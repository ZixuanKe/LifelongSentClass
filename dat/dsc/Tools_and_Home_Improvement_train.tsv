I hate it when my shirt collars , not otherwise secured in place by buttons , end up in weird places throughout the day . I purchased some steel collar stays to use with these magnets but they were only vaguely magnetic . I ended up using 2 of these magnets - one in the collar with the stay and the other inside my shirt , to lock my collar in place . They work flawlessly . They are the perfect size , and there are plenty of magnets in case you forget to remove them at the end of the day .	1
These little magnets are really powerful for there size . I am using them to make secret compartments in custom made boxes . Each one hols about .8 of a pound .	1
I wanted something this small to mount on the back of filagree wood piece I cut . They could then be mounted on refrigerators . Works well . Should be able to remove the pieces from the refrig without breaking yet will hold well .	1
I use these to magnetize my Warhammer 40K miniatures together allowing me to swap out their various parts and weapons . They provide excellent holding power along with small size to fit in snug areas .	1
They are soo freaking annoying ! ! Why ? ! You spend all this time , da*n near breaking off your fingernail trying to separate these li'l buggers , and when you do finally get them apart , you accidentally hold your hand in a certain way or angle and they snap right back together again with reckless abandon ! So yes , annoying , but that 's only because they are soo good at what they do . You too will be happily annoyed with your purchase . I 'd stick my reputation on that statement ... with these magnets !	1
am using for 40k models , they are a great size for adding jet packs , i use them for both orks and space marines , my stormboyz just use death company jet packs and my death company are also assault for codex marines or other codexes , have also use dhtem for eldar guardian weapons platform , will buy again when i run out they work for all kinds of customizations and these are small enough that it doens't break superglue over time ( 1/4 ' and above do ) also note glue on the magnets before you prime or they will also pull off you want superglue from plastic to magnet for best results then paint over it	1
The color pictures and exploded diagrams are an outstanding introduction and knowledge builder . Mr. Proulx full color pages helped me solve problems and understand better ways to use this great joinery technique .	1
These are projects that people can do with pretty basic wood tools , which is nice . If you have a tablesaw and router , you would be ahead of the game ... I found a lot of projects could be done much more quickly using different methods and tools , then prescribed , but I think the point of some of the ideas was to show how to do things with less ( in the way of tools , though it would take longer ) .The book has material lists , dimensions , etc . If you have a pocket hole love affair , this is a must buy . It even teaches you how to build a pocket hole drill setup ! How cool is that ? My favorite part of the book is the way it shows unusual joinery angles and suggests screw lengths for them . That is much better than trial and error ... Loads of pictures , and great writing . Very simple projects that look very difficult when finished . The books projects ' almost has a shaker feel to it , which I love . I am not huge on over the top ornate things ... This is all about straight lines , great joints , and useful items . All projects here utilize items you can get just about anywhere . Costs are minimal due to the way these items are put together.From my memory , I believe the book covers how to make : A couple clocks , accent table , end table , quilt rack ( very cool ) , mirror , and a frame ... I know there is more than that though ... .Most items are made from red oak in the book , but these items can be made from virtually whatever wood one desires . I highly recommend this book , regardless of skillset . For me , the materials lists and plans were enough to make it worth it . It does n't hurt that I love most of the designs too ...	1
If you have a pocket holl jig then this book is for you ! There are some nice projects in this book and they are simple enough even I could do them ! ! ! !	1
This has nice projects even someone just starting out will find they want to make . Simple instructions with enough drawings and measurements make it a must have for the new Kreg Jig owner . This will give you enough practice to make a few things and then move on to bigger and better projects with that ingenious jig .	1
Has some good information in it . The projects included in the book , are at a level , that just about anyone can do them .	1
This is a great system for drilling perfect pocket joints every time . Easy to use and a great way to make frames and cabinets . Makes for a strong joint .	1
If you 're new to pocket joinery , this is a great book for instruction and inspiration . Easily understandable , with lots of photos .	1
This book is not biased toward any particular brand of pocket hole jig and shows how to use a few of them , but most projects are built with the Kreg System.It has some handy tips for making mitered corners and how to best use the pocket hole jig for that application , and has several design plans . I do n't particularly like the style of the furniture but if you have your own style I 'm sure you can innovate beyond these plans . One picky point I have is that there is one dining room hutch/cabinet in this book that has and angled face and cabinets , but the book skips right over the steps required to cut the angle in the face frames after they are built so that they mate together at an angle and create the beveled face of the cabinet . One thing you have to be careful with when using pocket hole screws is that if you want to plane or trim an assembled face frame or panel , you do n't want to run a screw through your blades - they are hidden within and you have to remember where they are located before you start cutting . It appears that if you follow these plans exactly , the proper way to cut the face frame would be apparent , but it seemed like a critical step that at least requires more mention than simply skipping to the next step.If you have n't used pocket hole screws before , this is a great book for ideas and should get you started pretty quickly .	1
This is a great book for anyone interested in getting their feet wet with Pocket Joints . I bought a Kreg Master Kit and built the bookcase in this book as my first project . It came out beautiful without a hitch . Did my own variation for the trim but otherwise followed the plans exactly . I am planning on moving on to a chest of drawers as my next project and have no doubt that it can be done with the basic kit I have . There is one caveat , you will need some extra clamps to make working with the pocket joints a lot simpler . They are like having extra hands a crucial points in the assembly process . I read the material over and over so it is in my head when I go to work in the shop .	1
When I recently purchased the Kreg system , I was looking for a reference to get me started . I found this book fit the need admirably . While I am not as madly in love with pocket hole joinery as some , this book will give you a good jumping off place if you are a newcomer to it all .	1
Some useful projects to use with my new pocket hole tools . I look forward to using this book . Recommend buying it .	1
I bought this so I could make a few projects with my Kreg pocket jig . I never did , I had so many other things to do with my Kreg I never got to this book . But that does not mean I can not comment on its content . I have been wanted to make the clock for a long time , there are projects in here that a young person can manage . the instructions are straight forward and easy to follow , anything to do with the Kreg jig is easy . I will be using this soon , hopefully .	1
Awesome to light an entire room	1
Update : I purchased this light in January of 2012 and has been very pleased with it . After about 6 months I noticed that it has gotten very dim . It was getting dim gradually so I did not even notice until it felt like it was not helpful at all . After a quick battery change it is back to being nice and bright . The non-rechargeable batteries lasted 4 months of brief daily use ( 5-6 mins daily ) . Looking back I probably should have changed the batteries a month ago . I switched to rechargeable batteries , so I expect I would need to change them every few months.I have to admit that I use this Book Light in some unconventional places : my two main uses of the light are in the bathroom.I am attaching a collage of three photos under customer photos that demonstrates my two uses , along with the photo of the light next to the ruler . The very flexible 10 '' neck of the light provides the key to its many uses . And the two LED light is mighty bright . Given that I always place it several feet away from the book I always use it on full 2 LED power . The light switch is located on top of the light unit , it fits into the design so well that you may not even notice it right away.The clip opens wide and hold strong . I can open the clip 1 1/8 inches wide . Inside the clip there is soft spongy material which provides good grip and protection to the thing you are clipping the light to . The clip loaded with 3 ( AAA sized ) batteries is much heavier than the ultra light neck + light itself , so the unit can be used as a free standing light by using the clip as a stand.The only difficulty I had with the light was closing the battery compartment after inserting the batteries . It was a bit of a tight squeeze and required a bit of wiggling of the batteries to get them out of the way.The light can run on AC adapter but it is not included.My two main uses:1 ) I like reading while on the toilet , but do n't like the overhead light to be on because it has a built-in fan and I prefer quiet time . To solve this problem Xtraflex light mounts perfectly on the shelve near the toilet . It provides good light from a distance of 2.5 feet.2 ) Sometimes I like to take a soak in a tub and read a book or magazine in a bubble bath . It is such a treat ! But the lighting is poor as the overhead light is in center of the bathroom , not behind me . However I now mount Mighty Bright Xraflex Book Light on the shower caddy which is behind my head in the tub and this gives me good lighting from a distance of 3 feet.I am impressed with the versatility of Might Bright Xtraflex Book Light . This light lets me pamper myself in the bathroom by reading in the tub or on the toilet , I am really enjoying it.Update July 2012I purchased this light in April 2012 , and recently noticed that it has gotten very dim . It was getting dim gradually so I did not even notice until it felt like it was not helpful at all . After a quick battery change it is back to being nice and bright . The non-rechargeable batteries lasted 4 months of brief daily use . Looking back I probably should have changed the batteries a month ago . I switched to rechargeable batteries , so I expect I would need to change them on monthly basis.Ali Julia review	1
I have a Kindle and love it . I have n't found a need in my particular situation to have a reading light for the Kindle , so I have n't bought one . What I have found is as I am in my 60 's , my close focus of my eyeballs is n't what it used to be . When I get debris , eyelash or a cat hair in my eye , it is tough to see it to remove it . So , I bought a 10x magnifying mirror . It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye . But , there is n't enough light . ( Growing old is not perfect , but it is wonderful ! ) Anyway , I bought this light to put on my magnifying mirror so I can see to get things out of my eyes , or trim nose hair , or other such entertaining activities . Works perfectly for this purpose.But , I put it on my Kindle to see how it would work in its designed mission . Here 's what I find based on both applications : Base clip holds tightly and does n't slide off . AAA batteries are cheap and common . The light has two super bright LEDs . The switch is a push button , it will turn both on , the turn one off , then turn the other off . It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself ( 6-inch , keyboard Kindle model ) . More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard . There are no dark spots , bright from the middle to the edge . One light is plenty for my Kindle . Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare . The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it . It will hold in any position its put in . The batteries account for most of its weight . It 's well made , should last a long while . And one function - the clip serves as a base and will sit upright on a flat surface to serve as a small desk light . That has been a useful function.I wish I had gotten this long ago . I recommend it .	1
I bought this for my wife so she could read books in our poorly lit house . Works great , and still on the original battery after quite a bit of use .	1
Perfect light to read with or for the grill . Has two setting ( medium light and very bright ) and the name says it all ... might bright . Would buy again without hesitation .	1
I originally bought this for my wife so she could read in bed , but now she uses it with her laptop . It clips on very easily and provides a lot of light . It was a real lifesaver during the six days we were without power because of the hurricane .	1
There is n't a whole lot to say about a book light other than it works well and I like that it takes AAA batteries which are cheap and easy to find .	1
I bought this light for my wife not myself . She has a hard time sleeping when any lights are on ( all in her head I think but I ca n't convince her of that ) . I like to read in bed but I often come to bed later and this little light lets her sleep and lets me read.Brightness is good , I think they could use even a dimmer setting though . Clip holds to books just fine.Also , this light is good for the kids in the back of the vehicle at night when they want to read on long trips.Recommended .	1
Mine was shipped from China , took about 2 weeks I think , IIRC . Came with the required AAA batteries.I clip it to my headboard , about 1 inch thick , it holds on there well . Two light levels from the switch ( press once low , again high , again off ) . Flexi boom arm stays put once I put it where I want it.Solid purchase .	1
The lighting in my house seems terrible , at least for me . Additionally , at night , I was unable to use a lamp if my wife wanted to go to sleep and I wanted to continue reading . This little gem now allows me to have perfect lighting to read at night and not disturb my wife . I ended up purchasing a portable desk , also on Amazon , and this clips perfectly to the desk so I do n't even need to clip it to a book.There are two settings ... high with 2 LED 's on , and low with 1 LED on . I like using high when there is other light in the room , but inadequate light for reading . I like using low when the room is completely dark.I 've also attached the light to a & # 34 ; normal & # 34 ; desk to give me some well-needed light in my music studio.If you want , there is also an AC plug for an adapter ( not included ) if you did n't want to use the batteries.The gooseneck is very flexible , but sturdy at the same time after positioning it . Very happy with the purchase .	1
Very nice overall - two brightness settings and a good spread of light . Works very nicely on my Kindle . I wish the dim setting was a little more dim - I worry it is too bright and keeps my wife awake .	1
This little led lights are great , you can read while your spouse is sleeping without bothering her with your night table lamp . It has two leds , which makes quite bright , so I use only one at the time , which hope will extend its life . This one can be attached to the book 's body , or clamped to your bed , and the flexible neck will allow you to narrow the spotlight even more .	1
I keep it attached to my night stand when not in use . it clips easily to the top of a book or is strong and sturdy enough to be planted down and aimed in the direction you want light . It has 3 modes , high ( two LED 's ) , low ( 1 LED ) and off . the light is very direct and does n't bother my wife when sleeping sleeping . Plus , leaving it at the bedside , it doubles as a emergency light/bathroom guidance light if necessary .	1
One of the best things I have recently bought . Works great . I just use the batteries not the plug in ( kind of cumbersome )	1
We had a smaller clip-on light that worked fine for a book , but too small/weak for a headboard . This one is just as small but the clamp is wider and fits perfect on the headboard ! It is definitely bright enough on both settings and now my son can turn the light off himself at night ! Perfect !	1
I am very happy with this book light . It has two levels of brightness . The flex neck on it is superb . Some have said it is heavy , I would say bulky is a better term because of the batteries . It clips on paperback books without issue and stays put . I am glad I bought this light . I did so by reading the reviews from others here at Amazon ! .	1
Works great ! Perfect for reading with low light and/or in bed . Does n't bother my wife if she wants to sleep ( she has the same light herself on her side ) ordered from amazon , showed up on time just as expected . No regrets .	1
I ca n't stand clipping a light on the book , so I was looking for a light that would attach to the headboard . I wanted something that was bright enough to read clearly in the dark , but is still focused enough that it wo n't light up the whole room . This little light works perfectly for that.It has two brightness settings , and most of the time I only use the low setting as it provides enough reading light for me . The brighter setting is pretty darn bright , and is pretty impressive from such a small light . The light it emits is not really 100 % pure white light . It does have a very slight bluish/purpleish hue to it , but nowhere near the blueness of some of the cheap reading lights I 've used in the past.If you are considering clipping this on your headboard , make sure you measure the width of your headboard first . The clip on this light only opens about 1.5 inches wide , and my headboard is about 2 inches wide . To solve this , I simply screwed a small piece of 1/4 inch thick wood to the back side of the headboard so that it sticks up about 1 inch higher than the headboard on my side of the bed . I just clip the light to that . This does n't damage the finished side of the headboard , so if I ever stop using this light , I can just remove the little piece of wood.I 've used this light nightly for the last several months now and have not had to replace the batteries yet . Battery life appears pretty good . Overall , this is THE BEST reading light I 've found and if this one ever wears out I will be buying another just like it .	1
These bulbs are way cheaper than the big box stores and seem to work fine . It 's nice to have spares on hand .	1
I have n't been able to find these bulbs anymore so I thought I 'd have to throw out the lamp ( that I love ) but I came across these on Amazon and how great is that ? I received these in a very timely manner and they 're great at a fraction of the price I was paying . Two thumbs up from me .	1
This is by far the best price I could find on these . So far they have been in use for over a year and not a one has failed , so they are not inferior goods .	1
A very good value that allowed me to stock up on them . We use them in several of our work lights .	1
These are replacements for the kitchen undercabinet lines in my house . The color is better on these than on the previous bulbs , but had ordered these as replacements for missing and burnt out bulbs .	1
Good price and works well . I use it in my Kenmore stove top microwave . It 's been in there for months and I have n't had any problems with it . I would order this product from this vendor again .	1
These bulbs are a great price . They come well packed . Just remember never to touch a halogen bulb like this with bare hands . Use the plastic wrapper inside the box to handle them . Sold by : CBconcept	1
Exactly as advertised and MUCH cheaper than the $ 5 and $ 6 ( each ! ) that the big box stores charge . Just get it !	1
I was ready to kill my kids when the bulb burned out in my range hood . I had been on them for the life of the bulb about how expensive and hard to find these bulbs are . Often they cost $ 6 or more each . Now I have 10 of them and the light in my hood works again . Peace has been restored in my home as I now have 8 spares and the kids still cant turn off a switch . Why is it a kid can turn every light on , but is completely incapable of turning any light out ? Given the price of these I am tempted to find sockets to replace the florescent in my grow bed .	1
Now get this , at the world 's biggest retail store 1 halogen G4 is $ 5 ( with tax ) . I got 10 of them via Cbconcept for $ 5 ! They work great so far . My old expensive one lasted about 13 months . We shall see how this goes . So far so good , 30 days into it .	1
We needed one bulb for a Halloween decoration . This was a 10 pack for a great price and with amazon prime , you could n't beat the shipping . This worked really well and I suspect the bulbs will last longer than the Halloween decoration will .	1
Each bulb came in its own individual little box and wrapped in plastic . ( We ordered ours from CBconcept if it makes a difference ) The bulb fit our IKEA spotlight just as well as the original . I am not sure if it will last as long , but considering 10 of them , including shipping , costs just about the price of one in the hardware store , I do n't mind setting my expectations a little low .	1
They work fine and the price was great . I ca n't say anything about longevity of the bulbs . I 'll try to update the review if they do n't last .	1
These came fast , worked great and at good price . No complaints here , will use again in future . They were so cheap though , i bought enough to last me awhile and got free shipping . : )	1
Cheap and zero non-working bulbs so far . I use them for low-voltage landscape lighting and have not yet had an issue .	1
These lights are for our low voltage pathway lights . They work perfectly and add safety and security to our front walk . Well-priced , much better than retail stores .	1
I had a couple of lamps burn out over the winter months . Needed to get some spares and found this 10 pack for the Hampton bay lamps . Fit fine , worked fine , rapid delivery .	1
My husband researched everywhere for the best price and availability , and this place could not be beat.I could not recommend a better vendor or product if this is what you need for your landscape lighting needs	1
When I moved into my new house a few years ago , I installed a bunch of outdoor landscape lighting . I went a little nuts . Front yard , back yard , two porches , an atrium , all-in-all over 30 fixtures that use these little G4 base 10w and 20w 12V bulbs . I quickly discovered that these halogen bulbs are a lot less reliable than the 7w wedge base bulbs I had used before . What is more , at around $ 6.50 for a two pack at the local builder store , they are also a lot more expensive.I found these bulbs on Amazon a few months ago and have been using them ever since . While it 's true that you occasionally find a dud that goes dark in a matter of weeks , that 's every bit as true of the bulbs you buy at the store and pay over $ 3 a bulb for.These bulbs kinda saved me . I spent a lot on landscape lighting and was backed into a corner with bulb replacement costs . Finding these bulbs made it feasible to keep my lights . Five stars .	1
As others have said the price for these in the stores is ridiculous . If you can wait a couple days to get them this is the best value and the bulbs seem so far to be good quality .	1
I go through a lot of these bulbs with my kitchen lighting . They are used in the under-cabinet lights and the pendant above the counter . About a year ago I replaced half of them with LEDs . This increased the life of the regular bulbs considerably ( lower currents in the system means less wear and tear , so the speak ) . But they still burn out . These bulbs are a perfect replacement . They seem slightly less bright than say the GE brand that you get at the hardware store or the IKEA replacement bulbs , but the difference is barely noticeable . I give them a thumbs-up .	1
Good bulbs . Do the job .	1
10 pcs JC 12V G4 20W Halogen Light bulbs By CBconcept is great . Love it for the price . 10 of them can last long . hope last forever . LOL	1
These bulbs cost almost $ 5 each at my local big box home center so this ten pack is a great deal . So far the life from these bulbs seems to be about the same as the ones I used to buy at the store .	1
1/10th the big box store price and better packaging . Individual cardboard boxes with a plastic bag liner for easy , no-touch installation , unlike expensive name brand with armor plated packaging and clumsy extraction .	1
I have two desktop high intensity lamps - one I bought a few years ago , and one a recent purchase . The older lamp failed about 3 months ago , and I replaced it with the new one thinking the older one was finished . Then when the newer lamp blew a bulb I decided to get a set of these bulbs to see if it would work again . Replacing the blown bulb with a new one from this package took a minute or two ( being careful not to touch the bulb with my fingers ) , and the new lamp was back to working . So I decided to try one these bulbs in my old ( presumed dead ) desk lamp . After carefully installing the new bulb my old lamp was back to life . They are both still working , and I am delighted with this purchase .	1
The light went out on my goose neck halogen music stand clip-on light . Looked at local brick outlets and thought replacement bulbs seemed costly . Checked Amazon and found this pack for what was being asked for 1 bulb . Wanted a replacement and a spare . Got that pair and 4 more pairs in just a couple of days which was before my nest public performance . Put in the replacement and saw the light ! Placed extras in strategic locations for my next emergency blackout when I would have forgotten where I put my spare bulb.MORE than I Needed : BETTER than I expected	1
The cost for this pack of ten is about the same as for one at the local hardware store . They are wrapped and boxed indevidually so ther is no chance of contamination . Use gloves or paper towel to handle them.I replace 3 burned bulbs in Malibu lights . They appear to be nice and bright . save the rest as spares.very satisfied with the purchase .	1
We really like the light for reading in our bedroom . It gives off enough light for a comfortable light for reading a book .	1
Still looking for the 'dimmable ' option -- only found the on/off switch . But essentially the same light as the 'table ' model , very bright yet only 3W used . Has a clamp instead of a weighted base , capable of attaching to a table or headboard no larger than 1 and 1/4 in thick . Only assembly req 'd was plugging cord into plug . Same perfect black paint as table model , but can not change bulb -- permanent , so must toss entire unit if it ever burns out ! Advertised @ 20K hours ! We 'll see ... & # 128521 ;	1
My study room does n't get enough sunlight and I needed a desk light that can be clamped on to a shelf or hung on a nail . This clamp has both options . It 's not very big in size and like the other reviewers mentioned it does tend to drop a little . Does bother me since I leave it in one position and it stays that way .	1
I purchased this lamp from Ikea several months ago , and thought it had been long enough that I could fairly give this product the four stars I think it deserves.PROS- Simple , yet still has the elegant Ikea aesthetic- Not too bright- Adjustable to almost any angle/height- Base is wide and heavy , very stable- Perfectly focused light for a keyboardCONS- Some major quality control issues ( see negative reviews ) - Wall plug is too wide for my tastes , takes up two power strip sockets- Not dimmableAs mentioned , there are serious quality control issues . I 'm a bit of a tinkerer by nature - if something stops working I 'll have it apart in no time to see if I can fix it . That said , I understand not everyone is , and I can empathize with the negative reviews for this lamp . I do n't like the wall plug ( double wide ) but apart from the small issues this really is a fantastic lamp ! I have it peeking around the side of my iMac , spreading light over my full-size keyboard . For this application it is perfect , and for what it 's worth I have used this every day for several months with no issue whatsoever.OVERALLA very nice lamp that is highly-adjustable and gives just the right amount of light . Some QC issues , but overall easily recommended .	1
Earlier this year , I found an affordable LED reading lamp I liked at Target , but sadly , it stopped working this week . Hoping for an even better alternative , I checked again at Target , and also at Ikea . Target still offered a variation of the lamp I 'd bought before , but for triple the price of this similar LED lamp from Ikea.I particularly like the compact light housing on the Ikea lamp , and the heavy base that ensures the light stays where I aim it . My only complaint is that the power switch is in the power cord rather than a toggle switch on the base as it is on the Target lamps . The light output is also a bit less , but I consider that an advantage for reading in bed.My wife does n't like the look of the Ikea lamp , but I really do like it , so form your own opinion from the photos.Recommended .	1
This is a great shop light . I use is on my bench when I 'm working . For the price it is fantastic .	1
I 've had this saw for a few months now and by far , it is the best CS I have owned . I was n't sure how much I would use the Tilt-Lok handle however , I find myself adjusting it each time I make a significant change in the cutting depth . Having the ability to change the angle of the handle is nice , especially when making long rip cuts at a shallow depth.The saw has a tremendous amount of power and has so far , cut through everything I have thrown at it . 3/4 plywood is easily ripped cleanly and accurately . 2x lumber can be mitered as well . The supplied blade is n't bad either considering it is thrown in by the maunfacturer . Eventually , I will upgrade it to one of the better quality Freud blades.As with most Milwaukee tools , the warranty is stout . I think that any manufacturer who builds a quality tool should back it up and Milwaukee definetly does.Bottom line , this CS is in a class by itself and worth every penny .	1
I 've had this saw for a couple of years and it works great . I do the occasion remodeling project and this is the best circular saw I 've owned .	1
This is a great saw at a nice price . It has lots of power , is easy to adjust , and comes in a sturdy carry case .	1
I bought this saw at a Big Box . Paid more than the amazon.com price . I wo n't make that mistake again . However , even the price I paid was worthwile for this tool.The control handle is ergonomic and very comfortable . Trigger action is smooth and required less effort than other saws I have used . After taking it out of the box on a deck renovation , the first thing I noticed is the large-size and relative light weight of this saw . Upon reaching for the left-hand guide handle , I see that it is attached to the aluminum base of the tool , rather than the motor assembly . This is a detail unique to Milwaukee products and allows for more balanced handling of the tool . The left hand guides the base of the saw ... confidence inspiring.I fire it up . The eerily quiet motor ( by circular saw standards ) is refreshing . It is nice to end a day of sawing without a ringing in my ears . This saw is plenty powerful . I cut 2X treated lumber ( very wet ) with ease . The included blade is adequate . It made satisfactory cuts in rough lumber . I would recommend purchasing a dedicated finishing blade for finer applications.Well constructed and ergonomic , I am happy with this purchase and I highly recommend this model to contractors or anyone who expects to put in many hours with this saw .	1
I recently purchased this saw and am exremely impressed so far ! Cuts through all types of lumber with ease . Very smooth and surprisingly quiet . This is the finest circular saw available !	1
This saw is a dream to use . It cuts just as smoothy through thick hardwood as it will through a 1x1 . With power to spare , it lives up to the Milwaukee name . The tilt handle feature makes it so comfortable you can use the saw all day without fatigue . Each cut is almost effortless and without vibration . The 6390-21 is the king of 7 1/4 inch circular saws . You ca n't go wrong with this one !	1
This Milwaukee circular saw is among the best tools made . The motor is strong and cuts through the hardest woods with relative ease . It is well balanced and of moderate weight thanks to the alloy construction . Fit and finish is suberb , as is the case with most Milwaukee products . The case is sturdy and a plus if you move your saw frequently between jobs . The Milwaukee gets 5 stars and is a credit to their line of quality power tools . I 'd buy another one without a second thought .	1
I 've completed a bunch of projects using my new Milwaukee 6390-21 saw . I 've made shelving and cabinets using pine , cedar and oak . I 've cut 2 by 's for deck construction and ripped plywood for roof repair . This saw is terrific . It is powerful , solid without being excessively heavy , and very well balanced for a sidewinder . Calibration marks are clear and accurate for depth of cut and baseplate angle . Large adjustment lever and knob make these adjustments easy . I 've done a number of jobs requiring 45 degree bevel cuts . If you 've done this , you know how difficult it can be using a handheld curcular saw . Well , I 'm impressed with how accurate the gauge is and how easy it is to balance this saw to get perfect mitered corners . The most remarkable feature is the Tilt-Lok . I was n't sure how often I would use this when I first considered buying this model , but I find I use it often and really like it . It allows me to get just the right handle angle so that whether I 'm making cuts on the ground , or kneeling on a roof , cutting above my head or using saw horses , I can find an angle where the handle and trigger feel just right and I 'm in control . Even without electronic braking , the wind-down interval is very brief . The self storing wrench and spindle lock button eliminate a lot of fumbling during blade changes . A few points to consider : the blade that ships with this saw is for ripping , so plan on buying a couple more for cross cuts and fine finishing . Also , you 'll need a rip fence because Milwaukee does n't include this vital accessory : Milwaukee Rip Fence Kit , Model # 49-22-4146 . Finally , the base plate is aluminum to keep the weight down , but the aluminum galls on some surfaces and leaves marks , so plan on putting some tape on the bottom to protect fine work pieces . Every time I start a new job , I look forward to opening that big red box and taking out this really fine instrument .	1
I bought this for my mother , who is 5 ' tall and has small hands . I am also a small woman , though still a couple inches taller than my mom ... she 's shrinking ... hhehe ... anyway ... The same year she happened to buy me a porter cable circular saw.I have used this and I have used the Porter Cable circular . This saw is a very nice quality with some good features . However it is bulky and less easy to manipulate . Mostly it is bulky . Which would be good for big guys . If you 're smaller framed ... .or a small woman , this might be a little cumbersome . I enjoy using the Porter Cable circular saw much more , without any sacrifice of accuracy or power.This is a very good saw , but remember to play with your tools before you buy them . And think of the end user if it is a gift .	1
The Milwaukee 6390-21 was my first circular saw purchase . It is fairly lightweight , quiet for a circular saw , zipped right through a bunch of cedar planks and cedar 4x4s once I got the hang of it . ( Note that I used aFreud D0740X Diablo 7-1/4 40 Tooth ATB Finishing Saw Bladefor these cuts . ) I 'm not sure yet whether the adjustable handle is a must-have feature , but it is a nice option to have . And adjusting the cutting depth and angle is a cinch.After using this for a full day I think the electric brake and replaceable power cord on the Milwaukee 6394-21 would be a nice upgrade - but perhaps not worth the significant extra cost for my DIY use . My only other concern is the aluminum base plate , which flexes a bit under pressure . If Milwaukee had included a stiff magnesium base plate this would be a 5-star saw . As is , it is still a great bargain - the only other saw I considered ( a Makita with magnesium base plate ) was $ 35 more at the local big box store .	1
Growing up , I can recall my Dad using a circular saw for everything . After I purchased a home of my own , and being a bit of a DIY'r , I invested in a miter saw , table saw and Ryobi cordless circular saw , none of which I came to find were very good for cutting thick ( 4x4 ) or wet treated lumber , especially the Ryobi cordless saw which severly lacked power . I received a Milwaukee 6390-21 circular saw as a gift . I fell in love with it the first time I used it . While I consider it a 'beast ' due to its power and ability to slice through lumber like a hot knife through butter , I was surpised at how accurate and precise the cuts were . Being a right handed saw , I was concerned about visability , but it 's not an issue because you can clearly see the blade from both sides of the saw . The saw has a number of adjustments , all of which can be made quickly and easily , without tools . I agree with other reviewers that the included blade is n't of high quality , so you 'll most likely want to purchase a better one . The hard case is larger than it needs to be , and is impossible to close if the saw is n't properly seated . The case could also benefit from a place to store accessories , such as a rip guide ( not included with the saw ) . Overall , I 'm extremely pleased with this saw and highly recommend it . As a result , I 'm looking at other Milwaukee tools . In fact , I just purchased a Milwaukee 2457-21 power ratchet wrench kit which I am anxious to use .	1
This is one powerful saw ! I 've yet to slow it down , yet alone bog it down . It just eats wood . That aside , it has some super features . The tilt handle is great . It is not hard to adjust , and makes the saw much more pleasant to use . The sightline is excellent , and the saw tracks well . I also like the padded forward grip , and being able to see the bevel scale without turning the saw around . The base is flat and promises to stay that way , and the saw is light weight . I have had no problems with it whatever . In fact , I gave my backup yellow saw away - and it was a good saw too . This Milwaukee saw rocks ! It is professional through and through - definitely five star material .	1
I just started using this saw ( I purchased the lefthand 6391 ) to complement my lefthand Skil 5510 5-1/2 '' Circular Saw . My old ( 20 years ) 7-1/4 '' Skil saw was overdue for replacement . Even though I use my 5-1/2 for most of my cutting , I need a 7-1/4 now and then for heavier work like cutting 4x stock . Here are my impressions of the Milwaukee 6391.Good -1-Surprising light weight for a 7-1/4 . The magnesium\aluminum\plastic housing makes this unit the lightest 7.25s I have handled . And I checked all the major brands at home depot , hefting each in turn.2- First class construction . Every component of this machine is precision . The aircraft aluminum shoe is a marvel to behold . Much better then the stamped steel some others use . The depth of cut release mechanism is the best I have seen . Big grabbable handle that smoothly releases the shoe . Ditto on the bevel release , both easy on the fingers and they lock down with confidence . I really like the grab handle at the front of the saw . Its grippy-rubber covered and fits the hand perfectly . The magnesium housing around the top of the blade looks cool and give this saw an impressive look . The adjustable handle is a clear break-through in saw design . Its a brilliant innovation and I 'm surprised no other manufacturer thought of this before . It lets you set the angle your hand engages the tool with . So whether you are working material below your knees or even overhead , you have eight settings to chose from . I 'm still experimenting with the settings , but with this saw , you have a choice . I really like the rubberized handle too . No more slipping out of a sweaty palm.3- Power . I 'm working with salvaged fir timbers this month , all 4x and this old wood is hard and tough . The 6391 just powers through without slowing at all ! Even the full 4 '' x12 '' beams are no match for the powerful motor on the machine . I have to flip the timbers to cut all the way through them and the resulting cuts are square and smooth , and I 'm doing these free hand , without a 90 degree helper-square . The blade that came with the saw is good , a 16 point carbide tipped one . When it starts to dull I 'll switch over to a Freud TK203 7-1/4 '' 24-Tooth Thin Kerf.4- Case . The saw comes with a LARGE red carry case . It will hold extra extension cords and other pliable items if desired.Negative - Very little here.1- The depth of cut guage is set on the inside of the saw housing and its hard to see . The marking are in 1/4 '' increments , which is how much blade you want pertruding from below the work surface but the numbers are not easy to read . The Ryobi 7.25 had a very good depth guage setup , the best of all the ones I looked at at HD.2- No blade brake . Some of the high end saws have this feature , I 'm not sure why Milwaukee left this out . Maybe to save on weight . It would be a `` nice to have . `` 2a- An update on the blade brake feature . The `` right hand '' model , the 6394 , has the blade brake . I found this out from the Milwaukee web site . No plans to offer this feature in the `` lefty '' model though ( I wrote them ) . You do lose a 1/4 horse of power on the 6394 ; maybe thats the trade off . I 'd rather have the power to be honest.This is a great circular saw . If you use one of these tools on a regular basis , or if you are just a now-and-then user but like to have the best tools , get this one . You 'll be writing you own review here just out of your enthusiasm for what a great job Milwaukee has done on a classic design .	1
I had to rebuild my 15yr old deck this past summer . My craftsman CS just was n't cutting it ( pun ) . Said this will never do . Went to local big box and got this Milwaukee . I can tell you it 's one sweet saw . Powerful enough to cut thru 2x treated lumber with ease . Has n't bound up on me , although I guess if one cuts crooked enough any CS would bind , my craftsmans was always binding , motor running blade stopped stuf like that . These things do n't exist with this saw . I think the blade that comes with this saw is pretty good . I used it all thru my deck rebuild with no problems . As another has said , this saw is not very loud , it is a pleasure to use . This saw is n't the least expensive out there , but it 's well worth the money . I have n't read all the reviews but ca n't believe anyone who has used this saw would not like it . Highly recommend it .	1
While not a professional carpenter like many who 've already reviewed this excellent pice of equipment I 'd like to add my $ .02 worth to these reviews . A few months ago I was doing a complete remodel of the kitchen in our rental condo and for the first few weeks my old Skil saw ( at least 10 years old and possibly damaged when I used it , with the proper blade , as a concrete saw a couple of years back ) was doing just fine . However , when it came time to cut the laminated countertops to length it just was n't up to the task and it was obvious I 'd need a new one . Did a bunch of online research and narrowed my choices down to this Milwaukee model and one from Dewalt . Chose the Milwaukee mostly because of the Tilt-Lok handle and I could not be happier with my choice ! It cut through those countertops like the proverbial knife through hot butter and left edges as smooth and clean as if they 'd been cut on my Delta Unisaw table saw . This is one outstanding tool that I 'd recommend to anyone who 's looking for a really good circular saw that will get the job done and probably last them for many , many years and over many , many projects .	1
Another excellent tool from Milwaukee . The adjustable handle is a very nice touch . It is not too heavy , but is still very rugged . The base was dead flat . Switching blades is a snap.The best thing about it is that it just works like it is supposed to day in , and day out .	1
I 've had this saw about a month now and I am very impressed . This is one powerful , tough , saw . As a remodeling contractor I am very hard on tools and this saw can take the abuse . I have owned several other circular saws and this is easily my favorite . I also have the Porter Cable blade on left which I have used the last 3 years . I like the Porter Cable and I love the visibility of the blade on left , but it always feels out of balance in my hand since I am right-handed , and when setting up cuts you often find that the majority of the saw 's shoe and weight is being supported by the off cut side , because the blade on left is meant for left handers.The Milwaukee 6390 has solved this problem . It is extremely well balanced and the design of the blade opening in the shoe allows for excellent visibility of the cut line from above the saw . As a right hander you do not need to lean over the saw to see your cut line . Some guys are in such a habit of doing just that , and it is a hard habit to break . I have pointed out to them how you can easily see the cut line from above and they always comment on how great that is.The bevel adjustment handle is large and sturdy and easy to adjust . Bevel cuts on this saw are the best I have ever experienced . It will cut bevels up to 51 degrees or so like butter . No bogging or binding whatsoever.Two minor complaints that Milwaukee should address is that the shoe has a little bump on the edge at each corner , so that if you are using a straight edge like a speed square as a cutting guide , those little bumps will cause you to not get a perfectly square cut . To solve this I just filed them off . The other thing is that I did not like the thin kerf blade that came with the saw . I put on a heavy duty carbide framing blade and the saw cuts much smoother , and quieter . I get perfectly square cuts now , and this thing will go through a stud so smoothly it feels like 1 X .Despite its minor flaws the Milwaukee is still deserving of 5 stars especially when you start comparing other saws . The Porter Cable is a close second in my book , but the combination of balance , power , control , and adjustments of the Milwaukee make it my top choice . Highly recommend .	1
I have to stick my nose in here because something happened that never happened before . I am not using a skill 77 any more , or even the Porter Cable 743 . In fact I switched from a left bladed worm to a right blader just to get the toughness and power that this Milwaukee saw has . The first guy to review this saw ( conceptbydesign ) hit the nail on the head when he said this saw was tough . There are many well-designed features on this saw but the best thing is the power and toughness.Another great feature is the fact that if you set this saw to a shallow cutting depth , the handle stays where it belongs or where you want it to be - down near the work -- instead of getting way up in the air where it 's hard to control . Also , the blade guard handle is back off the shoe where it 's easy and safe to grab . Setting a bevel on this saw is a dream . The markings are clear and the lock comes easy to the hand . On some saws the shoe is thin and `` bendy '' or too narrow . This one is almost perfect.Now a circular saw is probably the second most personal tool a carpenter will own right after a hammer . I would n't be surprised if every saw here on Amazon got five stars , because everyone likes something a little different with their saws . You have to decide which features are right for you . There are almost more opinions about which saw is better than there are saws . That 's why I used a 77 for 30 years without changing . But the first time I pulled the trigger on this saw it was clear that the sheer power was going to make for accurate cuts and pleasant work . This is also one of the lightest saws there is - at least amongst the beefy framing saws . It was time for a change . No saw is perfect - here are the gigs : This saw is a bit noisy . It has a good blade guard but it still would be nice to have a blade brake . Maybe someday Milwaukee will read this and make one that has a left blade . That would make my day .	1
Everyone loves this saw , or so it seems from the reviews . I like this saw as well , I own it . I 've had it for over a year and a half and I 've cut everything from 1x4s to 6x6s , mostly for framing . I still think it lacks power compared to a worm drive , which is n't all that much more expensive . Here 's what I 'd like you to consider before buy a circular saw : try out a worm drive before buying anything . Brakes are a definate plus , for you do n't want to slow down when you 're on a roll and they make for a downright safer cut . Also consider the $ 60 Skil 13amp saw with a laser . Skil is a great name when it comes to circular saws , and what a great price . If you want to spend more look at the Skil worm drive saw . If you want to buy milwaukee , buy the version of this circular saw with a brake , you 'll thank yourself later .	1
I received this saw as a birthday present , allowing me to retire my old underpowered and inaccurate Black & Decker `` Sawforce '' saw . The Milwaukee arrived in perfect condition and purred like a kitten from the start . I have been very impressed with every aspect of this thing , most notably : The tool-less ability to change the base plate angle as needed ; The POWER . It cuts wet framing lumber and quarter sawn white oak with equal ease ; With all that power , I have not experienced any binding , stalling , kicking , burning etc ; The tilt lock handle is fantastic . I can not conceive of using a saw without it now that I have it ; The blade that came with the saw is quite good.Though the case is huge , it is sturdy and protects the saw very well.Overall I can not say enough good things about this saw . Its relatively light , very accurate , powerful , and feels like it will outlast me . Buy one yourself and you wo n't be sorry !	1
I bought this after my cheaper saw caught fire trying to cut a sidewalk with a mason blade . The Milwaukee never flinched . I have relied upon it for cutting wood , of course , but also occasional concrete and brick work . It had a ten foot fall one time with no damage other than bending the bottom plate , which straightened quite well . However , eye protection is a must . I know it should always be , but admit that you have cheated and used squint protection a few times . Not with this saw . I tried different blades , but there is something about this saw that kicks dust in my eyes . I was a little embarrassed when I was showing it off to my cheapo dad and all he commented on was the sawdust in his face . I rarely use the Tilt-Lok , but it came in handy a couple of times .	1
Stick a Frued blade on this sucker and game-over , pal . This is one powerful saw , and as accurate as my table saw . Buy this one with 100 % confidence , friends.Highly recommended .	1
I bought this saw to replace a 12 year-old Dewalt circular saw that still functioned but had significant signs of use . At first I did not like this saw because the handle and base are quite different than the Dewalt saws . However , after a few uses , I have to say that this is a better saw . It glides nicely for straight cuts . The levers to adjust the cut depth and bevel are large and easy to use . It is also surprisingly quiet and smooth in operation.I now use this saw for all my rough carpentry projects and I relegated my Dewalt to the less common task of cutting block/concrete with a diamond blade .	1
Generally , a good saw . Comfortable to pick up and get to work , but not the kind of tool to set down or store carelessly due to the aluminum shoe easily bending.Saw does get up to speed a bit slow , and it does throw sawdust around . It helps to practice a bit and to use the sharpest , finest blade you can for the work at hand . It 's tempting to let the motor do all the work , but stick with good sense and let the proper blade do the work.I generally enjoy the saw and have a great deal of confidence in it getting the work done . I would give it a higher review , but it 's not a tough tool , just a good one.If it lasts a few years , I 'll be happy at this price - although I would have paid extra for a detachable cord and a rip fence to be included in the giant red box ...	1
This has been a good router for me . It has good power , and the soft start works well . The controls are easy to use .	1
I 'm a multi router owner person . It seems that no matter what router I am using , they all accept the Porter Cable template guides . They work in the Dewalts , Makitas , or course the Porter Cables , as the description says , but they also work in the Fein Rt-1800 , and with the Bosch routers as well with the adapter.Template guides are useful when routing out a piece of work using a template as a guide . The appropriate size guide to accomodate the size router bit , simply attaches to your plastic or metal removable center base plate , using the template guide , and a threaded metal securing ring . The gap distance between the outer edge of the template guide , and the leading edge of your router bit , is the oversize dimension you have to make your template . The template guide prevents the edge of the router bit from touching your template . The protruding nipple-collar accomplishes that . To accomplished routists that earn a duh no kidding award , but to the new guys on the block , that is key to know , and opens up a new world , and a reason to buy the kit.The Porter Cable 42000 kit is made out of white metal . Their are some manufacturers that make them out of brass , but this kit is hard to beat . The price is right , and it does the job more than adequately . My one gripe is that they are hard to remove from the metal base plate in my Fein . No way to grip the spinninng bottom that sits perfectly flush with the plate . A huge rubber eraser might help . : - ) I plan on coating them with WD-40 so that ease of removal does n't become a problem . All in all a very nice set .	1
Still havent used them but they came immediately and will be handy later on . Hopefully I will make a great project from having them .	1
The guides were well made and fit my router perfectly . The only problem I had was that the case was busted when I received it . I would recommend this product . A good value for the price .	1
I 've used these before and they 're OK , but as others have said they 're NOT stainless steel . Brass runs along templates more smoothly and wo n't chew up your expensive bits so much if something should happen to come loose during operation . A nice brass set from Woodline ( Woodline USA WL-WTS 10-Piece Brass Router Template Guide Kit ) costs less and includes an adapter plate too , for using PC-sized guides in a large-based router such as the Makita 3612 .	1
Opens a whole new dimension in router use . It would be nice to have included a centering guide , but the price is fair . It is a sturdy functional guide set - fits the Bosch router too [ with adapter ] .	1
Bought this after this novice ate up a brass insert . I was impressed by the quality . Porter Cable has not ever let me down . So I buy more of their stuff ! I 'd buy this again !	1
For hardly a little more than the cheapie template guide sets you get a very nice one from Porter cable . The nice thing about it is if you have a Porter cable or Makita router you simply slip the guide into the existing hole in your baseplate and secure it with one of the provided nuts . Insert the right sized bit and you are now ready to go to work on whatever guide you need to follow . Much nicer than changing your base out with one of those universal kits , which use three screws to secure the guide to the base . If you need a template guide kit , you ca n't go wrong with this one .	1
The collet works great and does what its suppose to do , but I think if PC is going to charge me 300 dollars for a VS 3 1/4 HP router it should come with a 1/4 & # 34 ; collet .	1
so it holds the bit . My last collet got scratched or bent or something . It would n't grip correctly and the bit would work its way up and down while cutting . Aside from a bad cut it was dangerous . This one does what the other used to do . It holds the bit like it is supposed to . Plus I like the retaining ring to hold the nut to the collet . Makes it easier to change the collet size all at once , no finding parts and such .	1
I have a PC 7518 permanently mounted in my router table . I occasionally need to use one of my 1/4 inch shaft router bits . This collet is easy to install and releases the bit easily after use .	1
I was surprised when I got this that the collet nut was the same size as the 1/2 collet nut . One wrench does it all .	1
I bought a used commercial grade Porter Cable router ( the best router made , period ) but it cameloaded with a half inch collet for commercial router bits . This is for smaller bits and is a 1/4 bits.Porter Cable has been found to be the best router out there by numerous other magazine editors andtool pros , stick to factory original parts like this	1
I recently bought a PC7518 router and was also surprised that it did not come with a 1/4 '' collet . ( Turns out PC does not recommend using 1/4 '' shanks with the 7518 because of the high HP ... .so be careful . ) No problem I thought as I have a PC690L-RVS in the shop ( approx 8-10 yrs old ) . Well the collets were NOT interchangeable . The new 7518 1/2 '' collet would not fit on the 690 , and neither the 1/4 '' or 1/2 '' from the old 690 would fit on the 7518 . After reading the reviews here I took a chance that there was a thread change . I am happy to report that the new 1/4 '' collet fits perfect on the 7518 and I have routed several projects with my old 1/4 '' bits . Hope this review helps someone else out too.UPDATE : After several months of use , the collets are now fitting both routers . The threads must have needed to be broken in . I use the 1/4 '' bits often with no issues . But I do prefer 1/2 '' bits whenever possible .	1
Needed a replacement collet for a classic Porter-Cable router I bought off eBay . It 's an original , high-quality accessory that fits and works like the original . And it 's not like you have much choice in the matter ... .	1
The Porter Cable 1700 series comes with a 3/8 & # 34 ; collet . Go figure . That 's OK if your a production shop , but they should sell the darn thing with a 1/4 & # 34 ; collet because it costs a fortune and their customers probably have a lot of 1/4 & # 34 ; shank bits .	1
I was surprised 75182 router did n't come with a 1/4 inch collet . It is a big router but still . I 'm not buying all new 1/2 bits to replace the 1/4s . Serves it 's purpose .	1
Fits and works fine . I feel better having a 1/4 collet rather than an adaptor when my fingers are close to a high speed carbide bit .	1
Works great , if you need it , get it , no problems . Works in all of the Porter Cable Routers that I have . Zero complaints and I always find every little design flaw .	1
This collet was received in the original Porter Cable blister pack , and seems to be of the expected excellent quality .	1
Granted this thing is accurate and well made ( almost bomb proof ) but why so heavy and bulky.I dont think it 's necessary.I love porter cable products and have used them for years.My edge guide came as a freebie with a package deal I bought.I use it and have no complaints about it other than it being just too big and heavy.If and When I buy a new edge guide it will be the porter cable model # 5043 , it offers the same level of accuracy but without all the bulk . Now get out there and round something over .	1
I have used this guide a few times since its purchase and find it quite satisfactory for the times I need an edge guide . It is heavy , solid and stays in place . Not complicated to figure out . Overall , it is a good accessory to keep on hand .	1
This is edge guide is very accurate , it 's easy to mount and use.I originally bought the smaller cheaper guide . It was too small with only a narrow contact against the wood . It was n't very long so it was harder for me to feel it making contact with the wood . I ended up getting this at a later time when I large project came along.This guide is more substantial . It has larger contact surfaces , great adjustment and some weight which helps you maintain control of the router . I do n't feel that it 's awkward weight , just something substantial that helps control the tool.I actually ripped a long piece or material and screwed it along the edge to increase the stability . It has holes machined in its face which allow you to do just that if you think you need it . Most cases you probably wo n't . I just happened to need a longer fence.Another plus is that it will fit the new 890 series so I did n't have to get another fence when I added this router to my collection .	1
I can do just about everything with this jig . micro adjust is nice . More than I have needed from it with the circle cutting jig	1
This is a really accurate easy to use router guide . I wish I could figure out how to mount it to my skill saw for breaking down plywood.The guide is easy to use , pretty intuitive , and does a very good job of what it is supposed to do : guide the router.I 've used it with Porter-Cable 690 and 890 series routers and it is a cut above the old style with two rods . It also works with the plunge base of the Dewalt 611 trim router.The things I do n't like are probably minor to most people.First , if they drilled and tapped the open end , and put a plate there : You would have a storage place for all the extra bits they give you to adapt it to different routers . I bought this guide for use at work . I 've had the same guide for about five or six years now at home . The pin to make it work as a circle guide was lost about a month after I bought the one at home . One of the guys that works for me is a hobby machinist , so he is going to drill and tap the body , and make a plate for the end so we can store the extra parts in the guide.Secondly , the indicator sleeve could use hash marks at the 45-degree points , which would let you adjust to the nearest 128th of an inch , and interpolate to the 256th of an inch . Again the guy who works for me can make the change .	1
I 'm pretty new to using routers , and edge guides . I 've had some trouble learning how to setup the edge guide for accurate depths . However , that is part of my learning curve . The Edge guide was very easy to install on all the PC 693PK router bases I have . The micro adjuster also works well . I expect to become more proficient at using this edge guide soon , and I 'm sure I 'll be even more happy with it then .	1
It was a good value for the price and works well . It was a little heavier than what I expected . '	1
I must say this is by far the best router guide for this price range I have ever bought . It works great with my PC router as well as my Milwaukee 5615 router .	1
Quick and easy installation and application . Used this on my most recent project and it did a stellar job , highly recommended if you need an edge guide for your PC router .	1
Works great with my porter cable 690 . Use for fluting , or whatever you need a edge guide for . Recommend to anyone .	1
This is one solid guide , built solid of high grade material . I have only used this item a few times since my purchase but each time it has performed above expectations . The tool fit my Porter-Cable router as advertised . I used the tool to cut half circles with great success . I would recommend this tool .	1
Works as advertised , handy to use , not diffiuclt to set up and prepare , I like this edge guide a lot .	1
A must for free hand routing . you need to put on a edge on that wood part or work a standard measure in from the edge , this is the tool to use .	1
I PURCHASE THIS GUIDE ITS DEAD ON AND IT WORKS WELL I WOULD RECOMEND IT . ITS A MUST HAVE ITEM IF YOU HAVE PC ROUTER .	1
Affordable and very dependable kit for my router table . It was easy to use and operate for my routing needs . Customer service was great . The material it is made from is very strong and light .	1
I have not used the guide yet but the directions that came with it are very clear and the guide is very well made . I am looking forward to having a project that I can use it on .	1
I finally bought this for my PC routers , and it works well . The fine adjustment is great , and the unit adds control to the router . The Milwaukee 5615/16 routers have a base that accepts PC accessories , and this guide fits them also .	1
I really like this edge guide a lot . The only trouble is that the screws that mount it to the router do n't come with either the router or the guide , and it 's not a size that most people have in their shop . It seems to be a metric M5 . I had to go chasing around to find the right screws .	1
This should have been standard part for the router . easy install and works with a 2 1/2 round over bit.The bit can not employ the full bite . However this makes a 2 X 4 pressure treated stick into a very nice hand rail for the outdoor ramp . I rounder all eight sides and sanded smooth . I do not use the OEM base anymore .	1
Did n't take long after the purchase of my PC router that the base included would not do the job . Standard base would not accept a `` round over bit . I thought about enlarging the hole someway but thought it might leave some burrs that would mark my wood . New base was the only solution . The base plate accepts the larger router bits I sometimes use just fine . The added bonus to the base plate is its clear design . This is a good plus when using the router as you can precisely get the bit on the wood by eyesight.Clear router base plates should be standard on all routers produced IMHO .	1
As a novice at routing , I was puzzled for a while when I bought router bits that would not fit through the hole in the router base . Lo and behold , after reading an Amazon review I learned that you could buy an optional sub-base with a larger whole that would accommodate larger bits . I needed to round the edge of a 1 '' piece of oak , and the rounding bit has a `` shoulder '' that needed to be above the work surface . So the larger hole in the sub-base enabled me to raise the bit so that only the curved portion engaged the wood . Evidently the thinking behind the smaller hole is to make the router more stable for hand-held use , but I found it no problem to work with the larger hole . I totally agree with whoever said that this base should come standard with the router - with as much as router tables cost , you need this flexibility to maximize what you can do in the hand-held mode .	1
I needed a router sub base with a larger diameter hole for a couple bits that were too large for the standard sub base that came with my Porter Cable 690 router . This has a large enough hole to fit my Freud 45 degree chamfer bit and a large cove bit . The fact that I can see through the base is probably a bonus .	1
I wanted to improve my view of what I was trying to route , and this did the trick . They should sell all routers with these clear bases .	1
... be an accessory.I bought my first Porter-Cable router when my trusty 25+ y.o . Craftsman finally bit the dust . I figured routers were pretty simple devices and they are all generally the same ; the same bits that fit my Craftsman would fit the Porter-Cable . Wrong . I tried to use a 3/4 '' round-over bit . The bit would not fit the hole in the stock base plate . I ( and a lot of others ) could n't believe Porter-Cable would make their classic router without the capability to accept any non-pro grade bit . I had two different sized collets so why not two base plates ? This thing is clear , made in Mexico , fits the router perfectly and allows you to use a full range of bits . Yes , you can make one if you want or buy this one and wonder why it was n't included in the first place . For that I knocked off a star .	1
not a perfect fit - would be nice to get hardware with it - but for certain uses the see-through is wonderful !	1
I bought this sub-base after I purchased the PC router kit ... and could not fit a router bit through the standard base . I doubt I 'll ever go back to the standard base . The clear base gives you a much better view , and of course , allows the use of larger bits . Porter Cable should just include this base with the router .	1
With the clear base plate installed I can see my work with out having to put my face down on top of the work . It was easy to install , I do n't know why Porter-Cable does n't sell their routers with the clear base installed .	1
I was needing a larger diameter hole base for the router and this one is nice . It not only allows for larger diameter bits but also allows me to view the work area . This is great even for working on inlays and close area work .	1
Not much to say , well made for the most part , all metal where it should be . My PC690 fits well . The depth adjustment rod is a little sticky . I think it has some burrs on it . I will pull it off and clean it up for easier use . I should have bought this in a kit with fixed base and router together .	1
This plunge base is great for hand-held use . It plunges smoothly and locks positively without any change in depth when you release the locking lever . Its worst fault is the lock that retains the motor to the base . It 's a kind of wedge that is tightened with an Allen key . Its position means you can only turn the screw a half turn at a time with a standard Allen key . A long T-handle Allen key solves that problem , but not its other fault , difficulty removing the motor from the base . That same Allen key must be loosened several turns and then the block that acts as a wedge has to be loosened by tapping on it . It is n't that difficult but it just seems a less annoying method could have been designed to hold the motor in place .	1
this base is indespencible when making bowl projects and work where you it is hard to use a fixed base	1
My old Craftsman wore out after 20+ years so I asked for a new plunge router for my B-day since my old one was a standard type . I was a bit disappointed when I opened the box and saw that my new router was n't what I was hoping for . I bought this plunge base for it and it 's easy to use and works like a champ . Recommended .	1
To be honest , even though I have been an avid woodworking hobbyist for 40 years , I have never used a plunge router . Already having a pretty healthy herd of routers , the last thing I need was another router , so instead , I ordered this plunge router base . I am absolutely amazed at how it changes my previously fixed base routers . It is almost infinitely adjustable , very well manufactured and has completely revolutionized the inlay work I do . With the plunge base , it becomes a breeze to take progressively deeper passes , to a predetermined depth with each pass , simply by turning the depth turret.This is a surprisingly useful addition to my router arsenal . I love it .	1
My D-handle base came as part of a router package I bought from Amazon.com . I ca n't imagine not having the D-handle . The toggle switch on the PC 690 is not very conveniently located . The D-handle base has the trigger switch , which turns on and off without fumbling or taking your eyes off the work . In addition , I think it gives me a more stable grip than holding the two standard knobs on the sides . Forward-backward tilt is much more easily controlled with the D-handle.If you get the D-handle base as part of a package , it 's obviously cheaper , but if not , I 'd still recommend considering it .	1
The D handle base is the SAFEST and most convenient base for PC routers .	1
Replaced my standard router base with this D-handle for better control when routing dovetails using a dovetail jig . Just one thing to keep in mind is the cord on a standard base 690 is too long for use with this handle . There is no good way to manage the extra cord so I shortened my cord on the router and will use an extension cord if I need to use the fixed base again . It was easy to remove the cover on the router and shorten the cord or you could just cut the cord to length and add a new plug if you are nervous about getting inside the router .	1
Recently took advantage of a Porter Cable combo set -- buy their biscuit joiner and get their 1 3/4 HP classic router free . Good buy . Had one of these routers years ago , gave it to my son and have missed it ever since . Problem is it came with a standard two-handled base . Outfitted the router with this D-handle -- which offers great control . Only problem is the router has a long cord which has to be bundled up when using the D-handle to keep the cord out of the way . Pricey but worth it .	1
I needed better control for my router as I was working on creating dovetails on the jig . This D-Handle gave me better control and handling than the normal 2 nobs . It works well on other projects , so you are not limited . I 'd recommend it anyone it you want better control .	1
I have had the 690 Porter Cable router for years and finally committed that one to a table . This is the same motor ( without the speed control ) but with the `` D '' handle . Loads of power , really convienent to use . I find that I do n't use the speed control all that much . Woodcraft offered the Porter Cable 892 kit as a replacement for this one . The guy said that Porter Cable quit making these . But this one is half the price and actually meant to be used one handed . A fine tool . BTW they still make it .	1
I 've owned this product for about a year and it performs exactly as required . I use this for dovetailing and for edge routing . Very powerfull and very precise . You still need two wrenches to change the bit , but what 's new ? The D-Handle is comfortable and ergonomic . Since it plugs into the handle , you can unplug the motor once it 's stopped and it balances perfectly on its top.Single speed but so what , this has been in the P-C line for quite some time and still a fine tool .	1
This router is one of 4 that I own . It 's only 6 months old , but has quickly become my favorite . It has plenty of power for anything I 've asked of it though I use my 3.5 HP table router for big bits . I mostly use it with a dovetail jig . The tried and true twist-the-motor depth adjustment is quick and easy . It 's not too top-heavy and tippy like a plunge router . The D-Handle with trigger switch looks awkward , but works extremely well in practice . It 's not loaded with bells and whistles , but simply works well .	1
This router is great for a first or only router because of its versatility . You can buy a plunge base if you need it , but i dont really care for it too much but it is cheaper than a new diecent router.The dhandle is a great feature it gives you alot more contol than just the two knobs found on most routers.1 1/2 hp is pleanty of power for most applications.The collet i dont mind but use real wrenches , the ones in the kit are cheap and tend to cut your fingers especially if the bit is in there really tight.The 690 series is the most popular router , many other accesories are avalible , which make it even more versitle.If this is your 1st router of your 50th , you have to have one .	1
I 've owned this router for more than 10 years . It is dead reliable . I prefer the D-handle version as it affords better control . The 690 line is still THE standard reference for routers , though the design is aging . I would expect that anyone buying this router would be quite happy with it , but as more and more routers come available with variable speed , soft-start , better adjustment mechanisms , shaft locks , etc. , the decision is harder than it used to be . 10 years ago I would have given this router 5 stars . The quality has n't changed , but the market has . If a basic router fits your usage , however , you 've found the right one - and without maintenance worry on features you do n't need.4 stars for showing its age .	1
I purchased this router specifically to cut dovetails for dresser drawers and it works very well . The handle helps me stabilize the router and control the power instantly rather than having to reach for the power switch to turn it off . One caveat about using this product to cut dovetails in plywood veneer : Despite trying all of the fixes I found on-line for the tear out problem , I had very poor results . Using solid wood , however , resulted in dovetails that were tight and strong . This router does what it 's supposed to do and is a high quality product .	1
Am I impressed or what ? This is my first PorterCable product and based on its performance , this brand has won my loyalty . The first job for this tool was to cut up some 2X12 treated lumber from old bleachers into 8 & quot ; souvenir sized pieces . I made more than 100 cuts in 2 hours . Although some of the boards which were damp offered slight resistance , this saw sang right through that wood with little effort and noise . It was light and easy to manuver . It made clean , smooth , consistant cuts , and the motor was barely warm when I finished . The job would probably have been a bit much for my 10 amp , 15 year old Black and Decker saw . This PorterCable saw with 15 amps of power made doing this big job a real pleasure ! And its reasonably priced , too . Now , I have a quality framing tool . It 's a must have for anyone with big sawing jobs to do . Thank 's Amazon !	1
I replaced an old B & amp ; D saw with this PC447 . What a difference . This saw is trhe lgihtest most powerful 7.25 & quot ; saw you can buy . It 's built very well , and the fit/finish is excellent . The elctronic brake is worth it 's weight in gold . It 's so nice to have the blade stop in a second or two rather than waiting for the blade 10+ seconds to come to a stop like most other breakless saws . The dust port is exceptional . I purchased this saw beacuse I had quite a bit of pressure treated lumber to cut and wanted to make sure I collected all the dust without blowing it all over the lawn . Hooked up to my shopvac , I am able to collect almost all the dust produced . This saw is one of the best rated saws you can get and the break and dust port made it a & quot ; must have & quot ; for me .	1
I have owned this saw for several years , and really like it . It is very powerful and runs smooth . I like the feature that the saw blade has a brake , and just does n't just keep running .	1
When my 20 year old Sears saw died I decided to replace it with a first-rate saw . I wanted one that had a brake ( for safety ) , a solid baseplate that could be accurately slid along a cutting guide , and that did n't weigh a ton . This saw met all my expectations . It 's as powerful as any sidewinder on the market and weighs less than any other saw I know of .	1
This saw has alot of power . It is heavily constructed and comes with a dust chute that can be pointed in any direction ( see picture , it swivels around ) . Well balanced and the ergonomics are good . If you use a circular saw on a daily basis , this saw is right for you . If you are a hobbyist that uses a circular saw not so often , buy something less expensive and save the money for another tool.PROS** Power . ** Blade cut is clearly visible . ** Easy blade change . ** Good depth adjustment system.CONS** Poorly designed case . ** Moderately expensive .	1
This hose is reasonbly priced . It is sturdy and flexible . It fits all my porter cable power tool with dust port ( routers , sanders ) .Its length is conveniant and allow me to run the hose all the way to the ceiling and down to my workbench.My only complaint is that the hose requires an adapter to be able to fit on a standard shop vac port .	1
I have owned this hose for about six years now . It does an excellent job of catching dust from the 1-inch fitting on many of my Porter Cable tools . I had used a Porter Cable sander with one at a friends , and was so impressed with how much better it caught the dust than my sander , I bought a new Porter Cable sander , that came with the hose , and sold my old sander on ebay.I had a `` Mr. Nozzle '' hose on my shop vac when I bought my sander , and the Porter Cable hose hooked up to it with no problems . ( The `` Mr. Nozzle '' hose is a lot better than the standard hose that comes with the shop vacuums , and is well worth the money it costs . It flexes better , and is a lot more durable . ) I have since been influenced in my tool purchases by whether they have good dust capture capabilities , and as a consequence have several more sanders that hook up to the 1-inch hose , two Porter Cable Saws , a biscut joiner , and several routers I use it with.I am satisfied enough that I am ordering another today , because I forgot mine at my sister 's house and ca n't stand the dust that gets in the air with out it .	1
I have a Porter-Cable sander and biscuit joiner , and this hose works perfectly with both . I hook it up to the shop vac , and wow . At least 95 % less sawdust in the air than with the little bags . Highly recommended .	1
I 've had this PC vac hose for several years now and use it quite often along with a shop vac or Fein universal step adapter for dust collection with my RO and belt sanders . The hose is 10 ' long overall with a 1 & # 34 ; ID cuff on one end and a 1-1/2 & # 34 ; ID coupling on the other . It 's lightweight and very flexible so does n't interfere too much with using the tools . The 1 & # 34 ; cuff on the hose fits over the dust port my Dewalt 423 RO sander directly , but I need to use it with an adapter for my Makita 9220 belt sanders dust port . This hose also comes in handy for my Bosch planer and for the dust collector attachment for my Makita RF1101 router , but I generally do n't use it for that very often . This hose unavoidably gets dragged routinely across the concrete floor in my shop , but it has really held up well to the wear and abrasion . This PC hose has pretty much turned out to be a necessity for dust collection in my shop , so will definitely replace it with the same one when the time comes .	1
First , let me say I love this saw . Very strong for it 's size and cuts plywood with great ease and precision . Unlike another reviewer , I find the fence to be just fine.My two gripes are the small adjustment knobs on the fence and the power trigger . As a middle aged man with the beginning stages of arthritis , I find the knobs can be difficult to loosen , a little bigger or an oblong rubberized knob would be nice . My other issue is the lack of a thumb safety on the trigger . It 's easy to actuate the saw just by picking it up if you are n't paying attention . I get used to it myself but others who may be using the saw on a big project with me have commented on it . If you are a lone woodworker that becomes familiar with it , I imaging you might view the lack of a thumb safety as a good thing , one less annoyance . For me , the lack of one is not a good thing for the general population.I 'll also mention that the blade choices for these are a bit limited so make sure you look into that at the same time you look at this saw.For some of the negative reviewers here , perhaps you are expecting a lightweight trim saw to be as strong as a full size worm ? If so , you are using the wrong tool . This is a great saw for plywood and trim , with the right ( sharp ) blades . If you want a saw you can fling into the box , toss around the job site , and power through ply with a dull blade , look elsewhere .	1
PC bought the rights to this saw from Rockwell . I bought this ( Rockwell ) saw used four years ago and it is still going strong . There were a few flaws which they seemed to have fixed . The blade had cut a groove in the sole plate at the 45 degree angle and the power cord has pulled out a bit.But over all the saw is strong and easy to use . You can just tell it is a quality design.My major use is on plywood but anytime I need to cut overhead this is chosen over my Skil Saw ( 16 lbs ) . It is not a chore to get this saw out to cut plywood and I do n't have to lug a big saw around . A good blade and this saw has made my life a lot easier . A good tool.Jon	1
It 's really a pity that this saw is no longer made . I bought mine over 20 years ago , and since then it 's built cabinets in my house , remodeled a friend 's restaurant , and been loaned out many time . It 's light , powerful , and cuts very smoothly with no vibration . If you 're making cabinetry and not cutting 2x lumber you really do n't need a 7-1/2 & # 34 ; saw . This unit is smaller , lighter , and a real pleasure to use . I 'm hoping I can keep mine going for another decade or two .	1
I purcahsed this saw a few months back after salivating for it for a few years now . I could n't justify purchasing this saw when my table saw and circular saw more than do the job , but finally I got sick of using those bigger tools for small jobs and that 's I finally gave in to this purchase.Now this item is n't the cheapest option available out there but by far in my eyes it 's the best and worth every penny . Right out the box with the stock blade the saw does a good job on various thicknesses of wood . I have n't had the pleasure of using it on plexigass yet but I 'll get there . Overall though , I definitely recommend this saw but remember this is a trim saw . You have your regular circular saw and or table saw for the big jobs . This saw is more for the small little jobs or cutting trim , etc . Enjoy ! PS ... My only complaint is that this tool does not come with a case . In my eyes , every power tool should come with its own case .	1
After finally getting the saw . ( the first one came in broken durng shipping ) . It was put to the test and really has impressed me . It 's just what the doctor ordered for trim and getting those sheets of plywood down to a workable size . The saw is powerful yet small enough to not be a burden . I was having problems getting blades at the local stores but went back to amazon and there they are , as many as one would need . I must admit during this transaction , I was somewhat disappointed that the first one was delivered broken but Amazon came through and made the second shipment as painless a anyone could expect . The saw is a little pricey but worth it ... .. If it 's trim and plywood sheets you need to size this , is the tool to buy .	1
I bought mine used , but it looks new and it works flawlessly . It 's smaller size and less torque make it a joy to use . Do n't confuse smaller with flimsy . This is just as well made , accurate , and easy to use as the big ones . It just shouts top quality . Another thing is the blades . The thin size reduces chip out , and they are cheaper .	1
.One very usefull little trim saw ! Worm drive works very well and seems to handle anything lite . You can not cut a 2x4 with this so do n't buy it thinking you can.The only thing porter cable should have done with it is to have provided a box for it , It was designed way back in the 30 's or 40 's and to this date 2007 , they still do not have a box ? ? ? ... .A Shame ! The saw is much to easy to break or bend if not placed in some kind of case when transporting it . The size of this saw makes it very hard to find just the right size as well ... .But we have to give the tool itself 5 star because it works very very well ! A bit on the `` To high priced side '' with out a storage however !	1
I 've had a Porter-Cable 0314 4-1/2 '' Trim Saw since the 1980s - and it was such a good design , the current version is virtually identical . E.g. , mine has round knobs ; new knobs are triangular ! Being corded , it will also be just as good 20 years from now , given that I wo n't use often enough to wear it out . This is one tool to hand down to your children ... A battery powered trim saw might be a smart choice if you will use the tool often ; e.g. , weekly . Otherwise , this saw , over the long haul , will be MUCH less costly because it will never need battery , or tool , replacement . Every battery-operated tool manufacturer periodically changes/improves their battery design . Next generation batteries probably wo n't fit your [ old ] tool and/or will be a different voltage . So , when the batteries die , and they all will , you 'll have to replace the two batteries - and they are expensive . Or , `` your '' batteries will no be longer available , so you 'll have to buy a new saw.Another reviewer said his saw 's sole plate was `` out of parallel with the saw blade 3/64 '' over the length of the plate . Mine is also off , but only by 1/64 '' ; which has n't been an issue when using a straightedge to guide the saw . If it were , some judiciously placed thin washers in the adjusting mechanism would bring that to zero.Still another reviewer said his saw 's sole plate was `` flimsy and inaccurate '' . I do n't understand that comment , unless Porter Cable has used different plates . The sole plate on my saw is very stiff steel , 1/16 '' thick - rolled at the edges for strength , and is attached to the saw in four places - it does n't flex and works exactly as expected.This is a lightweight ; very portable and maneuverable saw ; having less torque & power than a full-sized circular saw . Those are distinct advantages in many situations , such as using it vertically or over your head , or when cutting trim-sized stock . On some jobs it 's just more practical to use a small saw . It 's also safer than a large saw because it 's lower torque means a reduced chance of the saw getting away from you.I 've been happiest with this saw since a carbide blade was installed some years ago . Although this is a terrific TRIM saw , I would n't recommend it for the ONLY circular saw in your toolbox . This is because maximum cutting depths are too shallow for 2x4s and other thicker stock , and because it cuts much slower ( on heavy stock ) than a bigger , more powerful , saw . It is a well-designed , professional grade tool .	1
I got this saw at the local home center . I ca n't believe how powerfull and effective it is for the price . I have used it to cut framing , pipes , exhaust parts , and other misc . household things and it never dissapoints . The quick release is a big plus , just be sure the blade is seated properly and fully before proceeding.I have used several professional models and this one seems as good as any of them .	1
talk about getting down to business . this saw chews up wood , nails , pipe , whatever gets in the way . it definately outcuts the milwaukee . i like the weight of this tool . it makes those overhead cuts alot easier . just rest the saw on top and let it chew its way through.i deducted a star for two reasons : 1 : there is more vibration than the milwaukee ( what else do you compare a saws all to ) ,2 : the quick change chuck is a little difficult at times . it likes to bind up and you will need a plier to twist it free . not a real tight bind , just too much for fingers.overall , if mine was lost , stolen , or broken , i would not hesitate to purchase the P-C again	1
This thing will rip through just about anything , as long as you use the correct blade for the job . Not a tool for doing neat and tidy work . This is for tearing ( hence the name ) . I recommend you stock an assortment of blade types and lengths for each situation that you may encounter . The longer the blade , the easier they bend . Use a blade only long enough to make the cut . Keep a firm grip on it and wear your safety goggles 'cause the sawdust really flies !	1
The absolute best . It has all the power that you could ask for , the blades are easy to change and it cuts through anything . Very difficult to complain about perfection .	1
Plenty of power . The blade change system is the best . A little weighty but overall not too bad . An excellent choice ! The 9737 is tough , versatile & powerful .	1
great value for the money	1
I have had mine ever since they first came out and have no complaints .I would like a leather sleeve for it as it takes a lot of abuse.I am still on the original brushes as well .	1
I 've owned two of these over the years . One was the older model and the one you see here . They are very durable . They will cut anything you want to cut with power to spare . The quick change blade clamp is very simple and very useful . The orbital action is great for speeding up any cutting job in anything except metal . Just watch for splinters . The variable speed makes it much easier to start a cut . The only complaint I have with the saw is that it vibrates a whole lot . My hands go numb after only a few minutes with this saw . If Porter cable would put a counter balance in like Milwaukee , this would be a 5 star saw .	1
I bought this belt sander to help strip the barn board floors in our 1870 farm house . The unit worked very well to strip 85 % the lacquer that would other wise instantly plug up may dewalt pad sander . I have used roughly 20 of the 40 grit belts so far and only had to adjust the tracking only three times during heavy use . As far as the bag unit provided I have not tried it as my wife had bought a small shop vac years ago that had the right size hose to attach to the exhaust port for instant dust removal . I did have the dust collection unit plug up once but I did use a large shop vac to blow air backwards through the sander and it cleaned out the plug instantly . Overall I 'm very pleased I bought this sander .	1
I 've used PC tools for years , and I would n't own another brand of belt sander or router . I 've used and abused them , to the point of smoke coming out of the motor a few times , and after they cool off they just keep on ticking.This belt sander has a lot of power , but it 's the ergonomics that make it my favorite -- it 's very comfortable to hold and , more importantly , to keep level when you really need to lean on it to remove some wood . The dust bag swivels a little too easily , but it 's not a show-stopper by any means .	1
I always wanted a belt sander but never had an actual need until I started a shop workbench consisting of a 2x4 laminated top . Once everything was glued and dried , I pulled her out of the box , attached the dust bag and adjusted the belt tracking on medium course sanding belt and let it rip on high speed . I was pleased at what quick work the sander made of smoothing the laminated top . Only light pressure was required for the sander to do its work . The sander fit comfortably in my hands with very little vibration . The dust bag was able to capture some of the dust being generated but just as much went airborne . I guess this is to be expected with any belt sander though . The variable speed came into play when I need to smooth some uneven edges on the cabinet carcass . By dialing the unit down to a medium-low setting I was able to control the amount of material being removed safely . Keep your eye on the electrical cord as I found out the hard way it can be grabbed by the belt and yanked up into the sander .	1
Hands down , this takes the cake . Variable speed makes it easy to control . Fabulous power . This is everything I hoped for and more . For the homeowner or professional who wants one belt sander , this is the way to go .	1
I do n't often use a belt sander , generally preferring a planer for heavy material removal , but I picked this one up anyway thinking it might come in handy for some renovation project . These are my admittedly novice impressions of this tool : - A bit difficult to control- Prone to unintentional `` sanding '' of objects ( e.g. , the power cord ) - Very , very loud ( a high pitched scream ) I do n't really understand the last one , as my stationary sander is a relatively quiet tool.Needless to say , I have ended up not using this tool as much as I had hoped , but if you have the right application for it , it 's probably worthwhile . I generally have the highest regard for PC tools , and this has done everything it claims , and is relatively easy to adjust and change belts.The most memorial moment I 've had with this tool was plugging it in once with the switch turned on . GO TOOL GO , TILL YOU RUN OUT OF CORD ! !	1
I 've owned/used several belt sanders over the last couple of years . This is one of the best . Powerful , somewhat heavy but well balanced . Because it is somewhat heavy and powerful , I save this for the tough wood , like oak or cocobolo . ( I have a Bosch with a sanding frame that is awesome for finish or delicate work . ) The motor does run hot , as another reviewer noted . The dust collection bag works darn well for what it is .	1
I bought this sander after having bad luck with the Dewalt 3x21 belt sander. -- -After many hours of using the PC352vs , I will have to say -- THIS IS A KEEPER ! .Very well made , powerful , sands smoothly with better balance than I expected . It is made and runs just as well as my 4x24 porter cable sander . I now have four Porter Cable sanders -- two orbitals and two belt sanders -- they all have been great performers . I highly recommend Porter Cable sanders !	1
When I purchase my sander , I debated between the 3 x 21 and the 4 x 24 . Looking back , I 'm glad I purchased the smaller of the two . For a much lower price , I got a belt sander that handles all of my rough sanding needs . The 7 amp motor is extreemly strong and handles quick material removal with ease . I like the swiveling dust bag and the cord on the top of the handle . This keeps the bag away from your hands and the cord up off of the work surface and away from the sanding belt . Overall , I got even more for my money that I originally thought .	1
This Porter Cable sander is a proven tool . I have used mine on many projects , and it has performed very well .	1
you could turn the thing upside down to make quick adjustments to small pieces of wood , it would be near perfect . It 's a great combination of size/wieght/price/performance , but it wont sit upside down without building a jig/stand to hold it.In most instances , this is not an issue . But when it is , it 's a fairly annoying design flaw .	1
nice and solid to keep it from wandering too much . feels like it should last a while . i use mine only occasionally so i ca n't speak to its longevity . variable speed is a nice feature . before this , i had only used my dad 's old black and decker ... .needless to say this one blows that one away !	1
I have only used this sander once since it came . It came on time and well packaged . WOW ! It makes short work of a heavy job . I have a wooden platform area in my house that has some water damage and I need to refinish it before I sell my house . It took me a long time ( over an hour ) and many sheets of sand paper to remove a little patch of damage with my finish sander . My finish sander finally died and I was reluctant to spend the money on a Porter Cable sander but I did the research and finally decided it would be very worthwhile . I could 've used this sander SO many times in the past and instead , I grueled over jobs with a finish sander that was not capable of doing what I wanted it to do . I am a female and I am the handy man in my house . I wanted a powerful belt sander that is competent enough to do the jobs I need it to do around my house . I love it , it appears to be VERY well made and it sounds SO good when it is running , like my circular saw . Changing the belt is super easy , just move the lever ( that 's made of metal btw , not plastic like other belt sanders ) and put on a new belt . Alignment is easy too , just turn the knob while it is running and it aligns perfectly . What people are saying about the variable speed dial is true , it is out of reach when in use but this does not bother me , I do n't think I 'll need to use it and if I do want to change the speed I 'll do it when it is n't running . I recommend this Porter Cable sander to professionals and to do it yourselfers .	1
After purchasing -- and returning -- the Makita 3X18 belt sander , I bought the Porter-Cable 352VS ( eee my review of the Makita ) . What a difference ! This sander is powerful . I sanded three layers of old paint off a door in about 1/2 hr . The body is constructed of metal , giving it a nice solid feel . When sanding , you can simply glide the sander back and forth , without having to push down at all . Porter-Cable came up with a design that gives you a lot of power , but at the same time control over that power . This is what a belt sander SHOULD be like.The position of the front handle makes sense -- it is up higher than the front of the machine , so you get a good position relative to the sanding surface . The handle is also designed to give you a lot to grab onto.The dust bag is designed well . You can swivel it in any direction to get it out of the way while you 're sanding , and it holds the dust without spilling until you 're ready to empty it out . Also , it does a fair job collecting the dust , but you should never expect any dust-bag system to be perfect.The meachinism for loading and unloading sander belts is very good . It is easy to place the belt in the sander and then tighten it up securely.The tracking system really holds the sander belt in place . I placed the belt on the sander , held it upside-down , running the sander until the belt no longer shifted left or right . Then I began sanding , and for the whole time I worked , the belt did not move from center at all . Because the housing is made of metal , even if the belt DID move , it would not damage the sander , as it would on machines with plastic bodies.All told , this sander is a great combination of power and ease of use.PS : The 3X21 sander belts that Porter-Cable makes ( the purple ones ) are excellent .	1
I bought this belt sander to replace the Porter-Cable 3 x 21 belt sander Mo . 337 I had bought used over ten years ago . They are the same except for the dust bag connection port , the way the belt is changed , and the variable speed feature . This new version does everything well for me and I really appreciate how easy it is to put on a new belt . On the Mo . 337 I sometimes knocked the floor plate loose because you had to push the sander down against the floor to release the pressure . The Mo . 352VS picks up about 80 % of the dust it generates depending a little on what grit you use . It 's pretty loud as one would expect but is very aggressive and operates flawlessly for hours continuously if you can take it . Except for when I need to level glued up slabs for shelving or cabinetry after biscuit joinery , this tool does it all . Since I 'm an all out person I rarely use the variable feature . For my large slab sanding I prefer my Porter-Cable 12 amp 4 x 24 belt sander which also eats wood but with a greater appetite .	1
Great sander , ample power , belt changes and tracking adjustments are a snap . However , one time during use , I inadvertently let the power cord get too close to the drive wheel . The tool sucked the cord up , wedging the cord between the sanding belt and the tool housing , and grinding the motor to a halt . The cord was easily repaired , but the drive belt ( which connects the motor to the drive wheel ) was shot and needed to be replaced . The moral of the story is to keep a close eye on the cord , and keep it away from the drive wheel at all times . Other than that , the tool has performed flawlessly .	1
Somewhere I read that Porter-Cable made the first 3X21 belt sander creating the portable belt sander market . This sander is proof that things get better over time.The power of this sander is perfect . I especially like the variable speed feature . This feature makes it possible to reduce the speed on soft woods to minimize the problem with removing too much material , yet have plenty of power to work quickly on hard woods . The balance of the machine is such that you realize you do n't have to hold this sander with a death grip , which reduces arm and shoulder fatigue . It glides over the work . The belt tracking is the best I 've ever seen . Put a new belt on , make a minor tracking adjustment with the side knob and forget about belt tracking . This PC sander is of the quality to make this reviewer wonder why I waited so long to get this sander , and convince me to make my next tool a Porter-Cable . I honestly ca n't imagine a 3X21 belt sander that performs better than this one .	1
I 'm pretty sure everything that should be said has been said about this belt sander . I worked with the PC & quot ; locomotive & quot ; belt sander for years and that is a fantastic tool for heavy duty , continuous surface sanding . However , if you are looking for & quot ; medium range & quot ; belt sander ( not too heavy , not too light ) and versatile ( can sand large surfaces , but is also capable of fine control for things like sanding the joints of frame and panel doors ) this is the sander for you . I find this model versatile enough for all purposes even to use one handed for scribing panels , trim and moulding on site . The DeWalt variable speed 3 x 21 is too heavy for one-handed use , and the super light plastic belt sanders made by DeWalt , Makita and Black & amp ; Decker are worth avoiding.Belt changes are simple , belt tracking is spot on , dust collection is quite good and the noise level is worthy of hearing protection during extended use . The dust bag and cord placement is fine once you get used to it , and as with any power tool do n't let your mind , power cord or fingers wander ( my sympathies to the poor guy who got his fingers sucked up inside ... that 's got ta hurt ! ) . The clogging of the dust intake ( not common with finer grits of sanding belts , but I 've had chunks of wood get sucked up in there too ) can be cleaned with a blast of compressed air from the outlet ( where the dust bag fits on ) back down . Although it would be good to have a vacuum hook-up to use instead of the dust bag , I 've always found that dragging the hose around while your sanding becomes more of a pain than it 's worth.Powerful , reliable and a joy to use . Highly recommended .	1
I have never had a sander like this before , but when I was refinishing a desk for a lady , I decided to get one . I compared several other units and decided on this one . I love the variable speed and with a course grit belt , it made light work of the 3 coats of paint I had to remove . it is very maneuverable and the dust catcher works great also . I used a light grit belt and some light hand sanding for the polyurethane finish and the lady 's words were : & # 34 ; you turned my old desk into a thing of beauty & # 34 ; .	1
This a fine quality machine . It really is very basic and quite simple in its design . Although not as refined as some sanders out there this unit does one thing well . SAND.The ability to adjust the speed is a must on any sander.This tool will easily withstand the daily rigors of loading and unloading your work truck.I do recommend upgrading the sanding shoe and I wish porter cable offered that as a standard.From the rugged american craftsmanship to its simplicity and fair price this tool is a big hit.Two thumbs up on this one.Now get out there and sand something .	1
This sander is very high quaility , and will last for years . It is very powerful , you can sand anything in about 1/2 time compared to a normal belt sander , because you can put so much pressure on it . It works great and the dust bag is great , it holds alot of dust and has yet to rip . The sander is also very stable , ive used it for hours with no fatigue . the speed is also very easy to adjust , just with a simple flick of your thumb . I highly reccomend this belt sander .	1
I used the same belt sander that I bought from a pawn shop for 20 years . I was sad when it finally died . Now I am happy . This sander is almost ideal . Some have complained about the dust collection . I find it works well if you empty the bag often .	1
I bought this sander to replace a 3 & # 34 ; x 18 & # 34 ; belt sander that went up in smoke after using it for more than 20 years . Compared to the 3 x 18 sander a 3 x 24 sander is more than twice as efficient . The dust collector works very well but only gets about 80 % of the dust . I use a 20 x 20 box fan with furnace filter over the suction side to collect the bulk of the airborne dust . I read a review about a 4 x 24 sander but opted of the 3 x 24 because of the lighter weight . I 'm glad I did because this unit is a comfortable weight . You do n't have to put pressure on the unit for it to work well . I 'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it for the average home workshop .	1
This sander literally is a horse ! ! ! ! ! Big , heavy , and powerful . So powerful I dial the variable speed back to control it . Very hard to control at the fastest speed.Dust collection is good but not superb like the makita 9910 3x18 I also own.Heavy weight increases stock removal . Works great for leveling tables .	1
I had bought the Porter Cable 4 & quot ; Whisper Series about a year ago . I previously used a 3x21 & quot ; Sears . Did the job , but this PC is in a whole different category . Some of the more important features : Positive tracking-when you set the belt adjusting knob , the belt stays adjusted . Some belt sanders creep on you , and require frequent resetting . Annoying to say the least . Also the belt change feature is nice . A simple lever you pull out , then push back in . Quiet-you do not have to wear ear protection to use this . Hearing protection is always a good idea though . It is heavy , but to me this is an advantage . You do n't have to push down on the unit , in order to get the job done . To those who mention that you have to keep an eye on the machine , because it can take away too much material too fast , that is because they are using a coarser grit than is required for the task . Finer grades give you more flexibility , and removal is more gradual and even . A belt sander is not designed to replace a finish sander.With the larger 4 & quot ; footprint , it is possible to remove a lot of material fast , without digging troughs in the work , which is possible with many belt sanders . Troughs-ridges show in the finished product . For fine finishes that are even and flat , a dedicated planer , then a finish sander , and finally a fine grade of hand sanding will give you the desired result.The Porter Cable 4 & quot ; is the best belt sander I have ever used . I would not hesitate to take on a floor refinishing task with this unit . If I was doing it for a living , I would of course persue a walk behind.This is a no nonsense sander . Heavy duty . Lay it on the board , and hold on . Makes short of a lot of work . Feels like it will last a lifetime . Definitely a leader in the pack , and worth the money .	1
I needed a sander that was capable of fixing uneven surfaces over a large , flat area , and I did n't have the budget for a drum sander or a wide-belt sander . I had heard horror stories about the difficulty involved in using a belt sander , too ... so I was a little apprehensive about buying one . The philosophy I followed was to buy the best one made , and from all I 'd read , that was the Porter Cable 362VS.There are two types of problems that one can encounter when using a new tool ... the first is a problem with the tool itself , the second is a problem that the tool creates ( e.g. , gouging the wood is a good example ) . With this tool , I 've never encountered either type of problem . The 362VS is a brute , however ... it 's heavy ( which is good ) , and it wants to `` walk '' across your wood ... so you spend a lot of time pulling it toward yourself . In a VERY short time , however , you 'll master the technique , and the results are spectacular.I made some checkerboards where the dark wood was 1/16 '' higher than the light wood . This would have meant a lot of sanding with the random orbit sander . It 's the kind of task you always see the drum sanders doing in their advertisements . The 362VS can take one of those boards down to dead flat in about 1 minute . It is amazing ... not just the speed of the task , but the quality of the product.Here 's an opinion and some advice ... If you 've wanted a belt sander for belt-sanding tasks , this is the one to get . If you 've been eyeing those drum sanders that cost more than twice what the 362VS costs , you might want to consider the 362VS as a great alternative that can do not only the same task as a drum sander , but is also much more versatile and consumes very little space in the ol ' shop.Do n't cut corners , however . Do n't read this review and then go out and buy a cheap belt sander ... get the one that can handle the job ... get the quiet one ... get the one with the best tracking ... get one with plenty of power ... get the 362VS ! 5 stars again for Porter Cable !	1
I have had alot of experience with the Porter Cable sanders . My previous job requiered laminating and the use of a good belt sander was a must . the only product we used were the Porter Cables . At that time they were still the same size and shape but lacked the power and the variable speed . a great addition to a nearly perfect sander . Since working at that job I have used many other brands of sanders and can easily say that if I had not started with the Porter Cable I would probably not have ever purchased one for my own use . The smaller brands 3 inch models lack the foot print to get a good surface area and tend to have a bad design with the motor . For starters . The motor should be centered so that the unit does not wable when used . The Porter cable is the only model I have found that does not have this problem . Secondly , it may appear nice to have a light tool , but in acutality the weight does two things . It keeps the unit flat and allows the sander to do the work for you . In other words , with the light units force must be applied to the sander to perform a even job . this is difficult if your product is very large . The Porter cable 's weight allows the sander to apply the pressure for you . The other great benefit of the Porter Cable is the belt guide . It keeps the belt true to the frame . a serious problem with many other sanders . I have had over three years experiance with this tool and will say that it is deffinately one of my favorite purchases . Spend the extra money and be satisfied with the results you can achieve with a good belt sander . ...	1
I 've had the opportunity to use many different belt sanders over the years . This one is hands down the best one you can buy . Superb engineering , and design , coupled with flawless manufacturing produces this gem . You simply ca n't go wrong with this sander . I especially like the variable speed feature . This thoughtful feature makes it possible to adjust your at load speeds which helps with softer material . An architect friend and I have used these sanders on many materials including wood . The 3X21 model is this boys little brother , which I found to be a benefit when I need to work upside down . If you 're looking for a belt sander , this one will keep you happy .	1
This moose is possibly the best tool on the market for large , flat surfaces . Use it for table tops and counter tops . It works especially well for flattening self-edges for plastic laminate work.At over fifteen pounds , it 's too heavy for delicate work or small projects , but get it on a large area and it floats effortlessly across the surface.The new whisper series feature is a treat and the dust bag works very well . All in all this tool gives the most bang for the buck in it 's class . But do yourself a favor-buy a couple of little sanders to keep big boy company .	1
Some may find this sander too heavy . It takes strong hands and arms to hold on to this sander when it is running at full speed . This powerhouse sander will do the heavy sanding you need to accomplish and in short order . I have used it to shape wood . I have used it to do flooring and decks . It is an excellent sander and will not waste sand paper . The belt tracks very well , all the time . It is of high quality and is American Made .	1
This is a beast of a sander but it is still very manageable . I am still amazed at how quiet it is ( you still need earplugs ) compared to some other belt sanders that I have used . The controls are very well thought out and easy to operate.This sander is POWERFUL ! Do n't accidentally set it down while is running or you might very well sand a hole through to China ! If you want to remove a lot of material , this machine is for you .	1
I recently purchased this tool to use in some detailed trimwork that I am installing in my house . I find the tool to be easy to use and quickly does the job for which it was made.I have seen some reviews that state that the adhesive backed sand paper does n't stick well to the profiles . When I first tried to apply sandpaper to a profile I learned that it would not stick . But then I realized that the rubber profile had a powder-like substance on them , a residue of the manufacturing process . I cleaned that off and there was no problem with it sticking . Just like any other adhesive-backed product , the surface must be clean before applying the adheasive-backed product . Sort of a `` duh '' moment . Not a problem with the sander 's profiles.I also have had no problem with the profiles staying in . Just make sure that they are fully seated in the holder clip that grips the profiles . Also , for additional sticking power on the adhesive-backed sandpaper , I recommend that you run the paper up the sides of the profile to almost the edge of the clip that holds the profile.All sandpaper clogs after some use . The smaller pieces will clog faster than the large pieces of sandpaper on , say a 6-inch random orbital sander . But I have had no problem with that . I understand how the use the tool and the sandpaper that is used with it.The first time I used it , I left a black mark on the wood . Another `` duh '' moment . I realized that I did n't cut the paper quite wide-enough to cover the entire contact surface of the profile . A new , properly cut piece applied and no more black streaks.I saw another comment about the profiles not matching every job . It would be IMPOSSIBLE to design profiles that *match* every profile of wood to be sanded . The trick is to practice and learn ( quickly ) how to use the existing profiles in ways that may not be immediately obvious . And one reminder that applies to ANY sander , do n't hold it in one place too long or you 'll remove more material than you wanted to remove.I am quite happy with my new profile sander and believe that I will use it many times in the future as I continue to improve the value of my home . I would have no problems recommending this tool to others .	1
A while back following a major wallet-emptying experience buying new windows for my house I decided to save money by recycling the 60 year old case molding . Having admired from afar the Porter Cable 9444 I finally felt justified in purchasing one . It was the right thing to do . This machine with it 's 1.8 amp motor has the power to remove material surprisingly fast in small places while giving you excellent control . Despite the seemingly small footprint of the sanding pad and the accessories , this machine cut far faster than I had hoped for . Over 640 ' of molding that had been badly re-painted several times came clean quickly . There was always a profile head that matched a particular nook or cranny . Originally , I had thought to use the 9444 only to do the grooves and tight places , but I found it fast enough to do the faces and edges of the molding as well - it was easier ( and safer for the molding ) than getting out the belt sander . When you use this machine your hand circles the entire motor . This is not a perfect feeling and I found myself having to stop at times to rest my hand . However there was far less vibration transferred to your hand that I expected . Porter Cable seems to think that you will never need a place to store extra sandpaper in the ubiquitous molded plastic case - there is a place for everything that comes with the purchase but nothing extra . When will toolmakers realize that they are missing a free marketing-moment by this sort of shortsighted design ? I consider these gripes somewhat minor compared to the overall excellence of the machine . If you only have occasional tight-place sanding to do , there is probably a less expensive rodent-like solution out there . But if you have a seriously large project to do or are in the trades you ca n't go wrong with this machine .	1
I make furiture and do some restoration work . This sander has been a time saver . I do not know how I would improve it . Others have told me this unit is hard to hold for extended periods , I have not found that to be the case . It cleans up very well . You will find it simple to change profiles and sand paper . Heat build up has not been a problem for me . This is a quality tool that has a fine fit and finish .	1
I have been building cabinets , rasied panels , bookcases , furniture , built-in shelves , wainscoting , and you name it for my home . I pride myself on accuracy and quality of workmanship like most people . It 's hard to imagine a `` power '' tool as being elegant , like say a Lie-Nielsen brass hand plane . But , this is one of those rare jewels.When I turned this sander on I was literally stunned at how smooth , quiet and effortless the sanding was . I just let it `` float '' along the wood using it 's own weight to do the work along with a fine sandpaper . This unit is perfectly balanced and produces truly flawless finishes.I have the Polished Aluminum Model called the 505H Heritage Model . I clean it up every time I 'm done , and I bought a special padded case for it to keep it pristine but useful.I can hardly believe I 'm writing so much about a sander but lets face it , when you 're all done building something , after the final sanding there is nothing like the tactile feel of silky smooth wood on a job well done . This tool will help you achieve that level.Hope that helps .	1
I 've been using this sander since 1976 . Back then , it was made by Rockwell . Porter Cable bought out their tool division several years ago . They know a timeless design when they see one and this sander needed no improvement . This is a heavy , heavy duty orbital sander . It uses its own weight to do the job . Using half sheets of sand paper , it cheaper to operate over the long run over having to buy round sheets that come 4 or 6 to a pack and can be pricey.Since I 've owned this unit , I 've only had to replace the power cord , thats it , and it was in a production shop environment for 3 years . I have used it in place of a belt sander at times , with an aggressive grit paper , its that good . Highly recommended for the serious wood worker .	1
This is the finest sander on the market.Virtually vibration free and no swirl marks . The PC 505 simply floats across the work surface . I actually look forward sanding my projects . I can use it for hours without the fatigue I experience with random orbit sanders and get a much better finish . As another reviewer noted it lacks dust collection . I 'm not to impressed with any of the dust collection systems I 've seen on other sanders anyway . Buy or build yourself a sanding table , and sand away . This is far and away the best power tool purchase I have ever made .	1
I used to work in a cabinet shop in the '70 's . That is , the 1970 's before Ipods and the internet . We used this exact same model then ! It worked very well and lasted forever ( at least until I left after 7 years ) .Now , 30 years later , my cheap B & D ; sander long ago gave up the ghost . My small Porter Cable orbital sander is beginning to fail . I Googled `` the best orbital sander '' and was totaly amazed this Porter-Cable 505 unit is still being made and is still the best . It if very easy to use , as it uses a 1/2 sheet of sand paper . The clips to hold the paper work easily and well . I just started using the new sander this last week . Brings back fond memories and it really removes the wood . I just ordered another 1/4 sheet orbital sander ( Porter-Cable ) for finish work , but this big unit works great for large surface areas and does NOT leave swirls.I must have gotten weaker and older over the years , because I did not remember how heavy this unit is . This unit is NOT for small , frail hands . It vibrates and it is heavy . But , when it is flat on a work surface , it does the job as intended . A great piece of equipment .	1
After about ten years of use I have nothing but praise for the 505 . Certainly does what it 's designed for and continues without fail . Honestly a tool that 's a pleasure for me to use in that it has a good feel and balance to itRecently replaced the cord and found the Delta/Porter Cable ( SeviceNet ) online parts system easy to navigate and with very reasonable prices for parts and shipping . I suppose the lack of dust collection can be a minus but for me personally I do n't use dust collection except for table saw , although I do wear a mask when sanding . Excellent tool with exceptional durability .	1
I 'll admit that this is the best 1/2 sheet sander on the market and has been for 30 plus years . Simple to use , vibration free , reliable as the day is long and a high quality finish are all part of what you are buying with this model.So why have I given it a 4 star rating ? Two words , dust collection ... or lack thereof . For as long as this model has been on the market PC have still not given any serious consideration to how to effectively collect the considerable amount of dust generated by this tool . There is a boot PC sells as an add-on that fits over the base . However , unless your only sanding flat surfaces AND are willing to drag a vacuum hose around you can rule this accessory out . Something , anything would help especially with so much dust control regulations being imposed by various government agencies , work place safety boards , fire marshals and insurance companies.Other than that a great tool that will basically last forever . Highly recommended .	1
Everything came in in great time and was packaged very well . The price on it was great also . Just as listed .	1
This Porter Cable Speed Bloc quarter sheet sander is a great product as all Porter Cable products . It is light weight .	1
I purchased one of these a couple of years ago to finish sand the maple cabinets I was making for my wife 's kitchen . They are pretty much one-of-a-kind in that the raised panels are made from Eastern Curly Maple and the stiles and rails are Birdseye Maple . The point is , of course , this is a super hard wood , that is difficult to work with , and takes a while to sand . This sander worked flawlessly , efficiently , and more importantly , comfortably through twenty-five of these doors . I think that is what really sets this little sander apart from all in its class . It is quiet , and its ergonomics make it a pleasure to use . It does use slightly more than one-quarter sheet of sandpaper , though , to cover its base and fit in the clamps . I readily recommend this sander for finish applications.Handy Dan	1
This is one of my all time favorite power tools . It 's easy to load and it 's super smooth to operate . I keep the clamp lever attached to the power cord using a zip tie to make sure it 's always handy . It also helps a lot to use it out doors if possible but if you are using it indoors try and have some air/filtration dust collection solution to protect your lungs and keep your home or workplace clean . There have been a few times when the counter-balance got stuck so it vibrated but if you power it off and tap it with your hand a few times the balance will free up and all will be vibration free again .	1
I own quite a few sanders , and in my opinion this is one of the best , although not _the best_.Other reviewers have done an excellent job on focusing on all the positives , so I wo n't waste time restating what they wrote.For the price there are a few things that could be improved on:1 . ) The old 330 has a metal housing , where as this one is plastic . Granted , on a cold day the plastic is probably more friendly , but I like the feel of the metal housing better.2 . ) The new 330 is n't made in the U.S.A. , where as the old one is . For the price , it should be made here.3 . ) The new 330 is rated at 14,000 RPM , where as the old one is 15,000 . This probably makes the brushes and bearings last longer , although the brushes do n't seem to be the same quality as on the older unit . Either way , the extra 1,000 RPM helped a lot when trying to avoid swirl marks with a course grit . The 340 is also 14,000 RPM , but 1/2 the price.4 . ) The new 330 is n't counter-balanced as well as the old , perhaps because of the lighter plastic case.5 . ) The 330 does n't have a dust collection system , unlike the 340 . Granted , if you buy a 330 you probably have a downdraft table and do n't want the drag of the vacuum hose to interfere with the feedback of the sander , but it would still be nice.6 . ) You pretty much need the tool to install the sandpaper . Everyone I know ( including me ) who has a 330 uses PSA paper because of this . Bosch has an ideal setup on their 1297DK , which is also a nice sander , but 12,000 RPM.With that said , this is still the best unit available for purchase that I 've found . The hand grip is very comfortable , it 's fairly quiet , and the vibration is low enough to not cause numbness after extended periods of sanding . Because of the price I 'm giving the new 330 4 stars , although I 'd have given it 5 if they kept everything the same from the old 330 .	1
What a great sander . We have been using these simple 330 Bloc sanders for years , we usually have three or four laying around the shop . They are easy use , do a great job preparing for furniture finishing ( leaving minimal sanding marks ) . They go through a lot of abuse with us over the years and they keep on taking it . I 've seen the price rise over the last few years , as well as the manufacturing move from the U.S. to Mexico , still a good sander .	1
The Speed-bloc is very well built and much quieter than ordinary palm sanders . It does an excellent job and due to it 's lower than normal vibration , does n't put your hand to sleep in the process . This machine is comfortable to grip and the on/off switch is conveniently located . Changing paper is quick and easy ( with or without the little tool they provide ) . The Speed-bloc is an excellent old design that Porter-Cable was smart enough to leave alone .	1
I used one of these in a cabinet shop when I was 18 , where I really gained a solid appreciation for quality power tools . I have had one since 1990 , and use is constantly . The only things that have had to be replaced are the pad , the power switch and the cord in all that time . The frame is metal and built for professional use . It is louder than the newer Porter Cable sander that I bought , but this one still works , the other one died after 2 years of daily use . The newer sander came with dust collection , which I thought I would like . However , the holes that have to be punched in the paper for the dust ports greatly shortens the life of the sand paper , and the plastic components just did n't hold up . To sum up , this sander is loud , dusty , and does exactly what it was made to do . I use one daily and would n't trade it for anything else .	1
This is a great little tool , much better than my PC 340k . Just alot more comfortable during long sanding sessions . Built like a tank , vibration free , and no swirl marks . It 's definetly worth the few extra dollars it costs over the competition . Other 1/4 sheet sanders just do n't compare . Pair this sander with the PC 505 1/2 sheet sander and your finish sanding needs are covered .	1
I bought this sander because of the excellent reviews and have not been disappointed . It is a very well made piece of equipment that makes sanding jobs a snap . I would like it if Porter-Cable made these in the USA instead of Mexico - I would even pay a bit more for it under those conditions .	1
Great vibrations . Fast removal of material . Easy to use sand paper sheets with . I love it ! ! ! Powerful ! ! ! Thanks Porter Cable .	1
Well , if you need the best finish sander in the business , then you are looking in the right direction . It has every quality you look for . easy of operation , quality of work . great for production shops or DIY . if you want to buy one sander that will last and last and last . this is the one . Longevity is the speed-bloc 's best feature . years and years of service .	1
I 've owned five power hand sanders ( two Craftsman , two PC , and a B & D ; ) and used many more . The Speed Bloc is hands down the quietest and best balanced sander I have used . You ca n't even believe how little noise and vibration this makes . If you use a sander extensively , this means a lot as it reduces your fatigue.As it is not a random orbit sander you will need to watch for swirl marks . I also own two random orbit sanders as there are many things they can not do well - like detail sanding and rounding of edges.Despite a few quirks , I very solidly give it FIVE stars.Some tips and cautions:1 ) If it is COLD ( below 35F ) it has problems starting up due to the rubber isolators being very stiff . If you have a garage shop as I do , you 'll have to keep it in the house until you use it.2 ) No dust extraction - use a downdraft table , mask , etc.3 ) If you are not using PSA or hook-loop , you probably will want to put 3-4 pieces of sandpaper in at a time so you do n't spend so much time swapping new paper in.4 ) The paper changing tool is something you do NOT want to misplace . Zip tie it to your power cord.5 ) The paper changing tool works better if you put it in a vise and bend the top inch about ~10 degrees.6 ) The sander is taller than most 1/4 sheet sanders - this can make it harder to get into corners or small spaces.7 ) `` Break '' your paper to improve it 's life ( run it across an edge to flex the grains ) This also makes it easier to fold and tear	1
I have a 15 year old model that uses sticky discs instead of hook & loop and no vac attachment . I have many hours on this sander and it has fallen off the work bench to the concrete floor and the ground many times ... nothing has ever broke ; This sander takes a licking and keeps on ticking . I had to replace the pad once . It has been extremely reliable and does a great job of swirl free sanding . It really slings out the dust , so a vac-setup on it would be great , which the new models come with . I highly recommend this sander !	1
It 's another of the collection of tools we use to make our renovation projects easier . Picked it because of our mostly good experience with Porter Cable . It does awesome work . And , the dust collection system , which is absolutely essential for our work , just about does away with dust completely . That 's a great plus for indoor projects such as refinishing wall paneling , hardwood , etc. , where you ca n't have dust going all over the house and you 'd really rather not have to tape up plastic everywhere.Unlike other writers , we 've found the dust collection system to be great when hooked to our portable vacuums . We also like the hook and loop and have had zero problems with it , despite this sander 's power . It 's a big improvement over our five inch sanders for larger projects . That one inch difference is unbelievable . We 're going to buy more of them .	1
Unlike some other users , I 've replaced my belt sander with this one.The good points of this sander have to do with it being very powerful and a random orbit sander . Powerful is good for smoothing large surfaces quickly . Quickly is good for me because I hate sanding so much ( I own at least seven electric sanders -- I must hate it ) . Random orbit is good , frankly , because you never get the surprises that an instant of inattention with a belt sander gets you ( I am in awe of those of you who get perfect results every time with a belt sander -- you are better than me ) . This machine is nearly as aggressive as my P-C belt sander , and much less likely to carve low spots or dig in an edge.The bad part is that it is much harder to handle than a smaller , less powerful random orbit sander . It took me a while to develop a smooth technique with it , and it still sometimes wants to & quot ; walk & quot ; off the work piece . I use it for preliminary sanding on flat surfaces before assembly . I think it would be a poor choice for sanding small parts of an assembled piece , and a disastrous choice for something with a lot of different surface levels close to each other ( a rolltop desk , small table , chair , etc . ) I use it where I used to use my belt sander , and finish sand by hand or with my small random orbit sander.By the way , it sands like mad . It 's fast . It 's aggressive . I love it.Recommended .	1
I use this sander primarily to strip paint of the bottom of my sailboat and it works great . Vacuum dust collection is required by the marina and this works fine as well . However , there will still be dust in the air and the combination of sander and vacuum is noisy so a good dust mask and ear plugs should be used . I have been using the sander for 3 years and it has not given me any problems . I use mostly 60 and 80 grit disks which make the tool moderately aggressive at removing paint , but not enough to mar the surface . I also keep the variable speed setting at the highest level , so I have not found this feature very useful . The only drawbacks are that it is a little heavy for overhead use and the cord/vacuum hose makes it a little cumbersome to maneuver . If you are going to own just one sander , then this is the one to get . It is more aggressive than the pad type sander so that it can be used for moderate paint removal , but can also be used for delicate finish work as well .	1
If this is what you need , then it 's exactly the thing for you . OEM replacement for a sander pad , so anyone that needs one should know exactly what they 're getting anyway .	1
Item was delivered in a very timely fashion . Exactly what I ordered , just wish I could find 5 hole sand paper locally	1
This worked just like the one that came on the sander . It was easy to install and I am very pleased with it .	1
This pad was purchased to replace the very old and worn pad for my PC 333 orbital sander . The old unit literally disintegrated when I was last using the device , so I ordered two replacements ( just in case ) . Product shipment , delivery , and packaging were all excellent , and the product -- a genuine Porter Cable part -- installed perfectly on the sander with absolutely no fuss.All in all , an excellent experience and great replacement part .	1
I bought this for a spare & have not used it yet . Will keep for future replacement when it is needed	1
THOUGHT I HAD TO TOSS OUT MY SANDER WHEN THE PAD FELL APART AFTER ABOUT 10 YEARS OF USE . HAPPY TO FIND THIS PART WHICH IS PERFECT . SANDER IS GOOD FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS . AT A GREAT PRICE ... ..	1
Factory pad for the Porter-Cable 333 sander is good quality and easy to replace.Reasonable price on Amazon .	1
My Porter-Cable gets a lot of use and the pad will eventually loose it 's & # 34 ; grip & # 34 ; . When using the sander one should not use excessive pressure as I think this is the reason the pads will fail after about a year of heavy use . Believe it or not , I get impatient and apply too much pressure which I believe develops excessive heat causing the velcro to fail . When this happens , the sand paper will only loosely attach only to fly off . Then it is time to put on a new one . For the price of a replacement , I 'll gladly fork over the dough to get away from the old stick backed sanding discs .	1
In reading others reviews , I made a slight modification to this pad . The original pad had a much stronger base to the pad . When installing this pad , I removed the foam from the original pad and sandwiched it between the new pad and sander . So far I have n't noticed any of the stripping or lose fitting complaints from other reviewers . It was certainly much cheaper than purchasing a new sander .	1
Like most reviewers , I had to replace my original pad after it started to fall apart . Thanks for the reviews that suggested to put a # 6 washer to make it last longer . The only reason it is not 5 stars is Porter-Cable should not require you to add a washer or a replacement item .	1
So easy to replace it take 3 or 4 tork screws and that 's it . You do n't realize how nice to have your tools 100 percent working till you fix them.Easy fit .	1
A new pad makes the sander hold sanding disks the same way it did when it was new .	1
In our shop the Porter Cable finish sander sees a lot of use . None the less I was surprised at how soon it wore out . Clearly the Hook and Loop pad is it 's weak link . I also feel that the price was too high .	1
Mine replacement was also thinner than the original . As per other reviews I used washers to make up for the thinner material . Once that was done the replacement worked great . Thanks to all who review their products and give us suggestions .	1
Been using them for years . They do get old if your a hobbyist user like myself and need replacement from time to time , but they do have a good shelf life and hold the finishing paper tightly to the surface . When they get old , removing the sanding disc will pull the hook and lop surface off the rubber pad . Then you know its replacement time .	1
It fits ; it works ; it was easy to install ; I expect it to last another decade , just like the original one did .	1
I bought this to replace a disposable item on the 5 inch sander . It is expected to eventually fail and it did . The replacement works well .	1
returns my sander to just like it was when it was new - no more sandpaper flying off due to worn velco	1
I was not aware I needed to keep one of these on hand until my sanding pad fell off during use after a few years of infrequent but heavy use . Good ol ' Amazon had this in stock and prime shipped to my door in two days , vs. having to look around town.Not sure what the folks who had trouble with sticking were talking about , perhaps they had the wrong disks . This is the same as the original , and my disks have to be forcefully peeled off.Wish they did n't fail in the first place , but since it does this is a great replacement . If you are in a professional environment , keep a replacement on hand as you ca n't predict when it will fail .	1
The pad is an easy replacement and works beautifully . What they do n't tell you is that it that the pad ALSO replaces the regular 333 sander . I could n't find any info on this so I just took a chance . The 333 and 333VS ARE interchangeable . I really like shopping Amazon . So here 's your plug . Lane Hall	1
Identical to original part . Use caution during removal offailed pad so that sanding dust does not enter the mounting holes making the attachment screws appear too long . Reports of & # 34 ; need shorter & # 34 ; screws read on a number of reviews !	1
I 'm not sure how to rate these pads . The sander works well , as do the pads WHEN NEW . But , they deteriorate fairly quickly and throw pieces of rubber about as they begin coming apart . Wear eye protection .	1
I was very happy that Amazon had this part available . My sander is quite oold , but this pad allowed me to continue using this fine sander . It is easy to install , and is just like the factory original . It sure beats throwing away a perfectly good sander just because the pad was defective .	1
These sanders are nice , light , powerful and last forever . Many idiots have my sander and it has taken a few falls , but still works with no unusual noises and i like the hook and loop , but if you dont you can simply un screw the pad and put on an adhesive backed pad . You dont realize how useful the varible speed is unless you sand in tight quarters or alot of refinshing . Also the hard dust cup is great better then the stupid bags or little dust boxes . I would by this over the bosch or makita any day	1
I have used my 2 333 's for over 2 years . I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable , which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers . The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place , ensuring that you do n't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice . I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own . None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors . On one of my machines , the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape . Aside from that , the unit collects and pushes dust away properly . I would still suggest using a mask , however .	1
This sander seems to work much , much better than the Dewalt . The dust collection seems to be better ( not as much dust flying around in the air while using it ) and it does not get as hot as the Dewalt . Also there are not any consumables on this sander that you 're going to have to buy . With the DeWalt , there is an O-ring that needs replacing every once in while for its dust collection . Better yet , the base takes either 5 or 8 hole sanding discs . Much better sander with regard to operation , dust collection , and cost .	1
If you 're looking for a good sander this is it . Porter Cable makes good equipment . This sander is easy to use and works very well . It 's built very well . Mine uses the hook and loop sanding pads which I personally like better than the adhesive stick on type . If you need a good dependable sander this one will do the job for you .	1
I have owned this sander for about a year and have been very pleased with it . It is a very comfortable tool to use , and with the hook and loop system makes it very easy to change the sand paper .	1
You can not go wrong with this sander for a finish that is perfect . Even someone with little skill will find this an esay use tool . I would recommend this tool as the only sander needed by most people . Weekender - this is your sander . Handy person this is your sander . Woodworker - try it you will love it . Very low price for a high quality power tool .	1
This is my pick for the best RO sander . It runs smoother than the others . It is not the fastest sander in the world but you can run it much longer without having a numb hand . The dust collection is great . The little canister is easy to dump and you 're back at it in no time . Variable speed is a must for fine work . You do n't always want full power . like when you just want to ease an edge on a nice piece of prize furniture . You can dial it down real low if you want to . This coupled to the pad control feature means no ruined work , ever . I use this sander far more than my Dewalt , Bosch and Makita RO sanders	1
Great for smaller jobs and occasional work `` in-place . '' Easy to use and no maintainance . But you will want to look at the very reasonably priced PorterCable belt sanders for larger jobs like doors , or large flat finished surfaces . But if you can only afford one tool to get started or are just getting started , this one is the one to start with .	1
I 've always admired the Porter Cable build and this is no exception . It is a great saw , but definitely invest in better blades . I could n't give it five stars because changing the blade is somewhat of a hassle . Installing the blade , no problem . Try to take the blade out , problem ! ! Also , Porter Cable needs to offer a better warranty . The fact that they only offer a 1 year warranty concerns me . To me , it means that they are not confident in their product . Milwaukee on the other hand , offers a LIFETIME warranty .	1
This is a very heavy duty saw . I bought it to help with installations in my kitchen cabinet business and it is an excellent tool . I saw on some reviews that there were problems changing the blades , it really is technique ; to remove the blade after you press the release lever you must twist the blade left and right and pull out of the socket , it is a tight fit in the slot and the lock exerts a lot of pressure so you have to twist it out . I have been using this saw for the last 6 years , I have no complaints and I am happy I have it . It cuts straight and square and the orbital feature works like a dream when you need to cut really thick pieces of lumber thanks to the 6 amp motor . It works great too when you have to cut delicate pieces as well . I will recommend it to anyone who wants a quality tool .	1
Typical Porter Cable high quality . Plenty of power , nice cut . The negatives ... The blower is a joke . PC missed the boat on that one . Blade changes are a royal pain . Getting them in is n't so bad , but try getting them out . { : - ( All in all , not a bad saw .	1
This is a very powerful jig saw . It cuts really good . I use it for most work as substitute for my circular saw . I found high quality Bosch T shank blades work great on this saw . The thing I hate is the clunky quick change system . But when I use the saw I forget about this problem . It does blow dust but I do n't care about it as long as the saw is great . That'swhy I am giving it only four stars .	1
I 've been using this router for trim carpentry for several months now , and it has worked really well on the job . Like other reviewers mentioned , the collet did tend to occasionally seize , but I fixed this problem by applying a little powdered graphite lubricant to the collet mechanism . Now it releases like a charm . Use of graphite seems like a minor maintenance issue given the performance of this router.I mainly use beading , round-over , and small straight cutting bits to modify oak , poplar , and MDF trim . The router 's small size makes it easy to modify trim in place when necessary and to work on small pieces . The base 's diameter provides a really good balance between stability and small size.Since I use this router for woodworking and it spins faster than conventional larger routers , I wanted to make sure that the bits that I use could safely withstand the higher rpms . I contacted Freud and they strictly advised me not to use their woodworking bits in it . A Milwaukee company representative also told me not to use their bits . People at the local Bosch service branch said that their bits would be safe to use . When I contacted the Whiteside Machine company , a plant manager took the time to correspond with me and make some bit selection suggestions . The Whiteside bits are not only safe at higher rpms , but Fine Woodworking magazine rated them as the best in a recent test and Norm Abram ( New Yankee Workshop ) recommends them too . So I 've been using Whiteside bits and have been impressed with their sturdy construction ( very substantially built ) and quality of cut.Of course , for moderate to serious stock removal , get out the larger router .	1
This is clearly a very well built router . The height adjustment is brilliant ! I have a rather noisy PC 690 router and was delighted to find that the PC 310P is much quieter . The starting & quot ; kick & quot ; referred to in another review is definately there but not nearly as much as I expected . For anyone considering a small router or laminate trimmer this is an excellent way to go !	1
I have the pleasure of having 3 of these routers . All made in the USA . I am a tool junkie to say the least . This is by far the best of the trim routers I have . It is a joy to use . I also have a Bosch Colt with variable speed that is nice . Also a Ryobi TR30U that is a great little router and a DeWalt trimmer . The P-C just feels better in my hand and is easier to adjust then the others . Sometimes the collet sticks but a small tap with the arbor wrench on the collet nut is all it takes . I myself love the 2 wrench set up instead of the single wrench on the Bosch and DeWalt trimmers . If P-C would put a variable speed or 2 speeds on this router it would be great ! Maybe even a self releasing collet to top it off . Oh and the P-C should be made in the USA for the money that they get for it . What a shame that its made in Mexico now .	1
Since Porter Cable has pushed its 7310 laminate trimmer as its primary trim router , the 310 has become less familiar with the general public but has remained the production stop standard for professional woodworkers . With its outstanding quality and precision construction , I imagine that the $ 159 310 is significantly more expensive to produce than the 7310 , and is thus not at a competetive price point with the $ 100 trimmers made by DeWalt , Bosch , and others . Those routers are OK , but they pale in comparison with the 310 . See my review of the 7310 for a critique of this second-rate machine.The 310 is a small little horse of a router . It has micro adjustment and is exceptionaly accurate . It has none of the numerous flaws that plague the 7310 and the other `` Rotozip '' style trimmers . Against the advice of my cabinetmaker colleagues , I originally purchased a 7310 as my sole laminate trimmer , thinking I 'd save a few bucks . I was so unimpressed with it and its inaccurate base and adjustment mechanism that I sidelined it for 1/8 '' roundover work and purchased a 310 instead . I now own three 310 's and have them set up for my commonly needed tasks . One cabinetmaker in my shop has a dozen 310 trimmers . Now that 's an enthusiastic fan ! As for the complaints by other reviewers about the collet not letting go of the bits , that 's a problem I have not yet encountered . Sometimes I have to tap the collet with the wrench and then the bit comes right out . Of the 20 or so guys in my shop that have this router , none have complained about bits that refuse to come free . Perhaps the other reviewers left the bit in for a very long time and the bit shanks rusted to the collet ? ? ? Not sure , but has n't been a problem for me.The only bummer about the 310 is that PC has discontinued production of the excellent optional bases for the machine . The offset and angle bases as well as the laminate slitter are the finest available . I say `` available '' because even though they are no longer sold complete by PC , you can buy the individual parts and assemble your own , though this is n't cheap . Used and new-old-stock bases are also available on Ebay and other sources , but their relatively high prices attest to the die-hard following this router has among professional woodworkers . Do n't let that put you off though , since most trim work is straight trimming and these bases are rarely needed . If you ever find that you really need , say , an offset base , go ahead and splurge on the parts and build your own.I just ca n't say enough about this router . You can spend $ 100 on a second-rate glorified `` Rotozip '' trimmer or spend $ 159 on this little gem and be set for years to come . Well worth every penny !	1
When reading Woodworking with a router , I noticed the author stated , that after getting a standard size router , your second router should be a laminate trim router . It is so versatile . Since it is smaller than most routers , it is more manageable . Shop made jigs using a router , are best done with one of these . Since it takes the standard 1/4 & quot ; bits , it makes it a convenient , multi use tool.If you do a lot of counter top , laminate work , their combo pack , with the different bases , is the top choice . Saves a lot of money over buying the individual bases.I looked at some overseas , and the Ryobi model , and decided to spring for the Porter Cable . The metal base , and fine adjust feature , and metal housing , set it apart . This is a professional level piece of equipment . Should give you many years of trouble free performance.When you are doing fine work , the lightness , and ease of visibility afforded by this router , is unmatched.If I had to be critical of it , I would say that when changing a bit , I remove the base , which is n't that hard , for easy access . The base is designed to come on and off real easy , since it is one part of a multi base system.All in all , definitely 5 stars . The more you use it , the more it will become your favorite one .	1
Got this to put 1/8 '' round overs on larger table tops . Works like a porter cable , great . It has plenty of power to run any smaller 1/4 '' shank bits . So easy to just grab this insead of setting up the regular top heavy routers . Best price here and free shipping ! !	1
I 've not owned another laminate trim router , but I have to say that this does a great job on laminate . I 've just completed a set of countertops and backsplashs and it does a fine job . I 've not seen the problems with height control that some mentioned but then again , I was n't doing anything especially tricky . It runs very smoothly , is easily handled in one hand and is relatively quiet.I would heartily recommend this for countertop makeup .	1
This , the standard to which others are compared , remains a premium contender even with variable , and LED-lit models coming out now . It 's small and powerful , with precisely ground guides for the vertical adjustment . One will note that even after Stanley bought Black and Decker , which had earlier bought Porter-Cable , this item remained in production , and will for many years to come .	1
There are a lot of tools I buy that are not Porter-Cable , but I have always been happy with their routers so all my routers are Porter-Cable . The trim router is definitely not a great choice for everything , but is great for smaller stuff as it can be handled with one hand and is quick to get the work done . The set-up is not as precise but is fast and easy to use , such as round overs on trim . If you need a bigger router for heavier and more precise work I use the 690LR and it is also a great router.Note : Be aware that this router only accepts 1/4 & # 34 ; collets so if you have 1/2 & # 34 ; bits for a larger router they will not work with this . I also bought & # 34 ; MLCS 6077 Woodworking 1/4-Inch shank Carbide-tipped Router Bit Set , 15-Piece & # 34 ; when I bought this even though I have close to 100 1/2 & # 34 ; collet bits .	1
I 've been using this little router for some 20 years now and it is my go-tool for any most of my routing tasks . I have half a dozen routers in the shop , including some very expensive and precision units , but this little guy is so handy that unless I need super stability or precision micro-adjustments , I grab this one . It has done miles of laminate and counter-edge trimming of oak and other hardwoods , and after probably hundreds of hours of use it is still running as new.Is it perfect ? No . The height adjustment is at best , primitive . I 've just learned how to set its depth-of-cut with minimum follow-up corrections . The nut that is supposed to secure the base to the body needs to be tightened with pliers , since hand tightening is just not enough to prevent it from loosening and then moving during a cut . My trimmer came with the full laminate-trimming kit in a nice steel carrying case , and back when laminate counter tops were still acceptable in kitchens , this kit was great.I routinely abuse this little machine by doing long 12 & # 8221 ; radius roundovers on long beams and such , and it has never overheated or shown any signs of stress . I like the fact that it has a shaft-lock so that only one wrench is required to change bits . The button is not very well placed , however , and I seem to hit it occasionally during use . No damage has resulted , but it makes a lot of noise and is no doubt not good for the tool . Also , the power switch is not placed well , as it is a two-handed operation to shut the machine off.Bottom line : After more than 20 years of use , I 'd replace this tool with another just like it .	1
I am a big fan of Porter Cable tools , I own many . This PC laminate trim router works fine , It does exactly what it 's supposed to do , cut laminate but I 'm not overly impressed with the motor . I have used several trim routers , this router has an odd vibration to it , tough to explain . I probably would n't purchase it again .	1
Received biscuits look good to me at a glance.As some other reviewers complained , there are some numbers of biscuits with defacts in size , shape , or thickness.However , the number of defacted biscuits are very little ( not 30 % from other 's review , I think less than 2 % in my case ) .Even though the number of defacted biscuits goes upto 20~30 % , I think the price is still very cheaper than buying the biscuits from local home centers .	1
I tried these in the oven at 350 for 12 minutes and they taste like wood and did n't rise ? just kidding : Pi have not used these but they are what they are , they are solid and good quality and hope to put them to good use soon .	1
This product has been a great product great price with great service to get them to us usually the next day .	1
I have too have purchased the 1000 biscuit assortment . For the money it 's a fairly good buy . Yes , I have encountered biscuits that are thicker due to moister absorption . Even keeping them in sealed plastic bags will only delay the swelling , and this is a limitation of the material . There is a solution , purchase a `` Biscuit Press '' . Tom Foster designed and sells a tool for this very purpose . It allows you to squeeze the thicker biscuits back to a thinner dimension before insertion , and they fit just fine . For more information see Link : [ ... ] After I started using the Biscuit press to compress biscuits to a consistent size just before use I have n't had any problems with too thick biscuits . If you use a lot of biscuits , this tool is a must . This step will eliminate the biggest limitation of this biscuit problems .	1
The assorted biscuits were exactly what I needed , packaged well and delivered promptly . Thank you ! bogie sends	1
I took a quick look at the biscuits to see if they were usable ( not chipped , broken , improperly pressed , etc . ) and saw the nearly all ( over 95 % in my estimation ) were ready for use.Buying in bulk means you do not get the nice plastic storage containers , but for the cost savings it is worth it . Besides , a clean , relabeled peanut butter container works just as well !	1
I looked at the 50 pack at the local home improvement store . For not too much more money I got a box of 1000 . These are the exact same quality you would get from the local stores , came in a Porter Cable box as well .	1
If you keep these in water and humidity proof ziplock bags , they are fine . About 95 % have no problem , but quality control is a bit lacking and some bad ones are inevitable at this price . All disks are made to absorb water and expand to form a very tight bond when coated with wood glue - that 's part of what makes them work . They come in non-resealable plastic bags and are fine when they arrive but if you use some and do n't put the remainder in something water tight , they will expand and become too big to fit . That 's not just these , but ALL wood disks . It would be great if they came in resealable containers , but they do n't , so have some gallon size ziplocks on hand when you open them and do n't get them wet . Great value .	1
before you judge the quality of these biscuts on my review , keep in mind that they are being kept in less then airtite conditions in a rather damp basement . Most of the pieces which i remove from the bag are , in general , perfectly normal , but there are a few which do take a bit of persuasive action with a rubber mallet to make fit . no huge problems , however . I would recommend .	1
I use these a lot in my woodworking and am very pleased with the quality and consistency of this brand . Even better , my wife got a look at these and they turn out to be perfect for many details on her crafts projects ( like leaves , flower petals , etc . )	1
These fit my new Harbor Freight joiner slots just fine . Maybe there are a few not perfect but I di n't find them . Seems PC has listned to the rumbles regarding the number of bad pieces . ( Or I got lucky ) . I am very happy with these . I do n't use that many but at this price they are cost effective . I will use the food save vacuum thingy to keep them fresh .	1
I have a Porter Cable biscuit jointer . I have used this product for several years and never had one problem . Oh sure you find the occasional one that is deformed or bad but not enough to worry about . You ca n't beat the price	1
I purchased these to keep on hand and the price for the kit vs the other brands 100/packs makes this a great deal . It 'll likely be a good while till I need to purchase more biscuits . Would gladly recommend them .	1
Saved a lot of money here over the local big box home improvement store and will buy this again when I run low on biscuits	1
Upon receiving my product I gave it a thorough inspection as always and and found no damaged biscuits in any way , nor did the box have any damage to it in any way `` Both shipping and product box '' .	1
They fit well , they arrived well packaged with no swelling , and at this price , they 're almost a steal	1
Well what is there to say , it has several sizes , they fit , they work , and its a better deal than those little bags in hardware stores , and yet not big , like the bulk boxes sold to contractors .	1
Biscuits work as they are intended . Appear to be accurately sized and are of consistent quality . Reasonable value for the money .	1
Just like most any other of Porter Cable 's products - these biscuits are a good products . I like the fact that these are only the 0 , 10 , and 20 sizes , since they are the sizes that I use most . I own a Makita plate joiner and so the & # 34 ; FF & # 34 ; sizes are not useful to me or most plate joiner owners other than those with Porter-Cable .	1
These are the smallest biscuits available and are of limited use , but the excel for those uses . They are narrow enough to use for joining face frames on cabinets , but I prefer to do that with a Kreg jig and no biscuits.I use these mainly for joining small picture frames and box corners . The only other method in these applications is a spline , which must be fitted with much more care and precision than a biscuit.These are quality products - I have not had one fail . They fit the slots cut with the special blade that comes with the Porter Cable 557 biscuit joiner kit . The fence on that tool makes it easy to do box corners . If you are doing alot of boxes and frames , I think you will like these biscuits .	1
There is not much to say about biscuits . The do work very well and I have gone through about 500 of them with no problems . They seem to be very uniformed and I have not had a joint go out on me yet . I have been building with biscuits for a few years and have always had good luck with Porter-Cable products .	1
If you 're using a porter-cable joiner - these things are super-solid and make and & # 34 ; excellent & # 34 ; joint - I do n't know how I ever lived without this joiner and these biscuits . Read up on them - go to woodworking blog sites where pro woodworkers discuss joiners . No doubt , you will come back to buy these . So save yourself the time and just buy them - more time to work on your projects and get away from this computer , eh ? I do n't work for them or anyone who sells them - I have nothing to gain or loose . Just passing on the truth to fellow wood-workers trying to cut through all the bull out there . Simply put , these are the industry standard for a reason .	1
Look good , feel good , what cn you say , tey are biscuits ! They are in a nice container to keep moisture out !	1
These FF size biscuits are great for face frames and so many other small jobs , I would definately recommend these and the small blade to anyone .	1
Why the big-box hardware stores that sell the Dewalt flashlights do n't keep these 18V bulbs in stock is a mystery . Luckily , Amazon came through once again and had a source for what turned out to be a hard-to-find item .	1
Please see my review on DeWalt DW 9043 bulb , as most of that applies here . Bulb worked great , but runs very hot . Lens very hot , after 2-3 seconds touch , reflector about the same . Metal hinge/holder too hot to touch . Some plastic smell in first 10 minute inspection . Checked again at 1 hour 5 minutes ( total test time ) and still the same . No scorched or melted plastic . A winner ... UPDATE April27/12 : Still working great with normal drops and bangs , lens heat not an issue ... UPDATE dec 31 , 2012 : Wow , this bulb is tough thru drops and bangs from daily use ; I wish I could find a girlfriend that was as bright and hot ( and lasted as long ) as this bulb .	1
A GREAT FEELING TO HAVE A SPARE BULB . I HAVE NOT USED IT , OR HAVE I TESTED TO SEE THAT IT WORKS . A VERY GOOD PRICE VALUE , ESPECIALLY WITH FREE SHIPPING .	1
A good bulb.I bought some because I lost my spare and I new Amazon carried them , so that was my first choice as it always is .	1
well what can i say other than they are replacement bulbs for my dewalt light and they should work okay	1
This was used in my Makita flashlight and works great . the fit was not a problem at all . it came well packaged and has so far outlasted the original unit .	1
Tried these bulbs in the corresponding gadgets . All were perfect and a great replacement for the old tired bulbs . Best to stock up and keep some spares	1
I bought this for my 18V B & D flashlight . It fits a little looser than the orginal and I was a little worried that it would n't work , but it works just fine . I have n't used it long enough to comment on bulb life .	1
I love my DeWalt flashlight and having multiple rechargeable batteries means I have a long life high power light to use for work or for emergencies . My light is many years old so I picked up another set of these bulbs to replace the bulb when it blew out . The original bulb lasted five years and I used it a lot . These bulbs are rugged and they operate on 18/28 and 36 VDC . They are rated to 325 lumens and they are Xenon bulbs.The picture shown on the Amazon page is not the correct bulb so I took a photo of one of my backup sets of bulbs and posted it . This is a good product and it is bright and rugged . I recommend them to you .	1
The Dewalt flashlight is a lifesaver but the bulbs are hard to find . Was glad to find them here and they worked perfect !	1
you NEED a spare ... ..	1
When I replaced the bulbs in the Dewalt 18v flexible neck light , I found that there is provision for storing a spare bulb . This 2 pack works well to provide a replacement and store the second bulb .	1
I recently purchased the bulbs and they work well in my Black & Decker flashlight . I was confused , at first , why the DeWalt bulbs came up in search for B & D bulbs , but by looking through reviews I found others had puchased for B & D as well . The bulbs fit my B & D perfectly and work fine with no issues to date .	1
For Makita owners , I can confirm that this bulb does work in the Makita 18V flashlight , and it seems just as bright as the original Makita bulb .	1
If you own a flashlight 10v - 12v this are the bulbs you want to buy for your flashlight . These are the best replacement bulbs .	1
What do you say it worked in mr Black and Deckrt light I should order an extra as it is hard to find .	1
I had both my 12v and 18v flashlight bulbs go out quickly on my M series Milw . flashlights . The reviews all stated that the replacement bulbs went out quickly as well . I just recieved these bulbs and tried them out ; the first 10 minutes on a freshly charged battery I smelled plastic , and after 1 hour and five minutes I found lens too hot to touch ( probably before that time as well ) . I only checked it twice as I was also watching a film . I found the reflector to be too hot to touch , and the little paper ring between bulb body and reflector came unglued . Bulb spring was hot but not too much . No scorched or melted plastic . Incidentally , the beam blinded me when I looked directly into it . I even banged the flashlight around a bit and did n't lose the bulb . This puppy is going back into the van and back to work . I may replace the paper ring with a couple of neophrene washers to isolate the bulb/reflector , and I will also definately drill a couple of holes in the botton body to facilitate convection out of the side vent holes , cooling the back of the reflector . As I am a plumber , I 'll not drill holes in the top for water to get in , of course . This test was with flashlight sitting vertically on bottom of battery with lens set to shine horizantally/90 degrees ; usual working position for me.April ... I 'm back with great news . These bulbs work just great , with much use , no heat problems , etc . I dropped my flashlight 5ft from a ladder and it landed on its side ; It landed hard on concrete and I was concerned I had cracked the battery casing . No cracks , Bulb worked fine and still does .	1
When I bought the light many years ago It worked great and was plenty bright . I took to strapping it onto the handlebars of my bicycle ( with a pad to prevent damage ) for commuting home at night from work . I really like the quick forty five minute recharge cycle and I have two batteries so is easy to change out.No other bike light I have found at any price comes close to that quick charge and simplicity . Anyway . . . the bulbs eventually went after LOTS of use and I went looking for new ones . At my local tool supply I found them and headed for the counter . NINE DOLLARS ! ! ! ! ( for two bulbs ; now ten plus ) .That 's stupid I exclaimed ! For twelve volt flash light bulbs . I can get the same thing at the local mom and pop hardware store for less than a dollar each ; dollar sixty nine tops . Five dollars each from Dewalt what a mark up ! Thievery ! etc. , etc. , etc. , etc. , OK I am singing a different tune now . I just `` invested '' in two genuine Dewalts after several years of using the hardware store ones . Partly because the cheep ones are getting hard to find and because I remembered the light being plenty bright back when new and has n't seemed that way for a while now . Even allowing for the darkening that happens to the glass on the bulb over timeI put in the new bulb and ran it for a charge worth . Quite a difference . The light out put is whiter than the basic cheep bulbs , the spot on the road is larger for the same pitch , it actually seemed to get brighter on the second use even though the battery was lower annnnnnd it ran longer than with the cheep bulbs for the same charge . I can say that because the run time is within a minute or less for each commute period . I guess I am back with Dewalt bulbs for the difference they make .	1
I bought these for my Milwaukee M12 ( 12-volt ) products since Milwaukee , unbelievably , does not make 12V bulbs and puts 14.4V bulbs in their lights which appear dim and yellow.I take away a star for either Amazon 's poor packaging or DeWalt 's poor protection because , in my first shipment , one bulb was exploded with glass dust all inside the package.This is an `` XPR '' = xenon PR bulb rated at 0.7A . I noted that one bulb had the filament centered , while the other was off-centered and did not give as uniform of a pattern as a result ( contributes for taking away a star ) .	1
I have a portable battery car jumper pack that has a light on it . That bulb burned out and these 12 volt lights work perfectly for a replacement .	1
I used these in my Ridgid flashlight since I can not find any locally . They fit perfect and are very bright . Hopefully they last as long as people say they do .	1
I 've used a number of these lights in the past and they all broke after dropping a couple times . Which in theory , would be my fault , but with Dewalt , and this being a work light , it should n't . Either way , I bought one of Dewalts `` snaking '' lights and have dropped it NUMEROUS times without so much as a hiccup ! Either way , it 's a really good light that lasts a LONG time on a single 18V charged battery !	1
I already had the batteries so i just needed the light , but wow what a nice flash light . for the money you cant go wrong .	1
Purchased this light as an extra to work where there was dim lighting . Used this item several times since purchased ,	1
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MANY FLASH LIGHTS . THE 18V BATTERIES LAST A LONG TIME AND THE LIGHT IS EASY TO DIRECT WHERE YOU NEED IT .	1
I have used this many times and would n't give it up ! Very bright , provided you have enough batteries you will ALWAYS have light . Nothing is more frustrating than a low and/or dead batteries . It is a light weight plastic so not sure on the durability but it works as intended ! !	1
When I started buying DeWalt tools I got the batteries and chargers but then started buying & # 34 ; bare bones & # 34 ; items . After all , after you have a few batteries you do n't need more . This lowers the cost of additional tools while ensuring batteries do n't languish and die from lack of use.I really like the variety and quality of the tools and the economical way I can add what I need without accumulating what I don't.The light works really well with the swivel head feature allowing it to shine where I need it . I also have the light with the flexible head but it 's too big and bulky for some applications . This makes a perfect addition to my toolkit.Ordering was easy and the Amazon Prime got it here pronto without paying expedited shipping .	1
I own a lot of dewalt tools , like almost everything . I used the snake lite for years , went through 2 of them still have two to this day but then i decided to try the pivoting head one and i love it . It 's a little easier to handle for service calls . More compact . Just an all around good flash light , Thanks	1
Power outages are not uncommon in this area and we needed a reliable source of light other than candles or standard rechargeable flashlights . This light fits the bill . It is nice and bright and the swivel head is very convenient . It is also very useful for working in crawl spaces instead of dragging in one of the shop lights with the long cord and light bulb . This light does not come with a battery pack but if you have any other Dewalt tools powered by 18v NiCa battery , they are all interchangeable . I had batteries from an old drill and they work perfectly .	1
Great addition to an 18 volt Dewalt drill set . The head rotates to vertical .	1
The photos are not current . This tool does come with the new square nano foot shaped to fit the LI batteries without overhang . Still accepts the NiCd batteries too and is slightly more stable on them due to extra size and weight of NiCd batteries . Has storage for extra bulb , but does not come with extra bulb .	1
Used this for a week along with theDEWALT Fluorescent Area Lightfor lighting in the evenings at my cabin . ( I can charge batteries at a neighbor 's . ) It performed well : bright and easily carried with the battery attached . Seems stable on the battery , does n't knock over easily . I did n't have much cause to use the pivoting head but I can imagine uses where that would be handy . Battery life is decent , but for the price it would be nice if it was LED so you did n't have to worry about bulbs and the battery life would be longer .	1
I use this flashlight almost everyday for my job . I love the swivel head which allows you to shine the light wherever you need it .	1
Great place to leave the 18 Volt Lithium Ion batter pack of your Dewalt drill went not in use on the drill . Very powerful light . Old time , incandescent light . Powerful beam . Lithium Ion does n't lose it charge over time like NiCad 's do . Wonderful improvement .	1
It is very handy with swivel head . You can set it down and aim it where ever you need light.The negative is that it is heavy with std battery , the swivel head tends to break if droppedwith any force .	1
The DeWalt DW908 18-volt flashlight is a nice piece of equipment and great to have around the garage . Purchased it because I have five or six other DeWalt 18v tools and a couple batteries , and they are all outstanding quality.The light delivered to me has the smaller footprint ( for lithium batteries ) , though my toolset still is based on NiCd batteries and chargers . That was not a problem as it still fits nicely on the NiCd battery ... matter of fact , I think that the bigger NiCd battery probably gives this light a much more stable base than a smaller battery would . Does make it a bit heavy to carry around though , so this light stays in the shop and does not hit the trail with us.The light works well and the position selector for the rotating head makes it easier for me to get the light to shine on just the right place that I need it to . Similar to comments in other reviews , I was a bit surprised by the lack of intensity of the light though -- it might be just a tad brighter than your typical 2-D cell non-LCD flashlight . Maybe I have become spoiled by all of the CREE LCDs flooding the market these days , but I did expect a brighter , whiter light.On the flip side , this light 's reflection will not blind you when under the car working . It puts out just the amount of light needed , and the swivel head helps direct things nicely . Looks like some reviewers got the spare bulbs with theirs , and some did not ... we were on the 'did not ' side of things , but that is OK . Already have a couple spares order and sitting in my shopping cart waiting for me to checkout.If you are looking for a good , sturdy flashlight head to run on your Dewalt 18v batteries , this one will work . It is not the brightest or the lightest on the market , but the price and utility are right . If , like us , that is what you seek - then I recommend this light to you .	1
PROS- It 's good and bright , Of course , powered by an 18V batt , that runs circular saws- this light darn well ought to be bright ! & # 60 ; g & # 62 ; Also , it stands well ( stable ) , using the heavy battery as it 's base . Finally , my tired old eyes sometimes have trouble seeing the thin black MagLight , but , even in the dark , can always spot the bright yellow trim on the DeWalt.CONS- Swivel head will not rotate to 'lower ' the beam , requiring light to be laid on it 's side.UNKNOWNS- I bought this mainly to exercise my DeWalt batteries , so I have no comparisons with other similar lights . I 've had none of the problems ( 2 star reviews ) with bulbs or quality , but then I 've only owned this a few weeks , so I ca n't comment.EXPERIMENTATION & # 60 ; g & # 62 ; This light WILL accept the 14 V batt . HOWEVER it must be carefully latched ( wiggled in , and 'pull ' checked ) . Otherwise it can fall out , in accordance with the 595th corollary of Murphy 's Law , which states & # 34 ; A poorly latched battery will fall out at the highest height above the concrete garage floor & # 34 ; & # 60 ; g & # 62 ;	1
I am tired of my Dewalt XRP batteries always dying an early death and having to buy more . I bought this because 1. it was relativelycheap and 2 . I plan to use it as a means of & # 34 ; using & # 34 ; my batteries and recharging them before they die . I hope it is worth it .	1
Nice , but not their snake light . The Dewalt snake light is much more useful . Yet , this is cheaper and there are uses so having it around is a good thing .	1
this light is bright and the interchangeable battery is very helpful . can be propped up to direct light when needed	1
Nothing new . Same as my 12V light that never dies . Gets banged around nicely and works well . Focus feature could be nice tho . As said before- love those bare tool deals .	1
GREAT FOR CAMPING AND FOR AROUND THE HOUSE . HAVE BEEN WANTING TO BUY ONE FOR YEARS FINALLY MADE THE MOVE .	1
This a great light , especially if you already have some other Dewalt tools that use the same battery . The head pivots to give different lighting angles and with the battery it stands up on it 's own with no problem . No more buying disposable batteries for flashlights .	1
This is a nice accessory to have , if you already own a DeWalt battery pack and the charger . Basically , that would limit my recommendation of this product to those who already own a cordless 14.4 volt DeWalt tool . While the flashlight itself is relatively inexpensive at about $ 25 , the battery pack and the charger are not . The battery pack cost more than $ 50 apiece . Add the cost of the charger and you get the idea that this is not a flashlight system that you buy on its own . But , if you already own the battery packs and the charger , then spending an additional $ 25 will get you a very powerful and durable flashlight.I bought this flashlight because I already own the 14.4 volt XRP drill . The flashlight and drill are sharing the two batteries that came with the drill.This is a very nice , wide-beam flashlight . The craftsmanship is what you would expect from DeWalt . The light is made of quality materials . And , due to the design and the bottom-heaviness of the battery pack , this flashlight can & quot ; stand & quot ; on its own . Perfect for those times when you do n't have someone to hold the light for you . And , because it throws a wide beam , this unit can illuminate quite a lot of area . I highly recommend this high quality light to those who already own a DeWalt tool that uses the 14.4 volt battery pack .	1
Bright and functional light , stable and rotates well . Great purchase is you 're already running a dewalt battery for something else .	1
It 's sturdy , very bright light , good swivel head ( but takes a few moments to figure out how to turn the head ) , battery lasts a long time , very reasonable price , and is perfect if you own any DeWalt 14.4 volt cordless tools . Even if you did n't , it would almost pay to buy this with a battery and charger !	1
Very good flashlight for the price if you have the batteries . Has the old style bulb , not a LED , but puts out a bright wide beam . The adjustable head allows you to use it hands free and aim the beam where you need it . Very happy with the performance .	1
Added this to my Dewalt inventory when replacing the 14.7V batteries . Great addition to my useful tools , here in hurricane country .	1
I bought this flashlight for use around the house and for camping . Since I already have a 14.4 DeWalt drill , it was an easy decision to pick up this high quality accessory . So far I have found this flash light to be very good quality : the beam is bright , the head is adjustable , and it stays put while standing alone on its base ( the battery pack ) . Based on all of this I recommemd this as a fair deal on a quality product .	1
We have purchased multiple rechargable flashlights and each one of them have died in the process of rarely using them . Plus , some of the specialty bulbs were very expensive . When we discovered the Dewalt made a flashlight which uses the same rechargable battery pack which fits my husband 's cordless screwdriver , we purchased the Dewalt Flashlight right away . We use it for multiple tasks . We have an extra battery anyway so now we can use this flashlight anytime we need one . Great versatility and great product .	1
If you already have a dewalt 12v cordless tool - this flashlight is great . I always keep my backup batteries charged and I have good light whenever I need it.It 's fairly well built and will provide great usable light for more than 30 minutes . The head of the flashlight rotates so that you can position the beam where you need it.Should it be cheaper ? It used to sell for $ 34.00 and now costs $ 20.00.Sounds like a good deal to mecaslo	1
Nice little flashlight . I took it camping , and it worked out great . I used it quite a bit , and it did not need a recharge for the whole week . My standard drill battery fits the light . Very bright yellowish colored light .	1
Been using this light for nearly 5 years for all kinds of work in attics or under houses . I 've always been able to rely on this thing for difficult to spot wires or for work in a dark closet when mounting panels for security systems . The rotating head is also very handy for that perfect angle when working in odd locations . I do wish it had a clip or hook that would attach to 2x4 's in the attic . That is the only reason why i only gave it 4 stars .	1
It sure is nice having a flash light that I always know there is a fresh battery in . This is the case because I have multiple of the 12-volt DeWalt batteries and always keep one on the unplugged charger fully charged and ready to swap out for a dead battery . This flashlight is well balanced and feels nice in the hand and turns on and off easily with the thumb of the hand holding the light . My only complaint is that it eats the battery up pretty fast . I am unable to make a run to the outhouse and back without the flashlight going dead ( or at least very dim ) . And I do n't stay seated long . I end up turning it off while seated .	1
This light is great , but I wish it came with the LED bulb as a standard item.After installing the LED upgrade the light is much better.I do n't use the flexible neck very often , but it has come in handy . It also makes for a good handle to carry the light by and makes me feel like I 'm walking around with one of the old railroad lanterns due to the shape and feel .	1
Great product and great price . This is our 3rd one , they wear out after heavy use and are n't worth repairing	1
If you buy this light then immediately buy the LED conversion kit for it sold here on amazon . Once you convert it over to LED you will have a super bright white light that wo n't run down the battery and it will hold up much better than the bulb type originally shipped with the units.I do n't understand why DeWalt bothers to ship this with anything but LED !	1
Love this light . It is very bright and lasts a long time with just one battery . The flexible neck wraps around almost anything .	1
Only reason the 4 instead of 5 stars was that while I was waiting the few days it took to get here I found it locally for about $ 4 cheaper but that was okay since I got what I wanted for a price I was willing to pay ( MUCH less that retail ) and for less than what most local stores had it ... .if I had ONLY checked EVERY local store ... .	1
I really did not think this light was all that and a cup of tea until I got it . it is such a nice little helper on all the jobs that are hard to see . It is a must for a person who works alone . will buy another one if anything ever happens to this one . I love this accessory to my tools .	1
Works great combined with my other 18-volt Dewalt tools , though I did replace the bulb with an LED from Super Brite LEDs , much brighter light and longer battery life , though battery life is pretty long anyway . Really handy to set or lay it sonw and bend neck around to get the light where you need it . Would be handy if it was a wider beam though .	1
This is a replacement for an old one that finally wore out.The only draw back is he fact that you have to balance the head just right to keep the unit from tipping over.Other then that , this is a fine product to get light where you need it hands free .	1
I sold all my DeWalt stuff locally and bought new , everything with the `` nano '' foot for the square lithium ion batteries . Some items still run the old photos , but I got everything from Amazon and all with the new shape . Still accepts the oval NiCd batteries with the same positive connect . Now if you get Li batteries you wo n't see the oval overhanging them.Has storage for a spare bulb , but does not include the spare bulb .	1
This flashlight is a very good flaashlight overall . Its 18v pattery provides long lasting bright light for close objects . It 's `` flexible snake '' handle can be used to hang the light anywhere and aim it where needed . It would be an ideal light to hang under a open car hood to light up the engine compartment.However , after I received my DeWalt flexible floodhlight , I found on Amazon a black aluminum LED flashlight ( `` 3 Watt Cree LED 3 AA Tactical Flashlight 180 Lumen Long Throwing Tight Spot yet wide moon light Torch , 7224bk '' ) which uses 3 AA batteries and produces 180-200 lumens of light . A typical flashlight with an incondescant bulb will normally be WELL under 20 lumins , including the DeWalt flexible floodlight . At close objects it has a very small , bright center beam , but a very broad overspill beam allowing the user to view things not in the main beam very well . For illuminating distant objects , the small center beam gets broader with the distance from the object . It will illuminate objects 400-500 ft. away . I purchased the LED flashlight on Amazon and consider it to be one of the best flashlights I 've owned . The way that LED flashlights have improved ( compared to incondescant bulbs ) is amazing . I use 3 re-chargeable AA batteries in mine . They get 3-5 hours per charge . In about 6 months I 've only had to recharge it one time , and it gets lots of use . Unlike incondescant bulbs , the LED should VERY rarely , if ever , need to be replaced .	1
I got this when I began working on a rental house owned by my mother . This was very useful because it let me work at night when I 'd otherwise have to shut down . The use of common batteries with the other Dewalt 18V tools is what makes it so useful.I use it as an area light , bouncing off light-colored walls to light up an entire room ( and it is a little dim for this ) . I still carry a flashlight as a backup and I 'd recommend the same to anyone using it at night , since you may knock it over , plywood may fall on it , et cetera . It can be used for task lighting . I suspect that the other Dewalt 18V flashlight might be better for that , though.The design of the light , with the flexible neck , lets you set it up in all kinds of positions . The advice given in another review - set it on its side - should be taken to heart , as I think that 's the most reliable way to use it . Setting the light on the battery base and extending the neck can make it unstable.But this is a very useful light which can be used in many , many ways . I think that , because it 's so useful , one is tempted to use it just a little bit beyond its ability to balance itself . With that caveat , highly recommended .	1
This flashlight should be on every 18v DeWalt owners must have list.An excellent value combined with outstanding function.Nicely done DeWalt.A nice upgrade would be a LED bulb kit , otherwise perfect .	1
dont know why dewalt doesnt sell this with their kits anymore , most stores dont even sell it , the have 2 other kinds but not the snake one . nice light .	1
This flashlight uses my 18V batteries and can be aimed wherever needed . Inexpensive and often helpful .	1
Bought this a few months ago and still working strong . Bought the LED UPGRADE and together this light rocks and the battery life is outstanding too .	1
I always thought this thing was kind of a joke . While it is combo filler , it is also very usefull , the flex is rigid and stays where you point it . At least sofar being only 2 weeks old . Bright enough to see , this is not a surefire . I even hung it from some pipes and it worked . I grab this light for more jobs that I ever thought I would.An multi LED version or better yet a combo LED/incandescent would be a good redesign for the nano version . I dont like the feel of 100 % LED lamps.Anyways , very good lamp but did n't come with extra bulb , hence four stars .	1
I bought this after I bought the 18V circular saw . If you only get one light , make it this one .	1
very handy , nice and bright . The flexible goose neck allows you to aim the light where you want it .	1
Wonderfull light . Will last all day on one battery charge . Easy to use in tight spaces where both hands are required for work .	1
This is a pretty good lamp . I have several that are used by my crews . I have had some of them for over five years and other than the bulbs going out there great . Dewalt has an LED up grade that I put on all my lights . It brings them up to a modern LED Lamp . Dewalt should eliminate the incandescent and just make the LED standard .	1
I got this because I have the shop vac and wanted a good flashlight for hurricaine season . LOVE it , got the new bulb but saved the old in case it blows . I got almost 24 hours out of the flashlight and a fully charged battery .	1
Use it a ton . Nice quality . Easy to wrap on things to hold it . Hope that dewalt does not drop 18 v	1
My original died after years of flexing the gooseneck.This was a bargain of a replacement . Almost half what I priced this item for in tool stores.Sometimes it gets hung up snapping on/off the battery .	1
I really like this light . I brought this one to replace the first light I have had for a several years . The first one was out of warranty and the flex broke near the base of the base of the light . It still worked , but you could n't hold it in position . Hoping they have improved the design . You can bend this to just about position to get light on something and free both hands to work on it . Uses the standard Dewalt 18v rechargeable batteries . Has a spot in the light to carry a spare blub , it 's near the blub , remove the cover like you are going to replace the blub and you will see the small hole to drop a blub in . My first one came if a spare , now they do n't . The blub lasts a long time , but if you do n't want to be without light drop in a spare just in case . I own three different Dewalt 18v lights and if I need to work and free both hands this is the one I pick off the shelf . I gave it 4 of 5 stars because of the concern it too may break the flex again and need replaced . Amazon 's price was great , cheaper to buy the new light than the part to repair the old one .	1
This a very handy light and I would recommend it to anyone who already has Dewalt tools that use 18v batteries . The weight of tha battery makes it stand up well and it produces a good amount of light .	1
This DEWALT DW7441 Side and Outfeed Support is really well made with heavy material . It truly helps when cutting materialon projects . Easily installed	1
Easy to install and works fine . Reason for only four stars is because they sage a little from weight ; although I do n't think enough to affect the cut .	1
These work great . I do n't know why others complain about them being low or sagging . They are fully adjustable and you can set them even with your table top . They are so simple I do n't know how anyone could have trouble figuring this out . My only complaint is they crowd the storage area on the side of your DW744 just a bit ( where you keep the spare blade and wrenches ) . Not a big deal though .	1
This was the best purchase I 've made in a long time ! With me working by myself about 95 % of the time , this has saved me A LOT of time and frustration ! Worth every penny I paid ( around $ 50.00 with Dewalt sale )	1
Ordered these for Christmas from DeWalt . They are made overseas ( Taiwan ) and the side support was packed damaged from the factory . 1-800-4-DEWALT was great customer service , they sent me a replacement within a day.The kit is a great addition on the DW744 . I tote my tools to my in-law 's farm to do repairs , and it 's a great help when cutting material .	1
Just get these things . Frankly , they should have come with the saw . The ONLY downside that I can see having them on there is that the saw weighs about 15 lbs more with these attached . They are heavy steel supports , and , unfortunately , add some heft to a saw that 's already pretty heavy.Other than that , they are perfect . Easy installation ( the holes are pre-tapped on the new 744 saw ) , very nice movement ( they retract in about 10 seconds if you do n't want them in the way ) . Makes it dramatically easier to deal with larger boards . The stock rip fence and miter gauge are totally functional with this in place.All in all , it 's something that should have just come with the saw ; but , because it does n't , you should add this if you ever cut sizable stock on your saw . Much easier to deal with and safer cuts .	1
How did I use the saw without these . ( My wife knows ! ) Glad I bought them as they are very handy .	1
Works great , all metal parts . The only downside is they do not lock in for transportation . I need to keep a bungee cord handy . A clip would be nice to have seeing this is for a portable table saw.I have the model attached to the cart with wheels . This puts the saw sideways when moving and storing upright which makes this even more of a problem .	1
Works great . I keep a folding outfeed stand around just in case but have n't needed it yet.Install was a snap . Some have mentioned that they slide out when you move your saw around . I had the same issue but I purchased some 5m Thumb Screws and put them in the near side of each supports guide bracket . Now it 's just a quick turn to lock them in place .	1
The photograph is misleading because it looks like a flimsy , toothpicky kind of support . Actually it is a very well made , heavy support worthy of the DeWalt table saw for which it was designed . I use it for supporting long boards and relatively heavy sheets of three-quarter inch plywood . I 've owned my DW744XRS table saw for a couple of years , and all this time I 've used `` horses '' for my outfeed and side supports . Talk about an `` I-coulda-had-a-V-8 '' moment , when I first discovered the ease and efficiency of this invaluable accessory I was awestruck . If you own a DW744 , these supports should be your next purchase .	1
I have had these supports for about 6 years . I carefully adjusted them to the height of the table and they have never gone out of adjustment , even when abused by resting an entire 3/4 sheet of plywood on just one support . They do a great job of turning a pretty small saw into a very workable machine .	1
I bought this saw at a local woodworking store while it was on sale a few weeks ago . I had been using a Hitachi CW - 40 which works well for a low end saw , but the DeWalt is a horse of another color - Bright Yellow ! Now , the nuts and bolts : QUIET and vibration free . Big smooth table , easily trued after making angle cuts . The blade tensioner is right there in front and stays where you set it . Likewise , when you re-clamp the blade , just bring it to the tension number you had it on and it stays there . Easy , EASY blade changes . The wing clamps hold the blade by hand tightening alone . I have n't had a blade slip out of the clamps yet . The stand is a must . The rear leg will adjust up or down to give you the table angle that is comfortable for your use . It is fairly tall , but a regular workshop stool will put you at the right height , making it comfortable to work with . The blower is powerful and clears away the dust . It too stays where you place it and it is easier to bend and position that I have found on the other saws . The hold-down clamp works fine , but like most scroll sawyers , I do n't use one and I removed it.This is an expensive saw for the average woodworker , but it is well worth the extra cost . Solid , quiet , smooth , quality workmanship and durablity . You ca n't go wrong .	1
This scroll saw is as advertised . I had a lesser model that I started out on and it had a lot of vibration . Intricate patterns were difficult to cut since the vibration would break the tiny pieces of wood . There is NO vibration with this saw . It is solid on its base and everything has easy access . One item that I added was the & # 34 ; Lifter & # 34 ; , which I purchased separately . It holds the arm up when changing blades or rethreading . Dewalt should consider adding this item to the saw - it works great .	1
This is the first scroll saw I have owned . It waited 6 months after I purchased this saw To writhe a review . I read many reviews and looked long and hard before making the decision to purchase this saw . I had seen various saws at Lowes at close out and their prices were tempting but I kept on reading and reviewing . Finally an Amazon sale tipped me to this one . Since I have had it I have used it constantly . I have let my grandson use it so it has seen much use . The blade change and tightning system is easy with no problems . My 9 year old grandson has no problem changing or installing blades . The table depth is great and I am glad I didnt buy a cheaper unit at Lowes on sale because I can now see the advantage of the deep throat of the saw.I also purchased a stand and light with the saw . Assembly was a snap . The light is a real blessing . It stays right where I put it so far . The stand is 3 legged and I wish it was on some sort of roller but I am not sure how stable it would be on wheels with only 3 legs . I have to give this more thought.My only complaint is the simple hold down seems to not be level and is aggravating to adjust because when I tighten it up sufficiently it is like I glued it down . Is dosent want to let go to make any adgustments.I dont have the advantage of having used other scroll saws to compare it with but It seems to be well made and easy to use . If I had used more expensive scroll saws or saws of different designs , I might be able to complain about shortcomings or design flaws , but so far this machine has performed flawlessly and will probably be the only one I ever purchase .	1
After reading the reviews here on Amazon and with the great pricing on the DW788 , I took the plunge and ordered both the saw and the stand.I 've used several scroll saws over the past 40 years , I can say this is by far the best I 've ever used ! There is no vibration to this saw and the cuts are easy and flowing , and did I mention how quiet it is ? If you 're looking for a solid scroll saw , pay a little extra and get a solid machine , you wo n't be disappointed in the DW788 . Better get a dolly when it arrives , very heavy , solid product A++	1
This is a great saw , we moved to Hawaii and I needed a new saw . I could n't think of a better saw to buy than this one	1
In the last 3 months I 've tried 4 different scroll saws , 5 counting this one . All the others were ridiculously difficult to install and change blades . And they all had big holes in the table with a plastic insert with big slots in them making it difficult to make square edged cuts and cutting out small parts . I do n't know why they put all those plastic guards around the lower arm.Now this one is so easy to use compared to the others . The blade clamps are made for plain end blades and it & # 8217 ; s no problem to clamp even one of the smallest sized blades.As for doing inside cuts , no problem . One of the other saws I tried had this big clear plastic guard thing over the end of the upper arm and blade clamp . There was no way to get a blade up through a work piece to do inside cuts . With the Dewalt all I have to do is loosen the clamp off of the blade and I can raise the arm a couple inches leaving plenty of room to line a work piece up with the blade then lower the arm and clamp the blade in place . The only thing needed is a small block to hold the arm up while getting the blade through the work piece.The blade tension adjustment is also way better than on the other saws I 've tried out . It 's a little lever right there on the end of the upper arm and you only have to move it about a quarter of a turn to release the tension . Best of all it has markings to line it up with and I can feel it sliding over little notches as I turn it so when I find a tension that works good on a blade I can get the same tension every time I re-clamp the blade when moving it to another inside cut . The main thing you have to remember is you can & # 8217 ; t lift and carry the saw by the upper arm.The speed adjustment is easy to use and the saw responds well and keeps a smooth action through its whole speed range . The on/off switch is big and easy to use right on top . One saw I tried it was down under the table another had it half way back on the side of the arm.About the only complaint I have about it is for the price , it should come with a work light . Even the cheapest poorest quality saw I 've tried had a light on it . Almost $ 500 for it and they want another $ 30 Bucks for a work light . And it would be nice if they threw in the stand for it too for that price . It & # 8217 ; s a sweet machine but I think they want a little too much just for their name . That 's why I did n't give it the other star .	1
I bought this saw about a month ago now and have used it a few times . Its very smooth . Very little vibration and when you bolt it down on quarter inch rubber it has no vibration at all . ( I used an old tire inner tube . ) I bought this with a Moto foot pedal . That leaves your hands on your work . The tension lever is great . Right up front where it should be . The cast table size is great for bigger projects . I got this saw as a member of Amazon Prime . I ordered it overnight air with Saturday delivery . It was an extra $ 9.95 freight . This is a 66 lb saw . Got ta love Amazon Prime .	1
I had been looking for quite awhile for a VS scroll saw , they were either way to pricey or a piece of just junk . I came across this model while I was in a local Woodcraft store . I really do n't have any grips about this saw ( which is very surprising for me because I hate almost everything made by DeWalt today ) but this saw is a really nice saw ... ... .except ... ... ... for the accessory light made for this saw by DeWalt , it is a piece of JUNK ! Amazon sent the 1st light to me with saw . After attaching light gravity takes over after a few seconds and light makes a nosedive for the saws tabletop . This seems to be a very common problem with the light for this saw and DeWalt has known about this problem since like 2009 and refuses to fix the problem . I called Amazon , as usual Amazon CS is top notch , they sent me another one the very same day and it was overnighted to me ! Amazon CS rocks . The second light does the exact same thing , so I boxed it back up went to IKEA and purchased a 15.00 light with a clamp and magnetic base and problem is fixed ! Its a shame DeWalt and Porter Cable are being run by the likes of Black and Decker ! 99 % of the tools coming out of their factories now are junk and marketed for the DIY'ers and Weekend Warriors that do n't care about quality when it comes to a tool purchase , all they care about is price point . Sorry about the rant , but this saw is better than most anything else DeWalt is building today ... Almost makes me wonder who is building it for DeWalt ?	1
I use this saw pretty much on a daily basis . I do a lot of scrolling and I 've had this saw since mid Feb and it is still going strong . I hope it will last for many years to come . My Shop Fox died after 6 months ! The packaging was wonderful and there was a warning on top of the saw that tells not to try to lift it out of the box by the arm of the saw . Every thing was there and all I had to do was attach the table and then blade and put a hunk of scrap wood on it and then went on to scroll !	1
Grizzly sells a combo including the DW788 with Dewalt stand and light regularly for $ 499 and is on a spring sale for $ 50 less than that . All new . Save about $ 180 over Amazon and other sellers . Ca n't understand why the price is so much higher elsewhere . ( Grizzly shipping + $ 21.00 ) . This is one of the few instances where Amazon is not even competitive ... unfortunately.UPDATE : 10FEB2010 - I see Amazon has finally reduced the price of this unit to a reasonable level that competes with the lowest found elsewhere . Glad to see Amazon catching on ! If you are looking at scroll saws ... look no further . This is the bomb ! There is no better at this price point .	1
This is my first and last scroll saw . I am glad I spent the extra money for a good one . It is so smooth and the cuts are so smooth you do no even need to sand .	1
I wanted a scroll saw to help cut out model airplane parts quickly . I did a lot of reading and settled on this saw and promptly received it a few days later . Bent . It is very heavy and feels sturdy but after running it for a few minutes , I noticed it had a knock at RPM 's above speed 4 . A quick google search later showed that this was a prominent problem from older models . After inspecting the machine further , I noticed it was cutting at an angle . No problem , just adjust the set screw and the thumb screw until the blade makes a right angle with the table . After maxing out the adjustment , the blade was a solid 1 degree off . On smaller work pieces , this is barely noticeable . Try to cut a circle on 1 '' thick wood or stack cut and you will quickly notice that the parts are all different . I took a step back and noticed that the machine 's entire top arm was bent about 1/4 '' to the right which explained everything . A call to DeWalt support later and they said it will be a month before they can look at it . So , I simply bent the thing back - by hand . If I am able to bend this cast iron by hand , it is n't very strong . Now the knocking is gone and the machine cuts straight vertical cuts.Now that is worked out ... for the performance.The machine is very quiet , about as loud as a sewing machine . It also vibrates very little.Blade insertion is very fast and easy . It takes only a few second to thread the blade though a hole and reconnect the blade.The top arm swings back to give you room to thread the blade and set things up . The bad thing is that it is not spring loaded . The material holder came down on my finger nail by accident because of this . ( It slipped out of my hand while trying to thread a blade through a hole ) I have to prop the arm up with a block of wood until I can rig up a spring system.The blade tension is very repeatable and easy to adjust.It is pretty strong , it did n't slow down once while cutting out 1 1/2 '' thick wood.I recommend waxing the table with finishing wax to make it slippery . Without the wax , materials snagged on the keyhole . I also recommend taping a bag under the bottom arm to catch saw dust . If you are electronically inclined , rig up a small LED near the bottom blade holder . It is hard to see the blade down there because it is dark . I also recommend getting a small lamp and taping another bag to the right side to catch sawdust on the top.For $ 500 , I would recommend looking at the 16 '' excaliber . This saw is n't bad , but it being bent out of the box but a very bad taste in my mouth .	1
I can not understand the reviews that claim this saw is noisy or has excess vibration . I find the saw to be very quite and smooth . It has good power to cut 2 '' stock and the table finish is very good . If you are upgrading from a low-end saw you will be very pleased with this saw .	1
Already own one of these and its 15 years old so thought it was about time to get a new one . Strange that it feels different than the old one , yet they are the same . One just new . Feels like it was made overseas but still will take some time to become familiar with it . Hope for the best . Initial cutting good but still different . Just hope it last like the last one .	1
The Dewalt DW788 is my first scroll saw . Have n't even used someone else 's before . So I would really like to thank everyone who took the time to write a review on it and the other scroll saws at amazon . It was the primary reason I chose the Dewalt.I make boxe 's , all kinds , shapes and size 's . I have pretty much quit using metal fastener 's , hinges , knobs , catch 's , etc . I really enjoy making my own out of wood . Have been using a multitude of power and hand tools to make my own , but thought a scroll saw would allow me to make even smaller , more intricate pieces.Assembly was very quick and easy . I added rubber feet to the base of the saw as it will sit on a workbench not on its own stand . Have a small shop , every thing has to be mobile . I also purchased a foot switch as everyone I talked with about scroll saws seems to feel it is a necessary safety feature . With a combination of the rubber feet and a rubber pad , the machine does n't move at all , even on speed 8 . Vibration is very minimal , and luckily the saw is at the perfect heighth when sitting on the bench . The dust blower works adequately , but I am going to rig a vacuum source up somehow . Changing blades is a bit of a challenge at first , but I think with time and practice it will become much easier . I also have rigged a swing arm lamp to use with the saw , old tired eyes ya know , need all the help I can get.I mostly use hardwoods , and thickness 's up to 1 '' so blade selection and speed are going to be critical items . So far I probably have spent 10-15 hours just practicing , using differant woods , blades , speeds , feed rate , etc. , and taking a few notes to help later on . I am very happy with the results so far . Have made two sets of decorative hinges out of mesquite and am very pleased with the small kerf I was able to achieve and how well they fit and function . They took a bit of time to produce , but I know that will change as I become more practiced and comfortable with the machine 's ability and of course my own.I spent a lot of time researching scroll saw 's before purchasing the Dewalt . It will not be used everyday , but hopefully will be used a lot for a long time . So I wanted a machine that would last a long time and I believe the Dewalt will do the job for me.Recommend it highly .	1
I purchased a DW788 in Dec , 2009 on sale at Rockler . Saw , stand , light , plus a $ 50 Rockler gift card was $ 449 . That 's a pretty good price , and Rockler was swamped , taking over a month to get it in.Unlike some of the earlier reviews , I experienced absolutely no problem with the lineup of the holes for the table/bevel control - saw assembly was complete under 5 minutes , with the stand taking about 30 minutes ( but I stopped for coffee once ) .My exceedingly precise machinist setup block shows a true vertical between the blade and the table top when the bevel gauge is set to zero so I have not had to adjust anything to get a perfect cut on 1 inch cedar scrap.I see no vibration problem with the saw on either my bench or the DeWalt stand . Running at full speed cutting thin stock ( a tongue depressor ) I get some movement on a nickel . Just running with a blade at high speed the nickel does n't move at all.There is a bit of accumulation of dust on the table , but I see that as less a problem with table top machining than with a whimpy dust blower . The blower does work , it just does n't move the dust very far . I 've got full-shop dust collection so I just do a quick clean periodically with a 2 '' hose I leave free and that seems to be able to keep up , but for a small blade it seems to create a lot of dust.One of my first cuts was a dovetail joint in the scrap cedar . I 've done dovetails a variety of ways , including by hand with chisel and gents saw and if you 've ever tried that you know it can take a while . With the DW788 , cutting a perfect pin side of the dovetail in the cedar took less than two minutes.Dewalt is a bit stingy with saw blades , only 2 come with the saw . I 'm learning that blade supply can be a tough hunt , and Amazon 's selection is not either a good start or final destination . If you 're new to it , it seems that Olson blades are something of the standard . Best so far best for selection/price is a site named scrollit . com . Rockler and Woodcraft are n't much better than Amazon.I got mine for use in Marquetry applied to furniture , but in just a short while it has become apparent that it will be used for much more . This puppy is one h @ ll of a convenient mini-bandsaw .	1
I have been in the business of teaching woodworking for over 20 years at all different levels . I have experienced many different types of scroll saws in school settings and home shop settings . For the money , this is one of the easiest to set up and use I have ever seen . They give almost no trouble at all and are rather vibration free if the right type of blade is used with the right type of wood . Experience is the best teacher in this regard . It is the smoothest running saw I have ever worked with and works well with young wood workers . There may be equals on the market , but I have seen nothing better for the money . I would definitely buy one again .	1
Overall , this is a pretty good scroll saw for the hobbyist and is $ 200 less than the regular price from Woodcraft , and $ 125 less than the annual sale they have . This saw has minimal to no vibration , super quiet , and easy to use . The quick-change blade process is very convenient compared to the more expensive Delta scroll saw I was using , and changing the blade speed is a snap with the turn-dial speed selector . The blower hose is easy to adjust and does not get in the way of your work while really pushing your sawdust out of the way fast.Assembly is a snap - the only thing you have to assemble is put in a few screws to attach the table as well as the front guard - that took me all of 4 minutes to put that together.The unit comes with two blades , and you might miss them as they were attached to an unmarked small plastic bag.One tip for when you are doing a blade change- get a small block of wood and set it on the table to hold up the throat of the unit in the `` up '' position to make sure you are getting the right tension.If you are looking for accessories , I will say the stand is okay and the optional scroll saw light leaves a lot to be desired - read my separate reviews on each .	1
have owned this saw for close to 4 years and it has been excellent . Very quiet , minimal vibration , reliable , and more than enough power . If I earned my living cutting scroll saw items might have considered the $ 1,000 plus saws but I do n't so they were never seriously in the running . I believe in the law of diminishing returns and once you get to a certain level of quality and performance additional improvement gets very costly quickly . That is the way I viewed the expensive saws ; perhaps slightly better but not worth the cost . As for comments about the blade hole being off center mine was dead on when I received it . Out of curiosity I looked to see where my saw was made but it was n't marked . I do n't have any problem with Asian manufactured products but there are some low quality manufacturers out there and frankly also here in US . I would hope Dewalt is not lowering the quality of this otherwise excellent saw by going to the cheapest manufacturer they can find and then skipping quality control inspections .	1
I 've had this for few months now and I am starting to really enjoy scrolling . This saw is powerful , really heaven duty and operates smoothly . Have n't had any problems . Highly recommend.PS The arm does n't stay up when removing your work piece but there are scrollsaw websites that sell remedies for that . Really easy to find . They are small home engineers who came up with solutions . The Lifter is one I purchased	1
This saw is used for fine detail woodworking . It comes with 2 blades , so the first thing on your shopping list should be more blades , as these blades are very thin and can be broken easily . It can be mounted to a workbench but purchasing the stand gives you much more mobility	1
Will try to make this brief , but my wife wanted to get into intarsia , especially , and other things that would require a scroll saw . My woodworking shop is pretty well equipped , but did not have a scroll saw . Looked at several brands , prices , etc . Read lots of reviews . The DeWalt is at the top of the mid-priced machines . Although it was a new venture and we were unsure if it would become a long-term use thing , decided that a cheap one would probably sour us on scroll sawing altogether . We do n't have other scroll saw experiences to compare with but can say that we have been very pleased with the performance of this machine . The quick blade release is an absolute must have . The throat depth works well for us . It is smooth running . Do n't know how a $ 1,000+ machine could be that much better ?	1
I have been waiting to acquire a decent scroll saw for ten years . Previously , I used a Delta 16 '' two-speed scroll saw . That saw offered basic scroll saw capabilities ; however , it was very inaccurate , with excessive blade side-to-side and front-to-back blade movement . It was **O.K . ** but not great for delicate work.The DeWalt is a solid performer , with very little vibration ( almost none , actually ) , very low noise , and a great tension adjuster that allows one to adjust tension while the machine is running . I also like the generous-sized table . The blades are relatively easy to change ( it is just a bit of work to load the blade into the bottom blade holder -- I just clamp the blade into the top holder , then load it into the bottom holder ) . The manual is not available at the DeWalt site -- I had to visit one of their ServiceNet sites to download an exploded view of the machine . I am still not sure how to adjust the table position in relation to the blade -- the side of the blade runs through the hole in the table very close to side of the hole . It would be nice to be able to adjust the blade so that it runs through the center of the hole ! ! ! All-in-all , the machine is a joy to use . I would definitely recommend this scroll saw above any others even close to the price range.July 2008 UPDATE : Still performing very well ! The first link of the blower hose did crack where it connects to the spherical connector . I just removed the broken link and microwaved the hose to get it warmed up ; it popped right back on . Also , for those who want info on tuneups for this saw , go to this link : [ ... ]	1
I 've had the saw with the legs and light for several weeks now . I got the Mobile Base with it as well in order to move around my shop with ease . The saw set up easily , and I had it up and running right out of the box . The Legs took about 45 min to assemble ( see my review ) . The saw had considerable knocking at high speeds , above 6 ( 1450 ) . I found a fix at [ ... ] . It was also the fix DeWalt recommended . I spent an hour or so making the adjustment . Also , I filed down the bottom rounded side of the Lid . See a drawing of the parts that can be downloaded from DeWalt or [ ... ] . Follow the instructions there . It helps as well . It now is running with no knocking at 8 ( 1750 ) . DeWalt put in a fix for this in 2009 , and it is there now , so they say . My manufacture date was Feb 2008 . I bought the saw , stand , light at Grizzly for considerably less than Amazon had . I have also added a dust collector ( Seyco at [ ... ] ) for $ 25 , and the footswitch from Woodcraft for $ 18 . I nearly bought an Excalibur , but the price differential was too much to ignore for my use . I am really satistfied , and learned a lot by disassembling the front end of the saw . I have hooked the Seyco collector up to my Festool Dust Extractor , footswitch , and saw , so now when I push the footswitch the saw and vacumn come on , or off . Does a great job . A great addition to my shop , and a replacement for my old Dremel .	1
The table alone weighs over twenty pounds . Milled flat and smooth . a pleasure to work on this big table . The saw is quiet , and no vibration until you crank it up to maximum speed , a speed I 'll probably never use . The pin-less blades are a snap to change , and for fret work , one simply loosens the knob at top , and the entire saw arm lifts up , so you can pull your project up and reinsert it in a new starter hole . Tighten a wing nut to connect the top of the blade , adjust the tension lever and you 're ready to saw . The blower works better than any of the scroll saws that I 've owned or used . The blade tension and speed are adjustable on the top , front of the saw . Both easy to adjust . I highly recommend the DEWALT stand , it takes up little room , following the shape of the saw base . Also a foot switch , which I 've used on my scroll saws for years.Scroll sawing is absolutely fun on this machine . After I finished the installation , I tested the saw , then immediately started a project , just to have an excuse to use my new saw .	1
I had gone through 2 `` cheapie '' scroll saws over the past several years . I do a fair amount of fret work and intarsia . I finally have a machine that holds the blade tightly and is easy to thread into pilot holes.the blower works great . Having the arm tilt is an invaluable feature for me . I am not crazy about the hold down ... the arms are too far apart for some of the small work I do . But other than that , a fantastic machine , and getting the stand free is a great incentive . A built in light and blade holder would nice added features.I just completed cutting and building a very intricate clock that was all fret work with this saw . It 's outstanding to operate . Changing the blade and re-tensioning from one hole to the next is fast and easy to do . I like the extra long air hose on the saw ; it does a nice job of keeping the work area clear of dust when cutting and it adjusts easily . This saw also runs very smoothly and quite . If you enjoy doing fret work or making small detail cuts this is the saw to have .	1
Hubby was really happy to get this for his Christmas present . He made me try it and I was really surprised how easy it is to use and I 've already used it on a couple of craft projects . So far , so good .	1
I have owned this saw for a couple months . I have played with it enough to get a feel for it but I have not worked with it enough to be an expert.Strengths:1 ) The cast iron table is nice ( large and smooth ) 2 ) The saw does n't vibrate hardly at all in fact I do n't even have mine mounted yet . I have simply put it on a work bench and the saw stays put.3 ) The saw does make very nice cutsWeaknesses:1 ) It 's heavy for moving ( is also part of its strengths ) 2 ) It seems to be a little underpowered for larger stockOverall it is a nice machine with a fairly hefty price tag .	1
I use this tool weekly and it 's well made as most Dewalt tools are . This saw can be found elsewhere including the stand for less money . A MAJOR FAULT in the design of this tool is when you go to switch blades or reposition the blade whole doing delicate scroll work is that the arm will not stay up and you have to find a 2x4 or something to hold it in the up position ! ! ! I have heard that there is some sort of retrofit available to solve this problem but ca n't find it . Otherwise this is a great tool !	1
I 've had this saw for about 3 months now and I absolutely love it . It 's quite , easy to use and does n't take up much space . As far as additional items , I got the stand , which is great , but the light is worthless ! .	1
This saw was purchased to replaced a Shop Fox 16 inch scroll saw . I did not think that there would be much use for a scroll saw when buying the Shop Fox at a third of the price of the Dewalt . Later I found that the scroll saw was being used far more than expected . Then I began doing intarsia as my skills improved . The Shop Fox is a good tool and served me well , but it does not hold a line as well as a heavier , better made machine like the Dewalt . I have completed several projects on the Dewalt and found the ability to hold to a line to be excellent . The Dewalt , as other higher priced machines , makes blades changes much easier . Even more important , if working a project with many inside cuts , the Dewalt is much faster than the cheaper saws . In addition , the table is very large and the extra 4 inches of throat depth is very nice . The Dewalt table alone feels nearly as heavy as the whole Shop Fox saw . The additional weight of the Dewalt and the use of bearings , versus bushings , on all the moving parts make the Dewalt a smooth running machine . I highly recommend the Dewalt if you do a lot of scroll saw work , or if you want to do very intricate/accurate work .	1
This is a great little saw . It was easy to set up . No vibration and very quiet . Blade changes are super easy	1
My first scroll saw was a cheap delta . It did the job . The 788 is my second . If I had ever used one of the high dollar saws , maybe I would n't be so impressed.I do n't understand the user that had a problem with the light and the hold down . My light mounts on the left and is rock steady ; my blade hold downs are knobs . I `` think '' I installed the light using an allen wrench but that 's the only place . My saw does n't pass the nickel test but that 's only because I have the saw tilted forward on the stand.I too was afraid that the 788 would not live up to its hype ; so far ( 3 months ) I have not been disappointedI have cut copper laminated to piece of 1/4 paneling with no problems or vibration.I think the other reviewer may have had one of the first 788 lemons that I have heard about .	1
This scroll saw is great : - High quality fit and finish- Very easy to assemble : two screws/a couple of minutes and that was all ! - A bit heavy for portability , but that enhances its stability , - Blade installation is just simple with thumb screws ( top and bottom ) , no tool is required , - All user controls - on/off sw , blade tensioner , speed controller - are in the front and & quot ; user friendly & quot ; , - It cuts just smoothly with very little vibration , unlike my Delta 40-540 that needs to be bolted down to a table . ( To be fair , the Delta costs only about 1/3 of the Dewalt . ) Still you want to appreciate the good design and engineering works applied to this saw.The stand I received is in good shape ; it will work but nothing to write home about . Maybe I should have saved the $ 50 and use that to build a rolling cabinet/stand for the nice saw .	1
I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I 'm new to the scroll saw . I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it 's mass . Was I ever right ! ! Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration , but that does n't do it justice ; this saw does n't vibrate . That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me . I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the & quot ; hold down & quot ; . While simple to use , I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece .	1
I had been using a grizzly for years . It was the only scroll saw I ever owned . The dewalt is and excellent saw . Do n't buy a grizzly scroll saw.Red Crane	1
This is a solid stand for my new Dewalt scroll saw . There is no vibration while the scroll is in operation , which really helps when cutting intricate patterns .	1
I received this stand , along with the saw and the light , from another online Tool website for a great price . The saw is great , the stand is great , and the light is junk.This stand is a bit tedious to assemble , but the included drawing helped a bit . The instructions make it very clear they want you to bolt this thing down , but do n't worry it . I suppose someone tipped it over on a dog once , so they added this to the instructions to reduce liability . It is a tripod , so keep the kids from playing monkey-bar with it and you 'll be fine.The instructions also say to keep the stand bolts a bit loose until you set the saw on it . I found this to be wise . It lets the parts all settle in prior to tightening and made for a rock solid platform with no wiggle.This stand really is a nice comfortable design and , had I purchased it separately for the Amazon price - would have been more than pleased .	1
This is not a real heavy duty stand but please consider it is just holding a DeWalt scroll saw . Once it 's all bolted together it is quite ridged and stable . It does what I need it to do .	1
This is a sturdy stand is the best for the fit of the Scroll saw that I purchased . Great find .	1
It 's a solid stand but it has minor problems . The instructions are not detailed at all , some of the parts had to be slightly twisted to fit , it does not include securing screws for the scroll saw but comes with extra short screws . The back height is adjustable but they do n't tell you which hole to make it level . The stand is very solid once put together though	1
It went together easily , it is solid and it fits the scroll saw footprint just right . The narrow back with only one leg makes it easier to maneuver around it in my small work area .	1
this is avery exact stand for the saw . well made , very exact in its fitting together .if only others would do also .	1
Great instructions allow this stand to be put together with few tools and frustration in a short time . The ability to assemble the stand with a built in tilt is great for clearing chips from the saw by gravity as it is in operation . They even supply a few extra pieces of the assembly nuts and bolts in case you loose one of the small easy to loose parts . Far better than having one or two short and not being able to finish the assembly with out a trip to the local hardware store . The tripod design insures all feet will remain flat on the floor at all times . Not too wide so it takes up little floor space in a smaller shop . Light weight and strong , it serves well .	1
I 'm in a wheelchair so I had to cut off about 6 inches of the legs but it was still stable and still sturdy . Matched up with my Dewalt scroll saw perfectly . Easy to assemble . Did it myself . I recommend .	1
This stand works great for the De-Walt scroll saw . It is sturdy and allows you to be able to work around the entire front and side area of the saw . The legs come with welded plates at the bottom so that the stand can be lagged to the floor or a wooden platform . Very well made .	1
Unless you have the perfectly designed work bench , you need this stand for the scroll saw . Right height , right size and sturdy/solid . My wife uses the scroll saw more than I do , but I do n't think there could be anything about this stand not to like .	1
I found that this stand to be very stable for having three legs . I also found it to be easy to sit and work with . With the weaght of the saw it doe ` s not move or is it easy to move if you want it in another area . Over all , I like it and would buy it again .	1
Easy to assemble , however , one bit of advice before installing your DEWALT scroll saw . Loosen all of the top bolts after bolting the stand to the floor . The Scroll Saw is a very tight fit , and it would n't fit in the stand as assembled . I had to loosen all of the top bolts ( many ) and jiggle that heavy saw around before the saw would fit in the stand . This is not a negative , but it would have been nice is Dewalt had included that in the directions . They do insist that you bolt it down to the floor before you put the saw in place . If you do n't do that , it is likely that heavy saw will tip over . Once assembled , bolted to the floor , and the scroll saw installed , it 's a solid fit , with no concern about tipping the stand and saw over .	1
I was not sold on stands because of hiegt and convince but this stsnd has come a long way to making it a favorite	1
This stand is made of fairly sturdy steel and should last for many years . Well packed and came later than the scrollsaw itself . I would have given this item 5 stars but the directions sure could have been better and there are no protectors on the bottom of the legs to keep them from scratching the floor , just holes to bolt them to concrete .	1
Easy to put together , and once the all the bolts are tightened it is solid . Great addition for my DW788	1
Adds the perfect light to the work area of the scroll saw . We need a well lighted area when working intricate patterns on the scroll saw and this does the trick .	1
This is a good price on this light . I have trouble with shadows were I live , so I need the extra help of the light .	1
Great fit and finish , overall it is well made This light serves the purpose well and has an attractive appearance .	1
This is a really nice lite and it really helps to see what you are doing . I think that it should come with the saw for what the saw cost . Not sure if I ` d buy again .	1
it has made a great inprovement on my machine it can realy help on detailed projects given you the ability to shine light where its realy needed with no glare	1
The Dust Hood was exactly what I expected , was packed well and delivered as promised -- Thank you . bogie sends	1
I have two DW733 planers . I bought one new and it came with a plastic hood . Nice because you could just snap it on and off . But it would sometimes fall off from the vibration . I ordered this hood for my 2nd planer which I bought used and did n't come with a hood . Much nicer ! Screws on SOLID and wo n't vibrate off . Ok , so you have to unscrew it to access the knives ... but how often is that done anyways ?	1
The dust hood changes everything on the planer . Were once was a pile of dust and fibers covering half the garage , now there is so few chips you could count them . I hooked the planer up to a 1 1/2horse delta dust collector with a 4 inch line , but my shop vac worked ok as well . Definately a good buy ... . but the mounting is a little shacky with the way the screws go in to the point where you might screw things up if you do it too often . Basically , you have to leave it on , which would n't be bad except that you ca n't close the outfeed extension with the dust hood on . This means that there is not an easy way to transport or store the planer once the hood is mounted . I had to build a stand on wheels after I added the hood which took up alot of space in my small shop .	1
I bought this dust hood to replace the original plastic hood that came with the planer . The screw holes had all enlarged to the point where the screws were not doing anything any more , even with washers . I was pleasantly surprised to find this one is metal and is not going to develop the same problem . Fits perfectly and feels nice and solid .	1
Dewalt dust hood works great on my DW734 . I never had the original plastic one so I have nothing to compare it too , but it keeps my work area completely clean when used with my dust collector . Easy to install with just three screws . Should have been designed to use thumb screws but thats not the dust hoods fault.Worth the money .	1
definitely a *major* improvement over not having one.I remember having a bit of a problem getting the screw holes in the hood to line up with those in the planer , but no hig hammers or powertools were required to overcome this minor hassle.The silliness is that you ca n't flip up the outfeed with the hood mounted , and unmounting the hood each time is n't rational . My planer is mounted under a workbench , and I just left plenty of clear and in the back.I 'd say this ought to be bundled with the planer - which is a great planer by the way - this tool produces *volumes* of chips ! some form of dust or chip collection is a requirement , packaging it separately is just a form of gouging.I 've never noticed any chip compression pitting as described by another reviewer - either with or without the hood . btw . I 'm using a 5.5hp Sears shop vacuum with it .	1
Great miter saw . Lots of capacity and lots of nice features . The tall sliding fence is great , just make sure to slide it out of the way during bevel cuts . The supplied blade is fine for general work but youll want to upgrade if you plan on doing any work requiring a quality cut . This saw is easy to adjust , just read the manual as it tells you how to adjust everything on the saw . Adjusting it took me all of five minutes and has stayed true ever since . My only gripes concern the cost of the accessories . They are ridiculously expensive and should be included considering the price of this saw . I also recomend purchasing this saw at your local home center as DeWalts packaging jobs leaves a lot to be desired . One piece of cardboard is all that secures this big saw inside the box . Other than those minor gripes this is the best 12 '' saw on the market .	1
I owned the C10FS for several months ( it 's a good tool ) but then sold it to buy the DW708 . Here 's why : better capacity , more power , better fence ( try to find a C10FS on a jobsite that still has those cheesy plastic things ) , better guard ( ditto ... most carpenters jam or remove the Hitachi guard ) , accurate , readable and repeatable mitre setting ( try to set 1/4 degrees on the Hitachi ) , a bevel left feature that actually works ( banging my knuckles on that stupid knob thing was the last straw on the C10FS ) , and bevel stops that adjust with a single wrench instead of using a hokey jam nut system . The dust seals on the slide rails are rubber and work better than the felt ones on the Hitachi . The camlock mitre adjust takes a little bit of getting used to but works very well . The only caveat on the DeWalt is the big blade , and that was the original reason I went with the 10 '' Hitachi . I had bought a DW705 ( 12 '' chop box ) when they first came out and still use it to frame , BUT the 12 '' blade deflected way too much for finish work . The solution is to spend the $ $ for the Forrest chopmaster blade ( actually two of them so you can keep them sharp ) as the DeWalt , Freud et al 12 '' blades are a waste of money . Another very worthwhile ( although too much $ $ ) accessory is the quick-release clamp , which switches sides and adjusts VERY quickly .	1
I 've owned this saw for over 3 years now . I use it almost daily , and could n't be happier with this saw . I know it gets expensive , but I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the DW723 miter saw stand . The mounting bracket has a quick disconnect so it 's easy to tear down and throw in the truck . It 's worth every penny ! ! ! Anyway , I own both the DW705S and the DW708 saws . I find that I almost exclusively use the DW708 saw . The table is absolutely flat . I just checked it and after 3 years of constant use it is perfectly flat . No gap . The bearings in the slider work flawlessly . This after cutting uncounted amounts of MDF . I do blow it off with my compressor everyday , just to keep everything clean . Some of the things that stand out on this saw:1 . Color . Sorry but this saw looks nice.2 . Horizontal handle for easy use.3 . The fences are high and easily adjustable.4 . If you are so inclined , the hold down accessory is top notch and goes on and off very easy.5 . Belt drive works great and I 've had no problems . This gets the motor up and out of the way for larger clearances.6 . A lot of people complain about the dust bag . Mine is always full , but dust also goes everywhere . That said I ca n't see a better way to mount the bag . It 's just a fact , on a sliding saw you will have this issue . The bag has to move with the saw.7 . The fixed miter stops . This is a metal plate that is removable . Eventually all saws tend to wear a larger clearance in these areas . The advantage to DeWALT 's design is that theirs is replaceable ! I just replaced mine , and it 's just like new . $ 30 for this item.8 . The blade guard has louvers so you can look right down the blade for an accurate cut . No looking through distorted plastic.I 've built decks with this saw , cutting up to 2x12 's and 6x6 rough cuts . Had to flip those but it worked great . Whether your cutting base board , crown molding or 2x4 's this saw is for you . Remember you always have 30 days to return with no questions asked .	1
I have had this saw for over a year now , but I only used very briefly until about 3 months ago . I had a major remodeling project done in the house and I used saw heavily on cutting Brazilian cherry floor planks , walnut for the trim , and some moldings . I never used other miter saw or sliding compound miter saw before this one . So my review is solely based on using this saw . When I bought it , I wanted the best based on my own research on the subject . So here is my findings from the use of saw and hope it will give you what you looking for in a tool review.The GOOD : Works out of box , no assembly needed.Clean balanced move on the sliding rail ( back and forth ) and head ( push down and let it up ) .Miter adjustment easily and lock down handle works well and tight.Easy to read miter degree marks.Cuts bevel nicely once set . Stock blade works well . Better , smoother result with better blade.Easy to change blade.Very good ergonomics on the handle and switch position.The BAD : Has to be careful with the fence extension when do bevel cutting.Need to take the extension fence off for certain cuts.Hard to read bevel scale.Tape the wrench in its hole or you will need replacement soon.Loud , very noisy loud.Do n't use top handle since it 's out of balance no matter where you secure the rail.The UGLY : The dustport gets nothing but dusty.No dustbag , well , like it works anyway . No support extension.No hold-down clamp. > Do n't take me wrong . I like DeWalt tools even often the times I found they are over priced . I do own their planer , table saw , biscuit jointer , jigsaw . But like any other quality tool maker , there is always room for improvement . This is a high quality saw and I will keep it for a long time .	1
This is a great saw , and they 've improved the dust collection -- my only complaint with an older model . Buying it from Amazon/toolcrib , however , is a nuisance . Trying to get presales support was useless , with conflicting information or tech people just reading me things from the web site . More importantly , the delivery time they gave me was a window of more than two weeks , and it took nearly 3 weeks to get the thing . AND , it arrived BROKEN . Fortunately , Dewalt is sending me a new one , but clearly someone had dropped this saw along the way since the lockdown pin was bent and the handle housing was broken . I bought from amazon only because they had a ( ... ) when I bought the saw , but the price they quoted changed from day to day on the web site .	1
I 've had this saw for over a year now , and can say its a great product . Its a little ( ok , if you listen to my wife a lot ) extravagent for a homeowner to have a $ 600 miter saw , but with a 110 year old house , this one has earned its place in my shop.The saw will cut through most anything with the blade they supplied . It will easily cut 2x4 and 2x6 at any angle or bevel . You can also cut up to 2x10 in one motion at 90 degrees . The angles are easy to change , though the pivot on the back is sometimes hard to read and easily gets blocked by sawdust . The sawdust collection does n't really work , it needs a vacuum attachment or just a clean up after every job . The downside to this saw , IMO , are 2 : high price of accessory items , and no laser guide for cutting . At this price they should include the laser guide ( Sears even does it on a $ 200 saw , so it ca n't be that big of a deal ) . You sort of expect high accessory prices from Dewalt , its just part of the deal.Overall , I 'd buy this again in a minute .	1
As a professional remodeler and contractor , I bought this saw for both frame and finish work . I have not been disappointed and found this to be one of the best saw purchases I have ever made . Do n't know how I managed before without it . Well worth the money I paid on e-bay . This is an excellant companion piece to Dewalts table saw , both of which I use on the job site .	1
I 'll just hit the major points : - Very solidly built . Very stable.- The electric brake is so much more convenient than I expected . You can switch out workpieces within about 2 seconds of a cut . Now my table saw bugs me because it takes so freakin ' long to spin down.- It should have come with at least some worthy accessories . The vertical clamp ( DW7082 ) would be a good choice , IMO.- The dust bag is completely worthless - without a vacuum-assisted dust collection system , sawdust rockets out the back of the machine . Even with a vacuum-assist , you 'll be sweeping up afterwards . If this is really an issue , maybe sawing is n't for you . ( *laugh* ) - The depth-stop system is shady . If you press a little harder than `` last time '' , the saw will bow down a little more . It 's very inconsistent . Do n't depend on it for a `` real '' dado . That said , it is very convenient if ultra-consistent depth is n't important for a given task.- The over-45 degree angle cuts are more a marketing gimmick than really useful - it takes more than trivial adjustments to bring this setup around . And then you have to un-do everything to get the stops back to 45.- When I was researching this saw , I read several complaints about the sliding arm bearings `` shifting '' or being a shaky ( which would result in inconsisent cuts , of course ) . These people obviously do not read manuals . Just adjust the bearings using the tool in the back of the arm . It takes maybe 30 seconds to do a very thorough job of getting the sliding arm very tight ( tolerance ) and exact.- Yellow is a good color for tools.- It comes more-or-less set up . It 's always a little disheartening to open up your new tool to discover a bunch of metal bits and a few baggies of screws . You can make some sawdust within a few minutes of opening the box . It did take some adjustment to get it to where I was ready to *use* it , but nothing major . A minor point , but still pleasing.- The handle being perpendicular to the blade and shifted towards center makes it not only more ergonomic , but also you can cut with either hand.- The fences are very nice - they are tall , very sturdy and stable , and adjust/remove with only one wing-bolt.- Of course the dual-bevel is great ( though , honestly , gratuitous - still , I 'm a fan ) - The cam-action miter base is superb.- The adjusty-tool stores right in the back of the arm . Very convenient.- The included saw blade is mediocre . It 's great for chopping 2x4s or something , but it 's not appropriate for `` pretty '' lumber.So - I really like this saw . If there was a 4.5 star option , I 'd go with it . If it was less or came with accessories ( other than that dust bag ) , I 'd give it 5 .	1
I just took delivery of this saw and matching stand , and I am really impressed with the quality of the product ...	1
I purchased this saw back in 1999 . Since then it 's mostly done decking - cutting 5/4x6 3 at a time and pressure treated 2x10 2 at a time really makes life quick . I 've also done 2x4s 9 at a time ( 3 high and 3 deep ) . The saw never complained once , even on two hundred feet of extension cord . Its also pulled double duty cutting 3 '' aluminum square tubing and 1/2 inch by 6 inch aluminum plate . The saw is a hairy beast . If you 're primarily a framer or do decks , there 's no better saw , period . I did burn out the armature once , but that was sawing through 3 '' steel pipe with an abrasive blade . Not difficult to replace , and I should have picked up a cheap abrasive saw or used my recip saw , but the Dewalt had done everything else I 'd ever asked , and it did get through about 15 of them.The saw does have a softer side , and its reasonably good for finish work and woodworking . Admittedly its a bit overkill for cutting trim . 12 '' finish blades are really pricey , so if I was a cabinetmaker or a finish contractor I 'd get a 10 '' slider . If you only plan to buy one chop saw , and primarily do bigger stuff , this is the one to get .	1
The Dewalt has taken center stage in my basement shop , right across from my table saw . The Dewalt has the most cutting capacity on the market and the double bevel is extremely handy . Sure beats flipping long mouldings around . Bevel cuts are repeatable on both sides of the saw using the positive stops . For bevels greater than 45 degrees , I recommend the old fashion way ; A table saw with a miter gage or a block plane , as this feature on the Dewalt ... No complaints on accuracy.Pros : I Love the cutting capacity of the slider and the tall fence is great , just remember to slide it out of the way on miter cuts . I also like the 15 amp motor , plenty of power . Slides smoothly.Cons : The blade it comes with is a throw away , but I saved it for grunt work . My base is not machined level and I have to wedge shims in the back to prevent the saw from rocking ( It is bolted down ) . The accessories could have come with the saw at this price . It throws sawdust everywhere .	1
Yeah , the DW718 has all the extra little bells and whistles , but I 'd rather keep that extra couple hundred bucks in my pocket ... this is a great miter saw . Amazon should put some extra tape around it though when they ship it . When mine arrived the bottom was opened up , luckily everything was still there and the saw was in excellent condition .	1
I have used this saw for two years now doing fine finish work on multimillion dollar homes at Lake Tahoe . I work on a large crew of woodworkers and we have every saw ever used on the job . I have used them all . What sets the DeWalt apart is the large capacity and ease of use . The saw did need calibration out of the box . There are three nuts to calibrate the 0 , 45 degree left and 45 degree right stops . After some fine adjustments it has been cutting perfect miters for years . The fence was not perfectly square with the blade at first . I calibrated the fence by removing it and filing the bolt holes to slot them a little with a rat tail file . Since the first calibration it has performed flawlessly . The dust collection is make believe.Compared to the other saws in its class the Hitachi is nice but the dinky table and fence is the same as the old 8.25 & quot ; saw and very inadequate . The bevel adjustment on the makitas has you bumping it hard to release it . The plastic lever for the bevel on the makita is flimsy and could break . The Makita has the nicest smoothest feel and spring action though . A decent table too.Some reveiwers whined that the DeWalt saw could not cut square . They are the same people that leave the VCR time display blinking for years . They never bothered to read the instructions for calibration.I owned a Milwawkee for a day or two . It did n't bevel both ways and the arbor was wobbly out of the box causing the blade to cut a wider kerf.Back to the Dewalt , little extras like a guard that really works , the high fence , the vernier scale and the slots in the guard to see the cut are very nice and well thought out . Guards on the other saws are see through plastic that quickly become opaque . You then have to bend over to see the blade on the mark . Some remove the guard alltogether after years of constant bending over . The reviewer that could n't tighten the bevel on the DeWalt so it would n't move must have very very weak hands . This is not a problem for the rest of us.The hold down clamp is the best design among all the saws . There is a quick release that makes the clamp much faster to use than all the others . It cost thirty bucks extra though .	1
I had this saw for about 6 years and never had a problem with it . Powerful , easy to use . I recommend it .	1
I rushed to buy this dewalt saw when I saw that just above $ 250 . Didnt read reviews or anything . Too bad it was a mistake . Was not surprised when Amazon notified me . Love Amazon tool section	1
This is a fine saw . It has been an acurate work horse since i bought it six months ago . The standard blade was ok but required upgrading for fine trim and furniture work.This this is BIG . It 's not especially heavy , just big . It takes up much more room that a standard miter saw . The sliding mechanism is the primary culprit . The old saw stand in my shop , is now a laundry cabinet in the basement . I had to build an all new , BIGGER , cabinet.It takes up about as much space as a Radial Arm Saw . It costs more than than a RAS.I not unhappy with the performance at all . It does require the new cabinet for cutting large stock . The stability on heavy wide stock as demands the unit be anchored well too.Make sure you need a sliding miter . You may be better off with a RAS and a standard miter saw .	1
I am very pleased with this saw . Let me clarify a few things:1 ) This is my first mitre saw so I ca n't compare it to any other models ; 2 ) I am not a machinist or tool and die maker so I ca n't comment on whether the base and/or fence is perfectly flat as noted by some other reviewers . Both the base and fence seem flat to me.I found the saw very easy to set up and use . So far I have used it to cut some molding as well as some pine boards . Great results and no complaints.As noted by some other reviewers , this saw makes a lot of dust even with the dust bag attached . I borrowed a vaccuum adaptor from my hand planer and now attach my shop-vac to the mitre saw . Still some dust but that is what I expect when I am sawing through wood ! The price does hurt but I am hopeful that I wo n't ever buy another a mitre saw	1
I 'm not a tool expert , but I do use this saw quite a bit . It is powerful , flexible , accurate and easy to use . I also use the DeWalt DW730 Heavy Duty Miter Saw Workstation , which I would consider an essential accessory unless you plan to permanently mount this saw .	1
I have owned and used this saw daily for 3 years and I have never been disappointed . It was specifically purchased for the construction of a 12 ' x 17 ' storage shed and was used to cut everything from 2 x 4 's and window trim right up to a laminated 4 x 12 beam . Mitre cuts , cross cuts and compound mitres in all materials is a breeze , but invest in the proper blades for the job and keep them sharp ( goes without saying but I never cease to be amazed ) .My saw is used primarily in a shop environment and mainly as a replacement for a radial arm saw ( cross-cuts 8/4 hard maple like a hot knife through soft butter ) , honestly I can not imagine working without it . I had heard from other trades that the saw & quot ; goes out of adjustment frequently & quot ; and I must admit I have had this problem on job sites . The primary issue is the saws weight and awkwardness in moving it around . The four screws used to secure the adjustable platen to the saw base do loosen up with use and just picking this Mother up can effect the saws precision . The good news is it 's not a major ordeal to re-set the alignment and a little bit of lock-tite prevents the set screws from wiggling loose . Although the saw can be placed on a work-mate ( barely ) , I would recommend the DeWalt stand ( the adjustable material supports alone make it worth the money ) . And if DeWalt would just put adjustable legs or feet on this stand it would be a perfect solution both in the shop and on-site . Yes the saw throws dust everywhere ( which is more of a problem in a client 's house than in the shop or outside ) , but a vacuum hook-up greatly helps and in reality every mitre saw does the same.Do n't be intimidated by the price or the size of the saw and use care when moving it around , you will not regret making this purchase . Highly recommended .	1
This is my fourth compound miter saw and my third sliding compound miter saw . This saw allows piece of mind . You basically know that this saw will cut whatever stock you have , within reason . This is a very good tool , it is thoughtfully designed and has some real advantages and falls slightly short in only a couple of areas . The BOSCH 3915 ( 10 & quot ; SCM ) is a fine tool , but only bevels one way , its toggle clamps are quick and easy to engage ( more so than the DeWalt vertical clamps , which are still effective ) .I prefer the cast in angle markers on the BOSCH over the DeWalts painted on gauge or Hitachi 's C10fs which are too hard to read because they are painted the same seafoam green as the base and they are too small . The detents on the BOSCH are superb , the DeWalt 's are also very good , and the Hitachi 's are not as plentiful or crisp . The cam action lock down on the DeWalt is great , but the BOSCH 's screw type works very well because of its large knob , much easier than the smaller Hitachi 's . Regarding the cam lock on the DeWalt , I was really impressed how well it locks down even a degree or less next to a major detent . The adjustable fences on the Dewalt are superior to the Bosch 's which only one side moves , and the Hitachi 's are too short to be very useful . For the most part the BOSCH has a very nice base , but the direct drive motor and mount is fairly old technology . The Hitachi is a nice and fairly compact saw with a great motor , very smooth start up , but the base needs updating . The DeWalt is a great compromise . It does not fall way short in any category that I can see based on owning the other two saws mentioned . The accessories not being included is a little disappointing , I believe that for the price of this saw DeWalt could atleast include the dust bag . Generally speaking though , I believe this saw is woth every nickel when you consider the other saws are very good , but have distinct shortcomings , the DeWalt really does not in my opinion . I have mounted this saw on a mobile custom cart with locking wheels and storage beneath , I mounted the the Rousseau extensions and stop system on my cart and it is extremely solid and useful . So far , although not perfect - this saw is the best of the current choices . Hope this review helped you .	1
Well folks this saw is the best I have ever owned . I chose this one over the nonsliding variant soley for versatility . I can bounce from framing to trim with no extra work beyond flipping the crown stops .The stock 60 tooth blade is adequate for most work but for delicate ornate trim I use a series 40 ( 96 tooth blade ) . I have had my saw for about 3 months and I love not doing the old `` upside down and backwards `` technique .If anyone wants to see some pics , ask and I 'll email you asap.I have used it on wood , poly , and foam crown with great results .

Love it , love it , love it . DeWalt really thought this one through . Form the smooth belt drive to the cam lock table . I can not find fault with this saw . It has absolutely the largest capacity of any SCM saw on the market . It is the only one with such a huge fence to support your material . If you need to bevel cut , just turn the knob , and it slides out of the way . No one else gives you that option . ( If Makita did , I would be more inclined to go that direction , since their LS1211 is such a sweet saw , even more refined than the DeWalt . ) The cam lock table is a very nice improvement over a screw knob design.The whole saw is very easy to adjust if it gets knocked out of whack by careless workers . It is however pretty heavy to lug around , so I mounted mine on a Trojan Miter saw stand . Now I roll it around instead . It sets up in less than 2 minutes.If you need the capacity , you ca n't go wrong with this saw . If you do n't , consider the DW705 .	1
Bought the DW708 at least 12 years ago for home remodeling and woodworking . It has yet to fail me . The remodeling project was a some 1300 sq ft game room . I have moved more into working ( small furniture ) and still love it . Just recently the electric brake was intermittent , and I went back to the manual . Just needed to pull the brushes and vacuum , and it 's fine again . I would like to see a better workpiece stop design for multiple cuts . It 's kind of clunky and hard to set to an exact length . It 's a trial and error process , and you need to keep checking the wing nuts to make sure nothing loosened on the attachment .	1
This Dewalt DW7080 Extension system fit my Dewalt miter saw exactly . It is well made and very strong and works great .	1
This product was a fine addition to my Dewalt compound miter saw . It allowed me to securely place eight foot lengths of crown molding on the cutting table . Amazon shipped mine without the end retaining bolt , but I was in too much of a rush with my project to raise concerns . Besides , not having that bolt did not affect the product 's performance . Once again , this was a great addition to my saw.Update : This product sucks ! It worked well with flimsy MDF crown molding , but is an absolute waste of time with any real wood . No amount of adjustment will make it support my hardwood projects square against the fence . Save your money and build your own fence and table extension .	1
I recently purchased the Dewalt DW318 SCMS and ordered this clamp at the same time . I was disappointed when I compared the clamp that came with the saw with this one . The stock clamp has a smaller knob on the top for tightening against the work piece , and only the DW7082 has the quick release button to quickly raise or lower it . The stock clamp does have a bolt on the back of the arm that can lower it on the leg , but the fence of the saw only allows 1/4 '' of play unless it 's slid out of the way . Originally I only ordered one DW7082 clamp knowing that the saw would already come with a clamp , but after comparing the two side by side , I ordered a second DW7082 and put the stock clamp aside . To invest in the saw and not have accessories that perform the way I want them does n't make sense to me .	1
I have owned the DeWalt vertical clamp for about a year now , and it works well on my DW703 compound miter saw . It is a bit large and clunky , and your finger can get slightly pinched by the release button , but the clamp is solidly built and holds tight every time . If there is a fault , it 's with the miter saw itself . The holes for the clamp post in the saw 's base could be placed better , and the saw was n't designed with other clamping methods in mind . In many instances , the DeWalt clamp is the only possible way to hold the work piece in place .	1
This clamp is incredibly easy to use . The quick release is awesome . It is very easy to insert and remove . I like it so much , I had to get a second one .	1
I bought this with the saw several years ago . I use the saw and clamp on a real regular basis . The clamp installs on either side of the saw with a simple twist and is very secure when used to clamp down a piece of wood . I had forgotten that this did n't come with the saw .	1
I 'm a residential contractor . I bought one with my original SCMS purchase over a year ago . Ever since wished I had a second one ... so I finally did it . Now I wo n't have to switch the one around ( I usually like it on the intake ) , and also I can hold both sides of my work at once when I need.It is well made and easy to use . And it is a great help when cutting hardwood or AZEK , both of which tend to move spontaneously while cutting .	1
I ended up getting a pair and they are very good quality ! The push button quick adjust works great and I really use these clamps alot . I highly recommend them ! No regrets !	1
If you are using this saw without clamps to hold what you are cutting , STOP RIGHT NOW if you value your fingers.Get one of two of these clamps ! They are simple , well made and make your saw much safer . They can be mounted to the saw in a second , and can quickly and securely hold what you are working on . They have a quick release button and a micrometer type fine adjustment for tension . They swing out of the way easily when you do n't need them . The rubber foot to hold the work piece is nice and big.Expensive ? You Bet ! Overpriced ? Absolutely ! But then again , you have to ask yourself how much your fingers are worth to you !	1
As several other reviews have said - definitely a good idea - Of the various accessories for the DW708 , the one I think should have been included with the saw ( or at least priced more reasonably ) . If it was ... I 'd give it 5 stars . Sturdy construction , particularly considering it 's an offshore-built product . It is a bit wobbly until you clamp it down on the workpiece , but that 's forgiven due to the ease of removal ( for switching sides , removing for steep beveling , etc ) .	1
I need ( want ) another one . It gets in the way on the right side of the saw ( 715 ) . The motor is really in the way for use on the right . I use it 90 % on the left - I cut my waste from the right . But I only use it about 50 % of the time - lazy . No complaints about the function . Pricy - but so is a visit to the ER .	1
Just added this clamp to my new Dewalt DW718 sliding miter saw . This saw did come with one clamp but I decided that I better have another one for the other side of my material I would be cutting for safety measures . It would have been nice if Dewalt would have included this clamp instead of the one that came with the DW718 but I am sure to keep costs down we are lucky to even get one material hold down clamp . This DW7082 clamp is way better than the one that comes with the saw and is more heavy duty with a quick take-up button that saves a lot of time screwing the threaded rod to tighten the clamp . It would be nice to have both clamps like this one but I ca n't justify buying another DW7082 clamp seeing as now I have one for each side of the blade . This DW7082 material hold down clamp will now become my primary clamp though and the one that came with the saw will only be used when I think two clamps are really necessary .	1
The clamp works well , but I thought it was pricey even when I bought it at $ 28 and now its $ 74 . I doublt I would buy again at that price .	1
Keeps your fingers outr of the way when cutting a LONG or tiny piece of molding.I wound up forgetting to use it half the time but still a great product/accessory	1
The clamp worked just like a clamp should . It is very easy to set up and move to and from either side of the saw . The only fault is that it would be nice if it were just a little bit taller so that it would be easier to swing out of the way over the fence without having to move the fence .	1
This is a well machined product , excellent fit for saw ( DW716 ) and well worth the price ! Clamps down very nicely and swings out of the way when not needed . Would recommend to all woodworkers .	1
After obtaining the DW712 8.5 '' SCMS from Amazon , found this DW7082 material clamp ( now part # 153650-00 ) listed on servicenet.DeWalt.com . Purchased and found it to be very solid and strong in holding power . With the quick release button , setting the height is very fast . This is the best clamp I 've used ( have owned 4-different brand sliders ) , but also one of the more expensive hold downs ( reason for only 4 stars ) !	1
I have used it a little but find it slows me down , so I only use it when I really need the clamp .	1
My instructor from a woodworking class introduced this clamp to me . We used them in our class . Later I bought a pair from Amazon . I used them on my slide compound miter saw . They are working beautifully and the best feature is that they are very easy to release . There is another one which is lighter duty . In my view , why do n't I just buy a better pair ?	1
As stated by most , the clamp works very well . It 's also on the high side price wise . Dewalt should give a discount for buying 2 . 5 stars for functionality , 4 for the price.Update . I used it so much I purchased another and use both on longer pieces .	1
The clamp is heavy duty , large and solid . The first couple of times I tried to install the clamp , it would n't fit all the way into the hole . Turns out , there was some slag in the saw from when it was made . I broke that out using a bolt and a hammer , then it worked great !	1
If your reading this you discovered that your Dewalt came without a clamp . This is the mother of all clamps . Heavy duty is the word I would use . Fits perfectly in the oversize hole in your Mitre saw . Reaches over the oversize fence on your mitre saw as well . I tried to find any other manufacturer clamp to use as a substitute but no this is it for Dewalt . You 'have to ' buy this one if you want a clamp . You either return the saw or give up and pay the ridiculous price . Is it a $ 80 part . No . Its more like a $ 40 part . Do you have a choice no . Do you need 2 ? I do n't think so . Its massive . Has a quick release on the screw down . Good size knob you can work wearing gloves . Does all this make up for the price . No .	1
I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke ... ... ... .until I used em ' ! I do n't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance . I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do . Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in ... ..I too wish they had a quick release . Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown . If that situation arises for me I think I 'll give it a try .	1
I ca n't believe it took me so long to find and use these . makes crown molding so easy . My wife actually does all the cutting now , that is how easy it is . Connects to the dewalt saw seamlessly .	1
The advertisement was just what I recieved.The price was in line of all sources I reviewed.Have n't used them yet but planning too soon.Yes I would refer this item to anyone .	1
I have a dewalt 716 . Stops work great on the saw . I have not tried them on 6inch crown though . ****Edit -- - I have a correction . I have a dewalt 780 too . I assumed these stops worked on it because it had holes in the same place as the 716 did to accept the stops ... .but the holes are to BIG ! These do NOT fit the 780 !	1
This is the only way to go if you want quick tight miters on crown . The best way to set them is to use a scrap block cut to the size of the projection of the crown at the ceiling . Tighten each stop against the block and the cut will always be right .	1
Yes , there is a way to cut crown molding that is laying flat , but this makes things so much easier . Not to mention , more accurate . These clamps are excellent quality , and as long as you keep their distance set precisely , your inside and outside angles , and butt joints , will look good .	1
Before using these , I eye-balled the crown angle during cuts and many times , the corners did n't quite line up right . With these crown stops , all cuts are made at the same angle so the corners fit perfectly . No more gaps ! I use this with the DW715 saw and the stops just screw right into the base of the saw . Super easy !	1
I am not a pro , just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting , you could definitely do without these stops , but you would have to spend more time . They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw . If you put a secondary wood platform on the table , you may have issues . I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO , since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed . They attach easily , are super sturdy and simple . If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw , just get them if you are doing CM .	1
Crown stops do their job , work well . It does n't seem like you can use them for anything more than 5 & # 34 ; or so , may be something to check out before you buy them . But for what I used them for , works good , tightens down into place on Dewalt saw nicely .	1
I really like these and while although some folks say they are just stamped steel and can be made in a third world country..they are very heavy duty and work quite well when set up properly..if I had to make one change on them , I would add Teflon strips to the faces of them..sliding a stained crown back and forth while adjusting the cut can scratch the crown , so I used black electrical tape..it worked fine then . I will get some Teflon tape and add it later	1
Simple to install and remove . Lay the crown on the saw upside down and adjust these in or out to set the exact spring angle . Once set you can fly through your project .	1
Stops work fine for cutting crown molding so you do n't have to cope inside corners . The stops fit fine but are over-priced .	1
The Crown Stops work great and are easy to adjust and store . They make cutting crown fast and accurate .	1
If you are doing crown molding , you need these stops . They attach very easily to the miter saw and do their job . Makes work much easier and safer .	1
Pro - Works as expected.Cons - Have to completely unthread to remove it doing a different cut ( not crown ) , should be quick connect . Should come with the saw and have a clip on space to keep them between uses .	1
My wife wants crown molding in the dining room . Someday I will have to install it , and I am ready when I am no longer able to push it any further into the future .	1
I have these on my DW708 and the really help . HOWEVER they arent long enough for really large crown and I would like them to incorperate a quick release device . This would prevent time consuming removal when switching to different materials .Beyond this they are very nice .	1
These stops made my job a lot easier when cutting crown molding . Saved a lot time and money . This is a must have when cutting crown molding .	1
Bought these in March 2010 and DeWalt has definitely beefed them up . They 're now heavy duty steel stops that weigh over 2-lbs . Worth having and worth the money now .	1
Yes , just as they claimed . This dust bag is just like the one it replaced .	1
The original one that came with my saw had a hole in the bag so I ordered this and it 's great , I no longer have sawdust flying around and the price was much better than home depot	1
This little bag does a great job catching the sawdust so your work area says cleaner . Glad I found this . Does n't hold a lot but for indoor trim work works great	1
I 've owned this saw for a couple of years now and really like this thing . I frequently use it to cut stucco and cement . I am always amazed at how fast I can cut through cement with this saw . I just finished building a deck and I had to cut 2 ' x 2 ' holes in the patio . It cut like butter . No bogging down . The only thing that slowed it down was the hot warped blade because this thing cut so fast . I find that I like the rafter hanger that you can flip out . It 's handy to have a way to hang your saw and not have to hang it from your cord . You ca n't go wrong with this saw.Update : It 's been another 1 1/2 years and this saw still works great . I still find that I need a regular circular saw though . The torque on this saw is so strong that it will really twist in your hand when you pull the trigger . I prefer to use the circular saw on precision work , like doors . But that 's the nature of a worm saw . Nothing slows this saw down . It 's durable too . I 'm hard on my tools . This has met the task .	1
Took this saw to the jobsite and all others were forgotten . More powerful than Porter-Cables and others . Slices multiple sheets of OSB . Love the saw hook . Owned this saw fo 5 years without a problem . Make sure you get the gear oil changed every year .	1
there are many great features about this saw : the low blade guard so you can cut shims from 2x stock , the 50 degree bevel ( which the the mag77 skilsaw does not have ) is essential for roof framing , cutting hips especially , it 's light-weight so it wont wear your arm out all day , it has a saw hook to keep the saw close by on the rafters or out of the mud on the ground , it also has plenty of power and has never bogged down , even in wet pressure-treated or epay ( dense , tropical hardwood ) . i bought it for the 50 degree bevel and the other features were just a bonus . i love this saw and i am happy every day i use it.just a quick note to all you skilsaw lovers : this saw is a hypoid saw , like the makita . it has an off-set gearing system to deliver an awesome amount of power ( torque ) , but it 's not a worm-drive . bosch now owns the skil company and their worm-drive saw has the same worm-drive motor as the skilsaw and has more features than the skil mag77 . my friend prefers the makita hypoid because it has an xtra gearing system that allows it to start slow without jerking the saw on start-up like every other saw . it 's heavy though . i prefer to use my dewalt over the makita and the mag77 . i have n't used the bosch yet , but i always hear great things from the people who do . any of the above saws will give you tons of testosterone satisfaction and get the job done right the first time , but i still prefer my dewalt.TOOLS OF THE TRADE awarded this saw as their best saw in 1999 , which is why i originally purchased it . they reviewed saws again , in their SEPT 2005 issue . IT WON AGAIN ! that 's a real testament to me , only far superior tools win their prestigious award . a close second was the bosch wormdrive .	1
I always like to try new tools . When I got my new DeWalt framing saw , I loved the weight advantage it had over my old Skil wormdrive . It 's not much lighter than my newer Mag 77 . The balance is different though . It took some getting used to . The rafter hook is just one plus I have come to love . I miss it when I 'm using one of my Skilsaws.The extra power is a nice touch if you 're ripping with a dull blade . An excellent tool overall . Why do I find myself still reaching for my Mag 77 ?	1
I am a Framing contractor and have owned four of these saws . They are light-wieght , comfortable and come with a great rafter hook . The only drawback is that I do n't feel they are quite as durable as my skill saws . That said , I will still keep purchasing the DeWalt , simply because I like the feel . I give it four stars , maybe four and a half .	1
I purchased this saw because I was building a 600 sq ft deck and really needed something that would work well . What a great investment this was . I ca n't begin to tell you how many pieces of wood we had to cut and the saw did it with ease . I am extremely happy with the results and very happy that I followed the reviews of others before I purchased the saw . Even after completing the deck , I still do n't even have to change the blade . I also purchased the reciprocating saw from DeWalt which also worked great . You get what you pay for and it 's worth every penny , especially when you do n't have tax or delivery .	1
I 'm not a pro , so was a little leery about the price on this saw . Like others have said , though , it was love at first sight ( or first feel ) when I picked it up for the first time . It just feels good in the hand , fairly heavy , but with a nice balance . And when I first tried the depth adjustment mechanism , that about sealed the deal for me - set the depth you want without hardly moving your hands ! I also highly recommend the electric brake . In fact that was the main reason I was looking for a saw - my old skilsaw would spin for almost ever after cutting - which made me nervous . Now I 'm used to the brake and would n't have a saw without it . In fact , once in a while the brake will fail to engage ( I think if I let go of the trigger too slow or something ) and it kind of bugs me ; I 'll usually flip it on again to get it to work.Incidently , the brake is n't designed to be like a brake in a chainsaw ( instantaneous stop ) since it still takes a couple of seconds before the blade stop . It does add to safety , however , compared to a free-spinning model.The saw seems to have good power - I think nothing of ripping full lenth 2-inch stock and it does n't seem to phase it , just keeps piling up the dust .	1
This is my second Dewalt saw , I sold the first when I moved . I like it because it is heavy and cuts straight . I tried the Makita , which is lighter , and also a good saw , but prefer the Dewalt . The new depth adjustment is as good as they say and right at your fingertips .	1
Bought this saw because of its easy adjustment features and solid plate . Have not been disappointed and now everyone on the job wants to use it . Ca n't go wrong with this saw .	1
Well I had this saw for 10 years now and I love it . The flat alum base doesnt scratch the work and the adjustment works well . I 've used this saw on a plywood base like a tablesaw and it preformed well . The electric brake continues to work , it 's a nice safety feature . It is a professional quality saw and I would buy this saw again .	1
I have logged hundreds of hours with this saw in my hand and it never failed me . It cuts as strong now as it did when I first bought it - a good ten years ago . I previously had a couple of Craftsmans & and an old Skil but I just gave them away after getting this . I 've used saws costing twice as much and I still prefer this old yellow friend . She is easy to hold , feels great in your hand and sold while cutting.Of the thousands and thousands of dollars I 've spent on tools , this was the best $ 150 I ever spent . I usually spring for more money than I need , but I 'm sure glad I did n't in this case.My youngest son just bought a house and is in need of some tools ( not mine ) . He 's getting one as a gift .	1
A very nice saw . Very heavy ( which I take to be a good thing ) and I went for this model because it has the electric brake ( did n't like the idea of standing there forever waiting for the blade to slow down . The handle sits nicely in my hand and all in all I 'm very pleased with it . I bought a better blade so ca n't comment on the blade it comes with ( actually I have used that one once when I was ripping out a piece of old subfloor and was worried about hitting nails with my good blade - it worked fine ) .	1
Update 8/19/07 - I have recently discovered that there is a fence/shoe adjustment that allows you to precisely align the blade and shoe for all of your speed square cuts . To my knowledge - this feature is not available on any other saw.Several years ago I had a chance to use a friend 's Dewalt DW364 . It was so amazing that I hoped my venerable Makita 8 1/4 '' contractor saw would die . The Makita is still running strong ( it 's 22 years old ) but I finally bought a DW364 anyway.This saw was not designed for the homeowner but for the professional carpenter.It will be too heavy for the casual board cutter and the great design features will only be apparent to skilled pro's.Circular saws have been built following the same basic design for years . Expensive circular saws had strong , durable motors and heavy duty fences while the cheapies had poor fences and poor motors . The depth and angle adjustments in either group were at best a suggestion of precision.Dewalt to their credit decided to build a better saw and succeeded masterfully . The other saw manufacturers are still doing things the same old way.What 's great - Heavy duty fence , clear view of the cut point from the left hand side of the saw , notch to position power cord so it is out of the way on rips , clear and precise depth and angle adjustment , unbelievably smooth and powerful motor.What 's not - it 's heavy yet it 's mass makes it stable , although not as stable as a worm drive.Caslo	1
Well , I have yet to buy a DeWalt tool that I have n't been happy with , and this saw is no exception . This saw makes consistent cuts and has a ton of great features . I would make two suggestions when buying it that some people may overlook : First , I would buy a quality blade for use with your intended projects rather than the one included ( it cuts , but as with most blades included with saws , probably is n't going to satisfy your needs ) Second , I would strongly suggest picking up the optional rip fence ( DW3278 ) . You can usually find it up for around $ 10.00 , and it makes long straight cuts infinitely easier . Definitely a good investment ! Nevertheless , I am extremely happy with this saw . THe only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the included accessories ( and lack of an included rip fence ) .	1
I am very pleased with this saw . My brother owns one and I decided to stop borrowing his and purchase my own . I love it . I only wish I would have purchased it sooner .	1
I am normally a Craftsman tool man but lost my last Craftsman Circular Saw to a shop fire . This is my first DeWalt Circular Saw and I am impressed . It has everything my Craftsman had except a lazer guide . It is considerably lighter than my Craftsman . It also has an extra long cord which helps me . I recommend this DeWalt Circular Saw to anyone needing a good dependable saw and will probably be buying more DeWalt products in the near future . JJF	1
The downside is that it is quite heavy , though that can be a advantage to keeping the saw stable when starting a cut . The aluminum base seems very rigid and gives confidence on keeping the cut on course . Nice hard case with space for a few additional blades though you have to be careful stowing the cord to keep it away from the blade . Hard case is much better than the bags supplied with my other DeWalt purchases . Warning - no fence is included - you have to buy the over-priced $ 20 DW3278 fence separately .	1
this is my 2nd one of these saws . the first one lasted 10 plus years . a work horse for sure	1
The DeWalt 364K 7 1/2 inch saw is replacing a DeWalt 369 model that I had for the last ten years so , I expect the same service life . I built a house with the model 369 , dropped it from the rafters onto a concrete slab three times ; never bothered the operational abilities . Now , I 'm building a large wooden boat and wanted to treat myself to a new saw that had more options ; like adjusting the blade depth and angle . I located both the same old model and Model 364K on amazon . Model 364K costs about forty dollars more , but what a difference in the power to cut through wood , ease of changing blades , and of adjusting the bevel angle and depth of cut . I also like the heavier duty electric cord . If the saw lasts for ten years , I 'll be very satisfied.And when I think of the time I saved by not needing to huff to the home improvement stores and shop , I 'm happier.The saw arrived well bundled , and like I said , I 'm VERY SATISFIED .	1
WOW ! ! ! I WAS WAITING FOR IT THINKING THAT IT WOULD BE AS MY OLD SAW BUT IT IS SIMPLY GREAT ; AND THE PACKAGE HELP ME TO KEEP MY TOOL IN GREAT CONDITIONS .	1
After doing a ton of research , I decided to go with this circular saw . Paid a little more to get the one with the case , but well worth it . The saw cuts extremely well and glides through even the most dense wood . It is very heavy for a circular saw , but makes up for it with its power .	1
I 've seen and used a lot of these types of saws but have never expected this to look and work and feel anything like this one , i 'm extremely impressed with this saw and count the minutes till i need to use it again ! P.s This saw looks way more professional grade then the price tag suggests !	1
For those who owned a legendary SAWCAT decades ago , this is your near-direct replacement but in a Dewalt-yellow body.We accidently dropped our SAWCAT from an 8 ' ladder and lamented its loss - its alignment was never the same even after replacing the solid aluminum base plate . Black and Decker is n't the company it once was and the USA made Sawcat is no longer available from B & D ; but this saw lives on via Dewalt - same saw but in a Dewalt body.Tried alert Amazon of a significantly lower price for several days and get them to better/match the lower price that included free ( zero ) shipping on this exact same saw with carry case - from a large box home improvement center 's website - but Amazon apparently would not do drop their price . So we were forced to vote with our wallet and purchase there . We like Amazon and Amazon Prime but they clearly dropped the ball here ... This is a GREAT saw , The blade brake is a must-have feature , stops blade rotation in ~2 seconds . This saw is n't the lightest one on the market but it had topped the best saw list for years , and it 's expecially great for left-handed craftaman - unlike the worm drive saws favored by right-hamders ( that offer left-side cutting area views ) . It 's truly a heavy duty design and had Dewalt parts support to keep it going for decades are there .	1
I bought another one of these to replace one that was stolen . It 's bulletproof , dead accurate , and really really hard to break .	1
This saw is a little high priced , but it is the only one I found that you can actually adjust the blade parallel to the shoe . It works quite well after adjusting the blade to the shoe , it is almost effortless to make your cut straight . I would highly recommend it if you want to make very straight cuts with a guide .	1
I love this saw . It is a little heavy but I know it is well made , you must get the rip fence make straight cuts so easy . Buy this saw	1
Way back in '89 I destroyed a worm gear drive saw . I replaced it with a major brand , big discount store , consumer grade saw , , , then 2 more . Finally I realized that I had spent as much as a nice commercial grade saw would have cost , in just 4 years ! ! So I began studying and researching and found this saw . I never did like the way that the worm drive saw would torque to the side when I pulled the trigger . The saw was n't hard to control after the initial start-up but that sideways jump annoyed me . So I did n't even consider another worm drive saw . This saw looked rugged enough and the base plate was precisely adjustable for paralell to the blade . I was sold . It self destructed in '04.I did a short overview of what was available and still could n't find anything I liked better , ,so , in '04 I bought another one . This time though the saw has been upgraded to 15 amps from the previous 13 amps , and I could n't be happier . 10 or 11 years from now if this one goes out again , I 'll buy another one gladly . The smoothest running , straightest cutting , easiest to control saw I 've ever seen has no competition . Well , , , maybe the 8 1/4 inch version of the same saw .	1
I have had this Jig Saw for Almost 3 years now . I do n't use it daily , but it does get more than its fair share of abuse . To this day , any problems with it have been due to my inexperience.One thing to keep in mind with any saw is having the right blade for the job . Ask your local home improvement expert which type of blade is right for your project . When I first used the saw , I was using an all purpose blade to do everything . After experimenting with a few different types on differend stock , I learned just how much difference they make.For me , this saw has worked great on everything from from countertops to crafts and beyond . It is more than powerful enough for a casual woodworker like myself .	1
After owning a couple of inexpensive 'Made in China ' jig saws , and recognizing their shortcomings , which included dropping the blade while the saw was in mid-cut and a laser line that was n't straight , I purchased the Dewalt 321K jig saw . In short , this is a really nice , no frills , jig saw . Other reviews I read stated the shank was n't straight ( about 10 degrees out of alignment ) , but my saw does n't suffer from this problem . The operation is quiet and the action is extremely smooth . The angle of cut and speed is adjustable . Visibility of the blade/cutting area is excellent . The t-shank blades are very easy to change and stay locked in place . I 've owned this saw for about a year during which time I 've used it to cut everything from laminate flooring to 1/4 '' diamond plate steel . It handled these materials with ease and never felt underpowered . Of course , using the appropriate high-quality blade for the material being cut is as important as an adequately powered jig saw . I 'm pleased with this jig saw from Dewalt and recommend it to others .	1
I 've had my 321 for a few years now and yes there are some problems with it . To me they are not that bad though . The first problem is that some blades do n't seat tightly . I 've had some that will come loose once or twice , but i just tighten them up a little bit more and that solves the problem . And it does not take 20 - 30 minutes to change the blade some reviews have said , more like 20 - 30 seconds . The second problem is the dust blower on the saw . Do n't get me wrong ; it blows air pretty good , just not where you want it . Most of the jigsaws I have used have the same problem . Other than those problems , I think it 's a pretty good jigsaw . It 's powerful and cut 's nicely . It will use almost any blade and cut 's straight and clean	1
This tool has the same amps and power as Bosch and Milwaukee jigsaws but with more features . And since jigsaws are used , by me anyway , almost exclusively for curved and angled cuts , it is nice to have these extra features . If they break I do n't care , they make work faster and more pleasurable . And since all the moving parts are metal , I 'm not too worried about that happening.Universal shank blades have never popped out on me . It can also use T-blades , but I do n't . I 've cut curves in 3/4 '' plywood , 3/4 '' solid oak , and curves in 3/4 '' granite with this . The slower speed settings are good for when you have a diamond coated blade and do n't want it to overheat and have the diamonds melted off . Higher speed settings are good for sawing through plastics and metals.The blower keeps your pencil-guide line clean so you can follow a curve without stopping to blow dust off . The blower force can be turned up and down , and is powerful.I cut a 5ft diameter circle table from fur-wood flooring in a single circular cut today . The blade did n't eject and it was n't crooked . And thanks to the blower I did n't have to stop a single time , it was a single cut.You can rotate the base on a horizontal pivot like a circular saw , and you can increase the orbital action of the blade for a more aggressive cut in thinner materials.Bits can be changed with a spring action lever right above the blade , which can be done even with gloves on ( but unplug the tool first ) .All of these features have worked flawlessly for me in both light duty and heavy duty applications . Other reviewers I think must be used to old style jigsaws that have only a VSR trigger rather than a dial , a pivot base , no blower , and no other features . And jigsaws like that are fine , especially the ones made by Bosch and Milwaukee , but I like the features on this.I got mine for $ 70 new from Murdochs , a farm & ranch chain in the Midwest.Dewalts are made in mexico . Their corporate headquarters is in the U.S .	1
This is the third finishing sander I 've owned ( I got it free when I bought my compound miter saw ) and of the three its the best in terms of sanding quality and noise . However , I 'd go with a random orbit sander to get better quality.My biggest complaint is that the dust attachment ( DW4111 ) comes separately ( and is not carried by very many suppliers , including Amazon ) . The dust bag that comes with their random orbit sander pulls apart and fits a standard 2 1/2 inch dust hose . Why could n't they do that with this one ?	1
Great little brute , Ive tried to stall it out but it just would n't stop . It handles 36Grit with no problem.The only drawback is the dust it creates is more than that little bag is going to hold . Get the the sweeper attachment part # DW4111 worth the money if your going to use this in the house or shop . that is why I give it a 4 star . Amazon.com should sell the attachment ! ! ! ! hint .	1
This little tool sands well and gets into tight spots , but it runs into trouble if your holding it horizontally ( sanding baseboard , etc. ) . The dust bag immediately lets go and falls to the floor . It 's more of an irritant that a major problem as the dust collection is n't that great anyway . For the money , it 's a pretty good sander and unlike the Makita model , it does hold up .	1
Easy to grip and handle . Low on vibration and noise . Lets you get right up next to areas you do n't want sanded with full sanding capability to the very edge . Beats anything I 've owned so far for controllability and ability to get in tight corners and edge sand on fine work.The ONLY complaint I 've got is with the dust collection system . The bag tends to jump off on anything you 're doing that is n't flat and horizontal . And a vacuum attachment would be greatly appreciated , too.But , I 'd buy it again , even with that shortcoming .	1
Overall a great sander . I have dropped , stepped on and kicked this tool ( not on purpose but I have very small shop ) and it keeps on going . The case has stayed in great shape and I use the sticky backed sandpaper and the pad has not come apart . I would give it 5 stars but the on/off button is hard to work . It is sealed in a rubber cover and when you turn it off sometimes it comes back on because the cover causes you to think you fully depressed the switch when in fact you only pushed part of the way .	1
I have used this sander in many ways it was not intended . Abuse after abuse it keeps running . I would have given it four stars because the dust bag is somewhat cheap and does not attach properly but then I dropped it 2 stories on to a paved driveway . Not even a dent . Up to five stars . I have used it non stop for hours . I should have bought more sander for the tasks but it was there and I needed a sander . When I do finally get a random orbital sander I will get another DeWalt .	1
Great power , adjustments , and accuracy . This tool should last me a long time and help with alignment of my projects .	1
First project was to put in nine biscuits into two pieces of 1x12x48 pine for a top-bar beehive roof . Maybe TMI , but they are at a 20* angle , which was problematic . The first couple were fine so I went merrily along doing the other seven , the last of which was barely cutting the wood . Had to make another half and start over . The thumbwheel that locks the height is kinda small .. you may want to give it a little extra & # 34 ; umph & # 34 ; with pliers if you are going in at an angle rather than straight in.So this is operator lack of experience with a new tool performing a rather aggressive ( angled ) operation . You just have to tighten the lock more than thumb-tight to prevent the blade from actually pulling the carriage lower with successive cuts . The double pinion adjuster is awesome .. the chip collector I did n't even try .. they All jam up .. soft pine would have been worse . The spoils shot out quite nicely .. hey .. it 's a woodshop : ) Ergonomically comfortable , very smooth action , and easy to control . Lessons learned .. easily 5 Stars .	1
This is really a mixed bag , on one side you have the good price unless you buy at retail , than it ` s way overpriced.I used the prior model for years at my job , no real problems but also nothing to brag about.One thing I never liked was the size of the case , but it was a nice and sturdy metal one.When I saw that they changed it to a new plastic model I was hoping for more space , but the new case seems even smaller.I do not know what is going on with the engineers at Dewalt but this is not good.It is not easy to get all the tool and all the parts in there and the cable is bent pretty goodwhere it comes out of the tool , not good since that is always a week point.The handle which houses the trigger was loose , not a big deal since tighten 2 screws solved the problem , but not sure if that should be the case with a brand like Dewalt.I checked the the line up of the blade and it checked out okay but the fixed shoe does not line up with the housing , so in the end blade and the fixed shoe do not line up.It ` s not a lot but I will see if that causes trouble.One improvement are the new adjustable anti slippage pins.UPDATE : I looked at the tool more closely and the misalignment was due to the fixed shoewas not aligned properly at the factory , but with loosing two screws and realigning it seems fine.I was debating with myself if I should return it or not but for now I am going to keep it and see how it works out.Update II : After aligning the shoe I did quite some work with itand it worked without problems besides the poor dust control .	1
Dead accurate . Smooth . It screams , but produces an excellent job . DeWalt scores again .	1
I have owned my Dewalt biscuit joiner for many years and it has always performed great . The initial setup is very easy and I can make dozens of biscuit holes in no time at all.The only complaint I have , and its a small one , is the dust bag . It does fill up kind of quickly and will sometimes spill out , especially when its filled with fine dust from MDF panels . Wood seems to have lots of curly-q pieces that stay in the bag . I found that if I empty the dust bag after every ten holes it works great . Emptying the bag is very fast , so its not much of an inconvenience.Its a great tool that has held up well under repeated use .	1
I 've only owned this for maybe a couple months now , but have used it plenty . I went to the hardware store and got my hands on this jointer , the Freud and the PC . I chose this b/c1 . It was on sale,2 . the PC ( to me ) , was too big bulky ( although the PC 's has a much better fence than the DW ) 3 . I like the fence better on this than the Freud.The BJ was perfect right out of the box . Everything was aligned perfectly . A lot of people complained about the handle being attached to the motor , where as the PC , it 's not . I would prefer the PC method as well , but I 'm noticing that when I use it , I put one hand on the fence , holding it to the material firmly , and the other pushing the BJ into the wood . So I do n't even use the handle.My only gripe , like most , is that the dust chute clogs up all the freakin ' time . When it 's clogged , it 'll blow dust right up your face . What they need is a larger chute opening.The noise is not an issue to me ( ear protection ) , but I agree , it 's loud .	1
Usual Dewalt quality standards.Works great and if not abused , should last a life time.Good value too , for it is and what it can do .	1
This is my first biscuit jointer . I was leaning towards the PC 557 when I started looking , but after I visited local store and handled both , I picked this one . Not only saved [ money ] , but this one is more comfortable to handle to me and the trigger switch is awesome to use . And for the things I make , I wo n't need the smaller knife anyway . The only problem with this machine is the dust control . The dust bag does not work at all . It will make a mess after a few cuts and get the chips all over my face . So I picked up Porter Cable 39332 Vacuum Hose for 1 & quot ; O.D . Dust Ports and couple of adapters hooked up to my Jet dust collector since DeWalt does not make any of those . Now I am a very happy camper .	1
I read the instruction , looked it over and made a few test cuts with it . It was easy to understand and easy to use especially for 3/4 inch material . I have been looking at biscuit joiners for about a year and this is the one that has the best value with most functionality and quality .	1
Have owned this biscuit joiner for years now , it has never given me any problems.It also is the easiest to operate of the different brands I have tried . I would recommend it .	1
The price was good ( for a DeWalt product ) and the shipping was relatively fast . I mean , you have to pay for quality and DeWalt makes some high quality tools for sure that not only last a very long time , but hold their value in terms of trading or selling in the future . The joiner works well and is pretty close to being 100 % accurate . It 's a good tool and I 'm glad I have in my shop !	1
This model is very quiet and has a smooth deliberate action . It makes very acurate cuts but takes longer to set up . It is a good value for the money and is $ 50 less than the Porter Cable model . I was impressed by the sheer weight and balance of this plate jointer . If you want simplicity and acuracy then the Dewalt DW682K is for you !	1
I 've used this joiner for aligning panels and attaching face frames . The adjustments for angle , depth , and biscuit size are all very easy to use , and accurate . The machine has plenty of power and cuts through hard maple with ease . I would 've given it a 5 , however the small dust collection bag they provide with it seems to be useless ( the chute keeps clogging ) . I just use it without the bag and clean up afterwards .	1
I was advised by a friend to buy this plate joiner , and I was not at all upset with my purchase . After & quot ; fiddiling around & quot ; a bit , joining pieces of plywood and two-by stock , I have to strongly disagree with those people who say that this joiner has fence calibration problems . My first few joints went together seamlessly , until I encountered a problem with the two peices of three-quarter ply I was attempting to join . At one end of the board , the joint was perfect . at the other , almost 1/16 & quot ; out . I was shocked and upset , until I looked at the fence mechanisim , to discover that I had not tightened the lock nut on the rack-and-pinion adjuster tightly enough ( in fact not at all ) , causing the fence to slip and throw the joint off . All in all , however I am extremely impressed with the quality of this tool . It has a weighty feel , because of the solid metal construction of the fence assembly , incredible precision , and a nice long cord . Having a long cord is always nice because you can maneuver the tool about easier , and walk further around without having to shlep out an extention cord . The motor 's 6.5 amps are more than enough to cut through the vermont rock maple I recently used to build a cutting board . Though I have n't tried it yet , I am assuming it will handle oak , walnut , cherry and mahogany with equal precision and cutting force . And , on top of all this , it comes with a super cool-looking carrying case . An all-around excellent tool .	1
This tool does a great job doing what it is designed to do . It makes nice , clean , consistent biscuit joints.The one thing to keep in mind with this tool , even if you have used another biscuit jointer in the past , is that you will never be able to use it consistently and correctly without reading the manual . I 'm as guilty as anyone when it comes to using a tool directly out of the box , but It makes a huge difference when you really know how to use and adjust a piece of equipment like this . Take the extra 15 minutes , read the manual , and you will enjoy this great piece of machinery for years to come . Several of the complaints you will see listed in various reviews are due to simply not knowing how to correctly operate the unit . My father has the more expensive Porter Cable model , and finds this one superior to it . Look around on amazon and you may be able to save even more money by purchasing the less expensive reconditioned model that carries the same warranty !	1
I have had machine for two years , it was one of the first woodworking tools that I purchased . Biscuit joinery is easy and fast and creates strong joints . Biscuits are , in fact too easy , I am just now trying to move up to dovetailing and box joints.I use two indispensible jigs that I found in woodworking magazines . ONE puts the joiner on a flat surface with four clamps in a 90 deg work area around the joiner . TWO is a support jig ( shape of the base of my machine , with wood inserts that raise the machine making the cut heighth adjustable ) that allows me to cut miter key slots in boxes and frames with the joiner . This is really KEWL with contrasting wood such as ebony or purple heart . Both are built of 3/4 plywood bases , stored on a shelf until clamped to my bench . I apologize for not being able to provide magazine name ( s ) or date of issue.My machine has functioned flawlessly except for two broken dust port adapters . Replacement parts were ordered over the internet from service center in Spokane and received within five days.PROS-1 . Mechanical heighth adjustment ; 2 . HD construction ; 3 . 8 ' elec . cord ; 4 . Fence is accurate , easy to read ; 5 . Sturdy carrying/storage box ; 6 . REALLY LIKE the trigger positionCONS -1 . Dust collection ; 2 . Dust collection ; 3 . Dust collection ; Tool has a rectangular dust port that requires a plastic adapter ( broke two so far ) which has a 1 1/2 '' OD male end that inserts into the dust collector bag . USE A VACUUM or dust collector ! I had to order 2 1/2 '' - 1 1/2 '' adapter thru woodworking site as Lowe 's and Home Depot did not carry them.4 . Cuts slots for 0 , 10 , 20 , and M size biscuits . Most are too big for the projects that I usually do.I bought a cheap detail biscuit joiner ( red and black brand-five letters starts with a 'S ' ) that does R1 - R3 biscuits to supplement the Dewalt . It is NOT the quality or as user friendly as the Dewalt.THINGS I WOULD CHANGE:1 . 135 deg . fence for making slots in 45 deg miter joints2 . Longer fence to help overcome inertia of machine trying to move sideways with torque of blade.3 . Ability to use smaller blades for FF AND R3 biscuits.WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN : No , I would try the Porter Cable because of the 135 deg . fence and FF biscuit blade . Would probably regret losing the toughness of the Dewalt . If I only did cabinets and bookcases ( big stuff ) I would n't have anything except the Dewalt . Yes , I know there is a 'L ' brand out there but ... .. I would have to win the 'L'ottery first .	1
This is a very nice power tool . I like how the adjustments work - very easy to setup . I 've used this thing a lot where I used to use dowels before . The dust collection works great too . The only complaint I have is about the case it comes in . It 's a battle to put it back in the box each time I use it due to a very tight fit . Everything has to be just right before you can close it . I 'm going to modify some of the partitions in the case to fix this . I wo n't deduct a star because overall I am very pleased with this item .	1
I just got this and have used it to make about 60 test cuts in oak of varying thickness for 0 , 10 and 20 biscuits . I did n't encounter any alignment issues as others have mentioned so either I got a good one or DeWalt has improved their quality control . It has enough power to do the job and with the angle adjustments is flexible enough for almost any application I can come up with . The case has enough room to store the joiner , tools , vacuum attachments and a handful of spare blades.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 ... The vacuum bag clogs very easily ( do n't they all ) and once clogged , needs a screwdriver or other poking tool to get the chips out of the exhaust chute . Also , the base is too thick to cut 1/2 '' without the work being raised up slightly . The depth adjustment has settings for 0 , 10 , 20 and manual . It would be nice if it also had a setting for FF but since I 've never had a need for FF , it 's not a deal breaker.Bottom line , for the money it 's hard to beat and if I was going to buy another , I 'd have no problems buying the DeWalt .	1
This is a very solid and well built plate joiner . Not really a must have for the wood shop but it comes in handy . It does what it is suppose to do with ease . Good tool to add to the collection .	1
Bought one of these awhile back . I 've used it on numerous projects without any problem . The motor will strain a bit if you really move into the cut too fast . Otherwise , the machine is repeatable with a nice fence . The adjustments for angle , size and depth are easy to manipulate and STAY there once set.Highly recommended . Absolutely no problems .	1
When I got the tool , the fence was not alligned with the blade . The slots on material would not line up parallel , and did not fit well . The fence is attached with two screws , and is movable . Other machines ( I also have a Makita ) use a design with two machined , parallel surfaces , and this is not a problem . With the Dewalt , it is . After aligning the fence , the machine works , but out of the factory , it was not even close .	1
So I 'm just getting in to making items with wood that are actually nice to look at . I grew up watching Norm and always admired his skill and his TOOL collection ! On to my review - my first project with this was a deck box to store outdoor cushions and I used an assortment of 1x6 , 1x4 , 1x3 to make the sides , bottom and trim , plans were developed in the head , on the fly.Inital impression was good - the device appears to be well constructed , is pretty well balanced and the adjustments appear pretty easy.First use - On some scrap wood I put a few slots in it and it took a bit to figure out how the biscuit depth/size ( 0,10,20 ) was registered on rotating adjustment , once I figured this out , it was off to start joining boards , once the locations for the joint are identified , lineing up and maintaining the joiner on the spot on the wood was very easy . There is a springloaded abrasive ( I do n't know the technical term for it ) on the face of the tool where the blade retracts that once the device is held tightly against the work surface , it holds the joiner in place for the duration of the plunge and cut . It does generate a good bit of dust and depending on your position it can end up towards your face . Eye protection is a great idea ( as well as ears ) when using this or any power tool . The cuts that it made ( I 've used it to make about 100 slots now ) have all been very clean and accurate.For someone that it just getting in to woodworking , this is great tool , and I doubt that for my use ( limited weekend/evening use ) I 'll ever exceed it 's capabilities/useful life . I 've got several Dewalt power tools that are 17 years old now and still function like new and I have had good experience with with their products . I am not a & # 34 ; DeWalt & # 34 ; only tool person though , I have Red , Blue , Orange , Yellow and Grey tools in my garage .	1
All the settings right out of the box are spot on . No adjustments were necessary . The dust bag collected all the shavings and none were left on the ground . I was really surprised as most dust bags are virtually useless . This is a fine addition to my DeWalt tool library . The price on Amazon was less than the B & M stores and delivery was overnite with `` prime '' . Always a good experience with Amazon and thats why Amazon always gets first crack at my purchases . As far as the dust bag goes , make sure you empty it frequently and Im sure you will be more than satisfied with it . Made in Mexico , not China .	1
Great product , fast shipping !	1
I 've used this joiner on various projects over the last couple years , finding it functional and easy to use , but when I recently put it through some considerable work I was seriously impressed . I just made around 400 slots in order to build a half dozen chopping boards . It cut through both jatoba ( Brazilian cherrywood ) and maple like butter , making clean , consistent , and accurate slots . The blade is very high quality . The dual rack-and-pinion fence is very accurate , easily adjustable , and stays where you set it cut after cut . The gauge is easy to read , a plus when your protective eyewear is covered in sawdust . The preset stops make it easy to choose the proper slot size too .	1
Bought this item to help build an oak framed screen door for the front of our house , which ended up being a total of $ 210 , in comparison to the models on line at $ 900 ( including delivery . This biscuit joiner worked wonders and with little ease . I 've never used one , but after experimenting on scrap wood it performed wonderfully and allowed us to build the door of our dreams . Thanks Amazon and DeWalt for such a grrrrrreat product .	1
This is a quality product . My first one was stolen by a trusted employee . That 's why I bought this one -- -already knowing how good it was . True Story ! ! !	1
I bought this plate joiner about a year ago , and it has become a regular part of my woodworking activities . It adjusts easily for doing either straight plunges in a 90-degree edge , or for plunging into a 45-degree mitered edge . This is made possible because the fence adjusts to any angle you would ever need . The blade goes a long way before it dulls -- I used mine for at least six months of regular cutting . The saw has solid adjustments for bisquit sizes ( # 0 , # 10 , and # 20 , as well as a kind of & quot ; open-ended & quot ; size that I do n't really understand very well ) -- you just have to turn a little knob until it clicks into a clearly marked bisquit-size setting . It handles better than other plate joiners , since the body is longer and the handle is in a better location relative to the mouth . There are clear , red lines on two places on the plate joiner to align with your bisquit marks , whether you are using the machine horizontally or vertically . The only negative I have to point out about this plate joiner is that it does n't have a great dust-collection system , and also dust collects in the blade opening a little more than other plate joiners I tested . Every four or five plunges you have to either vacuum out the dust , or run the machine in the open air for a second to clear it . This is a small matter when you consider how nice the finished bisquit joints look .	1
Plate joiner ... .Should have got this years ago , It cuts exactly as It needs too , makes me feel stupid for ever trying it with a router .	1
I did a lot of research and many people complained about & # 34 ; the tolerances & # 34 ; or the machines being & # 34 ; off & # 34 ; by a micro millimeter . Here is my experience : I 'm a dowel guy , but i recently purchased this tool to speed things up that do n't need the strength of a dowel . I 'm quite happy with it . There are some big advantages in assembly of cabinetry to have a plate jointer ! When you place a biscuit , you have a little play to work with so even if the machine were 'off ' by a millimiter , it 's really no issue at all .	1
must have for all wood workers . this is really well made . this is not harbor freight junk . i got this for one of our custom cabinet projects . works like a charm . already paid itself few times over with one job . highly recommend it .	1
This was one of my most-used tools until I started using pocket hole joinery . At that point , biscuits took on more of a specialty role for me . My DeWalt 682 has seen a lot of use , though , and is still as tight as new . It comes with an excellent blade that stays sharp for a VERY long time , and the tool has plenty of power - it feels effortless.I have only one complaint about this tool , and that 's its dust & chip collection . The outlet is a bit small and plugs when using the bag . So badly , in fact , that I 've taken to clearing it out after every few holes . I use the tool with a vac whenever possible , and the port stays clear .	1
Wanted to join two pieces of butcher block together to make a table top . Biscuit joiner made the job seem easy . The tool is a breeze to set up and use .	1
Exactly what you would expect from DeWalt . This thing is high quality , and performs well . I have used on many different types of wood , and it never fails to do its job . Works great , lasts long time . Buy it .	1
I am a fan of Dewalt tools , but do n't blindly buy any one brand . I compared the Dewalt to the Freud and Porter Cable . Although I like these brands too , I could tell in a moment the fit and finish of the Dewalt was superior . The ergonomics are great - easy to operate trigger unlike the Freud , and not top-heavy like the P.C.Dust Collector works great . It will hold the dust from 25-30 # 20 biscuits without clogging . Easy to empty with zipper.6.5 Amps is more than enough power to cut # 20 biscuits in hardwood . The DW682 glides forward easily and effortlessly cuts biscuits right where you want them.Aligning parts for glue-up is easier than ever . The slots allow about 1/8 '' side-to-side play for aligning the joint . Once the Beech wood biscuits hit the glue , they swell to tighten up the joint . My first project was a drill press table - so nice not to have holes everywhere from the brad nailer.I dispute others negative comments : Some complain that the fence only goes 0-90 degrees , unlike P.C . which goes 0-135 degrees . They assume this means that you ca n't cut biscuits for mitered corners with the DW682 - BUT THEY ARE WRONG ! The fence stays at 90 degrees to reference the beveled cut and it works great . It is all in the manual . Some complain that the dust collector clogs - not true - even without a vacuum . Works great . Another complaint I read was that the biscuit slot was not parallel to the workpiece . This is a simple adjustment covered in the manual . Do n't people read manuals anymore ? Mine came perfectly adjusted right out of the box.The best feature is the rack and pinion fence which always stays square to the workpiece . 5 star+++ biscuit cutter .	1
I will seldom use this jointer in a fine application , it is used for hidden deck fastening systems . Outside , used by helpers ( who do n't care ) . dropped from a deck once from 8 foot into dirt uninjured . Working in a shop situation I would probably have chosen the porter cable . I could keep it nice , put it away , instead of toss it in a bucket and it would be a clean , nice , ... tool for me to put cabinets together and look good as new in 5 years . I perceive the porter cable as being delicate . I saved ( $ $ $ ) , and can let others use it without worry with this jointer . I can occasionally use it for my simple shop needs . I wish they still made a metal case for this that is all that I see wrong with it . Second finest machine , fence is way better than the pack , and with the exception of some fancy european model which I see as a ... with the others currently available . This is the best value for the dollar .	1
This tool does everything the manufacture says it does and does it well . No wonder many magazines have made it their & quot ; Editor 's Choice & quot ; .I do n't understand the negative reviews . I have experienced none of the problems some people have mentioned . Maybe a person needs to be smarter than the tool . I make my living with a plate joiner doing plastic laminate countertops and it has been flawless . I 've used tools costing much more with no improvement in results.The only place I might take away a half star would be since the fence is so precise you would n't want to turn it over to an employee who would drop it on a concrete floor . Other than that I do n't know how you would improve upon it .	1
I read a couple of negative reviews here of this tool , and Ican only conclude that they did not buy the same machine I did . Ibought mine when they first came out ( five years ago ? ) ... . Everything was square and true right out of the box.Since I wear hearing protection with ALL power tools I can not comment on how loud it is . ( My ears do n't ring all the time , either . ) The dust bag , as is usual with all dust bags , does n't work and I have n't used it since the first try . The shop vac does the trick.It has worked flawlessly on everything from positioning slats in a headboard ( OK , I could have used mortise-and-tenon joints , but there were a LOT of slats ) to attaching edging to plywood , to table-top glue-ups . The only biscuit failure I 've had was when I tried to use it to attach the aprons to the legs on a children 's play table . Some places NEED better joinery ! I am a little confused about the other reviews talking about the machine dumping dust on your feet . Mine has a swiveling plastic nozzle that I direct to the side when I cut without the vac . It seems to work fine . Have they changed this design lately ? ... it , it seems like a bargain . The Lamello is unbelievably expensive ( at least for a hobbyist ) , the Porter-Cable seems like a nice tool ( that I have not tried yet ) , but the DeWalt seems like the value champ .	1
When this Kit arrived I was pleasantly surprised at the completness and quality . The blow molded case is not excessive in size and holds everything just right . I 've used many other tools but never have I used a plate joiner . Today I can truely say I made the right choice . The adjustments are all evident and handy to reach . I made the tool ready for the cut in a snap . Placed the tool where I wanted the cut and & quot ; bam & quot ; with ease the cut came out exactly where I wanted it . I think the price and quality and ease of use makes this a five star winner !	1
I bought this DeWalt to replace a Freud jointer that died after only a dozen or so cuts . The positive reviews on this site played a large role in my decision ( it 's the only DeWalt tool I own ) . I also considered the Porter Cable ( which looks bulky ) and the less-expensive Ryobi ( which of course you ca n't get here on Amazon ) .I 've had this jointer for over a year now and have put it to moderate use with home woodworking projects . It seems to be of good quality . The tool is lightweight and I agree with other reviews that the trigger placement is very user-friendly . However , I have one annoyance with this tool that I just ca n't seem to get over . I use this primarily in oak and pine , and the dust chute clogs with chips after just 2 or 3 cuts . The chute seems too small for the amount and/or size of the chips that are extracted . I am constantly removing the dust bag to clear the chips from the tool . Perhaps this problem could be avoided with a dust collection attachment , but bulky collection hoses can be restricting , and the bag otherwise does a great job catching dust ( until it clogs ) .I suspect this DeWalt will last a very long time . But if I were to buy another biscuit jointer , I would be very tempted to try the Ryobi at half the price . It too has very good reviews , and the specs are comparable .	1
I wo n't bore you with repeating the specs or features of the biscuit joiner as the other reviews cover them quite well . I 've had this tool for about 6 months now and am delighted with it . I had the porter cable model which is quite a bit more expensive . I found it to be bulkier to use than the DeWalt and a lot more likely to slip away from your alignment marks than the DeWalt . This cutter has pins on both sides of the blade that go a long way to help keeping the cutter in line with the wood.. The only drawback is that the dust chute will clog with the dust bag installed when cutting into long grained softwoods.Having owned both the porter cable and the Dewalt I must give a big nod to the DeWALT . Smaller and easier to use and a few $ $ less .	1
I 've had this Dewalt plate joiner for several years and use it often for things like making shelving and for joining mitered corners on gates and doors . I find it to be decently made with adjustments that are simple to dial in . It will cut slots with consistent depth and alignment and the rack and pinion depth adjustment for the fence allows minute changes to be made to for board thickness . The cut angle can also be precisely set anywhere from 0 to 90 . The chip bag for this joiner generally seems to only be good for maybe two or three cuts before it becomes clogged with chips , so I will normally use a shop vac and 1 '' hose for dust collection . For me , the only minor issue with this joiner is that it does n't also work for FF-size face frame biscuits , which could be useful for things like cabinet doors , but I see that there is now a smaller 3-1/16 '' diameter blade available from Amana that will supposedly give this Dewalt joiner that capability , so I am considering giving it a try . Overall , I 've been very pleased with this tool and how well it has worked for my woodworking needs .	1
Works like a champ . Used it to make about 50 biscuit joints already , and no problems . Watch videos on youtube if you want to see the many different techniques you can use to use this tool.My only complaint is that the little port which blows dust into the dust bag occasionally clogs up . I figured out that on woods like oak , if I just cut a little slower by pushing in the cutter a little slower , the little port never gets clogged up . It only gets clogged up if I jam it in really fast , making huge curly cue shavings of wood . The motor has no problem cutting the slot quickly , but just go a little slower , and the dust is finer and it never gets clogged . And then when you go slower , the cut comes out looking cleaner and nicer anyway.I 'm a real fan of DeWalt tools , and this one did n't let me down . I have a whole bunch of DeWalt tools , some of them are like 20 years old with tons of use , and they all work great . The only thing I 've ever had to replace was a battery back for my 18 volt drill after getting tons of use out of it .	1
I 've had mine for several years now . I do n't really give it much thought . It always does what I ask it to . I love not having nail holes in my face frames . Not a lick of trouble . I do n't have the problem of clogging . If I 'm inside , I use a shop vac . If I 'm outside , I use the dust chute and the ground . I do n't point it at my person , I point it away . Nor do I have the problem of out of square cuts . Even if they were it would n't be a problem . The slots are wider than the biscuits anyway . If you properly clamp your work the joint will be straight even if your cuts are off . It 's amazing how forgiving these little football shaped pieces of smashed wood really are . The glue causes the biscuit to swell and fill the voids . I really like biscuits . They are pretty strong if you use common sense . I have large pieces of furniture made exclusively with biscuits ( no mortise and tenons and no screws or nails ) that are several years old and have been moved twice to different locations with NO failures of any joints . The Porter Cable looked inviting to me but it 's not really any better from my experience with it.I 've never used a lamello . I 'm sure I would dump my Dewalt in its favor if I did but I 'm very happy with this one that is sooo much cheaper .	1
This is simply a great biscuit router that makes any corner or attachment of materials much stronger and tighter for the long road . So simple to use and once you use it often you will think of projects you wish you had this on . Like any routing type of tool it is going to make a bunch of sawdust no matter what you do but it is worth it .	1
This is quite a fixture for your Dewalt router . I use mine on the DW-621 , so I use the thinner set of rods and extra set screw knobs that come with it . It has a thicker set of rods for the 3hp routers . You rough-adjust it by sliding it on the two rods that fix to the base of your router and locking the set screw knobs . You can then & quot ; fine tune & quot ; it with the center knob and lock the set screw knob on it . The large picture above will make these explanations clear to you.The dust collection works okay ; I have a small hose adapted to my shop dust collector , but it does take some getting used to , dragging a hose around with your tool . The construction of the fixture is very heavy-duty ; it should last a long time with continuous use .	1
I am a beginner , but I learn fast . This product works just fine . As I 've learned I have n't used this , but it is nice to have it available .	1
this is the best edge guide i think i have ever used and the vacuum adapter is a god send for keeping the mess to a minimum	1
The Router Edge Guide does a superb jog with keeping the edge tight while keeping the area clear of shavings . The fine adjustment allows for minor adjustments without question .	1
I purchased this guide for Dewalt 's new trim routerDEWALT DWP611PK 1.25 HP Max Torque Variable Speed Compact Router Combo Kit with LED'sand it works as advertised . The guide only works with the plunge base but that is n't a problem for me because the plunge base is more stable in my opinion . You should attach a wooden fence to the guide too to get more accurate results and so you do n't mar the piece you are routing . My only complaint is that I now need to find and purchase a hose and/or adapter that fits this guide and my shop vac .	1
I bought this as part of my DW618 router kit . I 'm a DIY , amateur level homeowner/hobbyist.Con : well , not a biggie , but the edger 's face was missing a set screw . I found a nice replacement at my local hardware store.As for the rest , I like this edger a lot:2 sets of rods for attaching the edger to your router , the smaller , shorter rods thread into the larger set if you want a really big standoff.Previous negative comments about rods torquing and getting out of alignment when tightened down just do n't happen with mine.Setup is quick and simple : make a coarse setting using the rod set screws , then fine tune your distance with the guide 's ... ( drumroll ) ... fine tuning knob.Vacuum attachment is easily removed , I do n't like my clunky vac hose dragging along while I 'm edging ( personal quirk maybe ) .Edger face set screws use either a flat blade screwdriver , or a T-20 Torx bit ( nice ! ) , when adjusting the fence face ( wide or narrow , depending on what you 're edging or your particular bit ) . DeWalt seems to prefer Torx and Hex bits to screwdriver blades or Phillips , a feature I LIKE .	1
I found that this edge guide worked well . There was a negative comment about the stability of this guide , but I found that it worked well with good accuracy and stability on very fine cuts ( I have to take that review with a grain of salt ) . I was matching an existing profile on an older piece that I was modifying . The match was perfect where you could not tell the new from the old profile .	1
This is a great improvement over my past edge guide - two aluminum rods from Home Depot with an mdf fence . This guide has steel rods , and the knobs lock down securely . The kit comes with knobs to mount the guide to your router . The knobs have springs to keep them from vibrating loose.The microadjust works best if you keep some tension on the lockdown knob . If you loosen it all the way to adjust the microadjust , it feels a little wobbly . Just loosen it enough to adjust , and it works fine.The plastic part that contacts the workpiece is smooth , and slides with very little resistance . The guide has a dust collection port with reducer . My flexible woodcraft shop vac hose fit the edgeguide without an adapter . By the way the woodcraft hose also fits the DW618 plunge router without an adapter too . Anyway I now have good dust collection through the plunge base for inboard cuts , or through the edgeguide for profiling cuts . A nice feature is the split fence , which you can slide outward to create an opening for the bit.Use the thicker rods for the 618 router . A previous reviewer stated that the rods screw together for a longer offset . This is not true . The thin set of rods are threaded to allow them to screw into the Dewalt 610 router . The thicker set of rods are not threaded . If you have a longer offset than this guide will handle , you would be better off using a clamp and guide . But for cuts near the edge of a workpiece , fluted columns , strip inlays , and mortises -- - > this edgeguide is great !	1
Was n't sure when I purchased it but it worked well with my small plunge router . Really helped in routing two mortise for hinges . Highly recommend .	1
The edge guide is a must addition to the Dewalt router . Only wish , would have been nice to be included with the DEWALT DW618PK 12-AMP 2-1/4 HP Plunge and Fixed-Base package . Dewalt makes a quality tool in my book .	1
I bought this guide primarily for the dust extraction feature , which works fine . The icing on the cake is the capability to fine tune the guide settings . I 'm glad I bought it !	1
Used be I am used non vacume adapter type edge guide.Dust less compair with befor.I am quait happy with using this item .	1
Works as advertised . Seems to be reasonably good quality ( A Festool it ai n't ) . I have used it for aligning mortises on a board . It world perfectly once it was set up properly . I 'm happy with it for sure . Using it on my Dewalt 618 .	1
Purchesed the edge guide with the Dewalt 611PK router . Fits up to the plunge base only . Will not fit up to the fixed base . The fixed base has its own model edge guide . However , this unit has all the bells and whistles of a high end edge guide . In addition , it will fit up to all Dewalt routers.Review after ( 3 ) months of use.Holds its setting very well , no issues here . The long edge guide is very helpful and a must when doing cabinet work . The edge guide is low profile when the vacuum port is removed . However , chip build-up around the base becomes a problem . I highly recommend this attachment .	1
I have owned ny DeWalt for about eight months . Sometimes the on/off switch gets caught but really no trouble . I have probably put close to 500 hours of heavy duty work with this . C & amp ; D side plywood , raw wood as well as refinishing . I just had to replace the pad today as it losts its grip on the sandpaper . But again a very minor problem . My sole major problem is how hot the handle gets after about two hours of consistent sanding . However , the finish is beautiful and I would highly recommend it to anyone .	1
I use the heck out of this tool , probably every week . I 've had it about two years and have n't had a lick of trouble . The on/off switch on mine has worked without complaint . The speed control has also been reliable and is a nice feature on occasion to lower the speed on more delicate items ( although I usually run it wide open ) . I do n't really have much complaint about the vac attachment ; mine wiggles loose sometimes , but not every minute ( if anyone honestly knows of one that does n't every come loose , feel free to buy me one for Christmas ; I think it 's just the nature of the beast ) . Dust collection ( with my Fein vac ) has been excellent , especially when sanding wood . I have almost no clean up after . I 've also used this for some moderate drywall work ( remodel stuff ) and it 's been up to the task . That generates a little more dust than can be controlled with such a small tool , but I was still able to capture about 85 % +.I think you 'll find this to be a reliable , workaday addition to your shop/truck box . It may not be as efficient as some of the larger 6 & quot ; models , but then again , it 's much cheaper .	1
I figured that if this thing survived the job I purchased it for , it would be doing good . It has that and quite a few more that were just rough . So far ( knock on wood ) I have n't experienced the switch problem or dust attachment problem that other reviewers have had . We almost always use it attached to a vacuum . And that 's one of the reasons why it probably gets more use than some of our other sanders . The vacuum attachment works better with it than on our other sanders . So far , despite a lightweight appearance that would make you suspicious of its durability , it 's still sanding through some rough territory for us .	1
I bought a DeWalt 423 palm sander roughly 10 years ago . It has always worked great and has always done a great job . However , there is one aspect of this sander that can be dangerous . This morning I was using my sander to sand a book shelf . All of a sudden the rubber hook and loop pad disintegrated and threw rubber pieces all over the place . Several hit me right in the face hard enough to cause welts . I was lucky to be wearing safety glasses at the time . The part number for this pad is 151281-06 . I have ordered a replacement pad from Amazon . I think that over 10 years the rubber pad must have degraded to the point where it was no longer strong enough to withstand the oscillating forces of the sander . Its analagous to how the rubber in an automobile tire degrades over time . From now on I am going to inspect my replacement pad weekly and I will replace it every couple of years . It is interesting that my natural response after being hit by a barage of rubber shrapnel was to quickly throw the sander away from me while it was still running . The good news is , after the sander hit the concrete floor with a huge thump , it kept on operating and was sliding around the floor like a snake . At least I know that it can take a licking and keep on ticking .	1
This sander is an absolute pleasure to use . It has very little vibration and really floats over the work piece . I have n't used it for any serious material removal ( i.e . paint , stain , heavily marred surfaces , ect . ) so I can only comment on its use in finishing cut boards and sanding in between coats of stain/sealer.The paper for this sander is readily available and relatively inexpensive so get a wide assortment and happy sanding !	1
Other reviewers are correct , this is a terrific little sander with one problem , the switch is tricky to operate . The switch is too small and the rubber dust cover over it makes the action of the switch awkward at best . Getting it to turn on or off can be a two or three attempt task , this should be a no-brainer for DeWalt to fix in future production . Other than that the quality of the finish it produces is excellent , noise level acceptable and the dust collection is a major improvement over the old 1/4 sheet sanders . I typically use this sander immediately after my 1/2 sheet Porter Cable ( with no dust collection ) and the DeWalt sucks up all the dust left behind by the PC . Highly recommended .	1
This little sander is a wonderful tool . You can get glass smooth finishes relatively quckly with the right discs . I wo n't go back to plain orbital sanders . they 're too slow and leave too many swirl marks on your work . Incidently , I find myself reaching for my Porter Cable R.O . sander more often , because it has less vibration , and causes less numbness in my hands . They are very comparable in features and price .	1
While looking around in the tool department at the local Sears Store here in Fairbanks , Alaska , I noticed this sander on the shelf . I had heard how great Random Orbital Sanders were from various people , and since it was my birthday , I snatched it up and took it home . To date , I have used this sander for about everything ! Initially , I used it to sand kitchen cabinets that I built from scratch and faced with Hard Maple . Then , after finding it did a better overall job than a belt sander , I sanded two cedar patio decks ( ten by twelve ft , and 8-x 12 ft ) . I then used it to refinish the capping board ( 2 & quot ; X 6 & quot ; on my eaves ) that had been badly weathered . I have used this sander without mercy for hours on end ; I have dropped it from height approaching twenty feet , and have soundly thrashed it on too many projects to name . In short , it still operates like the day I took it out of it 's box ... four years ago . The grit of sandpaper you install determines this sander 's versatility ! A great buy for the money ! Handy Dan	1
I have had this sander for the last year . It has been a true godsend as it is used almost every day for two to three hours . The dust collection piece is great until you get up to the 220 grit which seems to somehow escape the collector . My only gripe is the palm area will heat up after about an hour or so enough to make it somewhat uncomfortable . However , it does the job right everytime .	1
I avoided buying an electric sander for a long time , but when my projects got bigger and more serious , it could be put off no longer . This is the little guy I ended up with , and boy does it do a nice job ! I have three or four grit levels I go through so the hook and loop makes that a snap . Even running 60 grit , I do n't see any swirl marks and after the 220 step , the wood is really nice and smooth.I have no idea if the dust bag works because I always use a shop vac , which seems to capture about 99 % of the dust if not more ! I chose this one over the variable speed model because of so-so reviews I 'd read for the other one . I did prefer the ergonomics of the variable speed model better and am reminded of this every time I use it . This one is a bit uncomfortable to grab from the top even though I have fairly large hands . It 's fine when I wrap around the middle , but I 'd like the option.My only concern is for the gasket-like ring between the pad and body that helps with the dust collection and keeps the pad from increasing in speed when lifted off the work surface . In the instructions , it says that this ring is consumable and needs to be replaced once it 's worn out . The kit comes with one spare ring but I have not been able to find these things anywhere so I 'm worried about what I 'll do when the second one wears out.other than that , this sander has performed well beyond expectations and I can certainly recommend it .	1
I 've had the sander for about a year now and it is pretty good overall . The compact size lets it go into tight workspaces . It is light weight and can easily be operated with one hand . This weekend I spent about 7 hours sanding and even after several hours of continuous use it worked well . I have a couple of small complaints . First the dust bag does tend to pop off frequently , which can be a messy nuisance . In addition , the dust collection is poor . Most of thet sawdust ends up in the air . Next you can really feel the vibration in your hands . After about 2 hours my hands feel like they are falling asleep . Also the unit gets very hot after prolonged use . It wo n't get hot enough to burn you , but it does make it more uncomfortable to hold . On the plus side , it has a good quality compact case that holds plenty of sandpaper .	1
This sander really does work fine , it does the job it is designed to do . I do have a couple of complaints though . Firstly the dust bag is basically useless . Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective . ( Actually though , I fail to see how a ssnder 's dust bag can work without a vacuum , but anyway ) and the other gripe is the power switch . Mine is in a dust protective booted cover , that I usually fail to properly toggle , so when I start to sand , it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down . I can say however , that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it , dropped it , loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability . I can not base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders , but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over .	1
This is my first ROS , and it 's great . The hook-and-loop sandpaper goes on and off quickly , and it stays put while sanding.The dust bag works well , but it is super when I hook my dust collector up to it . I 've had no problems with the dust bag coming off , it requires a twist and pull to get it off .	1
The discs are fine . They are good sandpaper is of good quality . The pad sticks well to the velcro . Sands wood like you want it to .	1
I like the fact that these pads stay put with the hook and loop fastening system . Glue backing always gets compromised by dust . These perform much better .	1
Works great with my orbital , gives a great finish and they last surprisingly well . I would highly recommend this too any woodworker .	1
You ca n't say much more then it 's & # 34 ; Dewalt & # 34 ; . This sandpaper does a good job and the hook and loop makes it so easy to use ! ! ! ! ! If you havent went to this type of sander/sandpaper in your shop you need too ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
That is what I thought the first time I used the orbital sander with an 80 grit . It quickly powered through all the stuff that had built up on top of a 30 year old bench-top I inherited when I bought this home . First step is sometimes the most important when refinishing .	1
Did not slip at all out of my Dewalt orbital sander . Has a homogenous sanding ability without tears to the sandpaper . Wonderful .	1
Works great with my orbital , gives a great finish and they last surprisingly well . I would highly recommend this too any woodworker .	1
This sandpaper works like a charm with my dewalt sander ! ! ! Easy to take on and off . They are a real joy to use and they last for a fair amount of time , even with hard use . I will be buying more of these in the future when I run our of the ones I have ! ! ! !	1
Works great just like good sandpaper should , SMILE and the price beat the big box stores by a little . If it says dewalt I 've found you ca n't go bad . Thanks Pitbullman	1
I tried both these DeWalt and the Sungold . THere is no comparison ! The Sungold will last 5 minutes tops , while the DeWalt is good for at least a half and hour of continuous sanding . Depending on the surface , these can even last a whole day . Will only ever get these again .	1
I dont know what to say about this tool that hasent been said already . It is of very good quality and powerful as well . If you look around at other drills I doubt you will find anything that even comes close to this tool.The chuck is top notch , In my opinion one of the finest made.The level mounted in the drill body is a great idea , it really works well.On the down side I wish the body had a rubber grip like the cordless model and putting it away in the kit box puts a weird tweek in the cord and can be tough to do in a hurry . other than that this item should be in you tool box or shop as of yesterday . A real winner . now get out there and drill something..	1
This is my favorite drill of the ones that I own . It is very powerful , easy to manage , great chuck , and the built in levels are a wonderful addition .	1
If you are buying your first drill this is the one , if you do n't have this drill yet you need it . I have a several drills , cordless and a heavy duty right angle , but this one gets a lot of use . Its high RPM and light weight make it great for accessories like wire brushes and other paint removal products . The keyless chuck is great for changing bits . I use it for projects where I will be using it for long periods of time , like driving lots of deck screws , or removing paint/rust with a wire brush ... places a cordless just does n't hold up . It 's a lot better value than a lot of cordless drills , which have their own place . With this drill you get the great Dewalt design and reliability . I have had no problems with mine .	1
This is a great , reasonably priced drill that has plenty of power . It is not too heavy and the keyless chuck is great . This drill will satisfy most peoples ' needs . I use a cordless drill most of the time and get this drill out for more demanding jobs . However , I have since purchased a 1/2 inch chuck hammer drill for even bigger jobs and drilling in concrete . In retrospect , I could have skipped buying the DeWalt , but it is still a great drill .	1
This is a great corded drill . Built lightweight but works great for drilling in wood or light metal . I use it for pocket hole drilling and holes for screws and countersinks . The built in level is a great feature . It has a lots of power for the drill of this size . The case that comes with it is useless . Just throw it in the recycling container .	1
I purchased this drill because I wanted a powerful 1/2 '' drill . I like this drill because its rpm 's match its purpose . I originally purchased the same drill with 2 speeds and the hammmerdrill function . I thought it was to big and really did n't like worrying about something else to break . The rpm range is ideal for heavy drilling . I received the drill , contractor bag and a set of spade bits for $ 99.00 . I tried the drill out using a 1 inch spade bit through an 8 inch oak branch . It drilled straight through and never bogged down . I am glad I got the 7.8 amp drill versus the 6.7 amp drill . I really recommend this drill .	1
I have used one of these for five or six years now . It is very strong and very tuff ; I can not tell you how often this thing has bounced off a concrete floor and it still works like a champ.Cordless drills are great , I use two of them constantly , but sometimes you just want a solid corded drill and this one fits the bill , strong but not too heavy or bulky ; in fact I think that it is lighter than my 18v cordless.I use it primarily for drilling pocket holes for building cabinets and such , when the batteries would have already drained on the cordless drills this one is still going strong .	1
I am posting because the product desription is not correct . Otherwise , it does appear as advertised . I can not comment on the drill 's performance because I have not used it yet ... so my star rating does n't count for much at this point ... I will update this review when I start my first project.One of the reason 's I bought it was the `` Made in USA '' description in the `` more technical details '' link ... but when I got it , it said `` Manufactured in Mexico . '' This may not matter to others , but it is better to be accurately informed before you buy ... also , a case would be a nice addition for such a nice-looking and powerful tool ! Good luck to all !	1
I bought this drill to get into places that my large Milwaukee right angle drill can not fit into while installing an electrical system and plumbing in what was previously an Amish farm house . This is an excellent tool . It is quiet and powerful . The variable speed is a great safety factor , when boring large holes with auger style drill bits in wood that just might contain nails you do n't want to be drilling full speed when the inevitable nail is found , that can be very hard on the wrist.This drill is a very compact yet very powerful tool . I will push a `` auger style bit thru 2x lumber like a hot knife thru butter . The angle of the handle makes it easy to apply straight line force to the drill bit when needed and the infinitely adjustable front handle is quickly adjusted or removed for clearance in tight locations . I prefer the old fashioned geared chuck on a `` drill , this tool has one and it works great , allowing you to really clamp down on the drill bit . This is a factory rebuilt tool that looks and works like a brand new drill . I do n't know what you could do to make this tool any better.This drill meets all my expectations as a high quality industrial tool . I think it is a very good value for the money spent . I paid $ 56 for a factory rebuilt , shipped to my door .	1
I purchased the drill to mix tile thin set and grout . After burning up a 1/2 `` Makita and Milkwalkee this drill has held on through hundreds of pounds of mix . Highly recommend .	1
This is a great tool for the price . One of my guys bought one . It drills pretty well in any material . Except masonry . It 's not so fast that you burn your bits in steel . The torque is quite impressive . More than my Milwaukee Magnum . You could easily hurt yourself with this bad boy . But that means you can use some pretty large bits and hole saws with it . Some times when all your batteries are dead ( if you forget to charge them ) you need a corded drill just to remember how nice the cordless one are .	1
This is a ruggedly-built drill with the chuck capacity and power to do the jobs I bought it for . It 's a good thing it has the auxiliary handle , because it has LOTS of torque . It 's also handy that the aux . grip can be readily rotated to any desired angle.Even though it 's a reconditioned unit , it looks and works like a brand new drill motor .	1
I bought this drill about a year ago in anticipation of a yearly construction project I do for a student group . During this project , my drill got banged up , had paint poured on it , and was abused and dropped from scaffolding , without ever quitting . Its major job was the ( seemingly endless ) drilling of 1 '' holes using old , blunt , overused spade bits . Despite the poor condition of the bits attached , my drill never slowed down , and the handle let me power through studs . Where others were getting wrist pain with their cordless drills , and having to change batteries , or re-tighten their keyless chucks , i just kept going . The chuck is SOLID , and lets you really clamp down on bits , and the metal housing for the drill 's gearbox makes this thing practically indestructible . I even used this thing to drive several 3 '' deck screws and it wasnt that hard to maneuver , ( though I dont think i 'd want to be working overhead with this drill unless i was really in a pinch ) as a side note : my dad actually has this same exact drill , but with a keyless chuck , and though the keyless chuck is also made of metal and well designed , i 've found that the keyed chuck simply provides better performance , and is worth the hassle of carrying a key around	1
I did a lot of looking around at medium right angle drills . The drawbacks on the Dewalt is no variable speed , and no reversing . So it may be prone to stripping screws , and now way to reverse them out when they do . Ouch . For straight drill of holes it is great.If you have air around , and do n't need to make large holes in 2x12s , the air driver Porter Cable is sweet . Has air pressure , to create torque and variable speed adjustments , and has reversing capabilities , and is the best price on the block.My pick is the Makita 110 volt model . It has the largest amperage motor in the medium duty range , has variable speed , reversing , and an adjustable speed limiting dial , an LED light to illuminate your work , and is guaranteed to last the lifetime of the tool.Next is the Bosch with a slightly weaker motor at 3.8 amps , and does n't have the speed range of the Makita , even though it is at the same price . Nice overall tool though.Then comes the Milwaukee 55 degree angle drill . Fine for additional leverage while drilling , but could be a problem for deeper access areas when making 90-degree applications . Especially important in crammed quarters , when you would have to swing the body out the additional 35 degrees to get a 90-degree angle.Black and Decker makes a lightweight unit , and will suffice for the occasional weekend warrior.The Dewalt unit , fills a niche , but is a very good example of getting what you pay for . If it were not for the no reversing , and no variable speed capabilities , and for making the paddle switch so long , that gets in the way , even when you do n't want it to , makes the unit , strictly for those who are price conscious first , and tool conscious later.Wake up and smell the Makita . : - )	1
While remodeling my home , we were taking up the floor boards on the second floor , so we could access the electric to the first floor ceiling fans . The house is old and still had gas pipe in the floors from the old 'gas lighting ' , and to add to the confusion it still had the knob and tube wiring . Needless to say it was tight working between the joists . Thats were the DeWalt DW160 came in ... .it fit down inbetween the joists nicely , and had enough power to get the job done . As mentioned in another review , and keyless chuck would have been great , but other than that this drill is a great thing to have around .	1
no question hands down the way to go ... I had this on my wish list for a while and got it last x-mas ... before that we used a Vermont American flush bit on regular or cordless drills and thought that was just fine ... but let me tell you the upgrade was worth it ... I should have bought it sooner rather than waiting for it to be givin as a gift . Its just is so much faster ... easy to dial in to your settings and light weight ...	1
I am a remodeler . I am not committed to any brand of tools , Some brands do better on one tool , and some do better on another . Overall Milwaukee is the brand I use the most , but a drywall screwgun I went with DeWalt . I have no complaints with this gun . It is fast , powerful , light , and has easy depth adjustment . I have been using it for the last year+ and havent had any problems with it.If you have drywall to do , and you dont have a drywall gun you are wasting time . It is worth the money .	1
I do n't know why I waited so long -- I purchased this to do my basement -- makes doing any sheetrock job -- especially ceilings -- exceedingly easier than doing it the old way with a cordlesss drill and dimpler bit.It takes a little practice to get used to how fast you can work with this , but even taking your time loading screws , it sets them at a perfect depth everytime which saves a HUGE amount of time in the long run when mudding.I 'm holding back 1 star to see how well the tool holds up over time , but 25 % of the way into my basement project , I 'm extremely pleased with its performance .	1
As stated elsewhere , if you do n't need 130 lbs of torque , and most of us dont , this is a great gun . Two things worth mentioning though:1 ) Throw away the manual immediately , it is less than worthless . It will only serve to confuse you and upset you to the point of frustration . Why most manuals are so poorly written I will never know . I guess they figure at the point where you 're reading the manual , they 've already got your money ! Bench Dog is a shining example of the opposite BTW . Their manuals are clear , concise , thorough , I ca n't say enough about them.2 ) DO NOT use bits with a cut by the bottom of the bit . These are the longer bits , maybe 2 inches long , sometimes 2 sided ? they will stick in the gun , you will have to take it apart and send away to Dewalt for a new bit holder.Use only 1 inch long flat sided bits , they are held magnetically , you do n't need the extra grab that the other bits give.Still a five star rating for the tool itself , just these caveats .	1
Several years ago I retired my corded Makita drywall gun which I had used for years and bought the DeWalt DW272 . This gun is fast and reliable ! The 'dial-up ' depth setting is simplicity itself and never faulters . The gun is light ; powerful ; well balanced ; and rugged . For the average homeowner 's drywall needs , this gun is all that he/she needs.I recently purchased the DeWalt DC520 18v drywall gun ( which can be very pricey ) , because I hate dragging around a cord . But for the overhead work I still grab the DW272 ! This is a fabulous screw gun for the money ! If you are in the market for a corded drywall gun , get it , you wo n't be sorry .	1
I 'm not a big fan of Dewalt , but even the worst companies do at least some things right . Dewalt did this one right.It 's built well , works well , and it 's priced right . What more do you need ? Setting the depth is foolproof , and the depth stays consistent.I use it more often for cement backerboard with durock screws than I do drywall . But for either job , I 'm totally happy with its performance.If you 're a homeowner/occassional user , the price puts this in the realm of serious consideration . If you 've got three or four sheets of drywall to put up , you do n't need it.If you think you 'll do more than one project in your lifetime though , spend the 90 bucks . It 's SO MUCH faster than the cordless drill approach . And you wo n't over/under drive your screws ( assuming you set the depth correctly to begin with , of course ) .One word of warning to the casual user - Remember that this is a professional level tool . The instructions assume you 're a pro . You wo n't just pick this thing up and start using it like a pro.Expect to have to practice a little with it first , until you get the technique down . You typically run this thing all out at top speed without letting up on the trigger between screws . Most people have trouble until they figure that out.It 's not a regular drill where you have to slowly bring the screw up to speed . With drywall guns , the bit does n't turn till you push the screw to the wall , when it catches it drives the screw at top speed , then stops turning once it hits the right depth . It all happens in the blink of an eye.You ca n't be overly careful with the thing , you have to put a screw on and jam it in with one quick decisive motion . Being timid with it only gets crooked screws driven half way.I 'd recommend using the shortest screws you can get by with until you get profficient with it.So there 's a bit of an art to it ( and this applies to all drywall guns , not just this one ) . But nothing you should n't be able to pick up very quickly.There are other good ones out there , but nothing I 'd recommend over this one.And if you 're thinking cordless - do n't do it . Cordless tools have their place , but this is n't one of them . As mentioned above , you want to keep this thing pegged as you 're popping screws in . Having a power cord attached to you is a very small price to pay for never having to worry about a constantly diminishing battery charge . ( oh and only 4 stars because the instructions really are kind of useless , and I think they should include a case with some extra bits - they have to box the thing anyways , how much more would a blow molded case cost them instead ? 50 cents ? ... The tool itself gets 5 stars )	1
Have hung my share of drywall over the years ( not as a pro ) and always used either hammer and drywall nails or a cordless drill with a bit to drive screws . This drywall screwdriver really speeds up the process -- even for a small room . It does take a while to get the hang of it , however , because unless you drive the in screw perfectly straight , it wo n't seat properly and you 'll have to back it out and try again . I 'd practice driving a few screws on a scrap of drywall first to get the knack of using it and to adjust the depth setting for your job before beginning work -- the screw should be just below the surface of the paper so you do n't hit it with a taping knife -- if the knife & # 34 ; clicks & # 34 ; on the screw when you go over it , you need to set the depth a little lower .	1
If your a tradesman or a homeowner hanging drywall this is the tool for you . I 've been in the construction business for over 30 years and believe me I know a lot about screwing things . The variable speed is a must and the long lasting Dewalt tool saves you money by not having to purchase another one after the first job you use it on . Where speed and top quality is needed , the Dewalt name and tool comes to the aid . Believe me , buy this tool and you wo n't be unhappy.Larry Hobson	1
Got ta agree with others who find this one of the best , easiest to use guns out there . I gave up on my Porter Cable gun after 2 switches gave out ( $ 45 ea ) . This gun is comfortable and lightweight . 5 stars !	1
I looked at several competitive products and chose this one . This is a very good tool . It is easy to handle as it is light , yet powerful , and the trigger is large . These features give you good control esp with larger screws . I have driven up to 3 inch screws with ease . The nosecone takes some practice to adjust , but once you figure it out , it performs very nicely . My only complaint is that the instructions provided are kind of sparse and you end up figuring out how to use the tool by yourself . Not a big issue , however , as the tool is very simple.Overall , very satisfied ! !	1
This is a life saver , and delivers as promissed , but is way over priced for what it is.I cut a lot of yellow pine , which wants to pinch behind the blade . I 've had to shut the saw off too many times in the middle of a cut and pray for no kickback . That is why I knew it was time to invest in one of these before something went wrong . After ~30min setup on a Grizley 1023SL , I ca n't believe that I did n't buy one sooner . It is so easy to add and remove the splitter , that you keep it on the saw ! ! ! The only drawback is the price . Considering it cost half of what the saw cost me , it was hard to pony up that much cash . But I must say , that it is still cheaper than one trip to the ER .	1
I 've had this installed on my contractor 's saw for over a year now . It works great . Kickback almost eliminated . Recently the spring on one of the anti-kickback pawls broke . I fixed it , then it broke again . The thing still works though . The pawls are adjusted to hold the wood very very tight . Sometimes too tight . All in all , it 's a great product , and should be priced at around $ 50 to $ 75 dollars .	1
Delta 's information is best described by a four letter word starting with an S. So the next guy knows : I successfully installed this on a 10 '' Left-Tilt Contractor 's Saw , model number 36-979 . I was only able to use one screw , however it is attached and solid . I had minimal difficulties installing and aligning . At some point I may machine some form of block to act as future lockdown . My 36-979 came with three holes around the bracket , and I had to play a bit to find the one that fit best . Once on , it works fine .	1
After reading many articles on table saw kick back , I decided I did not want to be the next victim so I bought the Biesemeyer 78-431 T-Square Anti-Kickback Snap-In Spreader ( For Delta Left Tilt Unisaw ) . I removed the original blade guard and kickback device after one day of use . The blind spots were distracting and aggravating . When it came time to install my dado blade , there was the factory splitter . Aggravating to remove and more aggravating to install and align . Without completing the re-installation , I worked for a few weeks without both . MUCH nicer and no aggravations ! My conscience told me over and over to install a splitter so I bought the 78-431.Over priced ? Yes . Worth it ? Yes ! What is the cost of a finger or hand ? Much more in many ways than the cost of this splitter/ kickback device . DO NOT order the wrong unit . Right tilt and left tilt saws require their own order number.Installation was non-complex , bigger hands than mine might have some grief but that goes without saying when working in tight spaces . All of the original blade guard hardware must be removed . If you already installed and auxiliary out feed table , you may have to loosen a bolt or two and readjust it when you 're done . No big deal.Keep in mind that the splitter/kickback device is removable and replaceable in seconds ; also keep in mind that this splitter is for 1/8 '' blades only . Thin kerf blades will not work with this unit . A three horsepower and higher saw does not require a thin kerf blade . They are meant for lower horsepower contractor and bench saws since the thin kerf allows for easier cutting pressures.Some of the earlier Biesemeyer overhead blade guards came with a removable splitter that sold separately for about $ 30.00 . The 78-431 is about $ 130.00 and more meaty than the thirty dollar freebee.I use this splitter/kickback device faithfully and never had a problem . Here 's to all my fingers ! ! Thank you Biesemeyer !	1
This outfeed table is well worth the price paid . Assembly took me about half a day , but I was n't in any rush . It color-matches the light grey of the Unisaw nicely . I really like the 12 '' fixed portion of the table- it helps on follow-through for smaller work pieces which do n't necessarily require use of the full outfeed table . I 'd like to reiterate what one of the reviewers said earlier that , unfortunately , when the table is not in use and hanging down adjacent to the saw , the single support leg of the table completely blocks the saw 's exhaust port . I would rather see a support leg on each corner of the table , which would allow access for a 4 '' hose to attach to the exhaust port AND would provide a bit more stability for the extended outfeed table . A hose can still be attached , but the lowered table will not be able to drop to a completely vertical position . I would still recommend this table .	1
I 've had mine attached to a jet cabinet saw for about a year now . I experienced poor packaging too . Though not severe enough to send it back , one of the corners came buggered up . Mine is particle board ... .or a very low quality MDF . The sides are skinned with a melamine rather than a laminate.Ok , that 's the bad . This table works , and works well . I wrestled with building my own but in hind site it would be tough to make one as sturdy , light , and with folding capabilities . My shop is in my garage and it 's sometimes shared with the car , so having a folding table is nice . The design is very flexible so it should attach to almost any cabinet saw ( requires some drilling in your cabinet ) . It uses lots of angle iron and fastners but the instructions are enough to get you through it . Once installed it makes sheet cutting a breeze . I ca n't believe I used roller supports for so long . It 's expensive for what it is ... .basically painted angle iron , fastners , and a cheezy table board . But it works great . I would buy it again .	1
I bought this knowing it was not designed for my Delta TS300 , but I also knew that it was modifiable . I have posted pictures of how I set mine up.I basically threw away the instructions after reading through it once to get the basic idea of how the parts fit together . I then assembled the stationary subassembly part of the table and test fitted it to my saw . I then marked the 4 holes to be drilled and where I would need to add a horizontal brace along the lower part of the table saw stand . This brace I made out of a 2x4.I then disassembled the parts and started assembling it directly to the table . The pieces have a lot of adjustment built in by using slotted holes , so as long as you get the 4 holes drilled in the right place on the table saw , you can get it aligned . Precise alignment ( as suggested in the original instructions ) was not needed . You do have to be careful though to align at least one slot for your miter/cross-cut slide . I do n't need both channels , but if I did I could cut out a section of the stationary table top with my router.Once I got the metal pieces bolted in place , I again test-fitted the stationary table top piece to make the final mark for cutting off the edge so that I had clearance for the fence slide . After making this cut ( allowing for about an 1/8th inch fence clearance ) , I assembled the stationary top in place , aligned it and checked for flatness and tightened the bolts.Adding the big folding table to the hinge was then trivial and required no adjustments or cutting . You also do n't need 2 people , because one end can rest on the floor while you insert the screws . My TS300 is on a wheeled stand , so the vertical brace is not long enough . The simplest solution was to just put a wood block under the vertical brace made of glued 2x4 pieces . Problem solved.This is a really great table extension and I 'm very happy with it . It converts my TS300 into a professional level saw . The extension also does n't get in the way of using my Bench Dog router extension . This project took 3 hours , with 1 hour spent on thinking about assembly and test fitting the pieces with 2 hours spent on actual assembly . I took my time and did n't rush , and measured twice before drilling or cutting anything .	1
First , no cabinet saw should be without an outfeed table.I purchased this one for my JET Xacta saw . It required drilling a few holes in the cabinet , and removing the splitter/ blade guard . It took about 3 hours to install , but it fits perfectly . This is an excellent addition to an already great saw . It really make the saw more useable , and more importantly , safer.Having seen up close how the table is made , I could have made one myself . However , I would have spent half the cost of the table in materials , and longer than I 'd like in making it . I like making furniture , not outfeed tables .	1
Mine arrived yesterday without incident . No damage to the table at all but I can see how others have had problems . Packing was not the best.The unit is very easy to install - it takes a couple of hours . I own a late model Unisaw and all the holes are pre-drilled in the cabinet for this table which made the installation very smooth.Regarding other comments about cutting the table - Either I missed it in the instructions or they took it out , but I did n't see anything that said to cut the table if you 're installing it on a newer model.My only complaint is with the 5/8 '' carriage bolts they ship with the unit . In a couple cases , they are barely long enough to get any thread on the nut and fit the pieces together . It 's a very minor thing though and in the end it went together easily.Fit and finish are good . I can never understand why Delta uses cheap particle board when there are much better materials available . With care though , it appears that it will last as long as the rest of the tool .	1
___________________________________________________My Motivation for Purchasing the Out Feed TableI purchased the Delta 50-302 out feed table to extend the bed of my Delta 36-L51X Unisaw . Prior to this I had been using roller stands as out feed support when ripping long stock . The problem with roller stands is that it is difficult to get them the exact height of the saw table , and even if you do , this wo n't work when ripping long stock because the stock tends to droop below the table height before it makes contact with the roller . So now you 're in a predicament . Do you continue to force the stock through the saw and hope it rides up and over the roller ? Do you stop the saw and move the roller forward to support the work , only to discover that the shortened support distance from the saw table causes the stock to tip up and over like a teeter-totter when the cut is complete ? Do you use several rollers in series ? The answer is none of the above , you forget the rollers and purchase an out feed table.The potential of a good saw is either limited or fully realized depending upon the quality its side and out feed support . Therefore in addition to the out feed table , I strongly recommend purchasing the side extension table too ! With a good out feed support and side extension support , your expensive saw can do all the big jobs it is capable of.___________________________________________________Packing and ShippingThe packing of the out feed table was of superior quality . It came in a very heavy gauge cardboard carton . The contents were packed well and reached my door step in perfect condition . Many reviewers noted that their table was damaged in shipping due to less than quality packaging . Not so in my case . Perhaps Delta has responded to all the negative customer feedback.___________________________________________________AssemblyOverall the design of the support structure for this out feed table appears to have been taken straight from the Rube Goldberg text book on over complicated design and difficult ways to achieve simple results . It appears as though the assignment to design this out feed table was handed to some young mechanical engineer fresh out of college as his very first task at his new company . Furthermore it appears that the senior engineers and management at Delta neglected to conduct any design reviews on his work . Assembly of this table is exasperating at best.The table has two angle braces that bolt at the lower end to the bottom of the saw cabinet , and bolt at the top end to two horizontal supports that extend from the top of the saw cabinet . For some reason , the two bolts that are used to attach the bottom of the braces are radically different from one another even though both bolts perform the same function . There is no mention of the reason for this in the assembly instructions . These bolts are inserted from the outside the saw cabinet and the nuts are connected from inside the saw cabinet . In order to connect the nuts to the bolts you have to remove the injection molded plastic motor cover . It is almost impossible to connect the nut to the bolt for the angled support brace that is the furthest away from the saw motor cover . The distance you have to reach into the saw base to attach this nut is much longer than my arm . I could n't hold the support brace with one hand and at the same time wrap my arm around the cabinet and stick my arm in the motor cover hole to attach the nut . This is definitely a two person job , and one person has to have very long arms.Some of the previous reviewers warned about not following the assembly instruction that tells you to cut ? inch off the end of the stationary table . I followed their advice , did not make any cuts , and the table fit perfectly.When the assembly of the out feed table is complete , it 's clear that you will never want to disassemble it even if the saw needs to packed up for moving across the Atlantic . The pain of re-assembly would be just too strong of a deterrent.___________________________________________________Using the Out Feed TableWith that said , after the table assembly is complete the out feed table does the job for which it was intended . I am extremely happy with it . It significantly enhances the operational capabilities my saw and it definitely increases the safety of using my saw . The inherent difficulty of ripping long stock or 4x8 sheets of plywood essentially vanishes when the saw has proper out feed and side extension support.The table has other uses too . I find that when I 'm not using the saw , the table comes in handy as additional work bench space . I even use it as out feed support for my planer.After having used the table for a few months , I wonder how I got along without it before . Would I purchase this table again if necessary ? The answer is yes I absolutely would .	1
I 'm a pretty frugal person and like to build something myself if it 'll save me a few bucks . So I hesitated to buy this outfeed table . But eventually I did and it has been just fabulous . Really , really helpful . It really is n't worth trying to jerry-rig something yourself when this product is available.Like all Delta products , unless you were the engineer who designed the product and wrote the owner 's manual , the assembly instructions are essentially one big puzzle ( you 'd think after all these years Delta might actually clue in and write these things in English and test them with real people who are n't associated with the product ... ) . But once you translate the instructions and essentially figure out how to put the thing together yourself , you 'll love it . It is really well made , like most Delta products and performs beautifully.Do n't debate . If you have the money , just buy it ! You wo n't be disappointed ...	1
I just installed this on my Enlon cabinet saw . Enlon had the best value award from one of the woodworking magazines back in 1994-1995 . I just followed the installation instructions for older Delta Unisaws that are included . Like others have said though , do n't cut anything off the table ( the directons tell you to cut off a half inch or more ) . I did n't and it fits perfectly flush with the saw table . I have a Delta Unifence on my Enlon , but if you have the original Enlon fence still , then you will need to cut some of the table off to clear the back fence rail . Better yet , upgrade the fence first . I did need the 2 wood supports ( 30.125 '' long in my case ) but they did n't need to be 2x2 as the directions state . I just used some scrap that was maybe 1 x 1.5 . I had to drill 4 holes in the cabinet to install the bolts as described in the directions . I tilted the saw up and stuck a 2x4 under it so I could reach under to stick one of the bolts through from below . That was about as tough as it got though . I finished the job in about 2 hours . By the way , I had previously installed the Delta Unifence ( 50 '' ) and the mobile base on this saw . Both fit perfectly . Enlon dimensions seem to be the same as the Unisaw . Enon later became known as Star . Now both are defunct I believe .	1
The Delta 50-302 Outfeed Table is just the right size if your space is limited and you need portability . I also like the fact that when putting my saw in it 's stored position , this unit folds down . There is nothing to remove . The adjustable leg comes in handy on my uneven floor . In seconds , I can have this table opened and adjusted to flatness.It is a very sturdy table . The hardware may be intimidating , but assembly was pretty easy . I installed the table by myself using a few clamps and a 2 x 4 for support while installing the hinge.After several months use , the table is just as nice as when I installed it . It even comes in handy as an extra glue up and assembly space . I place a sheet of ultra-light MDF on top of the saw and Outfeed table for a full 4 x 8 surface to work on . This protects both the saw and table from scratches and glue drippings . Storing the MDF is more difficult than folding down the table !	1
Was going to just build my own originally but for the price I figured I would save myself some time and buy this with the saw . Glad I did . Well built and works very well ( ca n't say the same for the extension table that came with the saw ) . For the time I would have spent making my own it would not have been worth it . Use this every time i use the saw . I very rarely collapse the table down but when I do , it collapses easily and always returns to the same position .	1
The hardware for this Outfeed table , fit perfectly on my 31-L31X Delta Unisaw , and went together well . All hardware , for the table , came packaged in a box , inside the main packaging box , and was delivered intact . The two laminated table sections were not delivered intact . Amazon delivered this item on time , but Delta blew it in the packaging , ... ... .big time . I returned the first order because the table sections were loose and the corners on both table sections had been broken . The fixed section of the table was very warped . The next shipment was n't much better . Three corners broken on the laminated table sections and the fixed section was warped , but not warped as bad as the first one . I was about to return this item also , but I talked with Amazon and told them what was happening about the defective packaging that Delta was using . I told them that all I really needed was the hardware and I could make my own table out of plywood , using the broken sections as a pattern . They gave me a discount to keep the second shipment , and I was extremely pleased . The hardware seems to be very well designed and with minimal effort , one can fabricate their own table sections . I did notice on the fixed table section that the miter slots were way out of being perpendicular to the leading or trailing edge . It looked like the slots were cut when the section was not squared up in the cutting machine . This table is definitely an asset when cutting sheet goods or long boards .	1
Overall this is a nice product , but make sure you read the directions from front to back before assembling . You do n't have to cut anything on the newer Unisaws . Fortunately , I heeded that warning from other reviewers . I have a slight ding in the corner of the out feed table . Do n't think this was from shipping since there was no damage to the carton , and it was packed well . Probably mishandling at the factory . After seeing this and the maximum 1/64 '' thickness of the lamination , I plan on banding the sides with hardwood . It wo n't be long before I add my own dents . I agree with other reviewers . The instructions are horrible . The mistakes in the instructions have been there for a long time . Correct them Delta ! It does work and save me space when folded down . The brackets are nice and heavy . I gave it a four due to the horrible instructions and thinness of the lamination .	1
I modified this Delta outfeed table to fit my Sawstop tablesaw . I took some work but its well worth it . The small stationary support has rabbets to clear the miter slide and because its always in place its very handy for pieces less than 48 '' . The flip up/down extension is great for safely and accurately ripping long boards and sheet goods . This outfeed is an excellent buy for a small shop when you consider just the cost of the hardware . I 'm not sure way so many have received them with broken pieces . Mine was packed well and received in perfect condition . Maybe Delta improved the packing.You might ask why I would go through the trouble of modifying the Delta outfeed ? Well currently the only ready made flip up/down outfeed for the Sawstop is a pivoting roller rack , which is almost identical to the one I put on my old PM66 . Its was a very sturdy unit but I did n't like the roller rack because it let small work pieces fall through or wedge between the rollers , and I had to constantly lower it to clear the miter slides on jigs/guides . If you forget to raise it back up , boards can and do slide back towards the blade . Now I know that if the guard is in place this is n't a problem , but I use a lot of jigs that do n't work with a guard . That 's way I bought a Sawstop which has at a riving knife in place most of the time and a blade brake all the time.The modifications are relatively simple . Viewing the saw from the outfeed looking towards the saw 's back , there is a space between the 4 '' dust connection and the conduit box where you can install the right vertical support . By placing the holes for the left supports an inch or two off the left edge , all the slotted brackets line up pretty good . I am not going into detail on the dimensions because you 'd need a drawing to give you every detail . You may need to do a partial assembly to estimate the location before drilling the holes . Just know it can be done if you use the Delta instructions and a little ingenuity.I ripped about an 1 1/2 '' off the 12 '' short stationary piece to fit in between the tablesaw top and end of the Delta supports . Then chamfered the lead edge of that short stationary piece . I did that before installation because that was mentioned in a previous review . Thanks to that reviewer for the heads-up . I also widen the rabbet on the short stationary piece to line up with the Sawstop miter slots which differ slightly from the Delta 's . I eventually replaced the stock piece with a custom plywood and laminate piece 7/8 '' thick with narrower rabbets in the exact location .	1
This base fits my Grizzly cabinet saw perfectly . Great quality as it moves this 650 pound saw with ease . Much better than the universal bases offered elsewhere ( including Grizzly ) .	1

Finally a way to move my Unisaw without huffing and puffing while dragging it to a new location . Great price too !	1
Great product from Delta - I have several of these and they have n't let me down . They fit exactly and it makes a difference over the universal base . Easy to move and adjust .	1
If you own Unisaw , or any other large heavy machine for that matter , you really should consider getting a mobile base . Delta 's bases are strong , sturdy , look good and are very stable . When I upgraded to a Unisaw , I also bought the mobile base . My Unisaw actually is easier to move around than my contractors saw used to be . With a quick step on the foot lever it effortly raises onto the large swivel wheel and the Unisaw can be moved very easily . A quick flip of your foot to raise the lever and lower the saw and it rests solidly on 4 points , making it very stable . This design of mobile base make large heavy machines very easy to move around and manouver . If your workshop is smaller than you wished it was , put your machines on one of these bases and you 'll find your machines take up less space and your shop will seem larger .	1
this base is 1in too small in each direction to fit the old style cast iron unisaw base . get a HTC HSJ-152 , HSB-152 , OR HSG-152 any one of these will fit depending on which fence you use . I have used this base it is very sturdy and a great purchase for the newer unisaws .	1
I bought this for my Grizzly 1023SL Table Saw . The base dimensions are as advertised and it was a perfect fit . The saw is easy to roll around and is rock solid when lowered.Perfect job Delta .	1
Have a Grizzly G0690 on this . Easy to move on the concrete floor and stays put when you want it too.Initially I was concerned that the bottom corner supports look to only be tack-weld in place rather than having a bead across the whole mating connection but its holding a 500+ lbs saw just fine .	1
Amazon supplied me the Mobile Base , Delta 50-333 , that goes with my 6 '' Jointer , Delta 37-275 . Shipment was quick , and I 'm very happy with the Mobile Base purchase.The Base is generally well designed , beautifully made , and easy to assemble . Moving the 225-lb . Jointer is a breeze using the Base , yet the Jointer is stable for use when the caster wheel is raised allowing the 2 corner feet of the Base to contact the floor ( 4-point support ) .One safety flaw in the Base : it does n't appear that the mounting hole patterns in the Base & Jointer were designed to match up . There are 8 mounting holes in the bottom of the Base and 4 mounting holes in the bottom of the Jointer , but a bolt will go through both at only one corner.The top-heavy Jointer should be bolted to the Mobile Base at all 4 corners because otherwise , the Jointer could tip over if you hit a bump moving it around or in the event of a mild earthquake . If the Jointer could be bolted to the base at all 4 corners , it would be much less likely to ever tip over .	1
Just the best device to move your equipment.With out them I could not have the machines because there would not be enough room in my basement shop and I do not wish to heat another space.They are over priced for what they are but to some of us a necessity . Good quality and function .	1
Found this for my Delta Jointer and was excited because it was $ 10 more than a universal kit and its much sturdier since it 's welded . works well . rolls pretty good for small wheels . Good value if you need some wheels and dont want to raise up your tools .	1
Well , I got it free with a Delta promotion ... ... ... But I 'd actually pay for it now that I have it . It works well .	1
This is my second Delta 'custom fit ' base . It fits just as it should and rolls decent even on my fairly rough older basement floor . Even with a top heavy tool like a jointer , it is pretty stable while rolling , you 'd really have to do something silly to tip it over . If tipping is a fear , see my last paragraph ! It comes to you with the third wheel and foot lever detatched , and that goes together in less time than it takes to find the wrenches to do the job . . . even if your tools are organized . I give it 5 stars since it 's the best thing out there for your jointer and goes on simply.If you have a garage shop and rough transitions out to get to your driveway ( bumps over 1 '' high , grates , etc ) and need to roll past those to use your tool in the driveway , I would not recommend this base . . . you may in fact be better off building something.My other base from Delta is on a Jet 14 '' closed base band saw . . . it 's made for Delta 's 14 '' Band saw , and the Jet base has a smaller footprint . For that reason , I bolted a piece of CDX plywood onto the base through the existing holes , and then mounted my bandsaw to the wood the same way . That allowed me to add a 50 lb . bag of gravel inside the cabinet ( sealed neatly in the bag , not dumped in ) , giving me more mass and stability than the saw had before the base was installed . I may do the same with the jointer , time will tell .	1
A perfect fit shipped on time at a very good price.Identical to the OEM knife set . Planer runs like new .	1
I did a lot of research to find the right blades at the best price . Amazon had the best price and I would purchase through them again . The blades are easy to install with a tool I believe you can also buy through Amazon . A must have if you own a planer .	1
I 'm glad these are still available for what is now a pretty old planer ! They work just fine .	1
Both edges of the two blades are extremely sharp as should be . No pits or imperfections . Well packaged . Getting harder to find for this aging planer .	1
I installed these blades as replacements on my Delta 22-540 planer and was very pleased with how sharp they were and how easy it was to install them . Once installed these knives have done a great job for me on red oak , q/s white oak , pine , and poplar.I have owned this planer for years now and I find that these double edged knives are a great value . By flipping them over when they get dull they last me a long time .	1
This is an update to a review I placed here 5 years ago . These blades are still a good bargain but I just learned that they can not be re-sharpened . I sent them to Burn 's Tool sharpening service and they responded that the blades were `` disposable , and will not sharpen nicely '' . BUT it took me 5 years to dull 1 1/2 sets of knives ( 3 edges ) , so I am not terribly disappointed . If anyone knows somewhere that will sharpen these knives , ( at a cost less that just buying new ones ) , please leave comment here .	1
This is the first time I am commenting on someone else ' comment . John Wendt made some excellent suggestions . I , too , have planed a lot of board feet and his suggestions ( except wetting the wood ) are what I have been doing for years . The only other suggestion is that you wax or lubricate the table often . This , too , puts less strain on the machine and does a better job of planing . I use good quality car wax but there are other products available . I am going to try the trick of wetting hardwoods . It makes sense . I have a jointer and many other woodworking tools with blades that need to be sharpened . If I had my way there would be a federal law requiring tool manufacturers to make machines with the same blade setup as this Delta planer . I have wasted a lot of time installing and aligning blades and it is such sweet relief to just pop the blades in this tool and move on to woodworking . A final thing about this Delta planer . I have had it 16 years and it wo n't wear out . I have replaced the rollers once . It is a great tool and Delta does a good job producing very sharp blades that are easy to install .	1
Okay -- I have the planer , and I have bought the spare blades . Both are great . I have a Makita planer as well , and the Delta , in my opinion , rates right up there with it . I just want to write a few words about the importance of sharp blades , and how to keep them that way.When you replace the blades , you are going to notice an immediate difference . The new blades are exceptionally sharp . The planer will make a lot less noise , and the wood will slide through easily . This goes for very wide planks of very hard woods . The two hardest woods I have planed are bubinga ( used for guitar backs ) and olivewood . Both are dense , hard , and heavy . A 12 '' wide board seems to glide through with a new blade.The thing is , a new blade does n't stay `` new '' for that long , particularly if you are planing a lot , and are planing hard woods . So -- after years and years of planing -- here are a few things I have learned for keeping your blades sharp.First -- sharpen them with the Hone-Mate , which you can get from Woodworker 's Supply ( [ ... ] This tool is meant for jointers , but it works great on planer blades , and the best thing is , you can sharpen them right there on the planer without taking them off . In 5 minutes , you 're done . This will easily triple the life of your blades . It costs about $ 40 , and I recommend the diamond version.Second -- sharpen often . The duller a blade is , the faster it wears -- both on itself , on the planer , and on your nerves as you try to force a piece of wood through an increasingly noisy planer . Sharpening often also reduces nicks and tear-outs.Third -- plane in the right direction . Most woods , particularly hardwoods , have a certain slope to their grain . Feel the wood , with the grain , from one side to the other . Your hand will probably slide over it more easily in one direction than the other . The direction that your hand slides over smoothest is the direction that you should be feeding your board into the planer . It will give you a smoother board and save your blades some wear.Finally -- if your wood is really hard , wet it with a sponge before planing . Let the water soak in for about 30 seconds . This dramatically softens the grain , and eases planing . Do n't worry too much about the wood getting wet and warping . With hardwoods , the water does n't soak in much , and the wet wood is removed in one or two passes through the planer . I have used this technique when my blades were beyond sharpening and I did n't have a spare on hand.I 've planed literally thousands of board feet with my two planers . Sharp blades are a joy to work with , and take a lot of frustration out of woodworking . I hope these suggestions are useful . In any case , your blades will eventually wear out , so keep a set of spares on hand . Happy woodworking !	1
I 've had my Delta planer for quite awhile now . In its lifetime it has had hundreds of board feet of hard and soft wood passed thru its portels . Much of this wood has been some of the hardest stuff on the planet . Mesquite , Quebracho , Vera , Mistol and white Oak just to name a few . I am on the first edge of my second set of knives . As in all planers , knife adjustment is critical , and with these knives it is as simple as tying your shoelace . Knives are sharp enough to shave with out of the pkg , and the locater holes make alignment a snap . Getting four cutting edges for this price makes the whole package a five star unit . I 've had my problems with some Delta products , but this is n't one of them.Love the planer and love these knives . Highly recommend .	1
Best of all , these blades are easy to find .	1
these knives are ok. they do n't last too long as they are only steel , not carbide . next time i would spend the xtra and get carbide ones . these knives go dull in just soft wood , as is expected from a steel knife . these delta knives are good for what they are.go carbide .	1
I purchased this stand for my belt/disc sander and it fits perfectly . I also discovered it is just right for my bench top drill press so I purchased another . Nice and sturdy with convenient storage underneath .	1
This stand is rock solid and will easily support several hundred pounds of weight . There is absolutely no flex or give in this stand . Assembly takes about 10 minutes using 16 bolts . Lower shelf has a raised lip so tools and parts wo n't roll off . The top is heavy gauge steel about 1/8 inch thick . The bottom leg protectors are of plastic and fit very secure . Each of these protectors offer a hole for anchor attachment to the floor.This stand impressed me enough to buy another without second thought .	1
I 've purchased two of these Delta tool stands so far and really like them a lot . One of them was for use with my Scheppach M90460 4 X 36 belt/disc sander and the other was for my Delta 28-150 bench top band saw , both of which have worked out great.This stand is manufactured in Taiwan , but is well made as well as extremely rigid and stable after all twenty-four 5/16 '' carriage bolts and nuts are tightened . It actually resembles a steel saw horse when assembled and the overall dimensions of the lower legs are only about 31 '' L X 21-1/2 '' W , so it does n't take up too much valuable floor space . Basic assembly was fairly simple and straight forward requiring just a 1/2 '' box wrench and all of the necessary hardware was included . The top looks to be heavy 10-gauge stamped steel and actually drops down over the top of the legs to give a nice finished look . For some reason , the picture here on Amazon 's site shows the legs mounted on the outside , which you 'll notice is wrong if you take a look at the picture on the box itself and on delta 's website . The rubber feet give the stand good grip on my concrete floor and the additional 14-1/2 '' X 23-3/4 '' steel shelf is handy for storing things like a miter gauge and rip fence . I lined the shelf with some rubber tool drawer mat to cushion it and keep things from sliding around.I probably would have preferred that there were no pre-drilled holes in the top because it kind of looks like Swiss cheese , so I covered it with a piece of 3/4 '' plywood then positioned the tool where I wanted and drilled down through both the plywood and steel top to mount it . My particular tools were n't listed as ones that lined up with any of the pre-made hole patterns anyway , so no big deal as I was already prepared to have to drill it out . Overall , I 'm very pleased with these stands . The fit and finish are excellent and I would have no problem recommending them .	1
This is a great stand , I installed a small table saw on it . The saw is wider then the stand 's base but it is stable and does not move or tip at all . I did have to cut the legs down 6 inches for the saw to be the right height ( a grinder made quick work of it ) . In all the stand is very well built made from heavy gauge steel parts , carriage bolts , and rubber feet , this stand could hold up my truck ! The only con I see is the top of the stand is only 10 '' wide . If i were to mount a drill press , grinder , or band saw i would buy and use this stand again .	1
Although I had to drill holes to fit my Craftsman drill press , the basic setup was reasonably easy . The result was a very sturdy little stand -- perfect for many bench top tools . Its weight and construction make for a very stable base . Comparing it to , for example , a similar stand ( sold by the same store from which I bought the drill press , ) there is simply no comparison to be made . This Delta stand is far superior . I will probably buy another soon for my bench grinder .	1
The Delta 12 & quot ; drill press is OK for a bench top model . I was disappointed in the chuck as it tends to stick and requires using the key at all times rather than just for final tightening . Also I believe I would rather have had the 5/8 & quot ; chuck that comes on the 16 & quot ; floor model more than the 1/2 & quot ; chuck supplied with the 12 & quot ; . For the extra hundred and fifty ( approx ) bucks I should have bought the larger floor model and got better capacity , longer quill stroke , larger and more stable table for mounting fences and jigs , etc.In the 12 & quot ; presses defense , it was and is the nicest of the benchtop models I have seen .	1
I was very impressed with the 12 & quot ; Delta benchtop drill press . The 12 & quot ; handles everything I need it for and also has an impressive number of accessory toys available to upgrade it ( mortising attachement , etc. ) . It weighs a ton so I would highly recommend finding a place for it and mounting it there -- it 's not a lot of fun to try and move around . As for the lamp accessory -- it 's worthless . That 's why I rated it a 4 versus a 5 . It attaches with a magnet ... and then it slides down and falls off . Overall , I would recommend this product without reservation . Just supply your own light .	1
This is a good drill press that is working fine for me . After reading some of the other reviews I made sure to set the chuck well using a medium sized hammer and a scrap block of wood . To tell the truth my only complaint is how long it took to assemble this but since I only have to do this once , it really makes no difference .	1
I 'm getting exactly the performance from this tool as I expected . If you want a compact unit , this will do . If you need something with larger capacity , better get something bigger . Speed adjustment is very easy . The chuck is a bit sticky and I broke teeth off the chuck key right away . Maybe it was my fault , but I 've used drill presses for years and never had this happen . I started using the other side of the key after this happened , and SNAP ! it happened again . I 'll get a quality key . BE CAREFUL !	1
Great , inexpensive machine ! Easy to set up ( It is HEAVY ) Once again , Delta makes set up simple and easy to follow . This one comes covered in heavy oil , so a clean up rag is a good idea while setting up . I also wore latex gloves to prevent my hands from getting greasy and slipping . Functionally this is a superb machine , easy to change speeds , excellent directions , perfect and flawless functionality . For a benchtop model , this is the best . At the best price .	1
This drill press is great . Easy to put together , easy to change speeds , easy ( sort of ) to carry around . It looks and acts just like a floor model . There is plenty of room with the table all the way down for 99 % of drilling I do . Overall great deal .	1
I purchased this machine about 3 months ago ... I have used the drill press for making holes as well as sanding with various size drums on many types of wood . The machine has worked very well on all occasions and I am very pleaased with its operations.The only two draw backs are 1 . ) the need to use the chuck to get the bit either tightened or loosened from start to finish , ca n't use my hand to get most of the way there and do the final tightening with the chuck and 2 . ) the finish is n't very good . I know the finish does not affect the overall performance , but sends a negative message about the factory 's pride in workmanship.All said , I would buy this machine again as I think its cost and performance match up well .	1
& quot ; For the money & quot ; is the key phrase here . Compared to buying a dedicated mortiser or doing it by hand this tool is chpear than the former and quicker than the latter . The good things are that it does work . Once you have it installed , aligned , and tweaked it seems to work fine . I use it in oak without a problem . People who are burning or breaking bits may need to adjust the position of the dril vs the position of the square chisel . Or maybe they have a defect of some sort . It seems to help if you back out often and allow the bit to clear itself of debris.Now for the bad . The molded plastic case seems like it does n't really fit . There are not slots for all the piece and no matter how you put the parts in it does n't seem quite right . This seems like a pretty obvious mistake so I assume Delta is just too lazy to address this . The setup requires a bit of patience and time . If the bit is not exactly square to the fence you get some wacky looking holes . Lots of fussy screws , knobs , etc.Overall this is better than not having a mortiser and the price is right . I would buy it again since I do n't want or need to invest the money or storage space required for a dedicated mortiser .	1
I almost sent this thing back , since it did n't fit correctly on my Craftsman 15 & quot ; drill press . Once I did some necessary modifications , however , ( a couple of washers as spacers , mounting it a little lower on the quill collar , etc . ) I was able to get it to work and decided to keep it anyway . Most of all , I like the versatility this kit adds to my old drill press . I figured I needed a dedicated mortiser clogging up my little shop as much as I need a ( square ) hole in my head ! I do n't think the set-up is that bad - although I quickly disconnected Delta 's & quot ; handy & quot ; spring loaded spline wrenches on their fence hold-down bolts . ( I do n't know how your supposed to start the bolt on the nut with those things getting in your way - I just keep them handy for final snugging ) Anyway , I find set-up to be a simple two step process : ( 1 ) slip on the collar and the load the desired size mortise bit/chisel , and ( 2 ) bolt the auxiliary fence to your table . Too keep everything square , I just clip a 12-inch ruler or straight stick to the back side of the chisel and set the fence at the desired clearance on both ends of the ruler.I find the whole set-up time similar to setting up a dado on the table saw - it takes a little measuring , but once you 've done it a couple of times it 's no big deal.I probably would 've given 5 stars if this had fit my drill . I still ca n't figure out why it did n't , maybe I 'm reading my model number wrong ...	1
Heavy weight and works . Does every thing it is supposed to do.The unit is designed for several brands of drill presses , but fit my Ryobi Drill press perfectly.While it takes a few moments to grasp the concept of drilling square holes , and following through the setup steps , the end result is quite worth it . The bits are very sharp and handled my pvc project with no effort . The plastic storage case is durable and makes for convenient storage . Item is well recommended .	1
I 've read other reviews regarding this item , and have to agree Delta really got lazy with the kit case for it . Things are jumbled into it with no place for them to be , just piled on top of other components , wherever there 's room . The tool itself is what I expected , does the job , and fits my drill press fine . For a shop with not a lot of available space , versatility is a must , and this is a reasonable alternative to a bench top mortising machine .	1
I purchased this attachment a couple months ago , and it has proven to be a real surprise . Since it is an inexpensive tool , with the more inexpensive chisels and bits included , I did n't expect it to be a precision tool , but it really does well . I have now used it to make mortises in red oak , white pine , and southern yellow pine , and am glad that I did n't spend more money than I did . The other reviewers are absolutely correct that set-up is time consuming , but for a hobbyist woodworker like me , it does the job efficiently , cheaply , and well . I would definitely purchase this item again .	1
This works , it 's cheaper than a mortise machine by about three hundred bucks . If you do n't use one very often , this works good . If you have a delta drill press , set up is a breeze .	1
I purchased this for my Delta Platinum Contractor 's Saw with Unifence . Installation is pretty straight-forward , although I have to modified my Rockler outfeed table a bit to accommodate one of the mounting brackets . Once installed , the blade guard works very well . I particularly like the easily-removable splitter -- very handy when I am using my sliding table . My only gripe is that I wish there is a vacuum port in the blade guard . The saw dusts seem to be focused to fly directly back at you -- I guess that is a good reminder not to stand directly inline with the blade !	1
I use a Delta X5 contractor 's Saw as my primary table saw . I do just enough dado and tenon work that it spends most of its time without the blade guard or splitter in place . As the Delta is set up , removing and re-installing these is just bothersome enough to appeal to my lazy side . I finally put in a Merlin splitter a while back , which gave me some margin of safety , but the simple truth is that I needed a blade guard that floated over the blade . After some price and feature comparisons I decided to use the Uniguard.The Uniguard is one of the least expensive , and actually has a lot of features . It has a split guard , which means that , on short cuts , the guard is still down . It has an accessory tray and a place to mount an upper switch . It is one of the few guards that can be altered to fit a wide variety of saw tables . And it even looks cool - or as cool as a table saw add-on might look.I trimmed about 9 inches off of the upper pipe to get the Uniguard to fit with an acceptable overhang for my table placement . As you can see from other reviews installation can be a bit exciting , especially if you are trying to do it yourself . It 's actually fairly simple , but the weight of the main body of the guard is enough to make things awkward . The Merlin splitter wo n't work with the Uniguard in place , but the supplied splitter is quite good , and nearly as easy to switch out.One everything is in place and adjusted the Uniguard is a pleasure to work with . It never seems to be in the way and there is plenty of clearance . If you are looking for a reasonably priced blade guard with a lot of flexibility , the Uniguard is worth serious consideration . Especially if you have a friend to help you install it.One interesting thing . Klutz that I am , I managed to bring the guard down into the blade and take a chunk out of the middle piece ( the 'upper ' guard ) . While the saw continued to work fine I discovered that there is a wind tunnel effect under the guard and the blade would whistle loudly . When I put in the replacement part ( Delta parts and service is excellent , by the way ) I found I had to carefully adjust the guard to get rid of the noise . Now it 's fine and I 'm back to being a happy sawyer .	1
The Delta 34-976 Uniguard blade guard and splitter is a good choice for your Delta Contractor Saw or Unisaw ( and works with some other brands ) . There are similar and superior products out there ( Excalibur by Sommerville Design , Biesemeyer , Exaktor , Brett Guard ; search google for `` Tablesaw Splitters and Blade Covers '' for a review by Kelly Mehler ) , but the Uniguard is very good for the price . I have only minor complaints : no integrated dust collection ( as in more expensive units ) , and it took longer to install and align than I expected.Once installed , the unit offers a world of convenience and safety compared to the splitter and blade guard that came with your saw . For non-thru cuts , you can easily remove the splitter without tools , but still have the benefit of the blade guard.However , the big U-shaped tube may get in the way of cross-cutting long pieces of wood . On my Delta Contractor Saw with 32 '' extension table and the Uniguard installed , I am limited to about 62 '' to the right of the blade . A workaround is to loosen then bolts on the big tube and swing it back down and out of the way , but of course you wo n't have a blade guard ( unless you re-install the one that came with your saw , and you wo n't want to do that ) . The other workaround is to have the long part of the work to the left of the blade , but then you do n't get the benefit of the extension table.As others have reported , the package is rather large and somewhat heavy , partly because of the wood used to crate the unit . Mine arrived in excellent condition but was missing three flat washers for 3/8 '' bolts.To install the unit , you 'll need some wrenches ( socket , adjustable , etc ) of the usual sizes , both metric and fractional inch hex keys ( Allen wrenches ) of various sizes including the somewhat unusual 8mm size , and ( if using an extension table to the right of the blade ) a 9/64 '' drill ( I got by with a 1/8 '' drill ) . A square and steel ruler are useful for adjusting the splitter.I suggest you put a towel or rug on the floor when setting the U-tube down , to avoid marring it . Another thing I learned the hard way was that while installing the U-tube , which is quite heavy , you have to keep an eye on it until the screws are tightened . While looking down at one of the bolts , the top part of the tube decided to swing down and bonked me pretty good on the forehead . The tube is very heavy , and I was momentarily stunned by the blow , but it served as another reminder to be careful in the shop.The manual suggests that if you have a 30 '' Unifence and table extension , you can cut 12 '' from the large tube . I suggest that you refrain from doing this until you find your saw too bulky with the Uniguard installed . The extra 12 '' on the tube may come in handy if you want to have a work piece that is more than 52 '' to the right of the blade.For step 25 , I was unable to position the blade guard in a way that the blade cleared both the splitter and the blade guard when the blade is set to 45 degrees . The solution is given in step 26 , which I did n't notice at first.Overall I 'm satisfied with the unit , and believe it will make using my table saw both more safe and more enjoyable . I 'll save time over having to remove and reinstall the old blade guard the way I used to , but considering the time to install the Uniguard , payback wo n't come for awhile.UPDATE : I decided to build an outfeed table for my saw . Most designs expect to use the same holes in the back of the table that are needed to attach the big tube to the saw . As a result , having this blade guard installed seriously complicates attaching an outfeed table . I ended up using a piece of iron plate ( hardware store ) to join the wooden outfeed table , using the same bolts that hold the big tube . It works great now , but it was difficult to design , build , and install.UPDATE 2 : I 'd like to get an Incra TS-LS fence system , but the screw holes on the back of the saw are required by both the Uniguard and the Incra system . I do n't know if it is possible to have both installed on the saw at once - maybe by drilling some new holes ? UPDATE 3 : I got the Incra TS-LS fence system . It IS possible to install that fence system , and then install the Delta Uniguard Saw Blade Guard . Basically the brackets for the blade guard mount to bottom of the TS-LS real rail . It is straightforward and reliable to have them working together , and I 'm glad to have them both on my saw working together . The Incra TS-LS is a dream fence system for my table saw .	1
The Deluxe Uniguard is a good value at $ 270 - and I took advantage of Amazon 's $ 25 off sale so my final cost was $ 245 . Such a deal ! Now the details : The UPS people did their usual guerilla routine with the package . So even though Delta packs this guard very well using both wood and cardboard , UPS still destroyed it . On delivery day when I answered the doorbell , I found the 6 foot tall package at my door - one end crushed and wide open and the UPS driver already back in his truck and driving away.Upon inspection I found that the plastic accessory tray was cracked and that the splitter assembly was nowhere to be found . It 's probably on a UPS loading dock somewhere.I called Delta immediately and to my suprise , a human answered the phone ! No waiting , no music on hold and no message telling me how important my call was to them . They took my information and they agreed to send out replacement parts . Satisfied that I would n't need to return the rest of the unit , I decided to go ahead and install it.It was pretty straight forward and the instructions were clear . Just a couple of things I should mention . The clear plastic blade shields slip over a steel pin and are held by allen head set screws . It seemed that they required a tiny allen wrench . I mean really really tiny . Smaller than any I had ever seen before . I am embarassed to admit that I puzzled over this for a full 15 minutes before I figured out that the set screws had been installed backwards at the factory - on BOTH guard shields . Simple matter to unscrew them and put them in right . Sheesh ! Also , the instructions suggest cutting 12 inches off both the top and the bottom of the main `` J '' shaped steel tube if your fence is less than 52 inches ( mine is ) . Based on suggestions I read here on Amazon reviews I waited to cut mine and I 'm glad . In the end , I cut just 9 inches off mine for a perfect fit.And last , my shop-built right extension table has a double thickness top ( one and a half inches thick ) . This guard attaches to the saw at three points . Two are pre-drilled and tapped holes on the rear of the cast iron top of the unisaw . The third mount attaches with an `` L '' bracket to the underside of the extension table way out at the corner farthest from the saw . With my thicker table , the third mount was 3/4 '' lower than the other two . Fortunately , there was enough room on the mount to redrill it . Had my table been any thicker , I would have had to get more creative.The final installed guard is solid . I do n't plan to relocate my table saw 's ON/OFF switch to the supplied switch bracket but I installed the bracket anyway . I have found that it 's the perfect spot to attach one of those magnetic base task lights . Delta sells a light made just for the uniguard but the mounting holes for it are out on the detachable part of the uniguard . This would put it closer to the blade for brighter light but would also require you to deal with the electrical cord when you remove the guard for raised panel cuts . ***** WARNING - WARNING - WARNING *****I 'm editing my review to warn everyone that the Uniguard will prevent you from fully opening your motor cover . If you have a right tilt unisaw with the metal box-shaped motor cover you 'll find that it ca n't swing open more than about 6 inches before it hits the uniguard 's steel pipe . It opens far enough to get a vacuum hose in for cleaning or for one arm to reach in to feel around for that arbor nut you dropped inside ; ) but it wo n't open all the way after you install this guard.I called Delta and they said that 's `` normal '' and they suggested that I leave the cover off or unscrew the hinge each time I want to get full access . Seems to me that Delta should let us know these things before we buy .	1
As a woodworking beginner , I 'm very focused on safety . I 've read dozens of posts about fingers being severed on table saws . These accidents , it seems , are usually due to removed blade guards.The uniguard is a blade guard you wo n't remove . The two split halves rotate back independently , so you can still guard the blade when cutting very thin pieces . And the guard hangs from above and rests on the work , so you can use it when performing non-through cuts.The splitter that comes with the uniguard is its second great feature . It is easily removed for non-through cuts , and more to the point , easily replaced afterwards . The splitter is separate from the guard , so you can remove it and still guard the blade , unlike the standard blade guard that comes with the table saw.The quality of the uniguard is first rate . The large tube you see in the picture is heavy gauge steel . The only improvement I might suggest is making the blade guard ( the pieces directly over the blade ) were a little wider . I like the guard to be centered over the blade , but in this position , you ca n't fully tilt the blade without hitting the inside of the guard . All that means is that you have to shift the guard to the right an inch or two when you tilt the blade . Not a big deal . The tray on the big black bar is handy , but could stand to be an inch or two deeper and wider.My uniguard arrived in a rather heavy , long narrow box with 1/4 & quot ; plywood backing . Set up is relatively straightforward , and takes about an hour . Depending on your saw , you may have to drill a couple of holes in the underside of your extension table to mount the bracket , but that is a pretty simple procedure . Another pair of hands is useful in holding the big black bar while mounting ( it gets pretty heavy while trying to adjust it ) but I managed to do it alone . The instructions caution against having the power cord from the table saw motor come in contact with the guard . On my saw ( Delta 10 & quot ; contractors platinum edition ) this clearance is very tight , but there is no rubbing of the cord.As you can probably tell , I 'm convinced the uniguard adds considerably to the safety of my table saw . And , if for no other reason than I spent a chunk of change to get it , I 'll be using it every time I turn on the saw .	1
I bought this because I have an older Unisaw which can be difficult to fit into one of the other bases . Let me way that ripping down wood to fit into the base was fairly easy ( because of the aforementioned Unisaw ) . However , the base does flex some because of the use of wood when popping it up . I think I would have been better off using some 1-1/2 '' square tube instead of wood . Probably would have ended up stronger and it would have been easier to acquire for me.The next step will be to see if I can make one of the extension kits interface with this base . More to follow.Jun 2011 Update : I finally swapped out the 2x4 douglas fir for 1-1/2 '' square tubing . After drilling it out , priming and painting , the metal was installed without issue . I can say the base is far stronger now than it used to be and there is no flex when `` popping '' the stand up on its wheel to move it around . As a bonus , semi-gloss Rust-Oleum paint blends in with the original Delta paint , giving the base a more factory made look.All in all , very much an improvement .	1
Bought one 5+ years ago for Jet contracor table saw . Made it up with oak . Took a little while , but nothing overwhelming . Been using it ever since and it has held up splendidly . No signs of wear at all . Easy to use . Just ordered a second one for a planer.This an excellent purchase .	1
This stand is , all in all , pretty good . I have it underneath my bandsaw , which is a somewhat heavy tool . When I step on the pedal and lift the stand onto the three wheels , it 's rather top heavy and tippy when I roll it around . I think the three wheel design might be better for a shorter tool with a lower center of gravity , like a jointer perhaps.The assembly is easy enough and I 've had no problems with quality of the stand so I have nothing to say in that regard.Under a lighter/shorter tool I think this stand would be great .	1
It took me about 2 hours to cut the wood and assemble a mobile base for my Jet 6in jointer -- a bit longer than I expected . It is very solid and I think the lift design is simple and better than that of a universal mobile base . I probably will get a couple more for other tools .	1
It was a little more involved to put together than some of the all metal ones , but works great and is well worth it in the end .	1
I like the design of the single foot pedal which makes this mabile base easier to use than the HTC 2000 model . The HTC design requires two foot pedals to operate while the Delta has only one . The foot pedal is also larger on the Delta while the HTC design has rather thin ones . The single wheel also seems to make the Delta model easier to pivot with.If you want a mobile base that 's ready to go out of the box , the HTC model will serve your needs well enough . If you can or do n't mind making the rails yourself , get the Delta model since its easier to raise and lower with its larger foot pedal , and the single wheel design also makes it easier to pivot with .	1
I had a 150-200 lb . vertical router that needed a mobile base . I got the Delta kit from Amazon , and assembled it one evening using pine 2x4s that I 'd ripped to the right size . Let me tell you , this base works great ! Everything fit perfectly . Typical Delta quality . I 'd bought some tool stands that were from another company , and I 'd almost lost my temper putting the darned things together ... nothing fit . On this base , everything fit perfectly.The specs call for the use of hardwood , but on a light tool like my vertical router , the pine worked fine.If you 've never used this type of base , they are a dream to use . A simple foot lever lifts and lowers the tool once the base is installed . This is MUCH better than having to individually lift each corner by hand-tightening plastic-handled screws . I also have a Vega base that requires a long handle to move the unit around , and I 'm telling you ... this Delta system ca n't be beat ! In fact , I 'm going to replace my Vega base with one of these.After nearly 3 years of using this type of base , I prefer it to the others I have had . MUCH easier to move stuff , and for those who say you 'll trip over the kicker , you 're walking too close to your machine ! These levers rise up out of the way ... I 've NEVER tripped , and my shop is crowded ! Happy Woodworking !	1
I purchased this mobile base for my edging sander , at first I was skeptical about using the wood and how it will hold up to my 200 lb . machine 30 '' L x 17 '' W x 36 '' H. However , I was very impressed after the assembly ; and by the way the wood must be 1 1/2 '' x 1 1/2 '' and not 2 '' x 2 '' as mentioned in the description . The base is very sturdy even though there is some rocking when it is raised to reposition and is easy to move around.If you want a really solid base try using steel RHS instead of the wood , it is rock solid with no rocking at all . I will recommend it to anyone who can not get a base that was fabricated for their machine , as this base essentially is when you are done with the assembly .	1
I purchased this mobile base because I wanted the flexibility to roll my mitre saw around , which is on a large stand . I needed to customize the mobile base to the size of the stand . All my power tools , and I have a lot of them are on wheels that are made for the specific tool . I had a problem with the mitre saw because of it 's odd size . There was no custom fitted base , that I could find . It worked out well , but one caution , the wood I used is a bit too flexible and the saw does move a little when rolling it . I never have an issue while using the saw , but it does bounce a small amount while rolling . Nothing that would cause a problem . You can find pictures and further description of the project at ediblefrog.com/topics/frogblogger/delta_50-345_universal_mobile_base	1
I actually bought this base to attach to a piece of machinery that fits in a closet . The base hardware ( angle brackets , wheels ) are solid , and if you use a hard wood like oak for the 2x2 sides , the whole thing is solid as a rock.However , the foot pedal sticks out several inches , and it actually got in my way a bit . In addition , if you are like me and wanted to store something in a closet out of the way , you need at least 8-12 '' of extra space to accommodate the petal . I 'm sure the petal is not a problem for most people , just something to keep in mind .	1
I am using this stand for a compound miter saw . For a light tool like this , pine rails ripped from 2x4s work just fine . If you are trying to support a major league table saw or something closer to the 300 pound limit , then follow Delta 's advice and use hardwood.I bought an HTC mobile stand for my table saw , in part to compare the two models . On design , the Delta wins . The freely rotating front caster makes the unit very maneuverable , much easier to move around the shop than the HTC . In addition , the lever in front gives a much greater range of motion , so it lifts the unit much further off the stationary feet . The two units are roughly equivalent in difficulty of assembly . Do your own measurements for the wood ; the unit will take a tad more than the 1 1/2 inch square cross section recommended . I also recommend drilling the bolt holes with a drill press if at all possible . I do n't own a drill press , so I could n't get the holes drilled perfectly square , and the unit looks like it was assembled by a drunken sailor . It works great , but I ca n't really blame Delta for the appearance.One downside to the Delta is the need for the hardwood rails for heavier equipment . If you do n't have a lot of scrap hardwood lying around , you should include the price of the wood in your price comparison . You should also have access to a planer and joiner to square up the wood , something that was n't necessary with the pine .	1
I have purchased three of these for my small home workshop and they all perform flawlessly ! With some minor assembly , these perform just as well as their more expensive cousins . I even bought one for my father to use with his HEAVY old unisaw ( built in the late 1930 's ) and it works like a charm	1
There are lots of reviews for this tool . This was my second Bosch purchase ( the first was a random orbital sander that I also adore ) . The level of quality has been superb on both items.I love the ergonomics of the device . Everything is where you expect it to be , and everything feels incredibly solid as you make your adjustments , lock them down , set your workpiece in , and especially when you are making your cut . There is NO PLAY in the sliding mechanism , nor is there in the miter adjustment or in the bevel adjustment.It 's a very heavy tool , but it needs to be to have the solid feel that it has . I purchased a mobile miter saw base , mounted it to that , and I highly recommend you do the same . ( See my review on the mobile base , a Delta 50-155 ) . You do NOT want to be lugging this thing out all the time because of the weight.The only complaint is the really lousy dust collection . However I see this tool as being most useful in its mobile state , so whenever I use it I set it up outside anyhow . I am not aware of any sliding compound miter saw that has an effective dust collector , but even if there were one , you could not get me to trade mine out for one ! Another pointer - definitely get an extra Bosch clamp or two . They are not very expensive , are very well made , and make your job much easier , especially if you are working on your own.I understand that there is now a Bosch that bevels both directions . If you decide that it 's important to you to be able to bevel both left and right , I 'm sure you would be happy with this choice also , but I have never found it to be complicated to work with only the right bevel capability on this saw . It 's simple math.Bottom line , I can not imagine a higher quality work tool and I know you will be happy with this choice . I would go further and say that my experience with Bosch would lead me to look at Bosch first for any corded power tool . ( For cordless , see my reviews on Porter-Cable , which I also highly recommend . )	1
I am a weekend woodwarrior . Wanted a nice sliding miter saw . Looked at all of them , fondled a few and them , then found this one on sale through Amazon . This is a nice saw . Put on a Forrest Chopmaster and it slices and dices all day . Required minimal adjustment out of the box for square . Adjustments were quick and easy . Very easy to use . Manual is great . Dust collection is not that great , but it was n't with my non-sliding miter either . It 's the nature of this type of machine . What was my old miter saw ? A Bosch 12 '' that was stolen from my garage . Bosch makes consistently excellent stuff . Would buy this one again in a heart beat .	1
I received my Bosch 39-15 yesterday and putit immediately to work . I am re-doing a basement room and had to cut many boards for trim . Out of the box it was in perfect alignment . Quickly read the instructions and off I was . I did n't experience a problem with dust any more than my chop saw by Dewalt . It is very smooth . The unit has a very smooth glide and moving the saw head to make the cut is effortless . It took me months to decide which unit to buy . This was the must sturdy unit I evaluated and it 's ease of use helped me make my decision . Amazon had the lowest price . Ordering on line was great . So simple and fast . It was delivered in five days . If you want to save a lot of money , buy this unit . There is n't a saw that can compare to the quality of build on this saw .	1
I was in the market for a miter saw for a whole-house crown molding project . I spent a few weeks going to local stores as well as reading online reviews . I settled on the 3915 from Amazon.com and have been very pleased with my decision . Below are some key findings:1 ) A quality built tool with thoughtful design . You 'll read some complaints on the dust collection bag but I find that it works about as well as most out there . If you 're really concerned with dust , hooking up a shop-vac should do the trick.2 ) Value ! ! This is a 10 '' slider for the price of most chop-only saws . The single bevel can sometimes mean a bit more effort but I simply could n't justify paying nearly 50 % more for a dual-bevel sliding Bosch or Makita . And the 10 '' slide handles wider pieces of wood than its 12 '' chop-only counterparts.3 ) The only weakness I found was the bevel angle markings . The tool was true from the factory but the markings are a bit hard to zero in on . That being said , I ca n't say that I had any angle issues with my finished pieces but it just takes a little getting used to setting it.All in all , I would challenge anyone to find a better value in a sliding compound miter saw .	1
I must admit I was worried about purchasing this saw , because it seemed to cheap ( price ) compared to comparable Dewalt , Porter Cable , makita saws . However , bosch makes great equipment , and they came through with this one as well.After setting this up and testing it , I have to give it 5 stars simply because the price is unbelievable , and the saw performs flawlessly . There are a few minor things I would change if I could , but they are minimal and not very important , only matters of design , convenience , etc . see below.One negative reviewer stated that the detents were n't adjustable , and could n't believe Bosch would build a saw without adjustments . This is incorrect . In order to adjust the angles on a miter saw , you need to change the relative position of the detents to the fence . On some saws , like the Porter cable , you can move the detents . On others , such as this , you move the fence . ( The detents are cast in position and ca n't be moved ) . My saw was n't correct out of the box , so I followed the instructions and loosed the fence and squared it to the blade with a combination square . However , this was difficult to do , and it still ended up slightly out of adjustment when tested on a board . My advice , which made it a piece of cake : Pick a 12 '' piece of wood with a perfectly straight edge ( I used MDF ) , make a cut , check the square , adjust the fence and retighten , make another cut , and continue until you are dead on square at 90 degrees . This method wasted a little bit of wood , but I got it adjusted dead on accurate in about 5 minutes , and no fumbling around with a square against the blade.Once I got the 90 degree detent in position , I checked the others making 45 degree cuts in both directions on 6 inch material and the results were PERFECT . I mean dead on perfect . I ca n't imagine better miters.Another reviewer said there was play in the detents of 1 degree or so . If you put it in a detent and do n't tighten the knob , there is some play , but only like 1/4 degree or so , and if you tighten the knob as you are supposed to , the play is taken up and the blade centers on the detent dead on in the middle , same place everytime I try it . If used correctly , there is no play.Other positive 's : -Comes with a quality 40 tooth blade . You do n't have to buy a new blade to get good results with this saw . Most of the others come with a cheap blade that will cause tear out on your trim.-Wrenches included for fence and blade , and mounted on the rear of the saw in convenient places . you 'll never find yourself without the wrench you need.-Adjustable slide on left end of saw gives you a little bit of extension in the table , about 4-5 inches.-No upward kick with startup like my old delta saw , and what I hear from dewalt . I hated my old saw for that . I would line up the cut , and then when I hit start , the saw would kick and make my board jump , and I 'd have to line it up again with the blade spinning . This saw does n't do that , I 'm happy to say.Negatives : -Dust collection is n't very effective , but I 've never seen a miter saw that is . Seems average to me.-Handle is vertical position . I would prefer horizontal like the dewalt , but I do n't think it 's worth paying the extra money . Then again , I do n't make miter cuts all day everyday.-Blade guard is a little too cautious in my opinion , and not adjustable . Guard stays pretty low to the table , so when you are lining up the cut , you have to have your eyes nearly level with the board to see your mark . In other words , the guard obstructs your view if you are looking from above the saw at all . Easy fix is to mount the saw in a high position , as most people do with miters anyway . However , if you put the saw on the floor temporarily to do a few quick cuts , this can be a real pain.Overall , a lot of thought went into the design of this saw . It is well constructed , the quality you 'd expect from bosch , and dead-on accurate . It does everything I would expect it to do and more , and at a price that I still ca n't believe . I had reservations before I bought it , but now I 'm thrilled that I did . Thanks Bosch !	1
I have been using my Bosch saw now for about six months . I agonized over my decision of which sliding compound miter saw to buy , comparing the Hitachi , Makita , Freud , Milwaukee , DeWalt , and Bosch . After testing each one in stores to get a feel for the saw , I went with the Bosch . At first , I was worried that maybe I should have chosen the DeWalt , since I usually love DeWalt products . However , I am so happy with the Bosch that I no longer have any regrets . The saw is accurate , easy to adjust , and incredibly solid . The left side has an extension built in that , together with the excellent clamp that comes with the saw , will hold down boards over 100 & quot ; in length without a problem . I have cut wood at several angles , and I have done compound cuts ( i.e. , bevel and miter ) , and in every case it 's been perfect -- and I mean PERFECT . The blade that comes with the saw makes glass-smooth edges . As a matter of fact , I use the saw regularly to make a nice edge on the wood I buy , and again it 's performed perfectly . Also , it has a larger cross-cut capacity that almost any other sliding compound miter saw on the market , able to cross-cut up to a full 12 & quot ; -- and if you are careful turning the board around , you can cross-cut up to 24 & quot ; . This means you can get away without a radial arm saw , which is precisely what I have done . One note about price : even though this saw is more expensive than other 10 & quot ; sliding compound miter saws , you have to keep in mind that the blade that comes with it is worth at least $ 60 . The DeWalt comes with a mediocre blade that is no good for finish-quality edges , so you would have to right away buy another blade if you buy the DeWalt . So , you have to take $ 60 off the price of the Bosch to compare fairly , or you have to add $ 60 to the price of the 10 & quot ; DeWalt . I have come to believe that Bosch excels in the saw department ( see my review of the Bosch Progressor jig saw ) while DeWalt is good with jointers , sanders , etc . Bottom line : I ca n't praise this saw enough . You will be extremely happy to have it in your shop .	1
This Bosch Slider is an absolute delight to work with . I used to have a craftsman miter saw and this one is so superior it makes the craftsman tool look like a toy . The supplied blade is smooth and precise . The overal product is very well executed and the performance is solid . Everything is perfectly aligned and the miter angles are as accurate as you can get . This tool is a real pleasure to work with and way cheaper than the equivalent Makita or Hitachi models . A real winner in my eyes .	1
I received the Bosch 3915 today , and of course had to test it out . First of all , I was impressed with the overall quality of the saw and was very impressed by its weight . It 's heavy , and I have yet to find a really easy way to pick it up and move it around . I 'm assuming that it 's meant to be mounted on a bench or stand , as opposed to being moved around from place to place . I was also impressed with the manual , since it seems to be written in English and for the most part explains things very clearly . Often , manuals that come with tools made in other countries suffer in their translation . I did experience one situation that was not explained well in the manual , however . I tried cutting a dado by using the depth stop feature , which in itself is easy to adjust . The problem I encountered in making a dado is this : When the piece of wood is placed on the table and pushed against the fence , the blade does not make a uniformly deep cut all the way through the piece because of the curvature of the blade . I assume that there are two solutions to this problem . One would be to turn the piece around and make the same cuts from the opposite side . Another wouuld be to put a second piece of wood against the fence and then put the piece in which you want the dado in front of that piece . Either of these methods is rather inconvenient , but maybe I 'm missing something . If anyone has a solution , please let me know.Previous to using the saw , I checked all of the adjustments as explained in the manual and found that they all seemed to be set perfectly . I also cut several test pieces and checked them for squareness and various angles ; they were all perfect . I have n't yet used the saw for crown moulding , so I ca n't comment on how well it does for that purpose . As far as the operation of the saw itself , I was generally satisfied . Since I have been using a miter saw that has a vertical handle most of my life I had no issue with the handle on this saw . I do realize , however , that some folks prefer a horizontal handle . The one feature I do n't like is the placement of the power switch lock-off button that has to be depressed before the power switch can be pushed in . No matter how I contort my hand I ca n't find a comfortable way to depress both buttons at the same time . On my other miter saw , the lock-off button is perfectly placed so that both buttons can be easily depressed at the same time.Lastly , I have to agree with other reviewers about the uselessness of the dust bag . I tried turning it it every direction possible , but nothing helped . It does n't collect much dust regardless if I make chop cuts or sliding cuts . And , yes , I do slide the blade from front to back as explained in the manual . So , overall , I would give the saw 4 1/2 stars , but since that 's not possible I gave it the four stars because of the lock-off switch , the dust bag , and the dado situation .	1
I have had this saw for 6 months now . I use it often and well it is a nice saw for the price . I think there are other saws out there that have more bells an whistles than this one . Having a horizontial tigger like the Dewalt would be nice , kind of cumbersome with the saftey trigger on the left . My biggest complaint is the saw blade . After only using it for 1 month I noticed burning , tearout , and bogging down on the motor . I changed the blade with a freud ultimate cutoff and what a differnce a blade makes ! ! Slices wood ( walnut , maple , redwood , and mahagony ) very clean and precise . I have read that the Makita has a nice blade included with their model and the Hitachi with the LAZER sounds cool ( $ 500.00 ) but this saw was good for the price . The dust collection is middle of the road , but to be fair I have not seen many that work that well . It did come with a hold down clamp that works ok . The base is kind of large too ... luckly I was able to land a Werkart cart that fit it perfectly and all and all Ive turned it into quite the compound miter saw .	1
I could n't decide between a table saw and a miter saw . I think I made the right decision by going with the Bosch B3915 . It is a very high quality tool . At first I was concerned when the saw arrived because the packaging was very minimal for such a heavy item . Parts of the saw were poking through the box . Bosch really needs to rethink how they package their tools for shipping . Fortunately , there was no damage . After unpacking the saw I tested the settings . Two of the settings were off , but only by a millimeter or two . It only took me about 30 minutes to correctly adjust the saw . It is just a matter of loosening and adjusting some bolts . However , it can take several tries to get it just right . The documentation was excellent and made the start up very easy . Once , you are familiar with the saw I imagine it would only take a few minutes to make adjustments . Bosch claims the saw comes adjusted , but it was clearly off when it left the factory.My first project was a breeze . I 'm a very amateur woodworker . Nevertheless , I had no trouble with the saw . It cuts wood like butter . The saw is very easy and fast to set when making angle cuts . The included clamp also is fast and efficient . Although the clamp does n't work well on the right side of the saw because it gets in the way of the motor . The only limitations I ran into with the saw was with cuts greater than a foot . This is where a table saw would be better . The miter saw can chop , but it ca n't rip . The maximum cut I was able to make was about 12.5 inches in a inch board . For bigger cuts I tried cutting one side and then flipping the piece over and cutting the other side . However , it is pretty much impossible to get a cut that does n't require sanding.Another little complaint is that the blade only tilts to the left . I was cutting some very small delicate molding at 45 degrees and the blade kept splitting the wood because of the way it was placed on the saw . If I could have tilted the blade to the right and put the fatter side of the molding against the fence it would have worked better.Several reviews complained about the dust collection bag . They are right . This bag is a joke . For every pound of sawdust generated the bag collects about an ounce . I would strongly recommend hooking the saw up to a vacuum system . I purchased a Shop-Vac 906-85-00 2.5 '' to 1.25 '' Conversion Unit for $ 4.99 on Amazon . The 1.25 '' end fits snuggly in the Bosch saw and the 2.5 '' end fits the end of the hose on my Shop-Vac . The conversion unit also fits my Bosch router . The saw sprays much less sawdust when you use the vacuum . Although , there is still spillage.All of my gripes are very minor . This product is clearly a 5 star . It is constructed very well . All the pieces have a very solid feel . The bottom line is that you can make very accurate chop cuts without much effort .	1
Half the price of a Dewalt 12 & quot ; , did not need that big of saw . Came with a clamp , did not have to pay extra , all dustbags are pretty much useless , I 've always got sawdust when I cut a piece of lumber , hmmm . Top value as far as I 'm concerned .	1
I picked up a Delta 10 '' CMS some time ago ... a nice saw but limited in capacity . I have longed for an SCMS and after doing extensive research it came down to the Makita or this saw . Amazon had a 3 day special on this saw ( just think a third off the price with free shipping ) and I could not pass that up.The saw arrived in excellent condition.PROS:1 ) slide mechanism is great2 ) saw is powerful but quiet ... quieter than my old less-powerful Delta3 ) Saw is accurate and makes good cuts4 ) Stops are nice and easy to read.5 ) Blade is nice ... 6 ) Accessories included are good ( dust-bag and clamp ) . This is a bigger plus since some other manfacturers make these optionalCONS:1 ) The handle is not bad but I miss the D-Handle on my old Delta2 ) I have yet to find a way to adjust the saw if the stops are off . I 'm sure I 'm just missing something ... 3 ) As with almost all CMS 's , the dust collection is a bit lacking . I have heard the Makita is great , but I 'm skeptical.Even with the small issues with this saw , it 's 5 stars from me . I 'm VERY satisfied ...	1
I 've had this saw for over six months now and am extremely satisfied . It 's very accurate , easy to adjust and is particularly good for cutting crown molding . The blade which comes with the saw is OK for basic stuff , but has excessive tearout . For fine work you 'll need a good 80 tooth blade.It 's a little awkward for a left-hander at first , but easy to adapt to . The biggest complaint is the dust extraction - the dust bag is almost useless , and hooking a vacuum to the dust port makes no difference : dust shoots straight out the back , hits the frame and disperses in a huge cloud . This makes it impossible to use in a customer 's home ; if it 's a row house , finding a safe , convenient outdoor spot for it can be tricky . Wintertime complicates matters . One reviewer said , so what if it takes an extra hour to clean up - it 's a terrific saw . Well , it is a terrific saw , but time is money .	1
Very impressive piece of machinery with positive stops at most common angles . Standard blade is not too bad either . High fence for crown molding and smooth drop action and good dust collection makes it a good buy . ( ... )	1
UPDATED REVIEW : Since the time I wrote the first review below ; I 've had a fair bit more experience with the 3912 . I 've not used it a lot but with what little I have , it appears to be very cheaply made . The aluminum and plastic which is used in abundance wears out quickly and bolts easily strip in their housings . In the owners manual ( if you can call it that ) there is no parts list so that repair parts can be purchased . Overall , after about a year 's usage I 'd have to say it is n't worth the money or frustration.FIRST REVIEW : Just had the time to really use the 3912 ( making a work station for it ) and I am very satisfied with the performance ! I 've given away my old Delta 10 '' . There has been no problem with flex as was mentioned by another reviewer or any weird electrical problems . The hold down works very well and the increased cut with the 12 '' blade is most appreciated . Plenty of power and very easy to use . The `` on '' switch does take a little getting used to ( a little stiff ) but the convertible use for right or left hand is a real plus for me as I am left handed . I did follow the set-up instructions though the saw was set up exactly on degree from the box . But in so doing I obtained more familiarity with the saw . The 3912 gives me accurate and very smooth cuts ... what else can you ask ? I like it , a lot !	1
I bought this saw in June 1999 at Home Depot . I do lots of custom trim work . Mantles , Judges Paneling , Column Trim etc . I have n't found accuracy to be an issue once you square the blade , table and fence . My tolerances are 32'nds but I know some guys deal in 64'ths What I do very much like and use is the Vernier scale which allows me to accurately cut in 1/4 degree increments . Other than that the saw works as advertised . I reluctantly cut aluminum screen framing for my cousins ' porch and got metal shavings in the swivel mechanism . I disassembled the table from the base and cleaned and lubricated the mechanism . It works good as new . Then I realized that metal filings could have gotten into the motor . I wo n't be doing this type of cutting anytime soon but that was 5 years ago and I have n't had any issues . Things I do n't like are : the sawdust bag intake . It collects about 1/2 the sawdust generated . Also like others I have had trouble with the guard . I keep putting off taking the saw to Bosch and having it repaired . I 've tried to replicate the deflection problem discussed in some reviews but could n't . I also have noted that the blade brake does n't work as effectively these days as it did when the saw was new . So after 10 plus years of use I can say I believe I got my moneys worth .	1
Could n't agree more with Amazon 's review - this is a high quality saw that rivals DeWalt and other competitors . Weight is not a problem , and handles on the top and both ends of the base make this easy to move around your shop or job site . The handle is very comfortable and convenient to use right or left-handed . Dust collection is good and noise is low . The saw arrived quickly as always from Amazon and required little adjustment out of the box . Highly recommend !	1
Very good quality tool for a DIY'er like me . Put a Freud 80 tooth finish blade on it and it 's perfect for all kinds of trim work and wood flooring . It 's good for rough construction cuts too if the stock will fit . Very stable , safe , well made . I bought mine in 2005 and use it several times a year for DIY work . It was my first Bosch tool . I was very impressed and stick with Bosch now for just about all other tools .	1
I talked to a lot of professional woodworkers and carpenters , before I purchased the Bosch 3912B ( they all recommended the Bosch 3912B ) . They told me to spend a little bit more and get a quality product . I am extremely happy that I did.Miter and compound cuts have been accurate right out of the box . Using this tool is such a pleasure , I am still impressed with the performance and the precise cuts . Bosch also offers more accessories than other brands . I really like the lock on the saw . You can release the table with little effort and reset your miter position with ease.If you want a quality tool , get this Bosch ! ! It 's smooth , quiet , and well worth the money .	1
I finally got fed up with my sub-standard circ-saw while doing a large deck framing job that required close precision . After researching all the & quot ; pro & quot ; saws including the Dewalt I decided to go with the Skil MAG 77 . I must tell you , I am not disappointed . This is simply an amazing saw . It tracks perfectly , allowing you to make not only precision cross cuts but do quick job-site ripping by hand . One of my main reasons for opting for the Skil was its superior gauge design . The Dewalt has an raised arch rim on the front of the foot that makes it impossible to site across the blade and the front reference mark at the same time . The Skil 's foot is flat allowing you easily to site across the blade and front gauge . BOTTOM LINE : One of the BEST power tools I 've ever purchased - definitely worth the money !	1
I have owned several Skill saws ( worm drives ) and this is my first time buying the MAG . I have used them a lot on the job site , unfortunately they were not mine . Even when my heavy saw was in front of me , I would still gravitate to the light MAG . I will never go back . Especially since my table on my last saw got all bent up , which seems to be the common complaint about this MAG .	1
This saw is great . It is alot lighter that the old 77 but with the same awount of power . This saw will cut threw any wood like butter . I particularly never liked worm drive because they are way to heavy but this saw is a little lighter and feels good when i use it . It feels more like a 15 amp saw than a 13 but you cant go wrong buying this saw , its been around for decades and they probly all are still working	1
This saw lives up to all of the expectations . It has a smooth start , and a consistent rip.I 've used cheap plastic saws before , and this one puts them in their place.The other reviewers were n't joking when they say that you 'll be able to give this saw to your grand-kids someday . Hands down , this is the nicest saw that I 've ever used !	1
I work construction and do plenty of research on tools . Skil currently makes less then par products , but with this exception . This saw is the industry standard . I see the MAG77 and the regular HD77 on every construction site . I like the HD77 because it is a little smoother then the MAG77 due to the heavier steel casing , which means no kickback and a stonger , more solid feel . Both saws are incredible and either purchase is an investment . Buy this saw if you plan on cutting a lot of lumber .	1
No body but no body builds a better saw than the people who invented the thing so long ago . Yeah , other companies make fine tools . But none better than the skill mag 77 . Dewalt tried to copy the design , it was a flop . So they came up with their new hypoid framing saw that does n't even compare for durability . Milwaukee makes an even bigger wormdrive with a 15 amp motor . It 's an also ran . Makita made a super duper hypoid gear saw that stripped gears like they were going out of style . I 'll admit that their new one is a lot better than the first but it 's still not a skil.Unless you live on the east coast , when you drive by a construction site , 9 times out of 10 you 're going to see a worm drive skil saw . There are reasons why .They are the most durable . They run the smoothest . They are the most powerful . I conducted a test of several framing saws . I ran all available wormdrive and hypoid gear saws as well as the Porter Cable blade left 15 amp saw with marathon blades down 16 ' 2x douglas fir as fast as I could without tripping a breaker . My partner timed me . The skil was the fastest by over a second . Then we switced places . Same result . At the time we had no preference for brand . In fact , we were hoping the new Dewalt would be the best ripping saw.With its bright yellow color and its 15 amp motor , we thought it might be . Not ! The 13 amp skil blew everything away . I must say we were impressed . I continue to be to this day . The mag 77 might be heavy but not overly so . In some instances the weight is an advantage . if you are cutting close to the ground , tilt the lumber so the saw is going down . It will glide through with no effort . The length of the saw is also a plus . When crosscutting sheet goods it is much easier to go all the way across from one side without changing your position . The in line design also makes it easier to follow a straight mark on your material . The depth markings are a nice feature for a rough reference point . I have a few minor caveats though . The aluminum shoe is n't as tough as the steel on the older saw . The cords crack pretty bad just past the strain relief . I do n't know of many power tool cords that do n't though . I think my Bosch and Hilti cords are in tact . If you want a 15 amp motor , a blade brake , a rafter hook or a lightweight package , this is not your saw . If you want the most powerful smoothest running most durable workhorse of a saw then look no further than the skil 77 original or lighter mag 77 .	1
I own a Porter-Cable 15 amp ( which I love ) and one of these . I 've had the P-C over a year and this Skil , which I just got a couple days ago , blows the Porter Cable away ! I 'm not a contractor , but I understand fully why contractors out West love them . This is one beefy machine with tons of power to cut anything . I tried twisting it in a cut to test it and it only slowed a little , while the P-C nearly stops ! A great buy for DIY-er or professional .	1
I got this saw from a charity auction in which I had the highest bid of $ 110 . Obviously , I scored big here . I probably would not have bought this saw because I thought it was just too much saw for my needs as a heavy duty home improvement enthusiast . I used it this past week to complete a three-story playhouse for my kids ( yeah , kids , that 's the ticket ) . This is a powerhouse of a saw - wait until I put a good blade on it . I actually like the weight because it keeps it in place as I move it across the workpiece . I also love the fact that the blade is on the left-hand side - I hate always looking over the saw as with the traditional style . The ergonomics are great . The handle is behind the saw as to give you better leverage.I 've always thought of Skil as kind of a low-tier brand , but this is the king of circular saws . Worth way more than the cost.I 'd also add that the first time I turned it on I was expecting a roar . It is surprisingly quiet . I find all my high end tools are quieter than the cheapies . All around very happy .	1
This is the standard by which every other power tool ought to be judged , not just saws . I worked ( OK , DIY ) with a sidewinder for years , but I should have just paid the extra money and gotten the Skil 77 . I expect that mine will be used by my grandson . If you are undertaking any major projects involving sawing a lot of 2-by-whatever lumber , or thicker plywood , like a room addition or deck , this is a highly recommended purchase . As a DIYer , if you get out the saw over , say , 15 times a year , you will probably get your money 's worth out of the saw . If you only use a saw a few times a year , it 's probably more than you need . For a DIYer , you should be aware that this unit weighs more than the less expensive consumer saws you may have used before , and some practice with scrap is advisable . And check and keep the oil level up - that 's the only real care needed for what is otherwise almost indestructible .	1
I 've got two of these skil saws.About 7 yrs ago I found an old beaten up one for $ 15 at a garage sale . I ran kerosene through it ( where you put the oil ) then ran it briefly and replaced the oil . I 've been using that saw since b/c it was so beat up I did n't want to wear down my new one . The old garage sale skil saw runs just like my new one . I 've reroofed my home , added 100sf to my home , replaced lots of fences , cut out old flooring . This saw just wo n't quite . It has to be almost 25 yrs old.Buy one of these , take care of it and you 'll be handing it down to your grandchildren .	1
I earn an income visiting construction sites . More rough carpenters use this circular saw then any other ( including the Skil HD77M ) .In March of this year , I bought the HD77 used ... to replace a low-end Black & Decker which was purchased new for $ 50 in 1981.For DIY projects around the house , the heavy-duty , smooth operating HD77 has yet to disappoint . Initially , I had to get used to the weight and the ergonomics . The cuts were smooth with no irritating startup kickback . Plywood and sonotubes ; no problem.With the increasingly harsh Toronto area winters , the oil in the HD77 requires to be room temperature warm prior to using the saw in the great outdoors of ours.With proper maintenance and care , this saw will be a vital and permanent tool for rough carpentry .	1
My wife 's Indian tribe has a casino in Oklahoma . In May 2005 , we were on vacation visiting my father-in-law , and stopped in to see my wife 's tribe 's casino . I 'm not really a gambler , but I put $ 20 in a slot machine , hit the button three times , and won $ 250 . I cashed out , and gave my wife $ 100 . I knew what I was going to spend the rest of my money on , a Skil HD77 Wormdrive saw . My father had the old metal handled version of the HD77 when I was growing up in the 60 's and 70 's , and it was what I learned to saw with . In my adult life I 've had cheap circular saws , but I always longed for the Skilsaw of my youth . Once you have used a Skil HD77 , you just ca n't go back to any lesser saw . I was also fortunate that when I got home , and purchased the saw from Amazon , it happened to be on sale , and I got $ 25 more dollars off for spending $ 199+ , so I got my new saw for the cost of about $ 110 . Some people think the saw is too heavy . Personally I do n't mind the weight , I think it steadies the saw . I love quality and value , and this saw has them both . If you read most of the reviews , mostly five stars , they speak for themselves . I 've built saw horses , bookcases , cabinets for my shop , raised beds for our tomato garden , a closet organizer , a coffee table , a computer desk , a sewing table for my wife , the list goes on . I guess what I would like to pass along is that I am sorry that I waited so long to get this saw . Now that I have one again , all DYI chores seem easier . I look forward to using my saw . It makes any sawing task , a pure pleasure . I should have just bit the bullet and got one a long time ago . If you are a person , contemplating the purchase of a circular saw , especially a younger person , my advice is spend your money wisely , and get the best , the first time , and you wo n't regret it . Throw our the cheap blade it comes with , and buy a decent carbide saw blade . Change the oil ocasionally , and the Skil HD77 will last you a lifetime . There are not too many purchases that you can make for around $ 150 , that you can say that about . If your are lucky , you might catch it on sale , or be able to pick up a used one for even less money . If so , grab it and run like the wind .	1
The SKIL model 77 is without a doubt the best value in power tools a man , ( or woman ) can buy . It would be a wonderful thing if all of my power tools had the same quality as this saw . I have been in the carpentry trades for more than 30 years , and I found out that when it comes to buying tools that in the long run you are much better off buying quality equipment than trying to save a few $ $ $ by buying cheaper stuff.If skil can produce this fine of a tool for a fairly low price Why cant the other tool manufacturers do the same ? If your make a living , or you just do your own household repairs you ca n't go wrong with this saw . I still have the original model 77 that I bought for $ 100.00 new back in 1978 in Tuscon AZ . At one of the early big box stores.By the way this is the only Skil manufactured tool I own , and would ever care to own , as I think everything else they made in the last 30 years is pure junk , but they sure came up with a winner with this particular saw.Builder Bob , Telluride , Colorado	1
This saw is every bit as powerful as it is said to be . The fit and finish of this unit is no less than excellent right down to the edges of the cooling fins which are clean and accurately shaped with not a bit of flashing or rounded edges . The shaft for the blade has zero end play which insures every cut is clean and square . If you have a need for precise work , have lots of work to do , or have a need for both this saw will do the job every time without fail . Changing the oil is easy to do as is operation of all the other controls/features . There is nothing I can think of to complain about . Some reviews have pointed to the weight for example or some other minor concern . You have to keep in mind what the mission is for this saw . This saw is a serious working tool . If you want smaller/lighter features than you do not have a need for what this saw can do . The day I wrote this review I spent most of it chewing through 2X6 's 16 feet long building a deck . For a saw with this kind of class it could have slept through the day and got the job done cutting 45deg angles that look square and furniture smooth . If you have work to do that needs a circular saw this saw is ready to go to work .	1
Being a construction worker and a tool fanatic I must say this is the best saw on the market . At least 80 percent of constuction sites are occupied by the HD77 or it 's brother the MAG77 . I like the HD77 alittle better due to it 's weight . I have yet to experience any heavy kickback and have yet to find any piece of lumber this wo n't rip through . This is a easy tool to use if you can handle a little weight ( it does n't take that long to get used to if you use lighter saws ) . This saw can handle being dropped several times and will last forever with an occasional oil . I do n't have enough good things to say about this great saw .	1
I remember skill when they had steel bodies on there saws .I have the craftsman variant ( YEAH Skill builds for Sears ) .I prefer the steel shoe over the magnesium for durability .I have run every type of blade ( wood , diamond , metal abrasive ) without any troubles .My saw is 13 years old and still on original brushes .	1
I like this saw . I use it as often as I do any of my other circular saws and I mainly use it to break down 4x8 sheet goods , including some hefty 7/8 & # 34 ; flooring . I love the size , weight and balance of this saw , and it does n't seem to lack for power either . It does seem loud for it 's size and power . High quality carbide-toothed blades are difficult to impossible to find for this saw , which is a pity because I would love to get more use out of it than I do now . For cutting laminate and composite materials cleanly , there 's just no getting around using a high tooth count carbide tipped blade , which as far as I am aware , is not an option for this saw .	1
I got this saw to replace my 18v DeWalt 5-3/8 '' cordless trim saw , which is underpowered and ca n't handle much more than thin plywood and short cuts on 2x4s . The Skil saw completely blows it away in terms of power . I did like the fit and feel of the DeWalt better , but that was probably due more to the fact that it was cordless than anything else . The Skil saw is a terrific alternative to bulkier and heavier 7-1/4 '' circular saws . I almost never need to cut wood that thick except on my table saw anyway . I have a feeling my 7-1/4 '' circular saw is going to collect a lot of dust now that I have added this smaller Skil saw to my shop.The only reason I gave it four stars rather than five is that it did n't come with a rip fence and because the arbor hole in the saw blade that came with it is considerably larger than the arbor on the saw . The rip fence can be purchased separately , but it seems kind of chintzy that they would n't include it . As for the blade , well , I 'm not sure what they were thinking .	1
First time for a 5-1/2 '' saw and I love it . Always used larger saws for the power , but you do n't miss it becouse this saw has the goods . I use it ripping 1/4 '' hardwood plywood on a shop made panel saw , works great . Light weight and well balanced . The cord is a good length and is heavy duty with a good plug . I think I will keep it .	1
Simply the best ! For a contractor you will use it more than you could possibly think . A lot of big box retaillers are not stocking this one any more , it is one of the few skill products worth a damn . The worm-drive is still durable , although they have cheapened it up over the years . Buy extra blades , I have recently started using it for demo . sure beats getting beat up by the saw-z-all or sledge hammer , just have to figure a blade per job as `` overhead '' .ZERO complaints . It just works .	1
Nice saw . I have a great makita saw , so why this saw too . My makita is larger and much heavier . This saw is a dream to use and it really saves my strenth . Dont throw that big one away however you 'll still need it for angle cuts on your 2bys . I do so few angle cuts I used it once on the two jobs I did . I am just like everyone else I hate to spend the money on tools I already have . After using this smaller saw , I must say if you do any amount of building this is amust have tool . The weight difference is a big factor in the handling of your saw over the length of your job . Old school you bust your butt with everything , if you dont have to , do n't ! ! ! TRy IT bro 's , you 'll love it . I ai n't a contractor I am just a homeowner with a huge honey-do list.So , make it easy on yourself and bother the old lady by spending that money . A great double bonus for me .	1
Skil has made one of the greatest little saws yet . This saw has more power than the Porter Cable Saw Boss , and is lightweight and easy to use . Most of the time I do n't need the power of a 7 1/4 '' worm drive , so I grab the 5 1/2 '' skilsaw . I use it in my shop mostly for cutting sheets of plywood down to size , and occasionally to cut a 2 x 4 or a 2 x 6 . It has plenty of power and is so convenient to use . You wo n't be disappointed in this little power house . By the way , it is not that noisy as another reviewer has written . If you want quiet , go back to the kitchen .	1
I bought this saw 22 years ago and have used it since . I am a professional electrician and use a circular saw from time to time on the job for wood braces and supports . The saw has never been serviced or repaired . Some 7 years ago , I bought a Freud carbide blade from Home Depot . That 's all I 've done to it , and it keeps on going and going . When it no longer works , I 'll get another . But , at the rate that it last and last , who knows when that will be .	1
Bought this because I wanted a smaller corded circular saw with the blade on the left , like my ridgid cordless circular saw . I was tired of the batteries being dead all the time . I like the blade on the left because I am right handed and like to see what I am cutting when I am cutting it . I think this is a perfect saw for small jobs . It is very lightweight and small unlike the bohemoth 7 1/2 inch circular saws . The only possible problem is you can pretty much only cut through 2 '' stock with the 5 1/2 inch blade . This is however not a problem to me . It has great power and feels very sturdy . If I dropped it I know it would be a problem because it would bend out of alignment , but any circular saw would . I would definitely recommend it to everyone who is looking for a light duty compact circular saw .	1
I bought Skil 's little 5 1/2 & quot ; three years ago . I have NOT used my 7 1/4 & quot ; since ! This feather weight lets you work all day long without fatique . I have so much more control with this saw , its a miracle . A couple of cautions though . Its kind of hard to find replacement blades for it . B & amp ; D 's Piranha blade is very good , if you can find one in the 5 1/2 & quot ; size . Also , its a left hand setup . The motor hangs off to the right . If you rip using a nailed down 3/4 & quot ; straight edge where the motor rides above it ( most righties do , ) the maximum depth of cut is fairly shallow ( about 1 & quot ; ) Other than these two limitations , best buck and a quarter I 've ever spent on a woodworking tool .	1
This is my `` go-to '' saw . It is much lighter and more maneuverable then my worm drive Skilsaw . I find myself reaching for this rather then my heavy worm drive skil because it is so capable . It is very heavy duty , but small and light . I like its steel ball bearing construction so I know it will last longer then me . I 'd buy this saw again in a heartbeat.Sometimes Amazon sells these as reconditioned . They make for a great deal .	1
I read all the reviews before buying . Wound up getting this one to replace my older 13A Makita 7-1/4 '' saw . The Makita had unstoppable power , but that is not what I need . I 'm a woodworker , and I use this to break down sheet goods and cut hardwood to rough size . It is working pretty hard to rip 5/4 Ash , but it gets 'er done . For 3/4 '' plywood , it is no effort at all.If you do n't cut through materials thicker than 1-1/2 '' , this is a great saw . It weighs probably half of what my Makita did , and that was with the aluminum shoe . The steel shoe of this saw follows aluminum edge guides without binding . ( aluminum to aluminum always binds up ) The left blade design is great for righties.As for the blade selection , I admit that it is n't extensive . It is only really extensive for the 7-1/4 '' saws . However , I have what I need . The included blade is not carbide tipped and is pretty much a throw-away . I bought the Skil brand carbide ripping blade . I also found a higher tooth count carbide tipped blade at a local tool store . The key to getting clean cuts in sheet goods with this ( or any ) circular saw is to make a zero clearance shoe that goes over the stock shoe.If you need to cut 4x4s , this is n't the saw for you . But if you need it to break down sheet goods and cut stuff up to 1-1/2 '' thick , this one is really handy . So far , I have n't missed my 7-1/4 '' Makita at all .	1
This is my go to saw when I have a lot of sheet stock cutting to do . My barn burned down recently , and unfortunately it had 30 sheets of `` O.S.B . in it that I was going to put on the roof of my house . It was stacked on its long edge on the cement floor leaning against the outside wall . Several of the outer sheets were gone completely and all the others were charred on both ends and the long top edge to some degree.Even though O.S.B . is cheaper than dirt at the moment it is against my nature to throw away something that might be used in the future , so I set up a couple of saw horses and proceeded to remove the charred edges of the remaining sheets . I think I can use this material to rebuild my old chicken coup . I used a straight edge and marked my cut lines and went to town with this little saw . It is very easy to cut long straight lines due to the total lack of vibration and the great sight line for a right handed user . It cuts almost as good as a table saw with a little practice.I trimmed about 25 of the remaining sheets of O.S.B . for use on future projects cutting about 16 foot on each sheet , 4 foot on both ends and the 8 foot long top edge . This saw gave me great results . It also does a great job on 2x lumber for cross cutting and ripping . It is small and light weight and it will make a professional out of the average user in a hurry.It is so much better than the average 7 `` consumer saw that I ca n't even find the words to describe it.Due to its low power draw it can be used with smaller extension cords and smaller generators if being used where power is not available . It has a long flexible power cord , a great sight line , no vibration . The only thing I could think of that could be improved is it could use a more aggressive blower to blow the cut line clear . But I suppose that if had a higher output blower on it someone might complain that it blew sawdust in their eyes . As it is it does n't do that but I find myself blowing the cut line clear on long cuts . Cross cuts on 2x material are n't long enough to cause a problem but ripping 8 foot long sheets will cause the cut line to become obscure without some kind of help.I love this tool .	1
Ive used about every saw in my 25 years remodeling , this saw is all I need most of the time . It cuts better than any saw so I sold my sawboss . Found I can put Frued 6 '' -1/2 '' arbor blades on it . Love it !	1
Well made , quality tool with ample power for most tasks . Well balanced too . Only drawbacks are lack of wrench storage , cheap original blade , and no case ( but this saw gets used enough it would spend little time in case anyway ) . Deduct 1 star for these faults if you see fit .	1
There are very few skil tools that capture my attention . Most are consumer grade like Black and Decker or Craftsman . The wormdrive saws and this trim saw are the exception . They represent the best of the industry . You may laugh at this little saw but it is a wonderful tool . It has full ball bearing construction . It is a professional tool that cuts beautifully . Glides through wood like a fish through water . I bought mine used at a pawn shop but it runs like a top after 6 years of use . You would n't believe it but it spanks Porter Cables saw boss any day of the week . Although it has a smaller motor ,6.5 amps Vs.9 amps , it cuts circles around the PC . The PC never feels like it 's really going to take off in the cut . It cuts O.K . but it never glides through like this little skilsaw . I wish you could run them side by side so you could feel the difference . It 's incredible . I thought it might be an isolated case but I tried several sawboss saws and they were all the same . New blades old blades pine , plywood or oak it does n't matter This saw really goes to town . It 's perfect for trim or framing . The only thing I can say bad about it , is you ca n't cut a 45 on 2x lumber with it . Other than that , it 's flawless . Highly recommended !	1
This is the perfect size little saw ; I absolutely love it ! I have mine mounted to a Rockler acrylic base that I use with a saw guide . I still use my normal 7 1/4 for 2 x4 's and such , but this saw will handle 2x lumber pretty well too . The left side mounted blade is great to see what you 're doing , and the light weight is wonderful . The stock blade is pretty awful , and as others have commented it can be tough to find blades for this saw . I found that using a Skill 4 3/8 '' 40T flooring blade with 2 bushings works . The flooring blade has a 20 mm diameter cutout , and you can get bushings to go to 5/8 '' , and then 5/8 of an inch to half-inch is pretty common . You can get this blade at Home Depot and Lowe 's . Oshlum ( sold on Amazon ) has a 24 tooth blade with the correct bushing for under $ 8 , so it makes for a nice general-purpose blade . The smaller blade is nice for veneer plywood , but at 4 3/8 of an inch it wo n't cut full depth . Does n't matter to me as I only use it for plywood , and a lot cheaper than many 60 tooth blades for the 7 1/4 saw . Just do n't lose your bushings ! They are gold when it comes to the saw.Just wanted to add , Amazon sells this 42 tooth blade as well : Tenryu SL-14042C that will fit with a 5/8 '' to 1/2 '' bushing . This one is 5 1/2 '' About $ 29.00.Just do a search for both names . The saw is worth the small inconvenience in locating blades .	1
While I have't used it much , this saw is truly a joy to use . Be careful when buying blades . I bought a 5 1/2 '' blade thinking it would fit my HD5510 ... ..wrong ! Many of the smaller blades are for cordless saws with a 10mm arbor , while this saw has a 1/2 '' arbor . They are not interchangeable .	1
This saw works great for cutting full sheets of plywood or MDF . It , s light weight and easy to use , with an edge guide , it will make perfect cuts . The strong 6.5 amp motor delivers more than enough power to do the job . It 's cheaper through amazon.com than Lowes or Sears , you ca n't beat price . Great product .	1
I bought this handy contraption because the Bosch brand has never let me down . It 's just the tool for cutting wood trim and does a great job on PVC pipe , too . Plus , this saw has all the features I value . I like using it freehand to square off or flush cut studs and rafter projections when prepping for drywall in my half remodeled 1930 's vintage home . It can reach into places where getting a handsaw is impossible . It has a variable speed dial that lets you match the tool to the material . It 's a shame it does n't come with a blade for metal cutting . I do n't use this tool as much as some of my other Bosch products , like my Progressor jigsaw , but it sure is great to have on hand . Never know just when you 'll need it . Thanks , Amazon !	1
I bought this unit some time ago and finally got to use it remodeling our basement . I have a 12inch compound sliding miter saw in my garage but the thought of lugging that thing down stairs to cut base moulding didnt float my boat . Then , I remembered my Bosch 1640SVK . Yes , it has limitations but none that was a deal breaker . I placed a 3/4 sheet of 24x96 plywood on a couple of saw horses and I was trimming and nailing like a Pro . No clouds of saw dust , no dust vacuum running although SVK does have a 2.25 port . I can sight exactly where I want the narrow kerf and it does the job.I will have this fine tool outside when I re-do the screens on our three season porch.Thanks Again Bosch ! ! !	1
Powerful and very steady balance . I have used this to cut door jams for laying tile . When I first turned it on , I was a bit skeptical ; not wanting to loose a digit . Amazing power for such a small unit , but the balance of it at full power allows for an amazingly clean , and even cut w/ no kick back.Expensive for a niche tool , but you would be amazed at the labour time it saves.For door jams , you basically have to eye the amount to cut . I would suggest cutting the jam at least 2 times , the cut is so clean that if you over estimate the tile height , your can use one of your cuttings , to glue back after the fact.I have also used this unit to `` shave '' interior window trim , that came out a hair too long on a miter saw.This is a must have for a tile or window installer , for a homeowner ; you will find uses for it .	1
I 've used mine about a dozen times . Trimming door molding when installing floor tile . Cutting new door trim , picture frames , etc . It 's a great tool - it 's only limitation is the blade selection . Two styles , both with very fine teeth . Could use a coarse tooth and a really fine tooth for metal ( thinwall , aluminum tracks , etc . ) Miter box is right-on accurate . It has to be clamped to a table to work ( or to a scrap 4x8 ) - this can be a pain , but not too much . One thing I really like - little mess . If I 'm working inside my home , I really do n't want to use the chop saw and get sawdust everywhere - this is the perfect solution.Update : Over five years later , the design is unchanged ( a friend just purchased one ) and my saw is still working like a champ !	1
If you are in the business , then you know what a pain it is to set up your dewalt miter saw for punching out apartmenst or any area for second trim ( shoe molding or scribe molding ) . This tool is the one for that job . I have owned three of them . of course it will not do what a top grade miter saw will do . but it is not suppose to . it also works great for thresholds and for trimming doors for flooring . i am in the fire and water restoration business and i believe you will find this tool very helpful .	1
It 's strange how a tool I never knew existed will drift into my awareness and within a few weeks I will have developed a need for it . I am not so much into fixing things because I like the work , it seems to be because I am fascinated by equipment and will learn a trade or skill just to use whatever new device holds my attention at the moment . And it comes in handy , especially in a case like the Bosch Fine Cut saw.. When I first saw one a few weeks ago my first thought was , `` How cool . But silly . A power handsaw . Is that not a great oxymoron ? And what would you use that for ? `` I liked the way the unit was reversible , the backbone of the saw action is integral to the blade and all the main unit does is provide power . The blade attaches and snaps over to either side in seconds . There are presently only 3 blades available , a coarse , a fine , and a true flush cut fine blade that will only run in one direction due to the offset . I would expect a carbide blade or an abrasive of some sort will be coming soon , as I have often needed a way to trim metal in a similar manner . But still I was unconvinced.About a week after that I got a project to remodel some cabinets in place and instantly discovered `` what for '' . But I resisted at first , thinking I could pull it off with a Japanese backsaw and a recip , even though there would be some problems with scratching the cabinet interior . Before I could get started , I was called to replace a broken board in a redwood pool deck , a five foot section had snapped off of a 12-footer . It would have involved clearing away a railing and everything atop the good wood to remove the long piece and then trim it and replace . An hour , just for that.I picked up the saw immediately . ( $ 99.00 at Lowes ) along with 2 extra blades , as I have read they are somewhat delicate.It took longer to run extension cord to the job than to fix it . I marked the broken board to the length of the repair piece and put the Bosch to work . Two minutes , max , I had a perfect cut without a nick on the adjoining boards . One more job like this and the saw has paid for itself . It is hard to find that in a tool . ( Added later ) - Well , there was that job- replacing a water-damaged bottom panel under a kitchen sink . I probably would n't have even considered the job if not for this saw . A little hard to handle in close quarters , but I had the old panel out in about 20 minutes , with no damage to the cabinet . Like surgery.There may be other units out there that perform as well , I have seen cheap jamb saw for twice the price , and I have heard a plate joiner can be pressed into service for things like the deck . But the Bosch was in the right place at the right time for me , and I am very satisfied with the purchase .	1
I own a few other Bosch tools and they all work flawlessly as does this great handsaw kit . Bosch brand has never let me down . I really enjoy using this handy tool . Thanks Bosch !	1
Pros : - `` Flush Cutting '' means the blade literally slides on the surface and cuts protruding wood to that level . For example , you can cut a piece of wood poking out above a sub-floor so it 's flush , since the blade will slide on the sub-floor itself . Of course , you can cut above the surface , as when shortening door-jambs because you are now installing ceramic tile and you want it to be under the door trim . In such cases , this little gem of a tool is a God-send . I 'm not aware of a competing electric tool , and although a manual saw could work in a pinch , this saw does a much better and faster job.- The flush-cutting blades are quickly reversible , so you can cut right to left or left to right ; depending on which is more convenient.- Accessories include other types of blades , with rougher teeth or for ferrous metals ( aluminum , brass , copper ) .Cons : - While the Bosch Fine Cut saw is a first rate tool , the miter table attachment is nearly useless . During a recent house renovation , before my DeWalt sliding compound saw was on site , I tried one last time to use it for productive work . No luck . This table attachment was so unsatisfactory , it was tossed it in the trash . The piece of wood to be cut vibrates way too much , even when clamped , for a quality cut . Besides , the unit itself , including the `` fence '' is just too darned small for most woodworking tasks . It might do a barely passable job , if you plan to grout the joints , and paint the work , but it is wholly impractical for a cut that needs to be smooth and accurate . Any electric miter saw , or a decent manual miter saw , would do a significantly better job than this tiny miter attachment.- Of the half-dozen Bosch tools I own , this is the only one with a lousy tool case . It 's cheaply constructed with plastic latches , plus the electric cord , saw , and accessories all have to be perfectly situated for the lid to close.Summary : - The 1640VS ( Bosch Fine Cut Power Handsaw ) does not include a tool case , miter table attachment , or clamps.- The 1640VSK includes the tool case , the miter table attachment , two Gross Stabil 6 '' F clamps , and a clamp to hold wood to the miter attachment , while cutting.The saw itself is mainly for remodelers or serious do-it-yourself types , since it 's a speciality tool you wo n't use very often . When you need it , however , you 'll be mighty glad you own one.My advice is to get the saw only ( Bosch 1640VS ) and a decent aftermarket tool case . Amazon sells the Gross Stabil clamps individually . Also , search Amazon for `` miter saw '' and you 'll find some electric models for $ 100 or less . You 'll spend a bit more in total , but have a much better setup.5 stars for the saw and two Gross Stabil clamps , 1 star for the tool case , 0 stars for the miter table attachment .	1
The title of this review says it all . These blades have a separate set of teeth that cut each side of the kerf . You can actually end up with cuts that do n't need sanding ! These cut through everything I have tried them on like butter . They are particularly good on plywood.I use them in my Bosch Jigsaw ( see that review , also ) . I suppose they will fit other brands that have a bayonet mount.If you find a smoother cutting blade , let me know !	1
When I use this item what would be the best way to describe it , fundamentaly useful , awesome , and easy to use , normally I have had products that snap off or just get lodged into whatever I 'm trying to cut this didnt totally happy .	1
T shank blades work will with my new Makita jig saw . there is no chatter or stray from line while cutting with this style blade . I am pleased with the Bosch brand blades .	1
The best jigsaw blades I know . Cut 2x4s square without any blade marks . That makes it good for fine wood also . For this price is a gift ... 5 blades for the rest of your life .	1
I bought these for my B & D Pira & ntilde ; a trim saw . Wished they were a tad longer but they are so sharp , they will cut your finger off just by looking at them . Good for carving turkeys or butchering deer .	1
If you need to make some coarse wood cuts then this will do the job .	1
They do cut fairly clean but not so much on the scroll cuts . If you want cut something fast , however , these are an awesome deal at the clearance pricing I found them for . If Bosch labels it `` clean '' that 's what you use when you do n't want to do a lot of sanding afterwards . If it 's labeled `` progressor '' it 's for making two pieces where there was once only one ASAP.There 's a lot of positive talk about the new Xtra Clean T308B blades out there . I 'll be reviewing them when my first set comes in . It 's hard to find customer reviews though . People tend to stick to what they know , I suspect .	1
Buy these blades and not cheap blades - you get what you pay for in power accessories . These are like Sharks - it will handle wood cutting . I use these in my Dewalt Jig Saw on high variable speed . You want be sorry . Pay the few dollars more . Hope this helps .	1
I put these in my cheap black and decker jigsaw and am amazed at the smoothness of cut in both poplar , oak , and mdf . I do n't have a bandsaw and so I use my jigsaw for cutting curves and various rough cuts in wood . Love it when I find a product that works well and actually improves my tools .	1
These are wicked blades . Combine this with a good Jigsaw and you have a serious tool to do about anything . I 've tried many different blades but these are my favorites . So many things I can do with them without changing out blades is nice .	1
These blades work well and were exactly what I needed to cut my laminate flooring . The price was better than the home improvement stores .	1
These blades are great . I put them through the paces right away by clamping two 1/2 & # 34 ; pine boards together and attempted to cut a fine line through both simultaneously and these blades held up fine and made a nice curved cut . Nice improvement over the blades that came with my PORTER-CABLE PC600JS 6 Amp Orbital Jig Saw . The fit perfect and worked great .	1
The Bosch T234X Progressor wood blades set is the one set of blades that you will find you will reach for in most of your jigsaw projects . Top quality , long lasting , clean cutting edges and easy identification . But , figure on using them only in Bosch jigs .	1
These blades are very sharp the cuts that use to minutes now takes seconds always thought my saw was weak but it was the blades I was using what a cost saving I can buy a lot of blades for the price of a new saw thanks BOSCH	1
As always , a great product at a great price . I 've been purchasing from Amazon for several years and VALUE is the key word .	1
These are fast cutting and do a good job if you are doing rough in work but if you want something for finer work bosch has good blades for that too .	1
These blades are sharp and cut very smoothly . I have used them with both my corded Porter Cable and my cordless 18v Makita and they work well with both . I will purchase more of these .	1
Progressor Wood Blades . I wanted some blades that were going to make my job easier , and these really got the job done . Really glad I picked them .	1
I have only used one of these blades a couple of times since purchasing , as I have a lot of other saws that i use for most things i cut , but the blade did what i was supposed to do very well . Very sharp , and nice smooth cuts . I would recommend buying these blades over something cheaper , the results are worth the extra money .	1
I have a terrible black & Decker Jig that wants to turn to the left constantly , my boss had these blades and they amazed me with how well they cut and how easy they were to maneuver , so I thought I would buy some and see how they worked in mine . I can now say I no longer feel like I could cut a curvy line better with my skilsaw than with my Jig.Great blades Highly recommend .	1
Bosch makes the best jig saw blades in my mind . These in particular are perfect for ripping wood . Big teeth , and sharp . They stay sharp for a relatively long time too .	1
I 'm crazy about these blades , blades that perform exactly as promised . I made some cuts with my Bosch jigsaw using regular blades . Then I switched blades and made cuts in the same materials with the Progessor blades . I was awed . The cuts were easy , fast , and smooth . I even made some cuts in the wooden garden ties picked up from Home Depot . I usually cut these with my chain saw . The ties were no obstacle for my Bosch jigsaw armed with Progressor blades.I 've used these blades on plywood , planks , garden ties , and 2 '' PVC pipe with equal success .	1
These blades cut efficiently and stay sharp with use . They are thick so that they do n't break easily . It pays to go with quality like this .	1
These blades work great and make a nice smooth straight cut . Nice precision ground teeth . Much better than anything you get 10 or 20 years ago , when jigsaws mostly made ragged ugly cuts with splinters hanging out everywhere . Good choice for cutting openings in plywood cabinets when you want a decent looking cut .	1
I did n't know what a great tool my Milwaukee saber saw was until I bought these blades . The quality is obvious when you open the box . They cut like the proverbial hot knife through butter . Amazing ! And the cuts are so CLEAN . You 're gon na love these blades .	1
I got these to use with my Black & Decker PSL12 12-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless Piranha Outdoor Pruning Saw ( which I also got on Amazon ) . These new models use a clamplike devise to grab the blade . These work perfectly and they did not cost much .	1
Wow ! The teeth on these things are as sharp as scalpels . The teeth are milled sharp and flat rather than being stamped .	1
I bought these blades in December , 2006 , and have used them on hardwood and pressure treated decking . They give a smooth cut with little or no tear-out , but they do deflect a little . I would definitely recommend them though , as the cut is really clean . I ca n't figure out why amazon raised their price to above what the retail big-box stores carry these for , makes no sense to me . Amazon 's price went to double what I paid just 6 months ago at amazon , yet the Marketplace sellers still have it at half the price . The India-based customer service reps were of no help when I asked about the price change .	1
I 'm even cutting curves confidently with these Bosch blades in my saw . I made a couple of small arched shelves recently and could not believe how smoothly I cut the curve . It hardly even needed sanding . I run my saw about mid speed with these . Once they start biting , it 's silky smooth . Make sure you have good pressure when getting started in hard wood or the saw will try to walk . Sometimes I take a small handsaw and cut a starting groove to prevent that . I 'm now zipping through wood with these Bosch blades . The handsaw stays in the closet much more . With the blades I used to `` try '' to use , the cutting line was always covered in sawdust . Impossible to work that way . These Bosch blades put the sawdust on the floor and let you cut nonstop through your line , the way its supposed to be .	1
I bought these blades to cut do some scrollwork in some marine grade plywood and there was almost zero tearout . Very smooth cuts . The best blades I 've ever used .	1
These blades cut great . Nice clean cut on veneered products such as the side of a cabinet , etc . Only downside , and maybe it 's just with my Festool jigsaw , when ran at high speeds ( cutting ) these blades make the worst high pitched noise you 've ever heard . I ca n't even explain the sound but if you do n't plug your ears it will literally make you brain dead . You can feel your ear drums resonating in your head ! And again , maybe it 's just my saw or my ears but it 's painful . If I am only making a 5 & # 34 ; cut with this blade I will literally walk off the job site to my truck and get my ear plugs . It 's that bad . Other than that the blades cut great !	1
Blades work great . Get a smooth clean cut , however the laminate edges were n't perfect but I did n't expect them to be . The irregularities were microscopic and easily covered by my drop in sink .	1
I got these blades to use in a `` Rockwell Bladerunner '' saw . They fit nice , cut good , and are a decent price . They do n't seem to be able to handle quite as tight of radius as the blade that came with the Rockwell for scrolling without the piece vibrating . These blades are a little shorter than the blades that came with the Bladerunner but work fine for my needs . If you are wanting to cut a thicker piece of wood you might want to get a slightly longer blade .	1
Bosch makes great products.I have the cordless tool set which is awesome ! This compliments my jigsaw . These blades last a long time and cut very well . They were great for cutting laminate counter tops . They did n't rip or cause any damage .	1
These blades cut super smooth . The only downside is that they create a lot of fine dust but that is expected .	1
I have a couple of jigsaws ( including a Bosch barrel grip ) and these blades are the best I have used . I prefer the Bosch blade style anyway , and this particular Bosch blade in particular . I have used this blade on many different woods and plywoods and I find the performance to be excellent in every material . The cuts are usually splinter free and the thin blade design allows for accurate curve cutting and scrollsaw-like precision . Though the blade is thin , it is surprisingly sturdy ( they do n't break too easily ) .I highly recommend these blades to all finish carpenters and woodworkers . They are top notch and this is a very good price !	1
I think this is a great blade for the money . They are sharp and last long - I usually wind up breaking them before they dull .	1
I do not use this as rip guide but it is great for circle cutting . Hard to read scale and yes the plastic is not the best material for a guide like this , but as a circle cutter it works .	1
This is my second one of these . The first was borrowed ( forever ) by a friend of mine . He used it once , and said . . . it fits great , works well and now I can use the jig saw for more precise cutting and quick jobs without all the measurements & quot ; .That really sums it up . You can actually set this guide up on your BOSCH jig saw in easily less than a minute , start to finish . The circle cutout feature is slick but simple . You simply flip the pin over to one side or the other depending on which way you are cutting and it pretty much stays put ( assuming that you press it in place or drill a location hole for the ABS pin ) which allows you to cut a consistent circle . It may be nice to have this machined out of a substantial casting or stamped aluminum with darkened numerals , but for the money , it is pretty tough to complain about ( so I wo n't ) . Good , useful accessory , thats been well worth the money time and time again .	1
Cuts through materials of all types ( with the right blade ) . Extremely easy to control due to the comfortable barrel grip . Blade change is quick and almost effortless . Dust blower is effective but requires the use of wrap-around eye protection . I do seem to have trouble keeping my cuts perfectly square but this is the plight of every jig saw user ( small shoe , difficult to keep flat on cutting surface ) . Overall , I am very happy .	1
This saw is a dream , it goes through wood like a butter knife through hot butter . It 's simple to operate and easy to hold while cutting out shapes and angles . I used it recently to cut some metal bars and was amazed at how easily it chewed through the metal leaving a nice fine cut you could have never gotten with a hack saw . I 'm not a professional and I do n't use this was all the time . I 'm a regular family handyman who gets ideas from reading woodworking books and magazines . And I do n't know how I managed to get along without this saw now that I have one . If you 're a weekend do it yourselfer like me , this saw is like owning a BMW instead of a scooter . Do yourself a favor and buy this saw . You wo n't regret it .	1
I 've used this jig saw many times , and I would recommend it to anyone from a hobbyist to the most experienced contractor . The barrel grip gives the operator the utmost of control ( more so than the top handle model ) . The blade change is a snap and through vigorous use shows no sign of blade slippage . The variable speed control allows you to cut through a variety of materials without putting too much of a strain on the motor causing it to prematurely wear out . This is by far the best jig saw I 've ever used or owned .	1
I have a Bosch Top Handle Jig-saw . I believe it is clearly the best jig saw made . I could go on for hours , like I did in my earlier review , but their is one thing I wanted to mention here . Although I love my top handle , if I was going to do it over again , I would buy the barrel grip . Why ? Because the mechanics of steering a perfectly straight course , are easier to do with your hand around the body rather than perched on top of it . The barrel grip enables you to do one handed cutting with more stability . I am talking on a very fine level . I noticed Norm Abrams on the New Yankee Workshop uses the barrel grip as well.Please do n't misunderstand me , I am not talking about the top handle model dancing around or anything like that . I am spoiled by Bosch 's accuracy , and sometimes use the jig saw to make critical straight cuts using an edge guide . With a fine tooth blade , it leaves an edge so smooth , I just go over it lightly with a little sandpaper when I am done and it looks like a finish edge.So what to do ? When I am using the top handle saw with a single hand , I modify my grip by grabbing it around the body , instead of using the top handle . By doing it that way , you get more of the barrel grip control , even though the rear part of the top handle gets in the way.This steering control that I am mentioning is not a major item . I am not going to pick up a barrel grip instead and consider selling mine . I just would prefer the barrel grip for that fine level of single handed control . Both are magnificent saws.Quite simply put , the ergonomics-mechanics of the barrel grip contribute to the capability of creating an incredibly smooth and accurate cut that these Bosch Jig Saws are capable of producing . I 'm being super critical here , the amount of wiggle produced is very fine , much more so than most people would care to think about . If you need to make a perfect cut , and want to do so closer to the line , and spend less time at the orbital sanding station , the barrel grip is the way to go.The other thing worth mentioning is that if you have the work secured with a clamp , and can get both hands on the top grip , you can cut a perfect line with great control also . If you already own the top handle as I do , try cutting with it by grabbing the barrel instead and you will see what I mean.After using cheapie jig saws for years , picking up the Bosch and using it for the first time , you wonder how you ever got along without it . Highly recommend for both models , I just recommend the barrel grip a tiny bit more .	1
I bought this saw 6 months ago based on the previous reviews , but have n't used it until recently . This is my first jig saw , but I know a good product when I see it . It cut through wood like butter . Easy to handle , but powerful . Bosch craftmanship is superb . I had no problems changing blades . What more could you ask for ?	1
I was n't even in the market for a new jigsaw - my old Craftsman worked fine for me . Sure it vibrated a little , and sure it was a bit slow cutting and hard to control the speed , and sure the cut would waver a little from top to bottom , but it generally got the job done . Then Bosch came out with the rebate and it got me thinking . I had always had been intrigued with the barrel grip design , and I did think I needed more power , so that incentive was enough to push me over the edge and upgrade.I have n't been disappointed . What impressed me first was the smoothness of operation . I had always assumed a reciprocating tool like a jigsaw had to be rough because of the nature of the operation . Somehow Bosch has practically eliminated the vibration in this tool . Then of course , there is the power of the motor that just keeps on chugging at the whatever speed you select . I have n't yet tested it on really tricky curves , but so far that blade support system has worked wonderfully , keeping the blade going straight down and where you point it.The barrel-grip vs. the handle-grip is a matter of personal preference , of course , but so far I have enjoyed the b-g design . It seems more versatile for tight spaces , plus your hand has more leverage down close to the action . Unlike a trigger switch , where you just let go , you do have to remember to shut it off when you get to the end of your cut , but that should come with experience.Overall , I am quite happly with my purchase . I ca n't speak for durability , of course , since I just got it , but it looks rugged enough . One thing I know for sure is that I will be having more fun cutting holes from now on !	1
I bought this saw and have used it a lot in refurbishing an old house . It is a powerful and excellent saw and it cuts exceptionally true even through very thick stock . The only problem some people might have with it is that it is quite large and heavy . I have large hands so this is not a serious problem but thank God I did not buy the even larger Bosch model which is REALLY huge ! Also , changing blades is a pain if you do not do it all the time since the procedure is overly complicated . No wonder they put it on the barrel of the saw !	1
I just got the jig saw and right away was impressed with how well it cut . I 've always had the cheap jig saws ... since for a jig saw you only need a machine that moves the blade up and down right ? ... .WRONG ! You need a blade guide that stabalizes the cutting edge , you need a powerfull machine behind it to provide a consistant speed stroke , you need a balanced machine to avoid fatique and not have the machine vibrate . Also , the Bosch blades cut like butter thru the wood . I was able to make repetative 1/8th cuts in pine without the blade wandering and I was holding the wood on the bench only with my hand..hardly any vibration .	1
I 'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one , but I do n't think that any are better . The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work . Dust is blown away easily . Just humms through wood . Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change : I ca n't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform . I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades . Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set -- excellent value . If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools . They are consistently excellent . Would buy this one again .	1
Let me save you time and money -- I 've researched all the jig saws out there and this is yet another solid , well designed/built tool from Bosch . No need to search any more-this is the one ! ! My advise : BUY IT ! ! you will love it .	1
Bosch is the standard by which all other jig saw makers judge themselves . This in itself pretty much says it all . Once you use this tool , you will understand what that means.I prefer the barrel grip b/c it is easier for me to control . However , the handle model has all the same features , just a different grip configuration , so the choice is purely a personal one.This saw cuts through almost anything like butter . There is very little vibration . These features pair up to make your control over the tool excellent , and that is what you get a jig saw for ! Changing blades is quick and easy . Changing the base angle is a snap.If you are looking for a jig saw you are going to have for a long time , then this is the tool to get .	1
Feels like a dream in your hand , cuts like a champ..If you can spend a little extra buy this saw , it 's well worth it for the handling..	1
I bought this saw at a woodworking show a couple years ago and have been thrilled with its performance ever since . I previously owned an inexpensive Black and Decker which had poor balance , a top handle , and tended to vibrate terribly . I have also used DeWalt and Milwaukee jigsaws , and I still maintain that Bosch is the best . I happen to prefer the barrel grip . With this saw I can make super smooth , nearly tear-out free cuts in almost any material as long as I use the proper blade and blade speed . The sheer lack of vibration alone makes this saw worth its weight in gold when you are trying to make an intricate cut in thin material ! ! ! I highly recommend this product .	1
In 1982 I had a nice Makita sabre saw . A friend ( a man with unusually small hands ) urged me to try his Bosch barrel grip saw . It was great ! Returned the Makita , bought the Bosch.We use this saw all the time . My wife even cuts 2X4 's with it -- she does n't like to use a circular saw . It cuts today as it did in '82.SO WHY SHOULD N'T YOU BUY ONE FOR YOURSELF ? The blade change . It has gotten worse and worse over the years . Now I can change a blade in however many tries it takes . My wife wo n't even try any more.Get the new model . Everyone is raving about the ease of blade changing .	1
Essentially , BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the way . I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt 's and used the Hitachi 's ( which I thought may be comparable , because they look similar , except for the color , and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison . The BOSCH is by far the best . Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we 're supposed to ) to what you 're cutting . Both the top handle and barrel grip are irreplacable , anytime anyone has used mine , they get them too !	1
You can use this tool all day because it is so well balanced . It cuts fast , smooth , has less vibration , and easy to control . The T shank blades are stronger than any other competitive design . Maybe that 's why you see so many on jobsites.I have yet to find another tool by any manufacturer that impresses me as much as this tool.Bosch also has the best blade selection in the industry . I 'm impressed everytime I use it . Highly recommended !	1
I bought this saw to make yard ornaments and work on my train layout . It is the smoothest cutting jigsaw I have ever used ! The variable orbit feature is really handy , as I discovered while modifying the dash of my '83 Toyota pickup to mount a new stereo.The power comes up smoothly when the trigger is depressed and there is excellent control of blade speed . The handle is very comfortable , which combined with a lack of vibration , makes the saw easy to maneuver . It is a whole lot larger than the old wristshaker B & amp ; D it replaced , but that has not been a problem.The Progressor blades are really super , I have used them on wood , plastic and metal with excellent results . The double grind on the wood blades is the key to the smooth cut ; each side of the kerf is cut by a separate set of teeth.I have used this saw on more different projects that I ever thought I would . It has become a staple in my arsenal !	1
I bought this jigsaw on a salesperson 's recommendation from a home center last summer . The underpowered scroll saw I was using to teach a woodworking class at 4H youth summer camp was not cutting it ( no pun intended ) . I needed a reliable tool with backbone , and fast . It saved the week at camp with flying colors , and showed me just how great Bosch tools really are . Now , I own several Bosch power tools , and not one has disappointed me yet . The orbital action on the Progressor makes it mow right through plywood and studs like nothing . The variable speed knob lets you match the speed to the work . It cuts sheet metal well , too , if you clamp the sheet down on plywood first . I 've used the saw to do demolition work , like cutting out plumbing and furnace vent openings in wall sill plates , and cutting access holes into a shingled roof . It 's great for cutting PVC and copper pipe , too . This little powerhouse will cut anything with the proper blade . Just insert the blade , and turn the top knob until you hear and feel that CLICK , and you 're ready to go . I would n't start a remodeling job without it .	1
I 'm not a hard-core tool kind of person -- I tend to buy tools ( mostly ) based on need . I had my trusty Craftsman that gave me many years of service -- it finally broke and I needed a replacement . I just happened to see the Bosch on sale at Amazon and others seemed to like it , so I bought . I was struck by how smooth and quiet it was ( relative to the Craftsman ) -- so much so that I thought I had a defective unit . I made a test cut into a piece of wood and quickly realized this was a terrific power tool . It 's balanced and easy to guide . At first I was a bit disappointed becasue the speed control was by trigger , rather than the 10 position dial on my Craftsman ( yes it was a very old Craftaman ) . After about 2 minutes of use I realized that the dial system was hopelessly outdated . So , in case you can tell , I like it very much and am very pelased with my purchase .	1
I absolutely love this jigsaw , so much that I actually try to come up with projects requiring its use . Plenty of power , rock solid cutting , easy-enough blade changes , and with the Progressor blades , amazing cutting speed with great smoothness . I was , like many people moving up to this kind of tool , replacing a older Ryobi-Craftsman -- one that I thought was pretty decent -- but there 's just no comparison . The Craftsman got sold at a yard sale for $ 4 . The newer Bosch 1590 model has gotten some wishy-washy reviews , so I went with the proven performer and I do n't regret it a bit .	1
I have owned a lot of jigsaws in my life , but this is easily the best I 've ever had . It is powerful , easy to use , cuts through wood like butter . Blade replacement is simple with no tools necessary , just wind and unwind the crank at the top . I do n't know how it works but it works great ! The blade can be set to cycle in a oval up/down , forward/back motion , which is great for fast wood cutting , or set to run up and down only for precise work . The bottom plate is strong , heavy metal and does n't bend out out of shape from the pounding . For really fine work , the plastic sole can be changed out so as not to mar expensive woods . And the Progressor blades it works with just chew up wood like you would n't believe with straight , clean edges . It 's a little heavy but there is n't much vibration and it 's comfortable to hold on long cutting jobs . I think it 's a great tool , I recommend it very highly !	1
The unit is rugged and does n't wander . I 've used it for 6 months now and changing blades is a breeze . The adjustable orbital cut allows for fine cuts as well as aggressive cuts . It 's a dream to use compared to the cheap wan na bees . I did n't know that you could control a jig saw until I bought this one .	1
I received my 1587AVSP yesterday and played around with it . I mainly wanted to see if the blade locking mechanism was as difficult as some had written about . The first try proved a little difficult , but the second was a breeze . There 's one simple step that needs to be done before loosening the blade clamp . Push the blade clamp as high into the housing as it will go to clear it away from the roller . That 's it.Putting things simply , the locking mechanism is like any other screw type clamp . The number of turns needed to lock the blade in place depends on how open it is and how thick the shank is . After the click , if it is n't aligned with the handle , keep clicking.I must agree with everyone that said the saw was smooth . There is going to be some vibration , but I 'm very impressed by how little there is . I 've used a jig saw made by BD before and there is not comparison . The Bosch is balanced to be used all day.As for the blades that came with the set , a pretty good selection is provided . I 'm not sure if all packages carry the same set of blades , but this is what came with mine.T345XF - all-purpose - Progressor , BiM , 5 1/4 & quot ; T234X - wood - Progressor , HCS , 4 1/2 & quot ; T123X - metal - Progressor , HSS , 4 & quot ; T144D - wood - HCS , 4 & quot ; , 6 TPIT118A - metal - HSS , 3 & quot ; , 24 TPIT118G - metal - HSS , 3 & quot ; , 36 TPIT101AO - wood - HCS , 3 & quot ; , 20 TPIT101BR - wood - HCS , 4 & quot ; , 10 TPIT101DP - wood - HCS , 4 & quot ; , 6 TPIHope this helps and thanks to all who reviewed .	1
Two years ago I was looking for a new jigsaw . Because of a couple of the reviews here , I purchased the Bosch 1587 AVSP Progressor . This is no doubt the best jig saw I have ever used . It handles anything that I ask it to cut . I am a Carpenter and have been in the business since 1980 and used and abused a lot of jigsaws . Nothing compares to this saw in my judgement . This one takes all the punishment you can dish out and comes out shining . The easy change blade is great and the fact that whatever type blade you need for whatever job -- is available . Even for super tight tolerance finish work , this saw comes through . Buy it , you 'll love it .	1
... Last night I wanted to see the power of my new tool . I grabbed a piece of seasoned 2x12 fir scrap , fitted in the aggressive tooth progressive blade that came with the unit and proceeded to cut right through the stock without applying hardly any forward force . The blade practically cut through that fir by itself , and lo and behold , it was a perpendicular cut , like I had used my circular saw . Hmmm , impressive , I thought . Next I decided to put some turns into the cut . I turned a tight S curve through the material and the blade did not slow down at all ! My old jig saw would have vibrated to a halt and possibly snapped the blade with such a maneuver.And this Jig Saw is a beauty to behold , has a nice heft to it , feels like an extension of your hand ( maybe this is a guy thing ! ) . I have used the Porter Cable , B & D ; , Skil , Craftsman and they all pale in comparison . If you use this type of tool on a frequent basis , this is the ONLY one to have !	1
It 's a known fact that Bosch is # 1 especially when it comes to Jig Saws and this saw is no exception . This is one great product ! ! Buy it	1
I have lately become a big fan of Bosch power tools . The company really excels in the area of saws and routers . After buying the Bosch 10 & quot ; slide compound miter saw ( see my review there ) , I decided to also buy the & quot ; Progressor. & quot ; I am very happy I did . This saw cuts through 3/4 & quot ; plywood like the wood is n't even there -- no exaggeration . I use it to do rough cross-cuts and rips , and it performs beautifully . The edge it leaves is very smooth . With a steady hand , you can cut perfect lines ; it 's pretty easy to keep the saw moving in a straight line . It 's got a very convenient dust-blower that keeps the sawdust away from the line you 're cutting , which helps make it even easier to cut nice straight lines . The trigger system allows you to very easily adjust the saw 's speed -- just pull the trigger a little more or let up a little bit and the saw responds perfectly . The saw comes with a great set of & quot ; progressor & quot ; blades for different types of materials , and the saw has easy-to-use switches for setting the saw to cut different materials . The blade-changing system is something that I know people complain about with the Bosch , but , honestly , it 's not difficult to master it , and the blade clearly & quot ; clicks & quot ; into place so you know it 's in . Finally , the metal case that comes with the saw is actually useful ( unlike many other cases that come with power tools ) . From beginning to end , I really ca n't think of a single negative aspect of this saw . It gets my strong recommendation .	1
This jigsaw cuts extremely well . I dont know how Bosch does it but there is something about this jig saw that makes it cut better than all the others . Throw in the quick change option and WHOA ! it 's unbelievable . Unless you use your jigsaw on rare occasions , or really just need a jigsaw for cutting rough stuff , get this one.PROS** Easy blade change** Unbelievable cutting performance** Great baseCONS** NONE ( that i can think of )	1
Without a doubt the best of the best . There are so many features that makes this saw the best . There is not another saw that even comes close . it runs smooth . cuts aggressive ( when aggresion is needed ) as well as runs straight and true when fine detail is needed . i do a wide aray of things with mine . including ripping . Try one out and compare it to other saws , you will agree . There is only one jigsaw in my opinion . the rest are just up and down vibrators .	1
Though this jigsaw may seem costly , it 's worth every cent . The case is well laid out and contains plenty of space for accessories . The extra blades are nice as well . Some people have complained about the blade changing system . I had no problems picking it up and it quite easy to change the blades quickly.The saw itself is powerful and smooth . I have cut some thick long boards with it easily and accurately . If you buy one , get the jigsaw table . It 's very nice to have .	1
I have used BOSCH jig saws and tools for years . They are always well designed and good tools in their own right . The jig saw was invented by BOSCH ( back in 1942 ) . That is over 50 years of innovation that has gone into this particular tool and it shows . I never had any difficulty with the & quot ; Clic & quot ; change blade mounting , other than initially being nervous that I broke something when I heard the & quot ; clic & quot ; for the first time , perhaps & quot ; crack & quot ; change is more accurate , but the marketing or tool buyers would not likely go for that ( myself included ) . Other than the sound of the click this tool is nearly flawless . Low vibration , comfortable grip in multiple positions , strong quiet motor , various cutting strokes including orbital action . The accurate variable speed dial really allows you to take advantage of the huge assortment of blades , and you are not locked into using only BOSCH blades . Any of the universal ' T ' shank blades will fit in this saw which is a plus if BOSCH is not available at your local hardware store . I have however , found BOSCH blades to be superior , particularly when metal cutting ( the BOSCH tends to bend , DeWalts Cobalt line breaks which is quite dangerous ) . The new saw has an improved footplate , BOSCH previously used a stamped steel footplate ( still do on their pnuematic model ) that was prone to bending and was nearly impossible to straighten and get dead flat . The new die cast aluminum , footplate is lighter and more rigid and it 's bevel markings are much easier to read now . Regarding other accessories , the parallel edge guide/circle cutter is very handy for the money ( Part # JA 1003 ) it is also available from Amazon/Tool Crib , and allows/encourages you to use this saw for quick cuts and rips with far less mess than than a circular saw , especially if the other tools are not out yet . This is the best jig saw on the market , bar none , very highly recommended !	1
I love power tools . A few stand out as the best . Usually made by the company who invented them . For instance , the skilsaw . Who has ever designed a better saw than the 77 wormdrive saw ? How about the sawzall ? No one can touch the super sawzall in a comparison test or in the real world . With jigsaws , Bosch is tops.They invented the thing . They make the best one available today . Everyone else has tried to copy their design , but not one has exceeded or even equalled it in design or usefulness . Believe me , I 've had many . In magazine review after review it alone stands out as the best . Why ? It cuts faster . It cuts smoother . It vibrates less . It 's easier to control . The T shank blades are stronger than any other competitive design . It makes less noise . It 's easy to hook up to your shop-vac . You do n't need tools to change blades . ( to be fair , Milwaukee does have a nicer blade changing set up , and Dewalt has a better footplate adjustment ) All this and a very reasonable price make it the logical choice . Maybe that 's why you see them on so many jobsites . Incidently this saw was recently rated second in a comparison test . What was rated higher ? The new Bosch 1589 saw that 's not available yet in the U.S .	1
I will start by saying that I have owned and used several other jig saws , and this one ranks right at the top . Vibration is minimal to nonexistent , and the variable speed and orbital settings make it possible to get smooth cuts in any type of material . I also purchased the combo 30-pack of Bosch blades , and found them to be of outstanding quality . I can not add anything to what has already been said of the comfort and power of this saw ... it 's all true . However , I did find a flaw that I thought was worth mentioning . When I first received my saw , I made several practice cuts in different types of material of varying thicknesses using different blades . These were all straight cuts , and I found in every case that the saw base was 3-4 degrees off of perpendicular . I carefully checked and rechecked , making sure that the saw base was flat to the material during the cut , and always had the same results ... . Since the saw only has fixed angle adjustments on the base , no fine tuning is possible . Correcting the problem is only possible if the base plate is shimmed . I used layers of tape on mine . I know that a jig saw is not a precision tool , and that the blade can deflect on course/swirled wood grain and on curved cuts , but this defect seemed excessive . On a piece of 2 '' dimensional lumber , the saw produces a straight cut that is 1/8 '' out of vertical . Certainly not as good as other saws that I have used . Overall , I am very pleased with the saw , and would still recommend it for its power , versatility and stability . I would give it 3 1/2 stars , because it is certainly an above average tool . Almost perfect !	1
I bought the Bosch 1619 EVS 3 1/4 hp router at the same time as this one . The Bosch 1619 is a plunge router and is much , much heavier.I like the size and weight of the 1618 better . I also like the ability to take out the motor and put it into a plunge or under-table base as the need arises . The reversible auxiliary handle is a nice feature for anyone left handed .	1
I own somewhere around a dozen Bosch tools , from jig saws to cordless drills . Every one of them shows a high degree of fit and finish , with good ergonomics and precise controls.Although I like the performance of this router and will certainly get good use out of it , I was surprised that the fit and finish were not as I would have expected . The adjustment knob is loose and sloppy , although the adjustment seems to be pretty precise.Someone else mentioned the lock-on button being recessed too much . While I agree it could protrude a little more , it does function . If it sticks out too far , you could accidentally pop it on and surprise yourself . But the button is too small for its recess and sits off to a side . Plenty of room for dust to get in . Again , it was surprising to see this lack of tolerance on a Bosch router.Other than that , the router itself just seemed to lack that polish and precision in plastic molding I see on all of my other Bosch tools.I wonder if the economy and some leftover Skill engineers are taking their toll on Bosch standards ?	1
I purchased this router on a recommendation of a fellow woodworker . Overall I am really satisfied with the router . Do plan on adding a tiny bit of lube between the base and motor for smoother adjustments ( thus only 4 stars ) . Other than that , the soft start is great . Power is smooth and delivered . And the D-Handle is a must have for safety reasons . Even with one hand the router feels much safer than the knob versions out there . The weight of the unit is n't too bad , so this one can be held for durations without issues ... This router is has a variable speed knob on the top making it yet even more useful.I own several Bosch tools and I have n't had any problems with them . They continue to work , job after job .	1
We all know the experience of buying and using equipment that you thought could have been made better . Not so with this router . This is a solidly engineered piece of equipment.I really like the D-Handle . Control is excellent and the the trigger control is right where it should be . The power cord is attached to the handle which makes it convenient to disconnect and safely change bits.The fine adjustment really works . The soft start is smoothly soft and the variable speed control works as promised.If you compare this router with others with the same horsepower , you will note that this router has a 12 amp design , vs the 8-10 amps in the other models . This gives this router the extra advantage of being able to drive larger bits or deeper cuts.The company has introduced a new edge guide for this router , the RA1054 . The RA1054 is the same as the RA1051 except that the rods will be the correct size for the 1618EVS . The RA1051 is the one with the fine adjustments . The original edge guide for this router was the RA1053 , but it did not have the fine adjustments . ( I guess Bosch is listening ) . It is not listed yet on their website but I confirmed it through their tech support.I also bought the case , the 9-piece template guide set and centering cone , all very nicely made . I was a little ticked at having to purchase the cetering cone seperately . It is inexpensive and its use is inherently part of the touted design features of this router . They provided the template guide adapter , why not the centering cone ? Note that this model uses the same accessories as the 1613EVS . ( they do not list them seperately ) . By the way Bosch , take a hint ... please include the dust control adapter . Dust control is a health issue you should readily promote.One more little peeve . Do you think power tool manufacturers could include a manual thats a cut above one made for a toaster . The one supplied with this router is terrible.If your looking for a solid router you will be hard pressed to find a better one .	1
This is by far the best router that I have used , and I 've used them all ! It is incredibly powerful , quiet , well designed , easy to handle , and light . The soft start feature is a huge plus . The variable speed is very helpful . Heck of a deal for the money.I use this tool with the Bosch Deluxe edge guide to make trim and moulding . No question this is professional level tool that great for homeowner and contrator.I love this thing ! I have yet to find something I do n't like .	1
I just got one of these , so what I offer here are just my initial impressions . If I think of anything to add after using it a while I 'll update or replace this review . I originally bought aPorter-Cable 690LRVS 11 Amp 1-3/4 Horsepower Fixed Base Variable Speed Router , but was disappointed in the adjustment mechanism , so I decided to go ahead and spring for this . The Bosch is n't perfect , but I can tell I 'll be happier with it that I would have been with the Porter-Cable . So here are some thoughts : - The Bosch 's fine adjustment mechanism is smoother than the Porter-Cable 890 , which I 'd tried in a local store , and of course the Porter-Cable 690 does n't even have a fine adjustment mechanism . Bernie is right when he says you ca n't run the entire range of the height just by turning the fine adjustment , but I think that 's a tradeoff to have a more sensitive and accurate adjustment mechanism . The fine adjustment mechanism has a range of 7/8 '' , so to move the bit more than that you have to use the course adjustment to move the motor up or down into the next notch . Since I want precise control over this adjustment , I prefer the Bosch system over the Porter-Cable's.- I think Bernie must not realize you have to rotate the motor to remove it from the base . It slides straight up and down for the course adjustments , but when you get to the end of the motor 's travel you can rotate it and it will come right out.- The handle is too big in my opinion . Specifically , the grip is too far away from the router , unless your index finger is 1.25 '' thick , which mine is not . So the grip is about 1/4 '' -1/2 '' farther from the router than it needs to be and than I 'd like it to be.- This may be by design to prevent turning the router on unintentionally , but the trigger requires way too much force in my opinion . The router weighs a little over nine pounds and I can hold the router by the trigger without turning it on . I do n't see how you could use this thing for any length of time without making your finger sore.- Some people have complained that the trigger lock button is too recessed to use easily , but that 's not been my experience . If I hold the side of my thumb against it while I pull the trigger it locks just fine.- The motor on this thing feels smoother than that on the Porter-Cable 690RLVS , and quieter too . The result is something that feels better made than the PC motor . The soft start is fabulous , and variable speed is a real plus . As far as I can tell , Porter-Cable does n't sell a variable speed D-handle version of the 690 , so this gets the nod there too.- The depth locking mechanism had to be adjusted , as the motor was sliding around with the lock on when I got it . I guess there 's a reason for that , but I do n't know what it is , and I could n't find any instuctions to tell me how to know when I had the correct tightness.- The cord has a little label wrapped around it telling you to read the instructions before using it and all that . I only know that because I can read French , as the warning was only provide in Spanish and French . I guess Bosch thinks English speakers do n't need to be told to read the manual before using it . LOLSo far I 'm very happy with it , and happy I returned the Porter-Cable and got this instead . I 'm lookin forward to having a lot of fun with this puppy .	1
Very smooth motor . Soft start ramps router up to speed smoothly . Very good power . Do not really care for D handle routers . Thought I 'd try it . Really just wanted the EVS motor from the router for my router table . Did not work to well in table as switch works only intermitately in table because of dust . Switch worked fine after blown out w/ compressed air . Milwaukee 5625-20 production router now resides underneath my benchdog router table . Well made router that gets a one staer demotion for faulty switch . Now motor gets used in my fixed base/plunge base 1617 kit when I need variable speed .	1
After using and abusing one of these at work for 3 years , I bought one for my self . The handles really give me the control I like . It can almost take the place of a belt sander in your tool collection .	1
The Bosch 3107DVS 5 & quot ; won top honors in a major woodworking magazine , and well deserved . It is aggressive enough to remove a lot of material fast , yet gentle enough with a reduced speed for fine work as well , thanks to the variable speed . The dust collection is perfect if hook it up to a shop vac . I use a vac with a 2 1/2 & quot ; diameter hose . It is larger than the intake port on the sander , and what that does is allow the vac to pick up that one percent of the dust that escapes around the edge of the sander . Even the expensive Fein setup does not get every drop of dust . The 8 holes in the base suck up most of it , but the dust generated at the edges escapes . The 2 1/2 & quot ; diameter hose , attached to a regular size roll around shop vac , leaks real bad around the fitting , so it sucks way more air than the sander allows , and that even picks up that last little bit escaping into the air.The vibration of this sander is next to nothing . I used a cheap vibrating sander for a while , and my hands started to throb . The Bosch 3107DVS you can use for an hour with no discomfort.All in all , it is the best sander out there . I had bought the 6 & quot ; version and absolutely loved it so much , that when one of these 5 & quot ; models became available to me in a deal , I grabbed it . The advantage of the 5-inch is that the paper is available locally . If you are ever in a pinch , the 6-inch paper is tough to find . By the way , buy the Mirka paper for these here at Amazon . It is a deal . The local home center sells the Norton paper , which does not hold up like the Mirka . With the Mirka here you get twice as much paper , at half again as much price . So not only does it last longer , and give you a more even job , but the upfront price is better as well.Now onto the glitch . The 3107DVS has a single screw holding the pad onto the base . That base is an oscillating cast piece with 4 indentations that accept the 4 prongs . The whole inside of the unit is well greased . Even the edge-rim that it rides on has grease on it . The problem is that the cast piece and the sanding pad are often ( not always ) covered with grease as well . So you have a wildly gyrating cast piece , well greased sometimes , a single screw is holding that on . They do install that screw with MEDIUM duty loctite from the factory . What I did was clean the grease off of the mating surface only with some alcohol , replaced the loctite on the screw , and added an INTERNAL tooth multi serrated lock washer to the holding nut . They sell them at Home Depot . Bring the nut with you and match it up . Bosch uses metric size bolts.Home Depot has been making room for their newly acquired Rigid line of tools . They bought the factory . Consequently they put some of the existing line up for clearance , and this Bosch sander is one of those items.The woodworking magazine that rated this sander the best , also gave the Porter Cable best value award . It is less money , not the same level as this Bosch , but does a nice job . If you go into spending more money , you can get the Bosch 6 & quot ; which does n't have any glitches , or the more expensive Porter Cable . Both of them are highly recommended.So there you have it . A great sander with a glitch that can be fixed . After looking at it , you might even have something further that will prevent the pad from ever working its way loose . Once it does , then the ridges holding it in line , move beyond the indentations , and can create damage . So it is important to deal with the problem.By the way these Bosch sanders have less vibration than the expensive Fein sanders . I love Fein equipment , I have the RT-1800 Fein router , which is best in class , and the Fein Multi-Master kit , and love it as well . But after using both sanders , I prefer these Bosch 's for their lower vibration , and equally aggressive material removing capabilities.So if you want the best for less , get the Bosch . The glitch is why I gave it 4 stars . Hope this helps .	1
I bought this sander for refurbishing boats . It works great for stripping off paint and exposing fiberglass , and also for sanding off fairing material . It outperformed all my other sanders , by a huge factor . I was able to sand over 400 sq feet of hull in three days . With other sanders I 'd need a crew of men and multiple sanders , and it still would take longer.I use 60 grit & quot ; hook and loop & quot ; pad and I duct taped a vacuum cleaner to it . A powerful external vacuum cleaner will make dust negligable . On windy days I can sand without a facemask and only need eye protection.The variable speed works ok , although I had trouble with it later which may be related to some internal probelms after I serviced it.It is the best all around sander I 've used and out performed palm sanders by a factor or 10:1 . I can do ten times the work , with a better final finish.However , I got less than a year of service out of it . The backing pad started to shake off . When I reattached it , it did not perform as well as previously . I 'm unsure if the allen head scre4w should be tight or allowed to float slightly . If left slightly loose it tends to shake itself looser.Also , I found that at times the power seemed to drop , perhaps due to bad contacts on my extension cords , perhaps low service voltage , or possibly something internal.The internal dust seal was damaged , the first time the pad started to shake itself off , which increased the amount of dust that could not be collected . After the first time the pad started to shake off , I was unable to make it perform like new.I tried changing extension cords . Now the power was gone from this unit . Although it sometimes picks up and performs like it did out of the box.I gave this unit a lot of use , and wish I had another one , but I ca n't give it top marks because the problems I 've encountered . I still rated it a 5 because even if it craps out , it is still worth the money . I wish the manual provided service information to maintain it.I 'm now planning on buy a competing 6 & quot ; sander of similar design .	1
Yes it is heavy , yes it vibrates , however this sander kicks butt , when it comes to removing wood . The dust collector is a joke like the rest of the sanders I have used . If you do not have a vacuum pulling the dust they just only work for only seconds . All in all a good product that is NOT made in China .	1
I am an avid home shop woodworker and have more tools than needed , 50 % or more are Bosch and the rest are made up of most every other major brand . I use my tools hard , but with care and maintenance , and have never had a Bosch tool break or quit . This 3107 DVS is new but I do n't expect it to be any different . I do n't understand the previous comments about the dust collector system just being OK or not good at all because my experience is that it is outstanding and without using a shop vac . Also I have never had a pad come loose and many of my tools are 10 or more years old . So much said ! I feel very strongly that there is no better sander out there and especially for the money .	1
This tool performs very well . It sands very quickly . Faster than my Dewalt and Porter Cable palm grip R/O sanders . The variable speed is very useful for sanding face frames on cabinets or other tricky spots . The dust collection works O.K . A shop vac helps a lot though . The only problem is that some times the pad comes unthreaded from the mechanism and flies off . Maybe some thread lock would help . I 'm not alone with this problem . I saw others ' comments posted on Bosch 's chat room about this . Do n't let that stop you from getting an otherwise good tool . Just periodically check the screw on the pad .	1
Nice and heavy - so it does the work for you . Works great on Corian and hardwoods . UGLY looking - but very powerful and easy to change/adjust belts.When I opened the box I thought this thing look heinous - but it 's a real swan as far as ergonomics and use .	1
This is my favorite tool ! I have abused this sander for the past 3 years and it keeps on humm'in . It is so smooth , powerful , lightweight , and easy to handle.If your a professional woodworker like me or woodworking is your hobby this is the ONLY belt sander to have . It 's the quietest belt sander I 've ever used.I always recomend Bosch tools when some one wants to purchase a very powerful and high quality professional power tool . Bosch tools have never let me down . Keep up the good work Bosch ! !	1
I use this sander mostly to flatten panels and todress surfaced lumber , and it is *excellent*.It removes material very quickly , and willpull 50 grit on the fastest speed with no bogging down . Iuse the optional sanding frame , and a vacuum hose , so thebag placement is not an issue for me . Using the sanding frame , you can get to 120 grit finish very quickly . Just a touch withthe finish sander using 180 or 220 and you 're good to go.This beast is heavy . Unless you 're Arnold SchwarzeneggerI would n't consider using this on vertical surfaces . Onhorizontal surfaces , gravity is your friend , and the weightof the machine does the work.I have a lot of tools . Most are good , a few are crappy , a few are excellent . With this sander , every time I use it , I congratulate myself again for coughing up the $ $ $ and buying it.It has saved me enough time compared to my other beltsander to have paid for itself .	1
Great power , lightweight , exceptional balance makes this tool a complete pleasure to use . It is difficult to find anything to complain about . I spent a good month reading , testing and talking to others in my trade before I bought this machine . In my house-restoration endeavors I required a machine I could use in any position on a variety of materials and that had the ability to remove material quickly and accurately . Bosch must have spent a lot of time talking to users to come up with this one . I only have about 100 hours on this machine but it feels like it will last forever . If I had to say something negative it would be the position of the bag . It rides high and sometimes gets in the way . However in thinking about it -- it would be even more in the way anyplace else . I own a lot of machines . This is the overall best .	1
This thing is a BEAST , it will eat up and chew through any wood you are looking to refinish . I matched this up with some 40 grit belt sandpaper and it was able to chew right through the old finish on my redwood deck . I had used a less powerful 3x18 belt sander and there was no comparison . While this is much heavier and you do have to stay on top of it so it does n't get out of control , I will take that over the slower process of sanding my previous belt sander offered . The only negative I found was there was no case/bag that came with the sander beyond that I am very happy .	1
I 've used belt sanders for several years to help with my home improvement tasks . My current project is refinishing all of the pine wood paneling boards in my den . Luckily , I can take each tongue & groove board of the wall individually and bring a bunch at a time down to my basement workshop . Before I bought the Bosch 1276DVS ( 4x24 ) I was using the Bosch 1274DVS ( 3x21 ) belt sander to remove the old finish . With the 1276DVS , I can now strip 4 paneling boards in the time it took me to do 1 using the 3x21 sander . By the way , some of the boards are cupped a bit and the 1276DVS is very effective at flattening the boards too.The 1276DVS is a great sander and I 'm amazed at the power that 12.5A can give you . It 's awesome . Yes , it is heavy but that 's exactly what you need when doing hosizontal sanding . Use the 3x21 if your sanding work entails overhead or vertical work . I did replace the cork/steel platen with a graphite one and the belt does run noticably cooler . Since I always connect my sanders to a shop vacuum , the bags are never used so I ca n't comment on whether they work or not.All in all I 'm exceptionally pleased with the 1276DVS in every aspect . One thing I did notice is that the belt alignment mechanism is a bit sensitive in terms of positioning the belt exactly . It could just be that I need more experience with the sander . Would I buy the Bosch 1276DVS again - absolutely yes .	1
Cant say enough good things about this sander -- I LOVE it.Bosch tools have never let me down . Keep up the good work Bosch ! !	1
I 've owned a Bosch 1276DVS 4 '' x 24 '' Dustless Variable Speed Belt Sander since 2001 , and have used it countless times . It has never failed to perform as expected . It 's well balanced ( front to back and side-to-side ) , so the platen stays flat on the wood without tipping . With rough belts , you really have to hold on with both hands , or this powerful tool will pull away from you . The adjustable front handle is a nice feature.It could n't be easier to change belts -- pull up the locking lever , slip the old belt off , put the new one on , push the locking lever down . When belts do n't track properly , the tracking adjusting screw is easy to turn and effective . Once a belt is on-track , which is easy to do , it usually stays put . Although the dust-bag sometimes gets into your sight-line or hits something above the thing you 're sanding , there is no perfect dust bag that I 've seen . As with any belt sander ( I have several ) , a tremendous amount of dust is produced , and the bag does n't get it all . Wear a respirator when using any belt sander . I also wear ear-plugs , even though this unit is n't particularly loud for a belt sander , and use it outside if the job permits.The electronic speed control is easy to see and use , and it works flawlessly . The sander has a high-quality 10 ' flexible rubber electric cord , not one of those stiff plastic ones . Any 4 '' belt sander would be too heavy to use overhead , and difficult to control when using vertically . In other words , it 's best ( if possible ) to use it facing down . This is a first rate tool , and I 'd get the same one again.July 2007 update . The sander stopped working . Turns out it was a defective speed control . I bought a new control through toolpartsdirect dot com , and the sander works like new again .	1
This is an extremely well-designed and well-built sander . Changing the belts could not be easier . The speed control is simple to adjust , and is variable by the amount of tension placed on the trigger.This sander felt great out of the box , sands flat and is smooth-running . I do heavy duty sanding , and this is the tool for the job . If I could I would give more than Five stars for Bosch tools . I highly recommend it .	1
I have had this tool 2 years so far no problems , lots of power works great compared to the more expensive models does the same job .	1
I worked for years using an inexpensive belt sander with no dust collection system to speak of , at the time none had these .I wanted something a bit larger and tested several newer models out .I found myself with a ryobi in similar design as the bosch .It was fine and I truely enjoyed the balance .Then I had an issue with the speed control getting hot and soon it quit and off the find another brand . This time it was makita and a rather large 3 x 24 inch belt with one speed .Yes it was powerful and heavy , most of the time I felt I would surely destroy anything and everything it came in contact with , one moments hesistation or lack of concentration and you found yourself with a deep grove because it tipped . Unbalanced side set motor , some people like these , I do not . I am all for learning to control and use a tool but I do not stand for a tool with a built in project distruct mechanism . Porter cable has an old time still in production inline giant that works very well , my father had one , just do n't plug it in when on it 's feet trigger lock on , facing a double pane glass picture window . There is no stopping it and yes it does perform a nice mid air drive very slightly slowed by the forced penetration of shattered glass .I leave this Makita sander for the jobs that need alot of fast stock removal , perhapes if I were refinishing a ship deck this would be the tool of choice . I was informed by the tool dealer in town this was the best sander around and it has been around for a good long time .I want a belt sander to smooth edges and a small to large surfaces with confidence that 's all , nothing that wants to drag me across the work suface at the flip of a switch .This is where the bosch comes in , light and balanced , quiet and smooth , you are now in control not the tool .Yes as someone else said the dust bag is not the one pictured on the box , out of curiousity I phoned bosch and it was politily expressed they had issues with static electical discharges that some people using the sanders did not understand , some people must have forgot simple science concepts and thought they were being electrically shocked with a high voltage .Never the less the bosch did send me one of the original bags along with it 's fittings and I must say the new square bag is better .You can empty it very simply by putting a shop vac nozzle to the plastic bag port and suck the contents out and even if you want to do the job right shake the bag and all comes clean . No need to play with the plastic closure clip .This sander does what it is designed for very very well indeed .Light continues work with easily controlled stock removable for the finishing of a fine wood project that possess flat sides , not for what some find it for , clearing away years of warp and splinter on some rough fashioned sun deck that can comfortably seat 120 guests .For this type of industrial endevor get the big ones , that 's what their function is in life .If you are looking for a belt sander for fine furnature work or do other work requiring precision and control and have always stayed clear do to the fear of belt sanders then the bosch IS without question the one , for you ! In closing , this belt sander does last and hold up very well , I have had not one single problem with mine , it has done alot of time saving work with me .	1
Except for the dust collection bag , this is a great belt sander.It is light and managable yet still has more than enough power . The ergonomics are good ( the hand grip area could be a bit bigger -- those of you with bear paws for hands , beware ) .The dust collection bag is n't so good though . The bag collects just as much dust as my Porter Cable . But emptying the bag is a real hassle . There is no zipper . Instead there is a cheap plastic clip . Mine cracked after just a few changes . ( UPDATE : This bag sucks . I retrofitted a Porter Cable bag . ) Also , a sanding frame is available for this machine.UPDATE : I first wrote review in 2004 . My machine is still going strong . I 've replaced the graphite platen several times . This is a wear item . Available from Bosch for about $ 3 each . I 've also replaced the pulley belt because the belt stretched and was so loose it jumped teeth on the pulley . About $ 6 from Bosch . Five stars for durability !	1
This will become one of my favorites . It 's well designed , comfortable and easy to use , very powerful , and feels like it will last . If you plan on using this on glue-ups , invest a little more and get the sanding frame . And most surprisingly , the dust bag really works !	1
UPDATED AFTER 8 MONTHS OF USE : I finally got the sander repaired by Bosch service - turned out a part had apparently been installed backwards in the tracking mechanism . Now the sander works perfectly , and has held up to lots of use in recent months . Tracking now works just fine - I was unlucky and got a defective unit originally , but the design and features are wonderful when it 's properly assembled . The slim size is very maneuverable and easy to use - I love this sander now , despite the initial problems that were a pain to get corrected.UPDATED AFTER 6 WEEKS OF USE : Everything I loved about this sander is still true ... .but it simply wo n't track the belt . The belt slides off the outside of the sander even with the tracking adjustment screwed all the way in . It was just a little quirky when new , and has become steadily worse with repeated use . Bosch tech support seemed puzzled ... suggested returning it through Amazon as the quickest way to get a replacement . Unfortunately the 30 day return window has passed , so I 'm left with taking it to a local service center who will return it to Bosch to repair/replace . In the meantime I 'm without an essential tool for my business . I bought this sander based on Bosch 's reputation and am quite disappointed.And to clarify some other reviews - the box does n't state `` MADE in Switzerland '' , it says `` ASSEMBLED in Switzerland '' . No word on where the components were manufactured , but I can guess.ORIGINAL REVIEW : I needed to replace a 20 year old Sandcat 2-1/2 '' sander that had served me well but finally wore out . I looked at a lot of 3x21 sanders , most seemed bulky and ungainly . This sander is smaller and easier to handle than most 3x21 's and very ergonomic to hold . The switch is convenient and easy , and having preset speed limits on the switch is very handy . Love the extra long cord too ! The tracking can be a little bit finicky , but overall I 'm very , very happy with this sander . I 've been giving it a workout in my hot garage on 100 degree days - it continues to run like a champ .	1
Firstly , let me say I got this sander from amazon for about 40 bucks less than the sale price offered at local stores ; plus free shipping . Such a Deal ! This thing works great . Square shape makes it easy to get up alongside walls . Variable speed dial and lock button allows you to run the thing and put your hands anywhere on the sander . Lots of speed and power . Easy on the hands . The dust bag attachment seems to work well , but is anything really dust proof ? I also put this thing upside down in a vise ( with a towel around the vise jaws ) and use it as a stationary sander . And for those who care , it 's not made in Taiwan or China by underpaid foreign workers , but in Switzerland . Hopefully by well-paid immigrant workers.I 'm not a contractor , so I haven'nt torture tested this thing , but if you 're a homeowner who wants to have the kids fight over your tools when you 're gone , or simply wants to have an impressive estate sale , you ca n't beat this sander . It 's way better to buy this baby and have it for life , rather than buy 50 buck sanders from the hardware store every few years .	1
I use this for both wood and metal work . The dust port makes sanding wood a joy . It tracks perfectly , I do not think I have had to adjust it ever . Turn it over and a couple of clamps holds it nice and tight to the bench for small wood items and forming the steel tools I make in blacksmithing.2 years later and still working perfectly .	1
It seems that every class of tool has one brand or model that really works just right . Others try to upstage it with different gimmicks , but the obvious best choice keeps coming through . You see it on jobsite after jobsite . P/C routers , Skil wormdrives , Senco finish nailers , Bosch jigsaws ... In the 3x21 sander category there is no better tool . Simple , balanced , sturdy and inexpensive for the long-haul.Square shape and small body mean that one-handed operation ( large hand ) is practical , allowing for use in ways to which other models do n't adapt well.This is my second one in ( I do n't remember , 15 ? ) years , but a long time anyway . Someone decided they needed my first one more than I did and helped themselves ; it 'll probably last them forever if they were smart enough to keep it . So I got the latest iteration which is just still the best . I think I paid about the same the first time too .	1
This tool lasted only 5 hours before breaking.The current project is 250 sf of hardwoord flooring in my own house , with another 350 sf to follow . The wood is milled Austrialian brushbox , which has above average hardness but probably softer than oak . I decided renting and using a commercial floor sander was too risky , and that a hand held could get the job done . My 15 year old Black & Decker ; ( 3x21 , 3.4Amp , hot , noisey , no dust removal , no switch lock ) would bog down with 120 grit at a slow rate of coverage and require frequent vacuuming . So I upgraded to the Bosch 1274DVS ( 3x21 , 6.6Amp , quieter , 1-1/4 dust port ) , gambling that the size and power could spin 80 grit at a reasonable rate of coverage.The other rave reviews about the ergonomics are true . Getting a dust port was fantastic in that , when hooked up to a medium size shop vac , almost no dust was put into the air or left on the floor during sanding . The machine remains cool under continuous duty and the switch lock allows your hands and fingers to relax . I still need headphones with both the sander and the shop vac going . As for muscle , I can report that Bosch 's 6.6Amps are good enough for DYI'ers to make two passes ( 250sf , 80 & 120 grit ) in about 6 hours.Unfortunately , the tool did not last that long . About 3 hours in , I had a power cord accident , something that never occurred in 15 yrs with the B & D . ; The cord was swept into the slot behind the rear roller . The motor is screaming , the cord is flying around , the machine is twisting out of my grip . It took about 8 seconds to get control of the machine and figure out how to unlock the power switch . During this time I am wondering whether I will get this thing shut off before I get electrocuted as it gnaws through the cord . Unfortunately I was killed . No , just kidding . Cord extraction required some strong tugging and a large screw driver to pry away pressure from the roller . The tough rubber cord survived and is in acceptable condition . I then did what anyone would do ( with the exception of a Bosch engineer ) , wonder why they could not make the slot just a little smaller or the cord just a little thicker . Much later I found the user manual warning `` The cord can be dragged into belt housing and become entangled with the pulleys . '' Nice.So the machine went back into service , only with a thump-thump-thump . After two more hours , I noticed the power drive was starting to slip unacceptably . I took the tool apart , looking for some kind of clutch mechanism in the gear train . Found a lot of German high precision and material quality , but no clutch . While reassembling the machine , I found the trouble . The rubber drive belt was missing teeth and starting to wear through . Bingo . During the power cord accident , the cord jambed the drive roller but the upper drive gear continued to spin , taking out teeth in the drive belt.I calculate the cost per hour of buying this tool and consider blasting Bosch with a zero-star rating . Instead I decide to include their service & repair organization into the total picture . Logging online , I find that in this metro area ( Silicon Valley ) they have several affilated drop off shops and one factory service/sales center . I stop by the factory center , buy a $ 7 belt out of local stock , and install it myself . After one day of down time the machine is now back on the job and works fine . So Bosch is back up to four stars , but only because their service organization and inventory saved their butts .	1
Very powerful , well built . It 's very easy to change the sand paper . Just a simple lever to release the tension and pull off . Dust collection works pretty well .	1
I really like this sander and have used it to sand a modest size deck ( 9 ' x 20 ' ) - lots of sanding belts but the sander was flawless . Do n't like the bag so much but not a big deal either . I pushed this off my work table and broke the front handle but was able to get a replacement for five bucks at ereplacement dot com . I have used this upside down which was an unexpected feature based on its flat top.Update . It has been years and I still find this sander very useful . By the way the deck I sanded had grease spots from a BBQ and it took a bit of sanding to get to clean wood so I could paint it . 60 and 80 grit sand paper did the trick . The weight of the sander though not excessive helped in the sanding and it was mostly a matter of guiding the sander around the deck . The cord is decently long which helped . More than 6 ft , I would guess around 10 ft . Even though I use a 12 gauge extension cord almost all the time I find the extra few feet handy.It is loud enough that i use ear protection . Do n't know that it is recommended but I am careful about these things . Except for the drills I use ear protection with most of my power tools .	1
This is an excellent tool that fits comfortably in your hand . It removes material efficiently and is easy to control . The belt tracking system works better than any other I 've used . Since it is light weight ( for a belt sander ) , it wo n't wear you out like most other units . The inline design allows you to easily get into tight spaces and unlike many sanders , the dust collection system really works . It 's made in Switzerland and the resulting quality is obvious .	1
I like this style of sander for many reasons . to early to tell if I 'm real happy . Tracking seems to be an issue out of the box . I 'll follow up after I figure it out .	1
This is an extremely well-designed and well-built sander . No complaints here only praise , praise , praise ! Thank you Bosch -- you sure make my life a lot better ! !	1
Great sander . Lightweight , great if you have to one hand something or if you have to sand vertically or overhead . The tracking adjuster works like a champ . Changing belts is super fast and easy . Only complaint is the dust-bag ... it seems kind of cheesy compared to how well built the rest of the sander is , but I bought a sander , not a dust collector . Made in Switzerland .	1
Very powerful and well made . This is just what I was looking for . Yes , I would buy this product again	1
I bought this Bosch at the beginning of a major remodeling project to replace a tired , 30 year old ... sander . I have n't been disappointed.For two years I fnished molding , leveled countertops , stripped old paint , sanded out difficult flooring stains and bevelled edges with it , and it 's still running like new . It 's light enough to use all day , the belts never need adjusting or wander off , and the variable speed feature makes it easy to set it for the job at hand . And the dustcatcher really works . An excellent choice for the pro or handyman .	1
Belt sanders can be dangerous because they remove wood quickly . They need a light touch or you 'll leave an undulating surface , not a flat one . But if you 're careful they 're a lot easier to use than a hand plane and a lot faster than an orbital sander . I 'm a hobbyist who got a C in woodworking in junior high , and even that was a gift , because I ca n't get a flat surface with a hand plane or saw a straight line with a hand saw . So power tools are my salvation . I bought the Bosch belt sander to bring the rails and stiles of several raised panel drawer fronts into perfect plane more quickly than could be done with an orbital sander . I read a few magazine reviews and was interested in the DeWalt 443 , but that model gets mediocre reviews on Amazon.I wanted a 3 x 21 '' sander because a 4 '' wide sander is heavy and seemed like overkill , and I was interested in one that had a lever to make it easy to change the belt , reasonable dust collection , and an accessory frame available to help with keeping larger surfaces like tabletops flat . ( That last criterion eliminated the Makita 9930 . ) The Bosch also comes with flat , graphite-impregnated platen , which the magazine reviews said was better ( flatter ) than the steel plattens most sanders come with . ( You can buy a graphite replacement platen for other sanders . ) The Bosch is a bit under 8 lbs and the motor is mounted in line with the belt rather than crosswise , so the spacing between handles is greater than for the DeWalt , Makita and others . That 's not a problem . The Bosch is comfortable to hold and easy to control , even for a short person like me . The magazine reviews say that it removes wood a bit less rapidly than other sanders in the same class , and that 's probably a good thing unless it 's being used in commercial production . There 's an easy to use tracking adjustment to keep the belt lined up and the front handle is removable in case you need to get into a tight space , although you 'd have to be careful controlling the sander . The variable speed trigger works well and there 's a small dial accessible in the hand grip to limit the speed , as well as a button to make it run continuously . That allows you to mount the sander upside down on a bench and use is as a stationary tool.The Bosch sander feels solidly made . The lever to release the belt is plastic , but it looks like it 's fiber-reinforced nylon so it seems unlike to break unless it 's abused pretty badly . The relatively light weight makes the sander easy to control , and the cord is quite long . The manual is clear and helpful . The sander 's dust collection bag works well and you can remove it to connect a vacuum hose for even better dust removal.The accessory sanding frame is solid and well designed but expensive - 50 % of the cost of the sander -- and you have to figure out that the sander has to be inserted onto the two front pins before the you push the back of the sander onto the frames ' clip , because the instructions that come with the frame are unclear . ( You buy the frame separately from the sander . ) Two cautions . First , try the sander on scrap before you use it on a project - it removes wood much , much faster than an orbital sander and it 's easy to leave a trough , even in hardwood . Use a light touch and keep moving it around to avoid that . Second , buy premium quality cloth-backed belts . You can get them at Sears , by mail order and at specialty store . The Bosch comes with a good cloth-backed 80 grit belt to get you started .	1
I spent the last few days buying sanders and taking them back ( 2 actually ) . One was a porter and cable 3x21 . This seems to be a well built sander except the dust collection system is very flawed . I had more dust flying than going into the bag . Then I got the heavy duty DeWalt . This is a heavy brute . I found the top front wheel creates a vibration every so often that the sander seems to hop and create tiger stripes on the work . It also requires a lot of energy bto hold it down . Even tghough the dust collector seems to be one of the best , I found a lot of dust all over the bag . I do n't know if the bag fabric 's hole is allowing the dust to escape or creating static electricity to attract dust . Even though the bag collects the dust , it seems the sander blows a whole heap of dust around . When in a tight corner and I tip the front to extend the reach , it seems to bite the work . It seems to go through a lot of sanding belts with little to show for it.Then I bought this baby.. Very light and requires very little effort to hold it on the work ( always fighting with the DeWalt ) . The way this is designed , there seems to be very little dust outside the bag and even then , there are no vent holes to blow it all around . The collection system works great and there is even a little attachment so I can hook up a shop-vap with a small hose . The sanding belts seem to last twice as long as the DeWalt ( do n't know why this is so ) . The sanding seems to be far more efficient than the other sanders I tried and returned . The icing on the cake is an accessory to hold the sander like a table sander .	1
I have had this for several years now . I like everything about it . Especially the ability to clamp it in the vise and use it hands free as a bench sander . The belts are always centered and change out easily ; something that was a problem with my earlier sander ( i do n't remember the brand ) . I use this on wood only , so i can not speak for other materials .	1
Still going strong after 6 years . Has taken a beating , but still in good shape.Bosch is quality .	1
I 'll be honest , this is my first belt sander , but I love it . I took the recommendation of some of the other reviewers , and I could n't agree more . The sander is easy to use out of the box , and is a smooth-running , well-designed tool . The variable speed switch is very nice , and adds considerably to the user 's control . I have n't yet done any heavy duty sanding , but for finish work the dust collection seems to work well . Five stars for Bosch on this one .	1
The dust bag on my sander is not the same as the one depicted in the image on the site . The one that came in the box is cheesier in design , and lacks the bracket/strut shown.Also , the suggested accessories are limited to sandpaper rolls . No dust collection attachments , no upgrade for the bag.The sander itself is powerful , easy to use , and does the job I wanted it to do .	1
This is a great sander for a homeshop that is also a great buy for industrial use . Inexpensive and agile . The belt system used on this sander makes the workpiece highly visible . Also it is easy to keep from dipping.PROS** Inexpensive** Lightweight** Very agileCONS** Not the best tracking system** Dust collector blows off ( or gets in the way ) alot . ** Requires alot of blowing out .	1
I have an old Tudor-style house with lots of oak paneling and trim . My other sanders are 5 '' and 6 '' Bosch random orbit units , and 1/4 and 1/2 sheet Porter Cable finishing sanders . The Bosch 1274DVS belt sander fits in perfectly when I need more aggressive sanding action on the wood paneling and oak doors . I 've even found it light enough to use on vertical surfaces and even overhead trim for short periods . It 's very effective removing the old finish and quickly exposing the raw oak for refinishing . I use the 1274DVS first and then follow-up with the random orbit or finishing sanders for perfect wood preparation.Although others do n't care for the bag dust collection ( and neither do I ) , my method for controlling dust is to remove the bag completely and attach the sander to my shop vacuum using the Bosch hose . I probably capture 90 % or more of the dust.I 've had no trouble with this sander since I bought it from Amazon 18 months ago . Then again , as a homeowner , I try not to abuse my tools so I 've been fortunate with the overall reliability from my Bosch , DeWalt , and Porter Cable tools.I would buy the Bosch 1274DVS again in a heartbeat . By the way , I just ordered the Bosch 1276DVS belt sander ( 4x24 ) from Amazon to give me even higher productivity refinishing pine paneling in my den .	1
I 've given this sander limited use so far , but it has performed flawlessly . Belt tracks nicely without needing adjustment , and the sander is light and easy to control . It worked very nicely for the first project ( shaping the edge of a cultured marble shower wall ) .	1
I bought this sander from Amazon several months ago , and I 've sure given it a good workout since I 've had it . It tracks very well , and is powerful enough for even the toughest jobs . Changing the belt is far easier than most models ... .a big plus . This is the first Bosch tool I 've owner , and it has made me a believer in the brand . The tool is exceptionally well constructed , and built to last . I could n't be more pleased with the purchase .	1
I could not agree more with Jim Thompson on this sander . You can tell that alot of thought went into its design . It is so much more useful than ordinary belt sanders . For one thing the balance is perfect . You do n't have to torque your wrist to get it to sand level . Because of the in line design , you can see both sides of the belt when you are sanding . Of course you have to watch it and keep it moving , but it 's alot less work with the little Bosch than the others . It 's a little slower than the fastest sanders . But what you sacrifice in speed , you gain in control and accuracy . I would n't buy one to sand floors , but for finish work you ca n't beat it . It 's light enough to use one handed if you have to . It easily becomes a table top horizontal sander by flipping it over on its flat top . ( it 's even better with the sanding frame ) The dust collection really does work . The front handle comes off for tight spots . Belt changes are a cinch with the lever action release . The variable speed is a lifesaver with soft woods , detail work where you do n't want to take too much off or even rough grinding on chisels and plane irons . I have several Belt sanders from different manufacturers and this truly is my all time favorite .	1
I bought the Bosch belt sander because , at the time , it had the best warranty . I planned to sand all the peeling paint off my 1 1/2 story clapboard house and repaint it . I thought that I 'd go through at least two of these sanders . I bought the belts by the case and spent several weeks sanding the house . I 'd run this thing until it overheated and stopped . I 'd let it cool down and go at it again . To my surprise , I completed the job and the original Bosch sander was still working good as new . I later found out that this sander is good for more delicate work . I have more control and it seems to lay flatter . It eventually died ( smoke poured out of the motor ) and I replaced it with a Makita sander , a very robust and dependable unit . Over all , I 'd prefer the Bosch for finer finishing work and ease of use .	1
I bought this particular drill for two reasons:1 : I really did want to support American labor and get a USA Product.2 : I needed a slighty heavier duty `` small hand drill '' size of drill.The drill is a bit large to handle at times , but is much smaller than the lightest duty 1/2 '' size drill . I can drive a # 12 X 3 1/2 '' wood screw into dense pine and it does not even slow it down ! It is well made , does not leak oil , and will probably last for the rest of my life.On the USA Product : This is frustrating to say the least . It says Milwaukee WI in large letters everywhere ; and , all the info you can get on line would leave you believing that you are getting a good American made tool ... .. even the price is high enough to be USA made . Then , in really small print on the very base of the manufacturers ID tag on the drill , it says `` Made in China '' and that is the only way you find out that you have been had ... .. again.SUMMARY : It is a good drill , and does do the job well ... .. but , though they took the jobs to China , we pretty much still get a higher USA price ! I am disappointed by that . Had I known it was not a USA made drill , and it was just another , pick a `` China vs. China '' product , I would have bought a less expensive unit like Sears , B & D , or Skill , etc . for about $ 25 to $ 30 less money . I do think that we need to demand that Amazon require these folks to list where it is made in the listing ... . that is only reasonable.UPDATE : I have used this drill for while now to do some really HD type of screw driving and drilling . It is one stout drill ! You had better hang on because it has VERY good torque for such a small drill.I still hate the keyless chucks , but this one has the best keyless chuck I have used to date ! Enjoy .	1
I 've been in the remodeling business for over 40years and have always thought highly of Milwaukee power tools . Long story short this is a very nice & # 34 ; powerful & # 34 ; drill .	1
This was my first Milwaukee drill . I liked it so much that I bought a 1/2 in . also . I am happy with both , as they are absolutly quality machines . Do n't buy the cheap junk first like I did . These drills will be around long after you are not . I have never seen a better drill .	1
I recently purchased the Milwaukee 0233-20 3/8 '' Magnum drill . I had first purchased another brand which was on sale . I tried to save a few bucks , and as usual it came back and bit me.The other drill was a real dog . Absolute junk . I returned it , got my money back , and did what I should have done in the first place . I bought a Milwaukee . The Milwaukee gives me slow , smooth starts which is great for starting holes in very precise places . It also gives me the high speed I needed for drilling pocket holes with my Kreg jig . The Milwaukee drill is buttery smooth . Just like my other Milwaukee tools it 's built solid , and it WORKS ! Another case of `` you get what you pay for . '' If you 're in the market for a 3/8 '' variable speed drill do n't waste your time ... just buy the Milwaukee to begin with and you 'll be happy plus by getting a high quality tool it 'll be a long time ( if ever ) before you have to replace it . No , I do n't work for Milwaukee or get paid by them . It 's just my 2 cents worth of opinion .	1
i agree with the folks on here who say milwaukee makes the best drills . this one replaces a dewalt i had for several years which finally bit the dusk . compared to that one , i think this is made much better . in this age of cordless tools , it 's still worth it to have a quality old fashion corded drill . this is a nice one	1
After years of cheap drills , I finally decided to try a nice one . Wow ! Not only does this drill do everything I need a 3/8 drill to do , it is so smooth that it is a pleasure to operate , even after two years . The keyless chuck has never slipped ; the motor will stall first ( but only on ridiculously long drill bits designed for a larger drill ) . There 's no turning back . I wish I would have bought tools like this years ago . They are actually a better value , after you have smoked a few cheaper tools .	1
Milwaukee makes the best hand drills , PERIOD ! It 's miles better than others in its range . It 's the only one in this price range with a metal gearbox . I had a Makita that was made by screwing 2 plastic pieces together , and eventually , the grease seeps thru and discolors the enclosure . This Milwaukee includes a side handle which is much more helpful than you would imagine . The drill is front-heavy and has a lot of torque , so you 'll be happy you 've got it . It also includes an extra set of brushes ( which you will probably never wear out ) that are user-changeable . The keyless chuck can be tightened at least as thoroughly as a keyed one . The hinged trigger is very nice and allows precise control of the speed . This drill was designed for industry and being constantly beaten up , I 'm sure it will outlast me . I use it every weekend in the wood shop and have never found it lacking in any way . ( And I 'm picky ! ) Also , it 's got grooves in the top sides for your thumb and index finger so you can get your palm right behind the chuck to push straight towards the work and squeeze the trigger with your pinky and ring fingers . If you 're deciding on whether this is worth the $ 30 or $ 40 extra over an equivalent DeWalt or Makita , it is . The only way I 'd consider getting a drill other than this one is if you drill nothing but large holes . If you plan on using it as a screwdriver , forget it . It 's too fast by the time you get enough torque up . You 'll twist off and strip screw heads , gaurunteed . You 're best bet is to get a good cordless ( DeWalt or Makita here ) for that and keep this as your main drill . I can not recommend this drill highly enough.Long-term addition : I 've had this drill for a few years now and there is one thing I should mention . If you may need it for the type of work where you need to have one hand holding your work while drilling with the other , you may want to get something lighter and smaller . I think Milwaukee makes a Holeshooter that is not called `` Magnum '' . It has a smaller motor . Anyhow , between this drill and my Makita 12V 3/8 '' Ni-MH cordless things are pretty much covered . If I were to do it again , I would probably get the Milwaukee with the 1/2 '' chuck & side handle for the heavy duty stuff and a good 12 or 14.4 cordless for everything else . Just keep in mind that the 1/2 '' chuck on the Milwaukees wo n't take super-small bits.Feb 23 , 2008 UpdateWell , I 've had this drill for 8 years now , and I still love it . It still looks and performs as new . The speed range is perfect for woodworking . The only thing missing is one of Milwaukee 's famous hard cases . The drill itself is easy enough to put on a shelf , but the damned side handle will not stay put if you put it down somewhere ; it rolls all over the place . Milwaukee would do well to make the flared guard area hexagonal or something that would n't be so prone to rolling .	1
This drill has great torque , it will twist your hand off if you use the the old `` hold the lock ring while you spin the chuck to tighten the bit '' method . I could do that with my battery powered Dewalt 18 volt drill without incident . Using this drill you better not do it ! This drill will handle anything you throw at it , but I greatly dislike the chuck . You can not get it as tight as a normal keyed chuck and some of the materials I drill though cause the bit to slip . It is especially prevalent with the small sized bits.I would give this drill 5 stars if the chuck was keyed !	1
I got my first Milwaukee drill 40 years ago , and it 's still working fine . I 've used their corded screw guns , drills , Sawzall , band saws , circular saws , etc for many years , and have never had a problem with any of them . At this point I only buy Milwaukee hand tools . That said , I have also had great success with Bosch and Makita . But I just decided to stay with Milwaukee a few years ago as I had so many of their tools.This drill has all the torque I could ask of a 3/8 '' drill . The only reason I would use a 1/2 '' drill is that I have quite a few bits with a 1/2 '' shank . The keyless chuck on Milwaukee drills works very well - I have n't experienced the slippage that I 've had with some of the competitor 's products . This may be the tightest clamping keyless chuck I 've used.I agree with some other reviewers that this does n't seem to be the quality of my Milwaukee tools purchased in the 1960 's and 70 's , but that 's inevitable given that Milwaukee has to compete with Dewalt , Porter-Cable , etc . price points . While I do have several Festool products , I do n't buy them if I think Milwaukee or Bosch will suffice because of the enormous price difference . IMHO this is an excellent drill and a great value - just as one would find with the Bosch.Recommended .	1
This drill is an absolute work horse . Besides doing lots of hole drilling in different materials , I 've used this drill to mix thinset mortar , grout , and joint compound ... .it just churns away and barely gets warm . After burning up two Dewalt drills , I decided to go with Milwaukee . The keyed chuck is the best on the market and you never need to worry about it slipping once you 've secured it properly . The drill has a lot of torque , so use the additional handle and hold on tight ! Great drill ... .great price !	1
I was getting no where with a 1 '' spade bit in my cordless drill , and I needed to drill a lot of holes to run the wiring in my basement . So I tried a self-boring bit , and my cordless drill quickly started smoking . That 's when I went and got this drill . It blasts through studs effortlessly with a 1-1/8 '' self-boring bit . This thing saved me hours of tedious drilling .	1
I have used my Magnum industrially for over 20 years . Never needed service ( I did replace the cord ) and never lacked for power . The variable speed works well . The chuck holds well.Do realize that this drill has a lot of power and if the bit catches the drill will twist violently and could hurt your wrist . Use the side handle ! Keep it with the drill so you will not get lazy and try to do without it cuz you do n't want to go and find it.The 1/2-inch chuck is a real blessing as there are lots of bits , especially those included in the good sets , that require that size . Also , many specialized industrial bits are 1/2-inch only.Corded drills are still required for most heavy-duty tasks and they certainly are more affordable . This is the drill I know I can recommend to anyone who needs the power .	1
Cordless drills have come along way in the last 20 years . The first one that I used a 7.2V battery and was great at drilling and screwing into ... pine ... for about 20 minutes but not much else . Todays Lithium Ion drills have considerably more power and battery life . However , they are still limited.With the Milwaukee 0234-6 the only limit is what the drill-bit can handle . This drill has the power to drill into brick , oak , and steel - things that you will be severely limited by any cordless drill . The Milwaukee 0234-6 is the one drill that you can pull out to do any job , Quality - in all likelihood you will pass this drill onto your kids . This is a tough industrial type drill that is perfectly suited for job sites.Inserting the bits into the chuck- it is not as easy as the `` twist '' that is standard with most of the cordless models , but it still is not difficult.I would still recommend that everyone own a cordless drill , since the Milwaukee 0234-6 is a bit heavy and cumbersome to use for basic jobs ( hanging pictures , putting together toys and such ) .Final tally - 5 stars the only corded drill that I will own .	1
I bought this drill second hand and was thrilled with it . I started showing it off to other technicians in my field . But it seemed that they each already had one of their own and would sing it 's praises back to me in a more enthisiastic way . It 's almost like this machine is synonymous with `` drill '' . Like , you look in the dictionary for 'Drill ' and there is a picture if this Milwaulee Magnum Holeshooter.Do not use a spade bit on this drill if you are not strong , unless you hold the side handle . If the bit stops abruptly , this drill could damage your wrist . Even if you are strong , Be carefull .	1
I bought this drill several years ago . It 's corded drill of course and is very powerful . It comes with a side handle which should be used because the drill is powerful enough to injure you if the drill should stick and twist . As I recall there was a choice of keyed chuck or a non keyed chuck . Mine has a keyed chuck and a drill this powerful should have a keyed chuck . When I got mine they were still made in the US and mine is really a quality tool . Unfortunately now they are made in China and I ca n't speak to the comparison between the older US made drills and the current Chinese made ones .	1
I have n't handled a tool that felt like this since I was a little kid in the late '70s and early '80s and it bugs me that the higher amp drills are keyless and put the side-handle in such a questionable location . Mine has had no problems with anything I 've thrown at it thus far . I like that the keyless chuck guarantees a firm hold on the bits , and the side handle is rock solid when screwed in and does n't come loose easily until you want it to.That said , the features on more modern drills make it a somewhat specialized tool.It lacks a clutch so I would n't use it to drive anything unless my other drills could n't handle something but the variable speed trigger is responsive enough to make driving an option if that 's ever needed.I 'm sure it will bore concrete but you 're better off with a hammer drill for that.For the craftsman , however , I doubt there is a better hand-held power drill in this class for tough boring jobs in wood , metal and other materials . Even the boatbuilder guys love this drill and that 's worthy of note because they tend to stick to powerless hand tools partially out of a sense of tradition and an appreciation for well-made things , but more practically for the extra attention to detail and precise control that hand tools allow . This drill appeals to all of those things . Aside from some lighter material upgrades , the basic design has been around for generations , it is very well-made , easy to maintain and it 's precise and smooth operating , making it easy to control.I 'll probably ultimately round out my drills with a cordless hammer drill for rehabbing work but this and my subcompact are all I need for now.I do n't think this drill is for everybody though . If you upgrade tools regularly because you prefer the latest in high-tech features , this drill is basically the opposite of what you want because it 's very simple and will last forever denying the excuse to upgrade.It can take plenty of abuse but if the abuse is the result of you being careless or forgetful , it may abuse you back eventually . There 's enough stories of people getting clobbered by this thing out there that I pretty much use the handle for all but the lightest work with it and I keep my head clear in case of spinout.It 's also not blazing fast . This is typical of the more traditional 1/2 '' drills which are used primarily on tougher materials where a slower speed is desirable . It 's not slow like a subcompact but some people want those 1/4 '' and under holes bored as close to instantaneously as possible.You have to order a case separately if you want one . I recommend getting the metal pistol-grip tool case . It 's old school and leaves enough space for plenty of smaller tools and accessories .	1
Big red is still tops . As a professional signmaker , we use drills daily in many situations for a variety of materials . I still like the keyed chuck , nothing like it for really tightening a bit and I especially like the detachable cord . I have a 25 ' cordset which I use ; most of the time I never need an extension cord . Power , quality , durability , it 's all here ...	1
For a 5.5 amp drill , this unit offers lots of power . The build quality is nothing short of what we expect from Milwaukee . Everything from the professional grade 1/2 '' chuck to the heavy duty detachable cord shows Milwaukee 's committment to reliability and longevity . I ordered this through Amazon and received the 75th Anniversary unit and it came with a steel case . Was n't expecting the additional amenities , but you get lucky sometimes , I guess .	1
They are not made in the USA anymore , but this is still the best all-around drill that money can buy . They have not changed them much in all the years they have been making them . This not your typical throw-away Black & Decker or Craftsman drill . I love the Quik-Lok cord feature ; it is very handy and helps extend the life of the cord . I have five 5.5amp Magnums ( USA Made ) and they never quit on me . They should last me the rest of my life ; all they need is the brushes replaced every now and then .	1
This drill is the best in it 's class . No other matches its power for its size and weight . As others have said , watch out for its torque . Used it with a 3 & quot ; Holesaw ... ... .it fetched up and put my arm through some drywall . Built to last with easily replaceable brushes ... ... .. a lifetime tool .	1
I have owned this drill for about a year . There is nothing I can add to the rave comments about this `` old school '' power tool ... I suspect it will run forever . Powerful , smooth , not heavy , balanced ... did I mention I love it ? I attended a tool event today and spent some time with a Milwaukee Sales Rep working the event . He told me the 0234-6 is being discontinued this year . The design is too old to satisfy some in Milwaukee 's management . If this drill is too `` old school '' ... then I must be too old school myself . This is a tremendous drill . Get one before they are all gone . You will love it ! 10/17/08 UpdateAs is obvious , Milwaukee did not dicontinue this drill . A Milwaukee rep told me that dealers went into such an uproar , that Milwaukee decided to keep this beauty available . I wish I loved all my tools as much as I love this drill . Buy one !	1
I bought this to have a powerful 1/2 & # 34 ; drill on hand & also it was still made in the USA .	1
I have 7 1/2 in drills , including a Milwaukee 299 , a Dewalt , and a Haitachi . This sets the standard . It is so smooth , it is a joy to use .	1
A dream come after using these drills for 10 years would be make them rechargeable . That 's it no other changes required and please do n't make any.We use these drills until they get so hot we ca n't hold onto them . Even when they have been so hot the red plastic has turned brown from heat they keep running an running.We have a Milwaukee Hole Hawg also . When it will not get into a spot we have to put a 4 '' or 5 '' or 6 '' hole saw on the 234 and it performs every time.When threading holes we end up slamming them from forward to reverse they still last for years . The drill will run a 1/2 '' NC Tap though 1 '' aluminum.We did try 2 of the models that ran at the slower 650rpm . The gear case broke in both of them.We use to use the Makita 6013 and found them to power full . The Milwaukee has just enough power for any job but it will still stall out before it wraps ones arms up like pretzels .	1
It seems like some manufacturers have cornered the market on certain things and have the `` Best in Class '' . Milwaukee has certainly done that with the 0234-6 . What sold me was the metal gears , nice feel , good trigger , obvious to the point of `` art '' quality , and of course power.This drill will last decades for the average user and the quality of the drill will bring a smile to your face everytime you use it.It has been a long habit of mine to lock down the bits while holding the chuck on my cordless drills . Do n't try this with the 0234-6 ( or be very careful ) . The power can rip the skin off your hands . And you do want the keyed chuck for the gripping power.The quality of the 234-6 is like art , it is built like the tight finely tuned incredibly strong machine it is .	1
Do n't be mislead by the gimmicks and styling of other 1/2 & quot ; drills out there . This beast is all you need for truly heavy duty work like running large hole saws , mixing drywall mud , or just drilling monster holes with big bits ! This machine is the standard by which others are judged and has been for years . It is ridiculously overpowered and its durable engineering has n't changed . It 's still the best.Milwaukee makes a keyless chuck version of this drill , but I do not recommend it . For the types of tasks this drill is designed to handle , you will want no possibility of slippage . The keyed chuck on this drill is as beefy as they get and is up to any task . Milwaukee also makes an 8 amp version of this drill . Such a machine seems like it would almost be dangerous , as this 5 amp version is perfectly capable of wrenching your arm . More amps is n't always better . This drill does not slow down , and would probably blow a circuit before it stalled.The removable cord is a nice feature , as is the removable and ambidextrous side handle . The only thing this machine lacks off the shelf is a good case , but the genuine Milwaukee steel case is available from various distributors for about $ 35 . A very wise investment , this excellent case will protect your tool for years to come .	1
These days when the cordless drill seems to have replaced the resevrsing 3/8 & quot ; corded drill as a standard , a lot of amateurs and even pros may wonder why they need a corded drill . Well , a cordless drill is a wonderfully handy thing , particularly when working on a remote job site , but even the biggest 18 and 22 volt drills are limited in the amount of power they can generate ; sometimes you need a really big , honkin ' drill . Drilling heavy hardwoods , going through mild steel- these are tasks where a cordless drill starts to bog down or overheat but this 5.5 amp drill just keeps turning.I was first introduced to the Magnum Hole Shooter by a boatbuilder who called it the single best power tool he owned . Not only was it powerful enough to drill through an oak keel or refasten a few thousand hull screws , it was built uncommonly well . You just ca n't destroy this drill in ordinary use , and if you do manage to break it or wear out the brushes , it 's easily serviced.Compared to the old 1/2 & quot ; drills , like my 1950s vintage Thor , this drill is half the size and a quarter the weight . It 's not much bigger than a decent 3/8 & quot ; drill even though it has over half a horsepower . If you 're doing serious work in wood or metal and can only own one drill , this should be the one .	1
This Milwaukee 1/2 '' drill is as good as it gets in all respects.I 've had over a dozen drills come and go over the past 40 years . I still have my Milwaukee 3/8 '' drill I bought in 1973 , and except for a new cord and brushes it is still going strong . This new 1/2 '' drill gives me larger chuck , variable speed and plenty of power for serious , heavy duty work . Yet , due to its small size and relatively light weight , it it also useful for smaller jobs . The detachable cord is a great feature . It would have been even nicer if it came with its own case.For lighter duty I use a DeWalt cordless , which I 've had for over 10 years , but I 've had to change and recharge batteries during a project many times , and the batteries do not last long.As usual , Amazon gets 5 stars for the shopping experience .	1
My favorite tool in my toolbox . This thing will punch through a tank ... well that 's an exaggeration , but it has gotten the job done on almost everything I 've tried it on . The handle is very nice and it 's just sturdy and built to last . Makes you feel manly .	1
1/8/10 Have been using this drill and am very pleased . It has tons of torque and the handle comes in handy . Just great to have a corded drill with this type of power for when the cordless 18V wont do the job or if you have a lot of screws to driveHavent used this drill yet but am looking forward to putting it to work . I bought it because I only had cordless drills , aside from a great , rugged Milwaukee Hammer drill , was also confident because of great reviews from others , It is very solid and I like the quick change cord . I expect to have this drill for years	1
Great drill ! Unquestionably Milwaukee makes the best , most durable , and comparably powerful drill motor on the market . The gear housing is metal , not plastic . The pistol grip is thick plastic , and very comfortable for larger hands . ( Its a pretty good stretch to hold this drill with your hand high on the housing while trying to drill a hole and toggle the trigger ) . Speaking of the trigger , it is very sensitive & amp ; accurate , again seems to be of a better quality than most . The Quick-Loc cord is a nice feature , but really should be of the twist lock variety , particularly for working at heights . The replacement cords seem pricey at first ; however , when you figure on taking the housing apart to access the set screws . . . as you normally would , it is well worth the price , particularly if on the job . What more can you say about a drill , this one is powerful , well made , should last a very long time ( even under heavy use ) and will drill holes with any bit you can fit in the chuck . The side handle is must with all the torque this drill has , and the threads are coarse enough that they usually do n't clog with dust alone , dirt will do it though . The only drawback to this drill is its weight , which is good and bad . It is good , because of all the reasons listed above , but if you use this drill all day , you can really feel its heft ( I have the 75th Anniversary model , which is even heavier ) . One other comment , for 1/2 & quot ; drill motors the keyed chuck makes all the difference , keyless chucks just do n't hold the bits tight enough , especially when drilling in tough materials . I doubt very seriously , you can buy a better drill than this one .	1
Before I bought my magnum hole shooter I had gone through several skil and crapsman drills and saws . When I got the milwaukee My tool buying changed forever . No more junk ever ! That was many moons ago and it just keeps on going and going . I will never sell my old magnum drill . They have a new one out with even more power and torque and a nice rubber grip which I 'll probably buy but I 'm still keeping my magnum . It runs as smooth today as it did 15 years ago . I 've done everything with it from drilling wood and steel to Mixing concrete.It wo n't drill concrete but it will sure mix it like no other.It also mixes drywall mud very well . As others have said it is very powerful and it will hurt you if you are not careful . I got thrown off a ladder once when the bit caught and I was n't going to let go . I thought it was going to rip my hand off . but it did n't . After that I always treated it with more respect . This unit comes with a lifetime warranty . No other manufacturer that I know of stands behind their tools like milwaukee . It 's no wonder when you consider their incredible track record .	1
Mostly a repeat of others , so bottom-line : BUY THIS , and you wo n't have to buy another ( unless it 's stolen , like mine ) .I bought mine YEARS ago , and it was just stolen , so I 'll be buying another one ... .not even going to shop around for another brand/ model ! ! Plenty of power ( use the removable side handle , and keep a good stance when doing high torque applications where the bit can grab ) . Very rugged construction . Comfortable grip and control ( although not at the lowest end ... but I do n't use it for those applications anyway ) . The removable cord and easy access to replace the motor brushes are nice touches . The handle threading into both the left and right-hand sides makes it easy to share with left-handers at the jobsite.What else can I say ... .	1
The Milwaukee Magnum corded drill is heavy and heavy duty . It is more substantial than the all plastic drills out there . It seems to have more of a gear reduction which relates into more power for those difficult drilling jobs . You can just feel the quality . I own a variety of Milwaukee tools and have no complaints about any one of them .	1
This is a nice quality toolbox . Pretty much what one would expect from Milwaukee . It fits the `` standard size '' pistol-grip corded electric drils very well . In the bottom there is a padded yoke to hold the body of the drill and a pad to absorb shocks from the drill chuck . There is enough room for a driver to be left in the chuck of the Milwaukee Mangnum Drill 0233-20 ( or one of the many similar models ) when it is in the box.The box does not fit the Milwaukee cordless drills well , ( one would have to remove the battery ) but my cordless models come with a form-fitted plastic box.Fit and finish are nice . The finish seems to be both tougher and thicker than the finish on my Super Sawzall tool case.There is room for a typical box of 1/16 '' to 1/2 '' dril bits in the bottom of the box with the drill , the extra hand grip ( unattached ) , and the cord folded in.The top tray is adequate for a collection of accessories , like driver bits , right-angle driver , and loose bits . It will not take any of the drill index boxes I own .	1
`` Wow ... 'Me-Tal . ' '' - Bart SimpsonYou just do n't see stuff like this anymore ( at least I have n't since I was a kid ) . I love mine and ca n't wait to put my 5.5 amp Magnum Hole Shooter in it . My fiancee digs it too and she could care less about the tools . Plenty of room in the top tray for additional hand tools , bits , and other accessories.I knock one star off because I thought the foam protective material was glued somewhat carelessly and there were some scratches on the interior of mine that seemed avoidable . Do n't get me wrong . I fully expect this thing to scratched up over time . I 'm not one of those daft idiots who buys a Ford F150 and then refuses to actually move anything with it for fear of scuffing the paint or getting dirt on it , ( full disclosure : I 'm really more of a proud '2001 Civic EX owner but I still hate those guys ) , but I would prefer that the paint scuffs and scratches be my own . These were all on the interior though.In any case , through this and other products , Milwaukee has converted me from a web developer with fixer-upper ambitions to a full-on , Tim-Allen parodied , tool nerd.Equally cool , is the case for the Milwaukee carbide drill bits I got , but I wo n't review those until I 've actually used them.For all the time I 've spent pissing on brand loyalists on the web , Milwaukee may have made a total hypocrite out of me . Oh well , at least I can be fairly certain none of my tools will be mediocre.Now do I get the V28 combo kit a year before I really need it or do I just content myself with some completely gratuitous M12 toys and hold out for an M28 line that may or may not appear next fall ? Or do I just buy a freakin ' 15 amp super sawzall and put out an ad on Craigslist to come destroy ! @ # $ for people for the cost of new blades and high-risk emergency medical insurance ?	1
I 'm a believer in cases for my tools ... ... .. saves them from damage and this is one of the best . Plenty of room for a drill with bit and a tray for accessories . Well made , it will last as long as the drill . Metal cases are a vanishing breed , probrably for cost reasons .	1
This toolbox is made of solid metal , which is pretty nice because plastic stuff breaks eventually . This thing feels solid . It has a nice top drawer that you can pull out . I use this as my toolbox between going between my two houses , I keep a small cordless drill and its charger , some caulk , a level , a hammer , drill bit set , safety goggles , utility blade , small flashlight , tape measure , a bunch of screws and nails of various lengths and maybe a few other small things that I 'm forgetting ( ahh , pliers and a couple of screwdrivers ) . It is a little bit of an exercise to get all of this into this relatively small tool box , but I actually like the small size of it . Easy to pack into the car , sturdy , etc . For the simple user , it is perfect . If you 're a pro , you probably need one of the metal boxes with drawers .	1
Nice solid carrying case w/convenient tray for bits ets . First one came damaged , top was dented in . Just not enough padding for shipping . Amazon was great and sent a new one immediately . Case is somewhat pricey thats why I only gave it 4 stars .	1
Milwaukee 48-55-0711 Steel Carrying CaseThis case is 13.5 '' wide , 9.5 '' deep , and 6 '' high.The tray is 12 3/4 '' wide , 8 3/4 '' deep , and 1.5 '' high . The tray 's ends are bent downward into half-circles which rest on the top edge of the case sides to support the tray . This approach eliminates the need for separate tray supports in the case itself ; a good idea as they would be in the way when the tray is n't used.The top on my case closed off to one side just a bit . By twisting the open top counter-clockwise , I `` bent '' the metal so that it now closes uniformly.There is a `` saddle '' spot-welded to the bottom of the case , to hold a drill in place . ( See Customer Images . ) Since I wanted a small tool box with a tray , but not a drill case , that saddle is in the way . I might drill out the 3 spot-welds and just remove it . ( The nearly identical Milwaukee 48-55-0885 Carrying Case has no tool cradle welded into the case ; but it does n't include a tray . ) The case is well made , sturdy , and attractive . It 's 100 % steel , with a steel latch . The red paint is nicely done . All of this case can be used for storage -- for a specific tool and accessories , or , as a stand-alone tool box .	1
I do not know how I did it before this tool came into my arsenal- It is a monster that makes quick work of boring holes between studs or joists to run pipes or wires . Once you use one of these with a self feed or auger bit , you will never use a standard drill with a wimpy paddle spade bit again for this purpose !	1
Since using this , I 've ditched all my spade bits and replaced them with self-feeding auger bits . This drill has the power to drive them ! Changing speeds involves minor dissassembly of the chuck and right angle gearing , but its really not a big deal . I leave mine on high speed and it has handled everything I 've used it for nicely .	1
Do n't settle for a lesser corded drill . In fact , do n't get any other corded drill ( with rare exception forMilwaukee 1680-21 13 amp 1/2-inch Super Hawg Joist and Stud Drillif all you do is use the right angle function and use it for big hole saws ) . As a remodeler , I could never go back to the regularMilwaukee 0299-20 Magnum 8 Amp 1/2-Inch Drillfor electrical and plumbing work . Once you get used to the awesome power , it 's impossible to go back . The best thing about a right angle drill is that when using an auger bit or similar , the drill does n't rip your wrist off when it catches . You can use your whole body to control the drill , which makes for much less tiring work ( e.g. , when mixing drywall mud ) . I appreciate using this drill over its bigger brothers because it is much , much lighter . The right angle attachment comes off as well so that you can use it as a regular d-handle drill . The right angle attachment is relatively easy to take off , and it can be switched around to adjust for speed ( low and high ) . The head swivels , and my version came with the quik-lok cord . I also appreciated that this drill is made ( mostly , at least ) in the USA . The five year warranty is nice , but like with most other Milwaukee tools , I do n't expect to use it.Get this drill .	1
I bought this drill 3 years ago to help cut holes in the studs on my living room wall to run HDMI , stereo wire and cat6 . It cut through those boards like butter - even at a terrible angle it works like a charm . Everything about this tool is top of the line - great case , great documentation , great durability . I see the price has n't really gone down so I guess I should be happy about that ! Either way , this is a powerful drill that will really get where you need to go.One thing about the angle - a long bit in tandem with the chuck and the shoulder can make this a bitt difficult to fit in tight places . Works fine for standard spaced studs for example , but anything smaller than that and you 're going to need to choke up on the bit . This can make using larger bits a bit of a challenge.That being said , I could n't be happier with this drill .	1
I added this to my arsenal when helping a buddy build a huge deck . This thing has loads of power and could not be bogged down . Used it with the right angle head on and off . Worked perfect for tieing the deck joist to the house floor joists . With a decent auger bit , drilling even big holes was effortless . My only issue with the tool is that switching out angle head is kind of a pain .	1
I have renovated several houses and a cabin . One of the tools I always needed was a right angle drill . I bought it and have put it to use drilling holes for electrical wiring and running pipes for plumbing . This is a powerful 1/2 inch drill which will let you drill in between studs , joists and other tight spots . I strongly recommend the Milwaukee Selfeed bits which assist in the drilling process by drawing the bit into the wood . I bought the plumbers bit kit which includes a great selection of the Selfeed bits and auger bits in a convenient carrying case . I highly reccommend these bits . The only down side to this drill is that it will wear you out if you are using it all day lifting it up overhead . This tool has tremendous torque , so make sure you have good footing and use care while drilling because this tool can literally rip itself out of your hands . But if you are using this tool , you are looking to do some serious hole drilling . You will never go back to a regular drill with a spade bit or hole saw . No wonder you will find this tool in almost every electricians and plumbers tool inventory .	1
We were building a house and we did quite abit ourselves , one thing was the wiring . My puny 14.4v ( at the time ) cordless was just way underpowered to bore through 2x 's one after the other.I intended to not spend much on tools , but I needed something tougher.This was JUST THE TICKET.It is a Power-house ! Now that the house is done , I do n't use it as often . It has become an occasional use tool , for when the cordless drill ( now 18v ) wo n't cut it , or when the job calls for a RA drill . This tool is a very powerful drill that seems well-built.I intend for it to be my heavy duty drill for many years to come .	1
If you need to drill through old , full dimension oak floor joist , ( very tough job ) this thing will do it EASILY . Just put in a self-feeding auger bit , and away you go.Also , it 's perfect for NORMAL jobs like holes for wiring in studs . Ca n't beat it . Buy it .	1
The Milwaukee Right Angle Drill 3107-6 applies allot of torque to spaces you otherwise would have trouble reaching with a regular drill . It is ideal for drilling holes between studs for electric , cabling or plumbing . The unit is basically their 7 amp variable speed D handle drill featuring triple gear reduction with a Right Angle Drive ( RAD ) unit attached that can be set in either low gear at 355rpm or high gear at750rpm . The D handle drill without the RAD will achieve 500 RPM . Changing chuck speed from high to low or visa-versa requires removing the chuck , reversing the RAD unit and then replacing the chuck on the other side . This is fairly easy but it takes about 2-4 minutes and requires a couple of tools that are provided . The Right Angle Drive ( RAD ) can be easily swiveled 360 degrees providing versatility to meet any drilling angle.Using the drill is a pleasure as it has so much torque it just seems to eat the wood up . No standard hand drill I ever used has this kind of power . The build quality of the unit is of the highest standard and will likely last a lifetime of moderate to heavy use . This model is also fitted with Milwaukee 's `` quick lock '' cord allowing easy replacement in the event the cord becomes damaged.For remodeling , basement finishing , or extensions this drill really shines . Trying to accomplish drilling many holes in wall studs with a standard electric drill would be very time consuming if not impossible for simply not being able to fit one between the studs . If however you do this kind of work every day as a business I would consider either the Hole Hawg or the new Super Hole Hawg . These units are more expensive but feature higher chuck speeds and a transmission that allows you to select the high or low speed without the use of tools . This will allow you to get work done faster when on really big jobs . But for the home owner that enjoys remodeling this Right Angle Drill is really the best choice as it is two tools in one when you consider the D-handle alone with the RAD unit removed.Built like a tank and as much power as you could ever need this drill definately delivers . The only variable will be your choice of bits , I have to place my vote on the Milwaukee self feed bits as they cut very fast and will last a long time between sharpening . So if you have some branch circuits to run or some plumbing to install go get this drill and some self feed bits . It will make the job go much easier .	1
This industry standard machine offers economical flexibility , power and utility -- and does so for a very long time . The small , tight angle head can sneak a whole bunch of torque into some very small places . The head can easily be adjusted right , left , up or down giving the user a lot of options when facing a tight-place job . The balance of the machine as well as the thoughtful positioning of the controls make it seem as though your hands are fully trained in its use the first time you pick it up . The gearing and fine working right angle drive make it almost impossible to stop this durable motor . ( But you can do it in a pinch - an ode to the motor design ) Last year I had to change the brushes for the second time in 26 years of use . Most people get better wear than this , but in my renovation endeavors I have used this machine for everything between removing a tractor tire to a make-do winch . Other attributes : The auxillary handle is built as well as the machine itself , and is very useable . The box is standard Millwuakee tough should last through the life of the tool . If you install plumbing vents in frame houses every day , you would do better with the venerable 1676 Hole-Hawg by the same manufacturer . Otherwise strong consideration must be given to this machine as your standard 1/2 '' drill . Ca n't go wrong .	1
This is a great drill for making holes in tight spaces . I have gotton by over the years with a 3/8 inch electric drill and spade bits/hole saws to make all of my holes , but I dislike the spade bits because they take forever and quickly wear out , while hole saws often bottom out when cutting anything thicker than 2 by lumber . But this drill , combined with Milwaukee 's and Dewalt 's resharpenable self-feed bits , makes drilling holes almost effortless and I can now reach spots that I could not have before . The lower RPMs combined with the extra long side handle keep this high torque drill under control when drilling large diameter holes . I purchased a reconditioned unit for the equivalent of about 3 weeks of fees at the local rental center and it looked brand new . I have had good luck buying reconditioned gear and I tend to trust this stuff because I believe that they have been carefully examined and all the defects removed . There 's no doubt that this is a specialized tool , but if you have a lot of plumbing and/or electrical work to do than it may be worth getting . It will save you a lot of time , grief , and sweat in the long run .	1
Milwaukee makes great tools . I did a lot of research on right angle medium duty drills and here is what I found . The Makita for slightly more money has : A more powerful 4-amp motor instead of the 3.5 , while still maintaining a slightly lighter operating weight . ( 3.1 lbs , instead of 3.5 ) An LED light brightening the way that is guaranteed to last the lifetime of the tool . Variable speed of 0-2400 instead of 0-1300 . Also the Makita has a speed-limiting dial to prevent over tightening of fasteners . Also the Makita has only a 2 5/8 '' head height instead of 4 1/2 '' for right angle drilling when working deeper than the first few inches of your project . For close to the edge work , the Milwaukee has a small head height , but if you need to go deeper into the project beyond a few inches , the angled body creates a 4 1/2 '' height , and that is for making 55 degree angle applications , if you need to make a 90 degree hole , you have to tilt the body , making the overall head height out of control . Look at the picture to see what I mean . For making joist holes in 2x10s this is not a problem because their is plenty of clearance , but if you are making cabinetry , and for example want to secure drawer guides in drawer openings , that are closed panels , the Milwaukee will not get the job done.I went into the local home center , and got my hands on the Milwaukee close quarters drill . Please understand I am crazy about Milwaukee tools , but ! Holding onto this drill is strange . The only way I can relate to it is to say , think of holding onto a 1.5 litre bottle of wine . You know the kind that quickly mushrooms out at the neck . Your little finger , second , and third fingers are holding onto a large body , while your index finger and thumb are wrapped around the neck . Now imagine trying to force the neck of the bottle into something . Albeit , the Milwaukee has a mushroomed head , it is a tiny head nonetheless . Difficult to put into words . Go into your local home center and pick one up . You instantly will know what I mean . In a few words , it is uncomfortable . I do n't know what Milwaukee was thinking with this one . For a little more money , get the Makita DA3010F 3/8 '' Angle Drill with L.E.D . Light.Two other mentionables for competition are the Porter Cable air driven , and the Dewalt DW160 . The Porter Cable air driven comes in at half the price and has a keyless chuck . It does reverse as well . The one drawback is that you do n't get the degree of torque out of small air driven tools ( monster impact guns excluded ) , and you need to have air . Lugging the compressor for a big job is not a problem , but for those small adjustments , it can be a nuisance.The Dewalt DW160 3/8 '' drill has an oversized paddle switch , according to the manufacturer . Reviews were pretty emphatic about false start problems while changing bits . Also it does not have variable speed , nor does it reverse.It is rare that you can narrow a tool choice down to yeah this , and boo that . If I had to chose just one , and I did , it would be the Makita . More power , greater speed range , least amount of overall head height in the greatest range of applications , and that lifetime LED light to constantly shine the way . They call it the new Eluminate line of tools . I know that if I get in a situation of needing the 55-degree angle , I will wish I had the Milwaukee . Additionally , I know I have a hankering for the Porter Cable air driven at those times when I have air . For the price , I might wind up with one of those also . The Dewalt , is an inexpensive drill that I know I would be cussing at , every time I needed to reverse out a screw , since it does n't have reversing capabilities , and it does n't have variable speed , so it will strip out the screw heads as well . Enough said : I like the first three very much . I have learned that if you go for a little more on the price , you often get a tool that is a lot more in the long run . Hope this was helpful .	1
Strangely , I found this in a clearance bin . I had always wanted a small right angle drill and so here was one , cheap , and it was a Milwaukee , a brand that has been good to me . I did no research and did not anguish over the purchase like I usually do.Every major tool company offers right angle drills . They all have their unique features and all would be best at some particular task . This drill is quite versitile and I grab it for many jobs that do not require my heavy Milwaukee 1/2 '' wristbreaker.Sometimes I would like to have a true right angle small drill to turn to , but this handles almost every task.The trigger is too easy to activate by mistake and it is quite sudden . It goes from 0 to full speed with even a slight depression . Likewise , it takes a light touch to use the variable speed feature . Reverse is out of the way , for better or worse.Let 's be realistic : not too many of us unplug our drills when we change bits . I place one finger under the trigger when the key is in the chuck . I recommend that little safety move to every user.Although it is now 2006 and nobody has figured out a good way to store the key , the chuck itself is good qualityAll in all a good drill that is very useable for most tasks , is light , powerful enough for normal drilling , and has ok ergonomics . My big Milwaukee drills have lasted forever , so I expect this to last a while . Minus a star because of the happy trigger and I am still mad about the key .	1
If you are an electrician or plumber , looking for a light drill that works in tight , stud bays - this is the one.Sure it looks silly ( kinda like a bird - without wings ) but you will find it works brilliantly with spade bits , augers and hole saws.It turns out that the silly shape allows you to easily exert force where it is needed.The variable speed , paddle lever will twist out of your hand ( shutting the tool off ) if the bit locks in the wood . No damage to the wrists.The chuck and key work perfectly.There are two issues that I must call attention to:1 . The rubber strap designed to hold the chuck key.There is no mention of how to rig it in the instructions.The big loop ( that will eventually hold the chuck key ) must be forced through the small loop ( even though it does n't look like it will fit . ) You then take the hoop and slide it over the plug - then pull it tight . Big loop left dangling receives the business end of the chuck key.2 . No carrying case - I for one would gladly pay more for a well designed box to hold the tool and the accessories to make a usable kit.I simultaneously purchased the small makita , right angle drill DA3010F . I had seen positive reviews for the Makita on Amazon and elected to do my own comparison test.I have worked with both extensively - issues with the Makita DA3010F : For me - it 's all about drilling holes in tight places - big ones , small ones - with paddles , augers and hole saws . Some have said that the Makita is great for driving the robertson screws ( square bit ) that are used to connect kitchen cabinet faces together . I can not comment on this because I have never used the tool in this capacity.I wanted to like the Makita . I own 2 of their 8 inch circular saws , several disk sanders , a venerable chop saw , a chain saw , a 4.5 '' angle grinder , a hammer drill , a disk sander and a 3/8 '' drill . All are professional grade . All but the 3/8 '' drill and the disk sanders have never needed service . A fine track record.The Makita DA3010F exhibits so many short comings that it proves the adage : Almost every tool manufacturer makes some good products - but not all their products are good.The DA3010F :1 . Right angle drills are most effective when using an auger style bit that pulls itself through the wood . Boring 3/4 '' holes with an auger tends to bog down this tool 2/3rds of the way through a pine stud . You have to reverse the drive direction to extricate the bit and then go at it again.2 . Once the screw on the auger has reached the other side - one must apply significant pressure to drill completely through . Often the effort to force the auger ( the rest of the way ) leads to the whole bit length travelling through the stud . If there was something that could be damaged in the next stud bay you would have to adequately protect it.3 . Hole saws and paddle/spade bits need to have force applied in line with the direction of boring . This is not the strong suite of the right angle drill . It is indeed a waste of time to use this tool with those bits.4 . The chuck and it 's key are both problems . The key does not mesh in the chuck adequately or is it large enough to provide adequate tightening for large bits . Because of this - the chuck tends to lose it 's grip on the bit and needs to be retightened often - too often.5 . The chuck key is attached to the cord in close proximity to the tool . It needs to be removed from it 's holder to be used . If it were mounted in an appropriate manner - towards the end of the cord it could be used without separating it from the tool - saving it from being lost.6 . The chuck has a problem tightening on hex shank bits - more often than not - the bit wobbles . Even when you get it right - the chuck soon loosens up and you have to play around with it again.7 . That LED light that will last `` forever '' turns on when the you apply trigger pressure . Would it not make sense that the light should allow you to align the bit before you start drilling - not after ? 8 . No carrying case ! I kid you not . Everyone who lugs their tools into the field knows the importance of the carrying case . It 's all about work/time management . You want a `` kit '' that holds the tool and all of the accessories that tool needs . The best designed carrying case will allow you to effectively manage the kit.8 . When I first looked at this item 11/15/06 it was selling for $ 159.00 . I purchased one on 2/1/07 for $ 178.00 . Now 2 weeks later 2/17/07 it is listing for $ 202.10.I can only hazard a guess as to why the price of this item has risen so sharply in just a few months : Recently the dollar hit a 6 month low with respect to the yen.Of course supply and demand . Based upon amazon reviews - I purchased one - as I am sure did many others , Increased demand - increased price.What is most dissapointing about this tool is that it suffers from inadequate field testing . No surprise there.What it needs and one hopes the next version might sport:1 . A bit more power2 . A better chuck and key.3 . A separate switch for the light4 . An adjustable guard that protects from deep penetration.5 . A decent carrying case with enough room to include accessories.The tool itself seems to be made quite well . If one were using this tool for small controlled work installing cabinets , or working with small twist bits - it 's value may be better appreciated.Caslo	1
Milwaukee , again , has produced a superior product . The tool is very handy and really does work in tight quarters , although I use it for a lot of different applications . The trigger is one of the best I have used for controlling the speed of the drill . It gives you a feel for the speed and is very precise . It fits in your and perfectly and has never bogged down . Ever . It is a litle pricey but it 's a drill that is used a lot . In no way is it limited to tight quarters .	1
I like this drill a lot , but I use it for what is is -- a close quater drill to get into tight places . It amazes me that someone would try to drill 1 inch holes with it . Would you try to haul 5 tons of iron ore in your 1/2 ton pickup truck . That wo n't work either .	1
Yep ... thats right a sander . I 've had this drill for 3 years now and I do n't think I have ever put a drill bit in it . I purchased it to use as a sanding device for bandsaw box 's and small clocks . It does a superior job with the multitude of flap wheels , drums , soft pads and wire whisk 's . I have used this drill for hundreds of project 's and have yet to think of a better substitute . I do a lot of work with burls , maple , walnut , cherry , and this unit really does a nice job of enabling me to clean bits of bark and dirt from the outside surface.It is a bit heavier than I originally thought it would be , but that does help with vibration and stability , and does n't to affect its manuverability . It is very comfortable to hold and use . The lever type trigger is a plus , much more comfortable than the conventional type trigger . I usually place a piece of foam rubber under the trigger to enable me to maintain the speed I want , without having to `` hover '' the trigger . Really lessens the fatique factor . I especially like the fact that the drill body does not heat up , even under continued use . I sometimes will use this drill for hours on end , and having to wait for it to cool would be a pain . It has a nice long , heavy duty cord , that does n't tangle up easily.I actually got the idea for using this drill as a sander from the book , BUILDING BEAUTIFUL BOXES WITH YOUR BANDSAW , by Lois Keener Ventura ( seperate review ) . I also have a stationary belt sander and Jet spindle sander ( seperate review ) , and I use these quite a lot , but for those small tight spots its hard to beat this combination.It is probably a great drill and someday I may actually use it as one , but meanwhile it 's an outstanding sanding tool and I highly recommend it .	1
Obviously , I wanted a drill that would be able to get into tight places for various types of assembly and remodeling . For this it works quite well . I feel it is a better choice for all purpose drilling at odd angles than a right angle drill which tends to hit framing , duct , plumbing . .. . unless you are at or close to that right angle . When attempting to align the drill for a hole that is reasonably perpindicular to the surface , can be a little tough to guage , but for me the flexibility of the 55 degree head outweighs that benefit of a dedicated right angle drill.The paddle type switch works quite well , sometimes too well as it can be easily turned on because of the way your hand wraps around the housing and switch . It wo n't take long to figure out different hand positions to avoid that . The reversing switch is a bit awkward to reach while drilling , but in tight quarters once you have twisted your hands and arms to reach that tight spot , it is nice not to have to worry about inadvertantly hitting the swith to change directions ; however , that being said , it works against you when you need to reverse the drill and have to back out of that tight spot or manuever your other arm to the drill to switch directions . The keyed chuck works well , and the drill is basically comfortable and very useful . As for the reversing switch , I have not yet thought of a better location or type , but time may solve this minor gripe . Nonetheless , this is a typical Milwaukee product so far , it is well made , has a durable chasis and will probably run forever . I bought the steel carrying case to hold various auger and forstener bits which I tend to use a fair amount with this drill , the removable tray and the extra space of this box is very handy to grab and get to work , without having to pack up each time you use this drill . Nice tool to have around when the neighbors are n't asking for it .	1
You 're in the bigs now-This will be a step up for many folks from the typical household rechargeable `` stick '' drivers that typically must plug into the wall to recharge , typically taking overnight to do so , only to typically die after just a few 3 '' x 3/16ths wood screws into an untapped piece of typical southern pine [ do n't even think poplar ] . Milwaukee , for most in the trade , has been and continues to be considered as a manufacturer of first class but no frills tradeline tools.Sometimes hot ai n't so hot-Previous versions of this model had problems overheating the batteries and as you are probably aware , heat and batteries is n't a good combo and one that you 'll sometimes get with `` frys '' ; some units reportedly caught on fire and suffered a complete meltdown . However , this was a rare occasion and most cases of overheating just led to a very expensive and curiously short-lived battery [ streetprices around $ 40- $ 50 per batt ] .None-the-less-Milwaukee redesigned the charging units [ old Vs new = cooling vents on side Vs cooling vents on top respectively ] . Another distinction between the old spontaneous combustion chargers and their safer successors is the handy little built-in bit compartment on the original charger has been removed.Twice removed-Sadly , Milwaukee as have many other manufacturers , moved the production of this model offshore , Japan specifically , but has not suffered in build quality as have many other tools making this journey.What goes around-Japan is now considered to be the Asian counterpart to `` German engineering '' and thier factory workers are paid premium wages , often in short supply leading Japan to respond by allowing more immigrants across their borders to fill the gap left behind as the majority of the Japan 's workers moved into the technical valley from the industrial park , `` uninterested in doing those kinds of jobs '' . Sound familiar ? Build it and they will come-There are some relatively new kids on the block that directly compete with this stick driver , most notably Panasonic 's facsimile [ a worthy adversary ] and newest of all managing a more innovative form factor is Bosch 's Ion stick driver , both of which cost a tad more than Milwaukee 's version , but arguably have some advantages over this `` classic '' .Two speeds better than one ? Hellsya ! Especially when that speed is doubled . As with all powered drivers , the inverse rule of higher speed=lower torque ability applies . Hence , the greatest power differential is between lowest speed+highest torque setting [ `` 6 '' on the somewhat obscured scale ] which can easily strip out sheetmetal and wood screws , Vs highest speed+lowest torque setting which can let you just snug that switchplate screw without hearing that soft but very unpleasant and all too familiar `` crrraccck '' .But have no fear-Unlike many lesser competitors , especially `` household '' stick drivers , Milwaukee 's torque settings offer a wide and *precise* range of torque settings for most applications [ 6x2 ] , any even better , the very tactile ring and positive torque detents which are handily [ but not so visibly ] located on the ring just at the business end of this driver . Furthermore , the detents on this very tactile ring are n't limited to just six positions as the numbers would suggest , but many intermediate positions for that `` just right '' setting that can snug your fastener perfectly into place . For heavier applications , a little bee 's wax or soap on the threads goes a long way and also helps to keep things from going squeak in the night.Faster baby , faster-The addition of the higher speed [ 400rpm ] lacking on Milwaukee 's less expensive model actually makes this stick driver capable of being a stick drill [ a goal to which many stick drivers secretly aspire ] , but only for those with either a great deal of patience and time yet perfect for that decorative solid brass hinge on that music box you 've been promising your ______ since _______ . `` I 'm giving her all she 's got , Captain '' -Ok , four-hundred revolutions per minute is less than half that of the slowest speed of cheapest cordless drill but still good in a pinch and great when you have many many many screws.It 's a matter of perspective-One warning : some may look at the pictures above and erroneously surmise this stick is capable of bending into a perfect right angle . It does not . More like 70deg or 120deg , it 's a matter of perspective.What 's this thingy for-While not a rubik 's cube , this stick driver offers some very nifty controls . As mentioned previously , the torque setting is located on the black ring surrounding the bit holder : a perfect place and a perfect feel . Just below and very close without being in the way is the speed switch , not variable , just two clicks , forward=low , backward=fast.Just below is a curious little sliding `` safety '' switch that moves side-to-side , unlike the speed control . Slide to the left and you ca n't engage the motor unless you are really really determined . I 'm not convinced this is really necessary or even desirable [ try getting that one little screw tightened that you can just about reach and . . . $ # ^ $ ! You get the idea . Oh , now you can look for that screw that just fell off and bounced over . . .er . . . $ ) @ # $ ! Oh , here it is-Just below the questionable safety switch is a `` momentary '' switch [ read `` must keep pressing '' ] allowing your thumb to easily toggle the power in either direction . And if you are n't already aware , `` reverse '' can be a very good thing and just like that time you got your car stuck in the mud , being able to toggle between forward and reverse quickly can be real handy . However , unlike that particular fond memory , you wo n't hear any gears grinding.The bottomline-So how does this all translate in the real world ? Wonderfully . . .if your criteria are precision over brute force and versatility over speed . This model has survived many years with little modification . All the controls are placed where they should be placed , feel how they should feel , even after many years of use , and even after enough time has passed that most of the fine print etched onto the plastic housing has become unrecognizable . The heft is enough to let you know you do n't have a toy in your hand [ approx . 14.2oz w/batt ] , but light enough for either gender and even for those challenged by limited range or motion that would restrict the use of a `` manual '' screwdriver , and balance is good [ about 55/45 w/batt ] .Does it come in colors ? This is one of those crossover tools that is as appropriate to find in the bottom left kitchen drawer of a designer kitchen as it would be to carry in a battle-worn not-so-pretty toolbox . The bits supplied are good quality standard 1/4inch hex feed that firmly snap into place without fearing an `` accidental discharge '' or feeling wobbly . The durablity , size , weight , power , precision , versatility , and feel means autotechs love these for interior work , A/C mechanics love these for control panels and tight spaces , woodworkers love these for attaching hardware to their projects , and I hear tell trade carpenters in California use these to frappe their eight dollar Starbuck 's mocha lattes'.Sorry , no chartruese but you do get a very nice , heavy , polished drill chuck attachment to show off to your friends or take down the neighbor 's plastic , faded pink flamingo with the missing leg at about forty paces , gratis ! Apparently , their engineers have been locked away for the last decade and someone needs to get word to them that hex-end drill bits are no longer just a distant dream.It 's all that and a bag of chips-So why the four stars ? ! ? ! ? ! Well , as stated , this model has been around for a long time . I mean a *very* long time . Long enough to design an improved case layout to allow for an unshifting collection of bits and a special place for the very shiny , but not-so-cheap and decidedly overwieght close-quarter angle attachment with that odd thumb ? brace that usually manages to fall off before you reach whatever it is you 're trying to reach . Battery life is fair , not great [ you will need the two batteries ] , and the charger could be faster . These issues may appear nitpicking to some , but for the hundred bucks Milwaukee has been collecting for each of these and for the three decades they 've been collecting , are these things really too much to ask for in return ?

I used one of these for years working on ag airplanes , which consist of dozens of panels held together with hundreds of stainless steel phillips machine screws that cost about $ 1 each . The torque setting keeps you from stripping the heads . The lock setting will even let you operate & quot ; dzus & quot ; fasteners with a flat blade . The interchangable batteries keeps you going all day.If you have lots of screws to take out and put back in , this tool will keep the blisters at bay ! It ought to be great on sheet metal , too .	1
I 've used this model 2 speed for over 10 years it 's in my tool box and is always ready , the nicads hold a charge seemingly forever , I think I am only on the 2nd replacement battery after all these years . It 's a perfect tool for all panel screw removal on teh stuff iI work on . It 's been dropped stuffed in teh toolcase , left in teh trunk hot cold colder hotter and it just keeps on going , super quality , and when ya find teh best prices it 's even better , the price varies depends on where ya buy it . The Pansonic or Bosch or AEG versions ( I bet they come from the same factory , change teh color ) are usually way over priced . The MILWAUKEE is the way to go . I always buy MILWAUKEE , they are teh best . And the bigger stuff is still made here . But I guess , the lower cost stuff needs to be offshore for competitive reasons , otherwise it would be out of the range for pricing , if ya have to pay a living wage . Look at FEIN stuff very pricey , great stuff , but still made in Geramny , so the price is up there , but it is another great tool maker .	1
I ca n't tell you how many B & D ; power screwdrivers I 've purchased for roughly $ 30 just to have them fail after 1 1/2 years to 2 years of routine , home use . The last time , I had it for about a year and the thing called it quits . The first thing I realized was that I was going to have to spend around $ 100 for a decent contractor grade screwdriver . This seemed like a lot at first , but after realizing that I had already spent over $ 100 in cheaper screwdrivers that simply did not last , I accepted the amount.So , I want to get a new power screwdriver , but which one ? Initial research reduced the number of brands to three which was n't too bad : DeW ... , Pana ... and Milwaukee . I must tell you that although I like the look and specifications of DeW ... tools , they tend to be a fifty-fifty hit with quality overall . They 're great for certain tools like drills and circular saws , but I did n't find great reviews on the screwdriver . The one thing that made me stay away from the DeW ... was the design of the bit chuck . Owners wrote that the chuck is pulled back to lock the bit in place , but complained of bits falling out when inserting the tool in a workbelt or when the screwdriver was accidentally dropped . Having a bit fall out when up in the attic with hands full really does n't sound too cool to me.The Pana ... had excellent reviews and people wrote of them lasting 10 to 15 years . Sounds great , but I 'm not aware of many Pana ... power tools so finding service or additional parts might be difficult . So I went for the Milwaukee.I purchased the Milwaukee 6547-22 Kit , 2.4 Volt , 2 Speed cordless screwdriver for $ 110 from Amazon . The kit comes with two batteries , a charger , a chuck , a few bits ( including a few drill bits ) , and the screwdriver . It 's works well for light drilling such as when mounting wall anchors and such , but it does n't replace a drill . I did n't expect that since I bought it for driving screws ( hence the name ) . It 's also very light and easily fits in a workbelt.It 's nice to be able to do all light work such as mounting raceway or putting together furniture with just one tool . So far , it has been excellent and it 's the first tool I grab when having to do any work that involves screws . I also had to install a threshold in the patio and this is where it really shined . I adjusted the torque to its maximum and set the speed to low and was able to drive the screws two inches into the concrete ( holes were predrilled of course ) . Not a problem and it stopped exactly where I wanted it too . This was after my 18 Volt drill ripped the head off the center screw , though . Oh well , you live and you learn.I definitely like the screwdriver , but it would be nice if it had just a little more power . For this reason , I 'd give it four stars in an ideal world , but compared to the other power screwdrivers in the market I 'll give it five . Being that it is for home use , I expect it to last quite some time .	1
I have to say , this is one of the best screwdrivers I 've gotten yet . In fact , i bought it used , and the battery is still in great shape . It has lots of power , and it lasts forever in one battery charge . Great for doing round the house jobs , as it fits in almost any tool-belt or box . The best part is how it can be straight OR folded . This allows for easier access for hard to reach areas .	1
I bought one of these in 1990 ( maybe 1989 ) , I am still using it to this day.If you are looking for a impact driver to for 3/4 bolts then this is not for you . If you need a reliable cordless screwdriver with enough strength to get the job done with out snapping the heads off your screws and bolts then this is what you want ... .I use it a lot for assembly / disassembly and it is perfect for the job , and with a chuck adapter light drilling.The only problem I have had was the need to replace battery pack once or twice ( amazon carries themMilwaukee 48-11-0100 ) , but that is acceptable in the course of over a decade of use.note : a drill chuck and a 1/4 '' socket adapter is a must have addition .	1
Yup , it goes in my trunk , or in my truck . It is that important . And , the Milwaukee Offset head fits in the carry case with the extra battery and charger . So , if you are like me , and you must have the proper tool for the job . And the job must be done right . Well then , here is another Milwaukee that is a must have ! When you get it , buzz your name right into the outside of the case with your Dremel . And you will be set for many , many satifying years to come . Good Luck , and God Bless .	1
I had a Porter Cable 19.2 volt drill with a light but evetually my batteries went bad so I bought a Milwaukee 18 volt hammer drill/saw combo . I missed having the flashlight so I bought the Milwaukee light to go with my batteries . I like this light even better than the Porter Cable becuse the on/off switch is so much easier to use especially with gloves on . I highly recommend the light to anyone who had Milwaukee cordless tools because it is well built and very bright . The battery provides a stable base for it to sit on and the pivoting head makes it easy to shine the light where you need it . It is another great tool from Milwaukee .	1
This light works good , but I was a little dissappointed in the `` belt-clip '' that was supposed to `` conveniently hook '' to my belt . The one I received wo n't clip to anything , and near as I can figure , you need another part of the `` system '' to attach to your belt for it to work . Now I 'll have to find that part or else jury-rig something ...	1
very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out . would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites . the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces . used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head , amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated : 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so . took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge . then they sent them back to my house , also free of charge . i still highly recommend this product .	1
I bought this about a year ago , still having great results . I use it all the time . $ 10 delivered for a great torche . It is a bit of a battery hog , but it places out some serious directional light that you can adjust . What I like about it is the fact that it does not go from working to NOT working , when you are up in an attic or crawl space . It will slowly start to dim so you know it is time to swap out the battery for a fresh one . Always check to make sure it is compatible with your rechargeable batteries . How they can free ship a quality Work Light like this for $ 10 is beyond me , but I am happy with the purchase one year down the road .	1
There 's nothing spectacular about this work light , it works as well as other 18-volt xenon bulb work-lights on the market . The pivoting head adds some versatility & the `` clip-lok '' receptor is convenient if one has the belt clip . Considering the cooler running , clear white , low energy consumption , LED work lights that are now available , these are becoming dinosaurs .	1
I am annoyed at those who would let 6 different people use a saw that do n't have the foggiest notion of how it works , then get critical of it when it breaks . This saw has a dual release on the front to set the miters . One is a lever that is spring loaded and easily moves aside in order to not click into the detents at 90 or 45 degrees for example . ( So you can set it at 90.5 and not have it fall into the 90 degree detent ) The other release is a large knob that screws in to tighten , and screws out to release . If you leave it tightened in and force the saw to change it 's setting , you are for sure scoring , stripping , and breaking the setting mechanism.Pertaining to the fence ; With any tool you use , like a router , or a saw , you have to be careful to start the tool spinning fast before you enter it into the work . Have you ever experienced the run away router that was touching the work when you started it up ? Well the same holds true of the Makita saw . Once or twice on my LS1212 , I rushed into the cut before the blade was spinning , and the power took the piece and tried to force it through the fence . Spin first , plunge second . After that happened twice , I had to realign the fence . When someone does this on a regular basis , and then has to take the saw back for a replacement fence , it 's the operators fault , not the saw . The fence is thick aluminum . Humidity has no effect on it whatsoever.The adjusting lever for the bevel is located on the back of the slider , and of course it extends beyond the back of the stand.I guess I am venting , because some have chosen to abuse this stellar piece of equipment , then return it trashed , and then try to convince others that the saw is at fault . I had to say something . So enough of the confusion , let 's talk about the beauty of this saw.The LS1013 is a brute workhorse , while at the same time an unbelievably perfectly accurate fine tool . Consider what Popular Woodworking had to say about it . & quot ; We ca n't recommend this tool enough . It 's won every award this magazine gives out , and has earned a permanent place in our shop because it 's tough and accurate. & quot ; Workbench Magazine gave its brother the LS1212 their editors choice award . Here is some of what they said about it . & quot ; Makita LS1212 proved to be the superior saw in this test on almost every count . It is compact , powerful , and dead on accurate . The saw made perfect bevels , miters , and compound cuts using only the factory detents for setup. & quot ; In ToolsOfTheTrade.com Tool test for sliding compound miter saws , without going into all of the elaborate criteria they used for each and every aspect of DSCMiters , they said in their Winners section ; & quot ; Without a doubt , my overall favorite saw is the 10-inch Makita LS1013 . The company 's engineers really thought the design of this model through.Personally I own the Makita LS1212 and it is a cornerstone of my shop . I used the Bosch Digital Protractor , which measures in tenths of a degree ( equal to 3600 dots in a circle , no matter how small the circle ) and measured the results in terms of accuracy right out of the box . This is it : The saw was dead on accurate , whether it was cutting a miter , a bevel or a compound miter-bevel cut , and was n't off by even one-tenth of a degree . It is so quiet and smooth , I smile every time I use it.Think of the engineering : Getting a saw to bevel both ways is a problem because when you tilt it to the right to bevel , the motor would normally get in the way . Some manufacturers put the motor at the back of the saw , and run belts to it . What Makita did , was still keep a direct drive by simply tilting the motor upwards at a 45 degree arc . Direct drive gives you the maximum amount of power , and zero vibration.I could go on for hours about this saw . It comes with a blade that is such high quality , their is no need for an expensive replacement . It creates a glass smooth surface . With the dual bevel capability , and the Bosch digital protractor , you measure the real corner angle of the wall , ( they are rarely a perfect 90 ) and it calculates the miter and bevel settings for cutting crown moldings . You lay the molding FLAT on the Makita , and cut a perfect crown the first time . No having to run up and down the ladder to keep tweaking it in.Some may complain that the dust bag does n't work very well . I throw my arms up in frustration hearing that also . How do you get a saw that is cutting forty million different angle combinations , and get it to throw all those shavings into a little throat . Production shops have a large collector behind their saws to catch all of the dust . It is amazing that the bag does the job that it does . Mine fills up with dust , but sure it does n't get it all , none of them do.I did a ton of research before buying my saw . I could tell you about the cheap plastic used in some of the competition . I could tell you about the saws that do n't cut accurately , even on a simply 90 degree miter . Or the ones that cut the miter accurately , but falls short on the accuracy of the bevels . The ones that throw small pieces of wood flying at a 100 miles per hour , but I would rather just tell you that the Makita sliders are Simply the Best Compound Slider Out There . With the special going on right now , makes this a no brainer . I am so crazy about the Makita sliders that I ordered the LS1013 for portable use , even though I already have the LS1212 on a stand in my shop . Some reviews rate the 1013 higher than the 1212 , due to a larger platform-work surface . It also has the crown detent , which the 1212 does not have . I love them both , now that I have been using them . Highly recommended . Triple AAA plus 5 stars .	1
I was a little nervous about buying a Makita brand because I have broken more Makita drills than I care to admit . People I know seem to swear by Makita so I ignored my four broken Makita drills in my shop and bought this saw . I justified my purchase by convincing myself that there must be a different department at Makita that designs saws instead of drills . The first thing I went to do was adjust the saw , but my machinest square was telling me it was dead accurate right out of the box . I did not think this was possible so I started cutting . Every miter I cut was dead accurate . And the blade that comes with the saw is a really nice carbon toothed blade . The blade worked well , but I replaced it with a Forrest Woodworker II combo 40 tooth blade . Now you may think it 's crazy to put a 40 tooth blade in a sliding miter saw for finish work ... but it cuts hardwood to a glass like finish , no blade marks at all . I also like the 40 tooth blade because I take the saw to the job site and cut framing , 2 & quot ; x12 & quot ; engineered microlams , TJI Joists , whatever . Then I might be cutting crown molding , and other finish work with the same blade . I know this is not a blade review , but this 40 tooth with this saw cuts smoother than any 80 tooth I 've used , except the 80 tooth forrest blade . I have used the heck out of this saw for two years and have not had a single problem .	1
I absolutely love this saw it is smooth and does everything a miter saw should well . The blade it comes with is a true finish grade blade ( i would recommend buying a cheaper blade if you plan on using this to cut framing lumber with and using this blade exclusively for trim as thats what its made for and it does it very well and you quite frankly you would be wasting it on framing lumber . ) The motor is silky smooth and quiet yet it has plenty of power . The slides are smooth , the table shifts places and detents effortlessly , and the dual bevel works flawlewssy . I use this saw strictly for trim which is what it does best because even though it has plenty of power this is definetly a finesse saw and I think if you can afford it youd be better served with another saw for rough work and keeping a good blade on this and using it for trim . Its so percise i would n't risk banging it up on a framing jobsite . All in all this is a true percision machine only two things stop me from giving it 5 stars . The fence could stand to be higher , wider and just plain beefier also bevel detents at 33.9 would be nice but hese are small complaints for such a precise machine .	1
You 'll find me somewhere down the list about a year ago . I use this saw every day . I cut and/or cut and cope large base , large case , and large crown even 16 & quot ; bullnose shelving on custom homes . I even flip the shelving over because it is wider than the cut , still dead on . I even straight cut cope joints , and the blade follows the bevel perfectly . In some houses the preference is Oak , and the cuts are knifejoint . Everyone I work with has one , swears by them . Just as good as the day I got it . It is not stationary either , it rides around morning and night on a shelf in my trailer . I could n't begin to count , even in a day , how many times the base has swiveled , rails have slid , bevel has been changed , and the saw has started , and it 's just as accurate as the day I got it . I make my living with this saw , I am very satisfied and I am still Impressed .	1
This is a dead-on accurate piece of art right out of the box . I use it in shop for many fine furniture cuts that need to be tuxedo accurate instead of using my radial arm saw . In the rough construction field , it works all day long on a small honda ( 2000 ) generator with no complaints . If you knock it out of alignment from roughing it up too much in the field ( all saws will suffer from this fate , ) just take the time to square it up , and you 're good to go again ! I have found absolutely no issues with this product	1
I found this to be the best 10 '' sliding compound miter saw . I like the heavy base for stability and the accuracy of the saw , even when extending the slider rails . The ability of the saw to compound miter left and right is a real time saver for me . I had no problems with locking in the miter angles on the turntable . This saw also has adjustable depth of cut which I used to cut some dados while building screen frames . This saw also has a lock pin to lock down the saw for travel and storage and a handle to use to pick up to move it . This saw replaced my radial arm saw . Excellent saw from a great company .	1
I just finished a very long session with the Makita : more than 250 hard maple planks that I 'm milling into flooring . I 'm very satisfied . The saw is very well designed , the action is smooth , and the fences were set up accurate right out of the box . I traded up from a Dewalt 12-inch ( non-sliding ) . With the non-sliding saw , I 'd have to flip wide boards and clean them up later with the table saw . With the Makita , I can cross-cut 12-inch wide planks , no table saw necessary . The trigger lock mechanism takes some getting used to , but once you 've used it awhile , you get the hang of it . My only real complaint is that the saw could use a more powerful motor ( how about a 15-amp like the 12-inch ) .	1
Let me get my one complaint out of the way right up front . The box this thing comes in has no padding in it . There are a few chunks of cardboard around it , but that 's it . I was surprised it was n't beat up when it arrived . Luckily , the only damage was a few scratches on the back of the table from the two metal wings that were free floating around in the box.Okay , with that out of the way , let 's get to the good stuff . Dang , this is a NICE saw ! I am very pleased with the feel , fit and finish , all very high quality . Right out of the box , the only adjustment I had to make to square it up was a slight tweak to the bevel angle . Which brings to me to one point of caution , I did not find the instructions for fixing this to be too helpful , in fact they occurred as misleading . Perhaps I was just reading them wrong . Once I gave up following them and realized what needed to happen , it was trued up in seconds . The process is much simpler than is written about.On to the cutting . I 'm sure the factory blade is very nice , but I put Freud blades on all my 10 '' saws . I have an 80 tooth finishing blade and a 24 tooth ripper , both are SOOOOOO nice . The 80 tooth produces a cut that is incredibly smooth , absolutely no sanding needed.I 've cut pine , red oak , maple and some funky Asian hardwood and it glides right through on crosscuts like the wood 's not even there . Ripping is similar on softer woods , though maple let 's you know how dense it is . No real effort , just slower cutting.As others have mentioned , the dust collection is not great . Mine is always attached to my shop vac , which grabs ~maybe~ 50 % . I have discovered that bringing the blade down at the front and pushing into the wood causes better collection . Just dropping the blade down like a chopsaw sprays dust everywhere except into the dust chute.I sprung for the right sub fence , extra vertical vise as well as the horizontal vice . I 've used them all quite a bit now , which is good concidering the cost . My only concern here is that you ca n't place the vices where ever you want them , they only go in pre-designed spots . This limits their usefullness on small work pieces.Oh , a word about clamping . When I first got it , I cranked the vices down fairly hard and this tended to pull the wood off-square . Lately , I 've been barely using any clamping force , just enough to keep it from sliding plus an extra twist and have n't had this problem since.If the other 50+ reviews have n't sold you , I do n't know what will . This is a fantastic tool that has become my first choice in saws around the shop . If I can cut it here , I wo n't even look at the table saw.Right now they are giving away a 14.4 drill/driver with it . How great of a deal is that ? ? ?	1
a light or a laser would give this saw 6 stars . very precise saw . Arrived by ups in great shape ! !	1
This saw is great ! I do n't know how I lived without it for so long . It is easy to use and has a great dust collection system once you get an adapter to attach it to a shop vac .	1
I purchased a used one for a song on ebay with a few parts missing and a few contractor modifications ( a nice way of saying paint splatters , missing parts and a nail being used as the safety button ) . I was delighted to see that the saw still cut like a champ with a new blade put on it and that parts were easy to find and buy online ! The saw is accurate , it has to be the best 10 '' CSMS on the market ! Get one new , get one used -- but get one !	1
I love this miter saw , my only problem with it is that I have to keep truing the fence , and it seems a little to fragile to take on the job site . I think one of my carpenters is forgetting about the soft start and plunging the blade into the wood before it comes up to speed . The price has dropped and I would definately recommend it .	1
I own a hardwood flooring business and we have 4 of these saws in use and 3 Dewalt 10 '' and 1 Hitachi . I had the Milwaukee Magnum 10 '' but sold it because it was too heavy and hard to use . These Makita 10 '' saws have a great feel to them and are prefered by our crews . We have never had a repair problem with them except for truing the fence which gets knocked out of square after extended use as is typical with all miter saws I 've used . Overall the best 10 '' saw out there.Note the DEWALT DW703 10 '' Miter saw is my second choice and is a good saw , however I did have a defective motor on a 1 week old saw .	1
Amazon shipping has never let me down . I received the miter saw within three days of ordering it ( standard shipping ) . It was packed well and I tested it out . It is well built and I have several projects where I will put it to work . The price was good and I would recommend it .	1
You 'd think it would be easy to find a miter saw that cut straights , angles , and bevels accurately ( without having to adjust them every time ) , but alas no . I went through a couple of cheaper brands hoping to save a few bucks ... live and learn . This saw does n't have all the bells and whistles of some other brands , but it cuts true .	1
Let me make this short : this is all the miter saw 95 % of us need . You can buy bigger , fancier more powerful saws with advanced features but this is all you really need unless you 're a full time Pro who does trim and molding etc . all day long.It has a liitle `` kick '' at start up but when you make the cut it is so quick and so clean you forget it . In fact ... .I LIKE that little start up boost ! This is a well made , well thought out tool and looks like it will last a long time . If its like my other Makita tools I 'm sure it will .	1
I 've have had this saw for many years and it works very well . It is lightweight , rugged and dependable . About the only drawback I see is that it is not the easiest miter saw to align w.r.t . fence perpendicularity to blade . It can be done , but it may take awhile to align perfectly and it does n't seem to hold alignment as well as it could , so I have to get our the squares to check alignment before attempting any finish work - work which I usually reserve for the table saw or Festool anyway , so this is not much of a problem for me - after all , this saw was intended for jobsite construction , not fine woodworking . I should also mention that my model does not have soft start electronics . The amperage spike when you start it is noticeable as is the considerable torque . ) I have several Makita tools and they have all proven to be both reliable and durable . I would n't recommend this for finish work ( e.g.as a primary angle station in a framing shop ) but for the price , it 's a good value and sturdy and great for construction.I should also mention that the dust collector works quite well for an open miter saw . I use a 1 1/4 hose and a shop vac , and this seems to get 85-90 % of the dust , and the station itself stays remarkably clean from cut to cut . only a light dust drifts to the table top.I should mention that the replacement parts seem to be only available through online dealers that charge enormous shipping fees ( though the parts are reasonably priced ) . I 've replaced some switches , brushes , cords , etc . over the years and invariably the shipping exceeded the cost of the part . On the positive side , in my case the parts have n't failed that often.Simple Miter saw design , reliable , and competitive price . Recommended.afterthought : I 've come to rely on accurate laser guides on the modern tools . My Makita L1040 has years of life left in it , but lacked a laser guide . Oshlun makes a laser for this saw ( Oshlun LG-M01 Miter and Portable Saw Laser guide - $ 22.49 @ Amazon ) that works great on this saw . See my review for details . There are several other brands of laser guides that may work as well , but I have n't tried them .	1
I 've yet to be disappointed with any Freud circular saw blades . I use them on my Ridgid 10 '' table saw , 10 '' Delta miter saw and on my Ridgid 12 '' sliding miter saw . This particular blade was for my sliding miter saw and it has greately reduced the problem of rough cuts on hardwood veneer plywoods . I also use Freud combination and heavy-duty rip cut blades . Their heavy-duty rip cut blade gets my `` best in class '' award . The blades are noticeably quieter than other blades I 've used.My usage is as an amateur woodworker . To see some of my projects I invite you to visit my non-commercial website : Life After 50 -- One Man 's Perspective . The link below will take you to my homepage where you 'll find menu links to my woodworking hobby pages and photos.URL : [ ... ]	1
I have retired the blade which came with my Ridgid 12 & # 34 ; compound mitersaw to utility and carpentry projects only . This blade is the thing for fine woodworking , and in combination with a sacrificial/zero clearance insert for the saw table , and a sacrificial fence to back up the cut , I get a finish quality cut every time with no chip- or tearout . A beautiful piece of industrial engineering . Just love it .	1
Hi everyone , I must admit , I was quite skeptical about this blade especially considering the cost , but I knew if I did not like it , I could return it . Not anymore ... I used the blade today and I must say the cut really is the smoothest I have seen with any blade.Another note is how quite it cuts through the wood , both cross cutting and ripping . So far it looks like it is going to be worth the money . Take care .	1
This blade cuts very smooth with no splintering . I use this on my Delta 12 '' lazer chop saw for finish work . I had one of these for years and had it resharpened until the teeth could be sharpened no more . I replaced it with a Forest chop saw blade bucause I use Forest on most of my other saws and they work great but the Forest blade would not make the smooth cuts I needed so I went back to this Freud balde . I have been woodworking for over 40 years and in my openion , this is the blade to use for finish work . There are other blades out there that will equal the performance of this blade but not at this price !	1
I Do alot of trim work and I have yet to find a blade that you can cut hardwoods with a Glass smooth end grain cut , , you can feel the diff	1
Among the finest blades I 've seen yet . I 'm remodeling an old house , and need to cut new base boards ( oak ) . It is n't kidding when it says & quot ; Glass Smooth & quot ; . This blade in my DeWalt 706 is an ideal setup.Beware , even a blade of this quality is not a replacement for proper support of the wood . If you are doing fine work with good wood , invest the time to create a sacrifical backstop and throat plate for your mitre saw . The stock plates on my DeWalt are great for general work , but if you want 5-star results , put in the effort to set up your saw correctly .	1
I purchased this blade for use on my compound miter saw . It cuts very well leaving a very smooth finish in all the woods I 've tried : oak , maple , cherry , walnut . I espeCially like the teflon coating , all my other saw blades have developped rust over the years no matter how hard I try to keep them clean . This blade should keep cutting well and looking clean for a very long time .	1
as a full-time woodworker , accuracy is everything..clean , precise cuts means less time sanding and cleaning up..this blade really saves me a ton of time on my sliding compound saw..I can crosscut all my cabinet parts and save a ton of time and this blade gives me no tearout on either top or bottom of wood veneered plywoods..	1
Our company purchased 1 of these saws about 6 mo ago and it has been a pleasure to use . We install hardwood flooring and so we need a saw that is lightweight yet powerful and reliable . We have used many table saws through the years including 10 '' Hitachi jobsite table saw , Ryobi , Tradesman , Skill , Delta , and have found that they do n't even survive a year before the bearings go out or other major problem . I have noticed some key design benefits on the Makita that may help with the longevity of the tool . Makita has a dust port that exhausts the dust out the back of the saw so that it does not get sucked into the motor . My only small complaint is that the switch is located on the right side which is harder to use for right handers since you are normally holding the material to be cut with that hand and would normally turn the switch on with the left hand . Perhaps this is some sort of safety feature or maybe it 's designed for lefties . Overall it is a great saw . The reviews noting that the fence is inadequate for precision work are true , but for me the lighter weight of this saw in comparison to the Dewalt makes it more desirable .	1
The factory fence sucked bad . I added the Rousseau 2600 fence system and it now a different saw , plenty of power , now very accurate . I use the portable setup in the bed of truck , sitting the saw on the tailgate at least 3 times a week ripping material for jobs . Bought this saw for $ 151 atHD so even happier at that price . Rousseau was $ 101 with all the Amazon deals available at the time , $ 30 off , Gold Box , and A9 . Believe it or not I still like my old 2708 better .	1
I own a Makita 2702 which is nearly identical to the 2703 except that the 2702 can only handle a max . 8 1/4 in blade . I 'm not sure if the 2702 is even available anymore . I like the light weight and portability which makes it a very good job site saw . The electric brake is also a nice feature . I bought the saw about 8 years ago and have used it on quite a few carpentry jobs . Recently , I upgraded the 2702 with a Rousseau table and a dado blade set . The dado blade will only cut a maximum 1/2 inch wide dado becuase that is all the arbor can handle . I also built a crosscut sled which was n't easy because the miter slots are only about 3/16 inch deep . This saw really is n't a woodworking saw but will work o.k . for rough carpentry or small home projects . The arbor is loose which creates a lot of runout , which can leave saw marks and burns in the wood ( especially hardwood ) during ripping and crosscutting operations . If you plan to make furniture , invest your money in a decent ( heavy cast iron ) cabinet saw .	1
In addition to a general contracting ( remodel and restoration ) I do intricate detailed finish carpentry . I 've owned this tool for at least five years now and like Timex - It takes a lickin and keps on tickin . But paired with the Rousseau 2700XLK 3 Piece Table Saw Stand System , this saw becomes a truly professional work station . Since initial set-up no adjustments have been required - just drop it in the hole and it is dead on . It will produce & lt ; 1/16 veneer off an eight inch board ( flipping the board ) with out a burn and that 's after ripping 80 ft. of cement board at a 45 miter . I 've seen trimmers and framers blown away in unbelief . On the serious side : the brake , the power , the Rousseau fence and the ease of mobility are the pluses . Also , drop a bag under it and hook up a vac . and it 's about 97 % dust free ( as long as your not running MDF ) . Blade changes are a snap as long as you do n't forget the Mikita supplied tools . Makita makes a 1/2 inch dado for this saw that is reasonibly priced if you are in to such . There is that one con that you 'll read about in any review . If I have to do a cross cut I use a framing square or run a line . I trashed that miter thing a log time ago .	1
I 've been a self employed carpenter for thirty years . Ive gone through several bench saws from various companies . I burnt all up in less than a year each . One saw in 6 months . Oh ! it 's not the cords ... I use a 25 foot 12 ga. Stranded cord . Finally I bought the 2703 a year and a half ago . What a change . I never use the miter as I use a miter saw . Most of my work is interior trim and cabinets , and I 've never had a problem with accuracy , unless it is my fault . With a 60 or 80 tooth blade I 've milled from stock to finish with little planing and/or sanding . It cuts a beautiful 45 bevel but if you use the normal 47 degree , it will be perfect . Oh ! what sold me is the ability to cut a 2x4 on edge . No other saw I know of , and I 've used nearly every name brand out there , will cut 3 9/16 & quot ; My only complaint is not having a long enough arbor to receive a large dado .	1
I have had one of these for about ten years . I mostly use it on the job for ripping 2x material . It is light weight and stay very accurate even after years of use .	1
This is my favorite table saw and I use it for everything and have never had any problems . I bought the rousseau table to attach it to and I will never part with it ...	1
I 've had an 8 1/4 & quot ; Makita tablsaw for about 5 years now . ( My 4th saw ) It has been the most durable portable I have ever seen . It has seeen thousands of board feet of hardwoods , as well as dimentional lumber.It never strained once unless I put the blade in a bind.The new ten inch saw positively blows it away ! Even more power , easier blade adjustment , and most importantly , much higher capacity . With a full 3 9/16 this baby will rip cca 4x4 's like butter . Try that with a DeWalt . Heck , try that with a $ 1,600.00 Unisaw . ( I have one ) & quot ; It 's not gon na happen. & quot ; The fence is n't as innovative as the DeWalt 's , but I plan to get a Rousseau table for it , with a T square fence , when they become available .	1
Ive been a self employed carpenter for thirty years and used every circular on the market . Skil before & after Bosch , B & D ; , Porter Cable before & after Rockwell , Milwalkee , DeWalt , Miller Falls , and Sears . Nothing has the feel , power and dependability of this Makita . Even the old worm drive skil , which you need a crane after rafters or stair stringers , has met it 's match with the 5007 . It is heavy enough not to bounce all over the work as light diy saws do , but light enough to still drink a soda one handed at the end of the day . You can rip all day with it , and it never overheats , nor can you bind it into a stall easily . Only complaint I have is I wish it would n't hit you in the face with the saw dust . Good saw buy it . Oh ! it is made right here in the USA.This is a complaint ; I dropped mine down a flight of stairs , and bent it . I replaced it . It is now made overseas , and no longer made in Buford Georgia . No wonder so many Americans are out of work .	1
My brother-in-law does remodeling and as a result , puts his power tools through hell . He 's used the same Makita circular saw since the 1980s . It was based on seeing how well his saw still performed that I decided to purchase the Makita . I 've never been sorry . I 'm not a pro , but I certainly enjoy having a powerful , accurate saw when I need to make home repairs . I have n't found anything I ca n't slice through with this little monster . I 've had it several years and it works like a new tool . The 13-amp motor supplies more than enough power for extended cutting of hard , thick lumber and has the added homeowner 's advantage of not causing your 15-amp breakers to trip like some of the larger saws . There 's a good reason you see these things all over job sites - they work well and last forever .	1
If I have but one complaint about this saw , it is that they need to put the blade on the left side . That 's it.It has a great feel . Good power to weight . Built tough . etc.I bought it when my Porter-Cable 753 was out on loan to one of my crewmen . I do not regret making the purchase of this saw .	1
Just another favorable review of one of my favorite power tools ... The weight is right , the handle angle is right , plenty of power , and it works every time . I bought this saw to replace a cheap DIY-special Black and Decker and the difference was a revelation ( of course , any professional-quality tool would have been a revelation ) .The saw has lived in indignity under my side bench for years , getting hauled out for a variety of tasks . I am a woodworker hobbyist and amateur household carpenter . I use this saw for the occasional garden shed , rough-cutting sheet goods , and to make sets and furniture for theatrical productions ( I married an actress ) . In my light-duty work the saw is a marvel.I can not speak to its suitability for a professional framer , but it works great for me.As a side note , I kind of lust after the left-bladed Porter-Cable , but I worry about safety . Is a left-handed blade more dangerous for a right-handed woodworker ? You can see the blade more easily , which sounds good to me , but it would put the blade much closer to my left hand ( i.e. , my movable clamp ) . Just a question for thought ...	1
Before this , I used my dad 's 12A Crapsman saw . This one puts it to shame . It 's lightweight for its power , well balanced and solid as can be . The kit is nice . The hard plastic case holds 2 extra blades , the saw and the wrench . I like the arbor lock and blade wrench that are included , and the Makita thin-kerf rip blade that 's included is second to none . My first impulse was that the Milwaukee equivalent is probably more durable , but probably not worth the money for someone who 's not going to use it daily . Also , if you 've ever watched Norm Abram , this is his saw . He uses it for framing , general carpentry and even in his woodworking shop . This is probably the best saw for the money . I do feel the slightest bit guilty for not buying American ( DeWalt , Milwaukee ) though.Update - Feb 23 , 2008 : Well , I 've had this saw now for 8 years . It is still as good as new with typical woodworking and homeowner use . Even though it is `` only '' a 13 A saw , it is very hard to find something that slows it down at all . I have just sold this to my brother , for two reasons:1 ) 90 % Most of the sawing I do with a circ saw is in 3/4 '' thick material , so I do n't need something as big & heavy as this . ( meaning 7 1/4 '' size ) 2 ) The edge guides that are available to help make perfectly straight 8 ' long cuts on sheet goods are also aluminum . ( this saw 's shoe is aluminum ) Aluminum rubbing against aluminum does n't work well ; it binds . A steel , plastic , or magnesium shoe would be better.I sold this to my brother for $ 50 , with the agreement that I can borrow or buy it back if I ever need the capability . For now , I 've replaced it in my own shop with a Skilsaw HD5510 , the nice little 5-1/2 '' , left-blade circular saw . It costs about the same and is ever so much more handy . Bigger is not always better !	1
I have been using this saw to cut maple ply for cabinets ( not cheap stuff to make bad cuts on ) and it performs great . I was using an old skill saw and it always seemed to wander and I figured it must be the operator . Most of my mistakes came at the start of the cut but the guide and the excellent visibility of your cut enables even untrained operators like myself perform well . In response to earlier reviews about the depth locking nut coming loose ... I have not found this problem . You will be happy with this purchase .	1
I purchased this model at a department store last summer , when I began painting my 60 year old , wooden sided home . I wanted a power tool to help take some of the work out of the surface prep job . I scraping by hand , and followed up by using the sander to smooth the surface . It worked wonders , producing a paper smooth finish on the bare wood and old paint that remained . Being so lightweight , it was a pleasure to use , especially up on the ladder . Actually , it made the job fun . This Makita sander has plenty of power . It did not bog down , and the dust bag is a great feature . I ca n't wait to use it in the county 4H youth summer camp woodworking class I teach every year . One point I must make , however ; I used a genaric brand hook and loop type sanding pads . They did a great job , but after a time , the fabric side of the pads would fray before the sanding side was used up , and the pad would come off during use , sailing away like a Frisbee . This happened several times . So , beware ! ! Next time , I 'll use genuine Makita brand sanding pads .	1
Solid construction , comfortable fit . Like all Makita tools I 've bought , it has lived up to high expectations . Beyond wood I 've sanded down lots of metal -- an old file cabinet , a credenza -- from its 30 year old enameled surface down to brushed metal ( also primed it with some paint remover ) . I agree that the dust collection is useless , but this is true with most tools not hooked up to a vacuum system.Lastly , a hand orbital is never going to give you the removing power of a belt sander . It is meant for finer applications and if you have to take off lots of rough surfaces , you 'll be frustrated by the lack of power . At the same time a belt sander will erase twice the surface that you intend . If you 've never used power sanders before , I 'd recommend borrowing or renting one first to figure out which type you 'll use most frequently .	1
I just switched from my DeWalt 423K to this Makita . The Makita definitely takes off more than the DeWalt . However , I would rate them both even for comfort and the Makita 's single downside for me was their dust collection system . It spews out of the bag constantly even though I can find no holes . It also does not collect as well as the DeWalt and is more difficult to install . However , it is extremely powerful and does a wonderful job .	1
I purchased this sander nearly one year ago and ca n't say I have any complaints about it . The dust collection works surprisingly well , though if the bag is n't pushed in all the way it has a tendency to fall out ( fault of the user , not the tool ) . It is n't unbearably loud although I still wear my ear muffs when using it . The vibration in the hand is low , and it does a superb job at what it is designed to do - sand . I do n't know where the components are made , but at least the tool itself is assembled in USA which is more than I can say for the 18V Li-Ion drill and impact driver combo that I have as well ( Makita brand ) which is made in China . This is a purchase you wo n't regret .	1
I am surprised to see that there are no reviews of this sander , as it is a great little tool . I have been using this sander for about three years , and it has been put through some tough tests -- sanding up to 1/2 & quot ; off wood edges , sanding floors , sanding tough wood , and even sanding plaster off the walls of a 250-square-foot room . In every case , it has done a terrific job , never weakens under pressure . The sander has very little vibration , and it leaves no swirl marks , even when using lower grit sandpaper . Several times , I have dropped the sander onto the cement floor of my shop , and still it keeps on working . The only minus I can see with this sander is that the dust collection system could be better . Even though it has a dust-collection bag ( which gets filled up , suggesting it is catching a lot of dust ) you need to wear a mask when you use it so you do n't breath in harmful particles . It is even pretty good at getting into tight corners , better than other sanders .	1
GREAT sander , does the job wonderfully , rugged ( I 've dropped it _so_ many times ... ) , but there 's a BUT : the vibration causes my right arm to go numb . Vibrates my funnybone somehow , and the numbness takes days to go away . Maybe it 's just me , or maybe that 's just something this type of sander does , but as much as I use it , I HATE to use it for that reason.Oh , also , be careful of the skitter . Good technique required .	1
This is a wonderful sander . Lightweight but good for heavy use . Hook and loop sanding parts are really easy to use . The switch is placed very conveniently . When you place the sanding pad please make sure all the wholes are aligned with the holes in the sander and give a good pressure all around and sand on the flat surface by applying some pressure . Once it 's settled the sanding pad stays pretty good . Then you can sand on the uneven surfaces . If you do n't follow the procedure I mentioned above , most of the times the sanding paper would fray from the sander . It is one of the most reliable tools I have ever owned . I have helped friend build three living units with this sander . Do not buy cheap Black and Decker orbital sanders .	1
Replaced an aging B & amp ; D orbital sander with this little gemReplacing an aging Black and Decker orbital sander with this little gem was a great move . The higher rpm ability of the Makita cuts my finish sanding time in half . Due to its lightweight , sanding time is only limited by the durability of the sand paper . Only time I stop is to change the sheet , which takes only a matter of seconds with the pre-cut paper and clamping system . The agronomical design fits comfortably in the palm of my hand . Only minor draw back is the location of the on-off switch . Sander can inadvertently be turned off during use .	1
If you 're after a compact belt sander with plenty of power and features , this Makita is first class.If you 've used belt sanders before , you understand the need for a compact sander for jobs like scribing countertops and for sanding verticle surfaces.As usual with my power tools , I bought the Makita 9911 and gave it a gentle break-in . I took it out of the box , changed belts to a coarse , and then ran it for over an hour without shutting it off while sanding the hull of a wooden boat . Then I continued to give it about 3 additional hours of use and that was just its first day . The Makita is excellent , the best small belt sander I 've ever used.The positives : - Light weight , but very powerful . This is the best sander in the world if you have to sand vertical surfaces ! It 's light , but on high speed it really sands fast . Now if you 've tried to use heavy belt sanders to sand vertical , you know how nice it is to have a light , but powerful sander.- Good dust collection . The dust system actually works on this sander and works very well . I have n't felt the need to hook it up to my vac system because the dust collection is that good.- It 's actually fairly quiet for a belt sander . I still wear hearing protection , but it 's noticeably quieter than the turbo-jet scream that most belt sanders emit.- I experienced no tracking issues at all . Put on a belt , adjust the tracking screw , and it stays right where I set it.The not-so-good : -I had to take a utility knife and remove the sharp plastic molding edge on the underside of the handle . Details , guys , please ! A minor detail , but annoying and I 'd expect Makita to catch things like this.- The closure on the dust bag is a funny plastic thing that slides on and I can already see I 'll have to be careful not to lose it . What 's wrong with a zipper like everyone else uses ? But still I give it 5 stars because it works very well and has great features . As always , I 'll edit my review if problems develop .	1
I recently picked this up for $ 79 on clearance at The Borg and am thrilled with it . I already have a large heavy duty belt sander , but I rarely use the monster because it is so aggressive and heavy . However , there are times when a random orbit sander is just too slow for the job at hand . With this little Makita I have excellent control and reasonably aggressive removal rates . Mine was Made in England , though I 'm not sure if they all are . The belt tracking is automatic . Just slip the belt on and go . The balance is just right . A very nicely engineered tool which I 'm glad to have in the collection .	1
What an improvement over my old sander ! I had a craftsman belt sander . This one is two pounds lighter with the same belt size . The craftsman was hard to control and vibrated a lot . This one runs very smooth and is very manageable ... something important to the female woodworker . The belt stays aligned whereas the old one needed constant adjustment . All in all..a good sander which I would buy again .	1
I researched a lot of belt sanders before deciding on this unit . I checked out various sanders at my local Home Depot and talked with some local contractors.I narrowed down my choice to this or the Porter-Cable . In the end I decided on the Makita for the following reasons:1 . The Porter-Cable is simply too heavy . I use this sander in the vertical as well as horizontal positions . It is heavy enough to be substantial and has a powerful motor , but is still easy enough to use with one hand in many different positions.2 . The dust collector is in a very unobtrusive location compared to the Porter-Cable , in addition it really works . There really is n't much dust produced when using this sander.3 . The flat back allows it to be clamped to a table and used as a parts sander . The variable speed control really comes in handy here.4 . Price was n't a big concern for me , I was going to buy the sander that fit my needs . For someone who needs a medium duty belt sander that will be used in a variety of job I recommend this one highly ! Some other larger/smaller units may be better at specific jobs , but this one is really a jack of all trades.5 . The motor is good , not a monster , but powerful and able to sustain heavy sanding for long periods of time without excessive heat . In addition , the brushes can be easily replaced.6 . Belt tracking mechanism worked flawlessly . One person in one of the reviews here complained about belt tracking . If you adjust the belt carefully it stays on track for a looong time . Maybe that person had a defective unit , or more likely , a belt that was n't perfectly square . There is no way a non square belt will track correctly no matter how much you adjust the tracking screw.Congratulation to Makita on a job well done !	1
I bought this sander for my small shop because of the price and size . It comes with a nice belt and collects the dust well . I have connected it to my fien vaccuum which works great . No problems with the belt tracking even out of the box ... plug and go . You will make some noise with this but the power on it is good for what I need . Not to heavy yet powerful enough to remove material . For medium work I recommend this sander to anyone . I have read the reviews and reseached and must agree after buying and using it to make our bedside and coffee table	1
I wanted a belt sander for quickly removing a lot of wood , but I also wanted it to be light enough to use vertically or overhead if necessary . Belt changes are easy and it is not too noisy . The dust port does clog easily unless you connect it to a shop vac . I would get the fixed speed version of this sander for a few dollars less since most only use a belt sander for aggressive sanding .	1
this was a big step up from my old b & d i got a decade ago . i wanted a big and powerful sander and that is exactly what this is ! smooth , quiet , effective when paired with shop vac at getting up lots of the dust . but be careful-this is powerful ! i find myself using the old b & d when i need to just touch up a bit ( but too much for the orbital ) .	1
A real work horse.This machine is quieter then my old belt sander and the bigger shoe makes for better surfacing.The extra long cord is a plus as well.I would recommend this to a friend .	1
Well constructed , durable , excellent finish on the wood sanded . Tracking on the Makita sander is easy to adjust and remains secure once set . This sander can be one-handed even using 60 grit paper . The weight and balance is perfect . When attached to a shop vacuum dust extraction is nearly complete.As nearly always , the dust extraction nozzle was broken in transit . Packaging secures only the bottom of the machine -- not well at that -- and nothing protects the top . However , Makita covers the damage under warranty and Acme Tools ( authorized repairer ) fixed it in two weeks . My thinking when I purchased the sander was to handle it this way . The quality of the sander is worth the inconvenience of warranty repair and it makes no sense to return it for exchange given and 80/20 chance the replacement would suffer the same breakage .	1
Belt sanders may be one of those power tools that are n't pulled out often , but when you need to remove large quantities of stock , you will want to have one . The 9403 , 4x24 sander is powerful , has good balance , good belt tracking and easy belt change . This Makita also picks up a very decent amount of sanding dust , has comfortable handles , a nice soft-start , and , most importantly , chews through stock with ease . This belt sander is possibly the best 4x24 on the market . I am very , very pleased with it.It is a genuine pleasure to operate this Makita , compared to my old Craftsman 3x21 which I had received as a gift years ago . I spent as much time adjusting the belt tracking on the Craftsman as I did sanding , but since I used it infrequently , I just put up with the excessive noise and generally less than stellar performance . After using the 9403 for 2+years , I shake my head everytime I use it , wondering why I waited so long to replace my old one . I find myself pulling this sander out and using it more often . Long cords are always a big plus for me , often eliminating the need for extension cords in the shop . I just ca n't find anything negative to say about this machine yet.Note : Being advertised as 'quiet ' at 84dB is pretty relative since > 90dB for sustained periods will deafen ... hearing loss is cummulative over time around high dB power tools ( routers , table and miter saws , plate joiners , etc . ) even if rated under the 90dB threshold ... wear ear protection [ Check out Peltor H10A Professional Earmuff Hearing Protectors ] .	1
This is an excellent sander . I really work this machine and it just keeps on going.Brace your feet , hang on tight and keep on moving ; this is a powerful sander.I usually sand with three grits and when changing belts it is rarely necessary to touch the tracking adjustment.The 4 inch footprint is more resistant to tipping than my 3 inch sander and ergonomics are perfect for me.Cons : There were 2 flat spots on the metal front roller 180 degrees apart which cause a barely discernible bump but it 's not really a problem . It just sometimes makes it hard to tell if a belt is about to separate or not.Recommended .	1
I stopped using my Crapsman belt sander a long time ago . It was more work than it was worth . When I ran into a particularly difficult wood that even my Lie-Nielsen planes , at the highest angles and with the sharpest blade irons , could n't plane without chip out , I had only two options : scrapers or a belt sander . Because of the amount I had to remove , I chose the belt sander . So I broke down and bought a real belt sander.And now I 'm wondering what took em so long . While a bit heavy , it works like a charm ! And it was so fast I wished I had more projects that required a belt sander.It tracks well . It 's easy to set down on the wood without gouging it . Dust collection is excellent . It 's relatively quiet . Changing belts is easy . And it does n't bog down under load .	1
Almost bought the variable speed but less powerful cousin . Glad I did n't . This unit works great . It 's heavy so you wo n't want to do much vertical or overhead work . One reviewr commented that it wears out his workers and I can see why . An hour is the must I can go without a break . But you can get a lot of sanding done in an hr with this tool.Much quieter than my old Sears unit . Dust collector works surprisingly well ( but I wish they offered a vac attachment becasue at the rate this unit removes material you will have to empty bag every 10 min or sooner.Probably 3 times faster than my 3 '' Sears and more stable with 4 '' footprint.My past tools have been Bosch , Milwaukee , and Dewalt . But I bought Makita 's top of line 18V saw and drill and was very impressed . Bought this based on that experience and great reviews . Very satisfied .	1
I love the power . I chose this over the variable speed 8 amp sander . After using this one , I know that I made the right decision . This is no finish sander . It makes a tough job easy .	1
I 'm a cabinet maker with a small shop and had avoided buying a large belt sander for years . In retrospect , I 'm not sure why I avoided the purchase but the right job came up , a pile of old , full of barn dirt , rough sawn Oak , that needed cleaning before planning . It only took about 2 seconds of sanding to realize this sander was going to prove to be a good investment . Now , I regularly use it to remove glue on panel glue ups . It 's not the most used tool in the shop , but I 've found when I need it , it pays for itself every time.I like Makita tools and own many , so when I write this I might be bias , but I looked at the other belt sanders in this size , this one is worth the extra dollars . Well made and lots of power , also surprisingly comfortable to use .	1
I love power ! This tool delivers boat loads of it . But you know what ? It does n't sound like it . I was never able to use a belt sander before without earplugs . This one runs at only 84 Db . It 's the quietest on the market . It 's also the smoothest I 've used.I 've used all of the 4x24 sanders and the Makita just seems to do more work faster . Maybe it 's the fact that it has the highest speed of any , maybe it 's the high tech , powerful motor , the efficient drive train . Whatever it is , it kicks butt . The dust collection system is also top notch . For small jobs and fine work , I prefer my Bosch 1274 dvs . It 's much lighter , compact and easy to control . For extended use or heavy sanding though , you can not beat this tool .	1
This Sander is a Monster ... you need to get this sander ... . forget the rest ! ! ! ! ! ! Very quiet and smooth handling , gets the job done.Hi i am back just to say that this Makita 24inch Belt Sander is really a BAD BOY ! ! ! !	1
I was going to buy a smaller 21x3 , but found this Makita for not a whole lot more . I could n't resist - especially as I like Makita tools.On arrival , it appears that the unit I received had already been used . That made me pretty mad but I decided to test it out before returning it to Amazon . Hey , it was already used so no big deal . Well , I ai n't giving it back now.The only down side is that this thing is heavy . One of my projects involves removing a bunch of material from some walls . I do n't know how long I can hold this heavy beast against a wall though . On the other hand , horizontal-ish surfaces are super easy because the unit 's weight means all I have to do is keep control.You do n't want this to be your only power sander though . It works fast , but that also means it can cause a lot of damage in a hurry too . For example , a little slip and you 've rounded an edge rather nicely . It would be very hard to round all the corners evenly though .	1
This is outstanding quality . Only thing I wish was a tiny bit different is I wish there was an ever so slight indentation in the backing so that you could more easily center it on the backing pad . So I give it a 4 1/2 instead of a five but I would buy it again .	1
I almost always try to use OEM accessories with my tools . There are exceptions as we all know but sticking with the products owned and designed by the original manufacturer usually renders the best results . I especially like this wool polisher for its durability , quality and the final finish it always renders . If used correctly you will never get burn marks or swirl marks . Always take your time , use superior products and learn the proper techniques for using them !	1
This is a good product , it 's much wider than the backing pad to allow use at an angle as well as more surface area . The wool is thick and cuts well . About the only draw back to this is that it will throw off A LOT of lint , at least with the first use . This is common with wool pads though . I do n't regret this purchase at all , but think that I will use foam next time to save myself the mess of all that lint . Made in USA	1
I 'm using it to polish my 38 ' 5th wheel trailer . As a buffing pad it works great . It 's thick and does a super job in taking off the applied polish to a high shine . The hook and Loop is very secure . I 've had zero problems using it even in small crevices tilted on it 's edge . A very fine product and highly recommended .	1
One of the accessories I bought to use on a conventional angle grinder instead of purchasing an expensive sander/polisher just for buffing .	1
WORKS GREAT , WONDERFULL SHINE . JUST KEEP CLEAN WITH SPUR TOOL . I WASHED MINE WITH DISH SOAP AND MY FINGER FOR 4 MIN. , LET IT AIR DRY OVERNIGHT .LOOKS BRAND NEW . THE ONLY BUFF CLOSE TO THIS ONE IS EITHER 3M OR MILWAUKEE . BEEN BUFFING WITH WOOL SINCE 1978 , PREFER IT . I DO HAVE FOAM PADS WITH MY A.C. DELCO 3INCH 3000 RPM BUFFER AND IT WORKS GREAT TOO .	1
Well made for buffing paste wax . has a centering hole for fast change out . See my reviews for the best disk to use . SW	1
This is a reasonably priced , good quality , seven inch diameter , wool buffing and polishing pad . It is pretty thick and deep , and has a 3/4 inch diameter hole in the middle . The pad is designed to be secured by the hook and loop system . ` Hook and loop ' is a generic term for Velcro type fastening . One advantage of hook and loop is that you can change pads quickly.If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop , the system is reasonably secure . The ` hooks ' on your buffing wheel , need to be in good condition , and not damaged or bent up . The ` loops ' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad . Push the pad and wheel together , and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good ` bite ' . Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels . If it seems secure , you can gradually increase the speed and pressure .	1
Check your blades . This goes for all brands of planers . The dullness factor creeps in ever so slowly and you may not be aware that your blades are too dull . I felt the old blades and they seemed sharp , but the normally fairly quiet Makita seemed too loud and the boards were not sliding smoothly through.The new blades were obviously much sharper and things went back to normal once installed . The Amazon price was the lowest I saw and they arrived quickly , although strangely packed in a big torn-up box.So , do n't be cheap . Be proactive and replace those blades . You spent a lot of money on the machine , so keep it working well . Same goes for bandsaw blades ( same basic experience ) , saw blades , etc . It is an expensive hobby for some and a business expense that ca n't be circumvented for others .	1
These are easy to install and last reasonably long . I seem to remember them being cheaper in the past but they are still a better deal at Amazon than my local retailer .	1
I 've used these blades for kiln dried oak , walnut , cherry and some poplar and pine . None of these present real challenges in terms of wear on the blade or tear out in the wood , but the blades last a long time and give an excellent finish for me .	1
Replaced the blades for the first time on my planer . the blade installation was not very easy . the end product looks good . however , I seem to notice little snipe which I never noticed with original blades !	1
Double-sided blade , very easy to install and last 4-6 months each side . First 3-4 months , it produces polished-like planning . I use Makita planer 2-3 times a week , sort of 40-50 bf/week .	1
Like a couple of other posters , I 'm not a huge fan of using biscuit joiners but on large glue-ups , mine still gets quite a bit of use , mostly for alignment.I have used another popular brand of biscuit joiner and find the Makita top notch . I like it because it 's not overly complicated at all and the chips really fly as opposed to clogging up in the chute . The fence is substantial , easy to adjust / lock and it 's very straight forward to use . I do n't want to have to `` refresh my memory '' for its use on those few occasions when I need biscuits . If for some reason I needed another , I would n't hesitate to buy another Makita for this tool .	1
I like this plate jointer . I have about 500 biscuits cut with this now , and I am happy with it . It 's not made like a fine swiss watch by any means , but it does work well for me if I take a little care setting it up , it performs as expected . You have to be a little gentle with setting up the depth `` fence '' , but it lines right up if you use reasonable care . So far no problems that would change my satisfaction with buying it . I run a lot of makita tools and love them all	1
Just got the Makita joiner today , and I 've already completed the job . It took me less time to cut the slots than to clamp down the wood ( well , almost ) . I 've had good luck with Makita tools over the years , and I 'm still using every one I ever bought . I did a lot of online research on plate/biscuit joiners , since I knew basically nothing about them , and this Makita cost maybe $ 50-70 more than the entry level ones . After 62 years I finally learned it was invariably a bad idea to buy on price , and this baby looks and feels well built ( think about it , how many power tools have you ever actually thrown away ? ) . It has a `` rack and pinion '' depth adjustment that is smooth and super-easy . Thumb clamps that are easy to use . The business end is all metal - no crap plastic angle guide or fence . The reviews and my experience give high marks for precision - and let 's face it - for this type of application is n't precision really important ? And did I say it cuts through pine like a knife through butter ? Somehow I got the impression this type of joiner might be hard to use - nothing could be further from the truth . The Makita manual is kind of sparse ( other than the safety warnings ) , but if you Google online and watch a few YouTube `` how-to 's '' you 'll be good to go . Plus I found the manual for the 3901 online if you want to look at it [ ... ]	1
I looked at the PC , and did not like the plastic components on the fence . I already had a DW , and was not happy with the alignment problems between the fence and the blade . Of all three , the Makita is the best . The fence is attached to a surface machined parallel to the blade , and is also more substantial than the DW . Do n't worry about the lower amp motor , as the blade is very high quality , and the wood from the slot comes out as shavings , not chips as in the DW . I like this tool . I would buy it again . I ca n't say that about the other two .	1
This was a good buy , we did a whole kitchen with it and we are really happy with the joiner.It 's tuff and worked REALLY well . A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+	1
OK , it 's my first biscuit joiner , I 'll admit , but I have only nice things to say about it . It received an excelent rating in the Taunton Press tool guide and was one of the mid priced models , so I took the plunge ( so to speak ) and it has definately proved itself . I 've used this tool for quite a few projects and it has worked smoothly and flawlessley . joints come out tight and perfectly aligned . There is only one drawback that comes to mind . It seems to be an excepted fact that the dust collector , as with most biscuit joiners , is not worth using . If you use the dust bag it will plug instantly . As someone else here recommended , I just turn the discharge nozzle away from me or to the floor and sweep up the chips later . I did connect it to my home central vac system with a rigged up adapter once and that seemed to work well but is n't always so convenient for me.All things considered , I appreciate quality tools and am not dissapointed by this one . Highley recommended !	1
I chose this model based on the Amazon reviews and previous experience with a makita random orbital palm sander . The other reviews do a great job listing the details , pros and cons.I had never used a plate joiner before but was up and running in 3 minutes . I was doing a project with Ipe ( aka Ironwood ) . Ipe is one of the densest woods available and just kills regular blades . I plowed through the project quickly . The motor did n't break a sweat and carbide cutters were begging for more.If you do any woodworking at all , just buy one .	1
This router is everything you need in a large plunge router for a great price . I have two older hitachi routers as well as three of the newer m12v 's and if these new ones last as long as the old ones I have , I 'll have to will them to someone when I die .	1
This router is versatile and has huge power . I use it in a table , and have made raised panel doors , etc with the `` big '' bits .	1
I 'd been debating between Milwaukee 's fixed base monster or one of the nicer 2.25 combo kits for the versatility of the plunge action . I did quite a lot of research so I was aware the old Hitachis are pretty universally well-liked compared to their more value-minded predecessors but I did n't think I was likely to find one for a decent price so when I saw one of these new for the price of a good 2.5 combo kit , I jumped on it.When it finally arrived , I had a couple concerns . The handles feel a touch cheap . In fact my right handle seems split along the plastic seam giving it just a touch of slidey action . I also noticed that the depth of cut adjustment pushes the plastic above the indicator out when you push a little too far rather than simply locking properly . There 's also a cap that rattles around on the plunge rod unless it 's held upright . I thought something was busted and loose inside of it at first.Now for the good : * The switch is perfect . It 's a blocky up/down slider . Near impossible to turn on by accident , easy to switch off with your thumb without taking your hand off the handle . * Nice accessories . A decent-looking flute bit , 1/4 '' collet adapter , and a very straightforward/easy-to-use edge guide . No wrench with mine . Did n't need it . * As cheap as they feel , the handles are adjustable and can be placed in 3 fixed positions . I like that more than I hate that they feel cheap . * Overall feel of the tool is otherwise fairly rugged and durable . * The plunge locking mechanism is rock solid . * The yucky oval shaped collet is made up for by a lever you can hold down to lock the shaft for one-wrench bit tightening . * Depth of cut is easy to change and the plunge action feels perfect for a router of this heft . * With a 1 '' cutting profile table edge bit ( 2.5 inches diameter bit ) I cut into some pine boards I 'm using for table leaves . The wood was completely disintegrating and I did n't even notice until I saw all the sawdust flying . The engine 's pitch did n't change . There was no resistance . It was like moving the router through air . Yeah , it 's a keeper . * The weight is perfect in my opinion . I would n't use it to trim laminate but it 's very easy to control freehand and highly stable . You want a tool to be the right weight , not as light as possible and this one feels just right . I also felt very little vibration.Oh and it 's just hideous . I love how ugly this thing is . Like a big dumb robot head ... that 's green.I 've heard some of the internal electronics are n't known for their longevity . If I get at least a couple years out of this beast I think it will have been worth every penny but people seem to have them longer than that . But do n't let nostalgia rule your purchasing decision . Yes this model is tried and true but Makita has one like that still on the market with some nice upgrades and I was on the verge of getting that Milwaukee fixed base myself . The price I got was much cheaper than those . It 's not worth more than the finest modern routers of its class which is what too many people think they 're going to get for it used , apparently .	1
This router is 1 of 4 in my shop . It is currently permanently mounted ( 3 years now ) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot . I have added the router raizer kit ( simple installation ) to it and can not live without this setup ! This router has soft start and runs smooth and true . I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems . It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.For the price , I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup . You just ca n't go wrong with this one ! Enjoy .	1
I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time . The deal Amazon has going ca n't be beat and if you 're considering buying this machine , do so from this site . I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too . The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly . The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well . The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing . It is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use . Those are the good points . There are a few points of contention which I have . The depth scale is a joke and I would n't use it for anything but a `` ball park '' measure . The plunge action is n't smooth unless you make it so . This entails wiping the rods , blowing compressed air into the housings , and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant . The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned . Also , the fit and finish could be better although this does n't detract from performance . I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use . Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase .	1
I love the performance and features of this router . For the money , I 'm not sure you can do better . It 's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool , and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great . I bought this specifically for a router table I built , and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity . I 've done some hand-held routing with it and it works good for that as well . Smooth plunging mechanism . The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid . The only thing I hate ( and this pretty much goes for any router I 've used ) is changing the bits . It 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up . Even with that , I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer .	1
Hitachi 's M12V is a big beast of a router . It 's not the heaviest around ( I think Porter-Cable has that distinction ) , but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation . Luckily , the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into . Hitachi includes a 1/2 '' straight cutting bit in the package , and I used this to cut out my table . I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for . And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench , one hand on the spindle lock , and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table.In my table the M12V has been a real champ . I 've cut dadoes , flush trim to duplicate a complex form , and done roundovers and Roman ogees . The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it . With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table , although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and ON/OFF controls ) .Accessories included in the package are : - 1/2 '' shank , 1/2 '' diameter , 1 '' cutting length , 2 carbide flute straight bit- parallel guide- template guide- template adapter for 3rd-party guides- 1/4 '' chuck sleeve- cutting depth fine adjustment knob ( which takes a `` 13 mm '' wrench to install , but a crescent wrench works OK too ) Not included are : - 3/8 '' chuck sleeve ( the least common bit size ) - depth scale in mm ( the included one is in inches ) - dust collector set- trimmer guide for chamferingThe M12V is really set up for right hand operation . Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws , repositioning , then retightening . This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb ( instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger , respectively ) , but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router , as is the straight edge of the base plate.Nice things about the M12V : - in a table , the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great- soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on- continuously variable speed control- Amazon 's priceNot so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use- spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1/4 '' chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slippingBottom line : Highly recommended , but best when used in a table .	1
My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop . The owner had three routers - all M12 's . This was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router . In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines . After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking . On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works really well . I use it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob ) , in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances . The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged . Unless you routinely use it like this ( which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat ) then you will never notice . If it were n't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..	1
I did my homework before buying my larger 3+hp router for my router table . From the Internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price . I have a mid-size plunge router already , ( the DeWalt 621-a fantastic router , read the MANY reviews ) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table.This router at it 's normal everyday price is a good value . I 'm not allowed to disclose this price unfortunately , ( sorry Amazon 's policy ) . When purchased with the accessory package and the height adjustment knob it 's a great deal . I got mine at Amazon with all the above and an additional twenty five percent off . This unique Amazon offer was a terrific ( once in a lifetime ? ? ) deal ! 3-1/4 hp is more power than most people are going to need unless you plan to use it for panel raising or using 3 '' diameter bits . I just used it in my router table for cutting 3/8 '' deep 1/4 '' dados in purpleheart , a very hard/heavy exotic hardwood I plan to join for a heavy duty cutting board . The cutting was flawless . Earlier I used a 3/8 '' radius bit for rounding off corners in some pine shelves and a 3/4 '' straight cutter in redwood for some 5/8 '' deep dados . The soft woods of course did nothing to arouse the Hitachi beast 's attention.The Hitachi M12V has been around a long time and has proven itself in countless professional and school woodshops and of course at home with the everyday woodworker . It has a long and positive track record.While some might argue getting a plunge router for a table is not a good idea because of their inherent design ( you have to fight gravity and the plunge springs to adjust ) . This router is easy to convert . The plunge springs are quickly removed with the loosening of a couple allen head screws . The height adjustment knob is easily attached with the refitting of a nut/washer assembly on the threaded adjustment bolt attached to the router base . If you wish to run larger bits of 3 '' + , simply turn the router/base upside down , hold it secure and cut off the magnesium tabs that hold the template guide with a jigsaw . ( If this is your only router you may wish to keep this useful feature for hand held routing , otherwise its not really necessary . ) The whole conversion time including cutting is a little over ten minutes.The height adjustment knob works adequately for most table routing but it 's a little slow and can be awkward to bend down each time you wish an adjustment and measurements are done by hand ( meaning literally your hand holding a ruler from the table top to the tip of the bit ) . You may wish to purchase the Router Raizer system , I plan to . This system then is essentially the same as buying a 3hp fixed base router+router raising assembly at 1/3 to 1/2 the cost ! And for those of you Tim Taylors , those large 3 '' -3-3/8 '' bits can be used to hog off a small forest in your next cabinet or door project.The fit and finish is adequate . I 've seen better from Porter Cable and DeWalt but it 's the performance and reliablility I 'm after here along with a good price . This incredible hulk is lurking under my router table unseen anyway , ready to chew through anything I can throw at it . The accessory package aside from the height adjustment knob and included 1/2 '' carbide straight bit is of questionable usefullness to me since mine is primarily for the table . The quality of these items is average.The Pros : **Unbelievable value ( when purchased on sale ) , otherwise still a good value**Incredible 3-1/4 hp power**Soft start , electronic speed control and feedback**Well designed , simple to use plunge lock**One touch spindle lock**Easily converted to table use**Long track record as a proven workhorseThe Cons : **Fit and finish average**Macro and micro plunge adjustment action fair when used freehand**Base opening & lt ; 3 '' diameter ( to fix , see above ) Summary : A terrific big mean green machine for the table and the most bang for the buck available . Just do n't get it angry .	1
This was one of the first ever Hitachi brand tools we purchased and was so impressed that have gone on to buy many others . After six years of use , it has stood the test of time . Powerful , smooth and durable . Stil has plenty of life left in it ... unless they have changed the construction , this is an excellent unit and well worth the price .	1
Hitachi has been making the M12V for awhile now and any serious woodworker knows the name well . It stands for quality and precision.I use this router only in a table and could n't ask for more . I have the RAIZER mating it to help with above-table adjustments.I have never had a problem with this router . It works for everything . 3.25 HP is right on the money.Buy this product without hesitation .	1
My recent purchase was my third M12V . My first was in 1991 at a tool show .One thing that really impresses me is there is no vibration , no jerking at start-up.I have not had any problems with any of them -- they all are working just fine . This is a great all around router for handheld use or table use .	1
This is an excellent router for the money . I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim . The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust . I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much . Other than that , i think it is the best router for the money .	1
I mounted this router in a table , using a Rousseau router plate . I have used the machine for some light molding and grooving over the last year , and it works very quietly and smoothly . You ca n't even tell the router is cutting under load . I just experimented with a couple 3 1/2 inch panel raising bits , today . My samples were 3/4 '' pine . I cut a cove pattern and an ogee pattern on two separate samples . Both profiles were cut in a single pass . You can tell the router is working hard , but it did n't bog down . My shop vac was providing chip collection while the router was operating . The router eventually needed all 15A , and 15A circuit breaker popped . For panel construction , I will definitely use 2 passes over the panel raising bit . I experienced no tear out on the cross grain cut , or the long side cut . This router is a great performer , from my perspective.I noticed that many people recommend removal of the template guide tabs on this router . I did not remove the tabs , since the bottom surface of the panel raising bit is well above the template guide ears . The ears prevent the bit from being lowered from the table . But it is easy enough to remove the router from the table to change the bit.If anyone can provide a reason why this practice may be unsafe , if indeed it is , I would be grateful to know about it . It seems that as long as the panel raising bit is well above the template ears , there should be no safety issue . I guess if you need to lower the bit below the table to change the bit , the template ears would definitely have to be removed . Thanks for any feedback you are willing to contribute on this . I 'm no expert ; just a pragmatist . I 'm curious what more experienced woodworkers think about this .	1
BEEFY ! Nowhere close to this price will you find as powerful and reliable a router ! This will drive panel-door bits with ease ! Very happy with my purchase .	1
I managed to burn up my Dewalt router while making some raised panels and needed a router in order to finish the project so I started looking for something that : a ) I could afford and b ) that would be heavy enough to swing that panel raising bit . The only router that satisfied both requirements was this one . I was a bit hesitant to buy one that was so much cheaper than any other name-brand router in its class but did it anyway . The router came in and I was quite pleased with it even though it does not have the bells and whistles that the Dewalt had . It runs fine , is easy to adjust in the router table ( thanks to the extension handle ) and most importantly , it is still running !	1
Bought this router with the idea of using it in a table exclusively . I Figured it would be too heavy for using it without a table , but I was wrong : the smooth slowstart feature and the router having no vibration makes it easily controlled.I did end up mounting it in a table and it works great with large style and rail cutters.I compared this against the larger DeWalt , but this one won based on price . As to performance , they are probably equal.If you need a larger router for a good price , get this one .	1
I 'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I 'm very fond of it . This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables . I mounted mine in a home brew table and used a router lift . The smooth operation verable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results . Its well made and user friendly . You 'll love it !	1
I have a small fixed base , single speed router that I use freehand . But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits . At first , I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router , but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise . The Hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with Freud bits ! ) However , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand ( I keep it mounted in a table ) . Since I use it in a table , I do n't use the plunge feature , but if I ever need it I 've got it . The Hitachi is a great router for a great price , but only get it if you need the maximum power , variable speed and use it in a table . Otherwise , get a smaller single speed router , which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits .	1
We use Porter Cable routers for 80 % of our needs.Some years ago in a fence shop the foreman showed meThis M-12V Hitachi work horse.After pairing it with the 690 non VS by porter cable at the time , I was impressed andSomewhat surprised at its ease of use . The ideal three angle adjustable handle gave me hours of comfort in use.I loved the convenient shaft lock for much easier changing of bits over the PC 's . But the real cherry in the pie was its '' Electronic '' variable speed control . I could not believe how well the unit 's starts felt when using a very large panel bit.One move in the right direction for this router is its weight ! You need it for the typeOf work output this unit can give ! Its weight really helps to keep it stable and safeWhile turning out large shapes by hand ! ! Now we have purchased one for our shop . It is mounted under a large shapingTable and turns out some of the very best door panel designs we have.This work horse is one of the best routers money can buy and with the savings you getFrom Amazon you can buy 2 for what they sold for new ... Over $ 500.00 list price.I must say that if you 're serious about your cabinets or what ever you just should notBe with out this Hitachi Router ! It gives you one more ace in your deck !	1
It ai n't cutting edge ( no pun intended ) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ai n't pretty . But it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable & it has a proven track record . I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits . Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit . Have to clean , buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway . So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I 've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that . Happy woodworking ! !	1
This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses . Built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig . The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation . It is a heavy but well-balanced machine , which is an asset when maximum stability is desired . The edge guide is top quality , easy to install and accurate . I used this router to plow out 3 & quot ; raised panels in oak without phasing the beast . This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit . The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings . The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it works well and provides good accuracy . The only complaint I have is that the 1/4 & quot ; collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4 & quot ; bits . I purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job . The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately . However , now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob , I 'd say jump all over it . This is a great deal , and I 'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi 's green machine . Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars .	1
When I first used this blade I could n't believe the smooth cut I received with this blade . It was also quieter than the old blade I was using .	1
No complaints . Cuts like a Freud blade should : smooth and quiet .	1
Bottom line : awesome blade , supremely sharp , well-balanced , zero vibration even when cutting very thick , very hard wood . I purchased a previous-generation LU85 20 years ago which served me well and yielded great results on my old Craftsman contractor saw , despite its limited power . I bought this new blade so I 'd have a backup when the other is out for sharpening . Used with my PM 2000 , it produces crosscut surfaces that are almost glossy smooth with no visible saw marks , even under a magnifying glass . I 've used a lot of other blades . In my opinion this is the best crosscut blade on the market and the price is reasonable .	1
This blade lives up to it 's billing . It does cut as smooth as glass . If I had not seen it with my own eyes I would n't have believed it . Pair this blade with the Freud blade stabilizer and you have a cutting combo for your table saw that is hard to beat . ( I would recommend cleaning the blade every now and then . Pitch build up does reduce the smoothness of the cut . ) Chalk up another one for Freud !	1
Super smooth cuts . But you ca n't really chop cut with the blade . You have to take a few extra miliseconds than you would with a 60 tooth , but you make that up in sanding and/or gluing time since the cut is now at about a 150-grit finish anyway . It seems to run quieter than the blade I replaced ( ca n't recall the brand or model since its been on so long ) . And it fits snuggly on my 5/8 '' arbor , no play . All-in-all I find it an excellent blade for my second most important saw ( my table saw has a Woodworker II ) .	1
Have used these for years - a reliable blade , thicker and more stable blade than the LU87R , has 1/8 & # 34 ; kerf , always smoothest of cuts .	1
We are replacing all of the trim in our house and I needed a quality blade . We are using hardwood poplar and this thing is like a hot knife through butter . The cuts come out perfect every time without ANY need to sand . Buy this blade you wont regret it.I was a little nervous buying an expensive blade for my cheap miter saw but i get perfect cuts all of hte time	1
My husband does woodworking as a hobby . All I have to say is my husband loves these blades . His exact words were , & quot ; Cuts like a hot knife through butter ! & quot ; If you have any doubts about this blade , DO N'T ! It is worth every penny .	1
I 'm just repeating what everyone else here has to say , but the redundancy is worth it . If you are crosscutting you have got to use this blade . I use it on my Bosch 4000 Table Saw . It leaves surfaces so glassy smooth that they could be used to calibrate scientific instruments . : )	1
I have a cheap miter saw that I have been using for a couple of years ... it is accurate enough to get by on the kind of `` rough '' work that I do . This blade almost makes a new saw of it , cuts so smooth that Ican be glue straight from the saw . Almost invisible line . I could n't believe that .	1
This thing is SHARP . Cuts like butter in Walnut , Bloodwood & other exotic hardwoods . I would most certainly recommend it you will not be disappointed~ !	1
I used this on my maple flooring project , and the ends were burnished as the cuts were made . No chipping , no tearouts , and it works on softwood with equal adroitness . I am well please with Freud saw blades and bits .	1
We have tried all types of blades . And some are better than others ! When your making some of the finest cabinets and doors in the world for some of the most demanding customers you ca n't second guess your self ! Or worrie about your saw blades integrity ! These blades will amaze your customers with fine bevels and hair line tight cross cut joints at any angel with any type of wood ! ! Great for cabinet panal saws and compound radial sliders ! In 10 '' size.When asked how we get our cuts so tight , we tell them about the Freud 80-tooth LU85R010 `` Ultimate Crosscutting '' blade ! If your as serious about your projects as we are about ours do n't skimp on your crosscut blades ! Buy the LU85R010 From Freud ! And Fillet Your Wood !	1
I needed a better blade to make laser like cuts for end grain cutting boards . This blade handles it with a breeze , even for harder woods like purpleheart or wood that traditionally is hard to machine , like hickory . Very happy with my purchase .	1
How smooth can be crosscut in birch plywood ! No blade will compete with this one in cutting plywood and other man made materials . No Forrest , no Ridge Carbide , no Amana . Freud beats them all .	1
I actually have an original C8FB . The C8FB2 is even better : self-retracting guard is the best . As you lower the saw , the guard pulls itself up via a linkage . My older model allows the guard to touch the wood and is pushed up by being in contact . Not bad on 90 degree cuts but if the saw is laid sidewise , the guard binds against the blade . They fixed this problem elegantly on the B model.The saw is now twelve years old or more and is as accurate as when I bought it . What else can I say ? It crosscuts 2x12s . Crown mouldings . Aluminum . Anything . I 'm trying to get the 998864 blade that is actually designed to cut aluminum . That would be even better.The saw transports well : not too big and heavy . Cord is too short , but they all are . I replaced it with a 14-ga 25 ' cord . Much better.Now if they offered that centrifugal-on laser cutting guide in the blade bushing it would be perfect.My radial saw was retired by this beaut .	1
This is my second purchase of the Hitachi Saw , now for my son , who started using mine over 15 years ago when he was in high school . The saw is the most precise miter saw I have used ( I once bought a cheaper saw for off-site work and discarded it as unsatisfactory ) , much less bulky than a 12 inch saw , has more cut capacity than the larger blade models and has smoother travel along its double rails than comparable sliding saws . Yes , it looks expensive , but , after 15 years , I 'm glad I stretched my saw budget a bit to get a good one . Naturally , since my son learned on the Hitachi saw , a dad ca n't gift him an inferior grade .	1
I own a home remodeling business , and I 've owned this saw for over 3 years . I have other miter saws that I use specifically as `` chop '' saws for rough framing duties ; however , when I need to do finish work or flooring , I always reach for this saw . It is rock solid , durable and very accurate , and seems to be owned by every trim carpenter I know . Sure , 10 '' , 12 '' and 15 '' miter saws are easier to use for fat crown mouldings , but who wants to lug those things around all week . For its versatility , portability , and overall quality ... Get This Saw ! ! !	1
I just built a 650 sq ft deck with this bad boy . I already know its great for trim but cutting a 1 '' X 6 '' on a 45 degree angle was when i needed a slider . it made probably close to 500 cuts in Ipe lumber which we know is some hard wood . Oddly enough the dust colector worked pretty well also which is not something you see everyday on a slider.Highly recommend12/5/2006 - Update - I just added the IRWIN 3061001 Miter Saw Laser Guide . fits perfect . Read my review of that product also .	1
This fit my HF band saw perfectly . I had to drill and tap 2 holes on the out feed side of the table for the read fence guide . The pointer and scale even match .	1
I installed this fence on my RIDGID 14 '' bandsaw . It went on with no problems although I too had to drill a hole in the bottom of the fence about an inch back from the factory hole which mounts the rear rail slider . Not a big deal , it is designed for a Jet after all , which apparently has a slightly longer table than the RIDGID.After putting it all together , I had it all squared up in a matter of a few minutes . The adjustments are pretty basic , mostly just tilting the rails a bit until the fence is square with the table , then adjusting it square with the miter gauge slots.For the money , it seems you ca n't go wrong with this fence !	1
Very good rip fence . It fits the jet saw well . After you install It you will sill will need to aline it . It has great repeatability.Just like car ads the miter gauge is a option , and is not included . Just read the whole ad .	1
This same fence came standard on my 21 '' 3 HP Jet bandsaw . I 've had it for over a year now and it has worked well for me . Granted , I do n't use my band saw a lot and I never had a fence on my 14 '' bandsaw , so I 've nothing to compare it to except the Beismeyer on my table saw . It ' not as hefty as that , but is sturdy and accurate and for that price I think a good buy .	1
This fence is basically a miniature version of the fence found on the Jet 10 & quot ; contractors style saw . It is built tough and easy to adust . Once it is adjusted , it stays that way . The fence scale is also extremely accurate and has a micro adjust pointer which can be used to bring your cuts accuracy to within a 32nd of an inch . By far , the best bandsaw fence I have seen and used .	1
I bought it , I put it on , it works and I have n't thought of it since . I have a few months of use on it now and I am happy that I bought it . I do n't have another bandsaw rip fence to compare it to , but I do n't need anything else .	1
I have a Ridgid 14 '' bandsaw , which is the new orange/black version , not the older grey saw . I 've been looking for a decent rip fence with reasonable price for a while . After some reseach , it seems that this fence would fit the Ridgid saw with some slight modification . And since Amazonwarehouse was offering an unbeliveable deal , I snatched one quickly.The fence arrived within two days . From an earlier review , it seems that one would need to drill a whole in the mounting bracket to fit the Ridgid saw . Much to my surpise , this was not needed for my saw . The holes line up perfectly , and the all the hardware that came with it fits the Ridgid saw perfectly . It 's as if this was made for the saw . I guess the new orange/black Ridgid share the exact same dimensions as the Jet model , even the threading of the hole in the table is the same ! It took about 20 min to install . Once it 's operational , I made a few test cuts , and then spend the next hour fine tuning it . It is now perfectly square and pararllel to the blade . The fence is quite sturdy , and glides smoothly on its track . For the price and its precision fitment for my saw , I can not find a better alternative .	1
Like Hangtree , I have a rigid bandsaw and could n't find a fence anywhere . This fence fits with only one modification . The rigid table is about one inch too narrow . I drilled one hole on the fence itself , now it fits great . The resaw guide is a bit too far back as well , but I do n't do much resaw anyways . This fence is very sturdy and will make rigid and jet saw owners real happy .	1
Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw 's 16 '' x16 '' work table -- falls short . I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail ( making it un-returnable ) before realizing that the fence would n't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is , of course , not the fault of the manufacturer . It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported ( and I 'll continue to use it ) . The indicator over the front rail 's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it 's actually indicating.Easy to assemble , nice packaging , and quick shipping . Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits .	1
I would have given it 5 stars but the resaw guide is not very tall and I will have to make my own . I love the guide and do n't think that I would give it up . It was easy to install and adjust and has not needed a reset . I have used it so many ways and it have not given me a bad cut .	1
Cruisin with power tools . One can never have enough . Forgot about how important it was to control the dust ( MDF ) stands for & quot ; man-made dust factory & quot ; . Although I could have used a larger unit , I can only use one machine at a time . It has got to be better than a shop vac . It is definitely a whole lot queiter . Static pressure is lower but volume is tremendously greater . I might be able to find what is left of my basement yet ! If you love wood , than get one of these before you change your mind because of the dust .	1
This was the second ever Jet tool I bought about two years ago . It had been serving my home shop very well . I have not had any problem with it whats-so-ever . It always starts when I need it . I had couple of times the dust was up to the neck and this thing was still going . It is pretty powerful for its size and that class of dust colloectors as I understand . I made my own 5 micron bag and plan on making a bigger lower bag or add a & quot ; window & quot ; to it . My shop is 10'X12 ' and this thing does not take much of room . So it 's recommended if you have a small shop and do n't run more than one tool at a time .	1
I brought this collector sight unseen based on the reviews and am pleased with the purchase . Setup is a snap , performance is flawless , and the workmanship first rate . Even the manual is what I expect from a power tool ... detailed and well versed in the available accessories.Buy a hose kit or two since none is supplied.You 'll be pleased with the purchase .	1
To cut to the chase , before getting into a lengthier discussion about the dust collector , I give a qualified high recommendation to the machine to a beginning wood worker that has nothing else for dust collection.I purchased the DC-650 when they still made them in the blue paint scheme and used it exclusively until the purchase of an Oneida 800 CFM cyclone dust collector about 3 years later . For those of you who already know about static pressure and CFM , please skip to the next paragraph . This next part is not to compare how well either device works , but merely to inform about some of the basic science behind how air moves and to further describe the real operating effectiveness of the machine . The DC-650 functions at 650 CFM with clean ( or mildly seasoned ) bags as supplied . Also , the top and bottom bag must be empty of any dust or chips to be near 650 . The last major part that affects the machine 's ability to reach the 650 mark is the length and type of ducting/hose attaching the unit to the tool supplying the debris for collection . For example , typical spiral wire hose is very restrictive . A long length can be even more restrictive . This restriction is known as static pressure . Increasing or higher static pressure means a decreasing or lowered CFM when based on a non-loaded fan static pressure to start . Bottom line is the DC-650 pulls 650 CFM at zero inches of static pressure . The 800 CFM cyclone dust collector I have hard piped in my shop with all metal smooth pipes and long sweep elbows pulls 800 CFM at 8 '' inches of static pressure . While it 's only 150 CFM more when reading the box labels , when the going gets tough the Oneida-800 can keep up with my 15 '' planer like it 's nothing . The DC-650 starts bogging almost right away because of the introduced static pressure restriction , flexible hose and the bottom bag starts loading with chips thereby reducing the surface area of filtration which further restricts and reduces CFM.I kept the DC-650 on the side for occasional use , but found that the supplied bags leave a lot to be desired for filtration . I would highly recommend purchasing replacement bags that filter down to 1 micron as soon as you can afford them . Otherwise you 'll find a fine layer of dust settles on surfaces in the shop when you 're done working . That also means you 're breathing that fine dust . In my case , I purchased a pleated filter very recently . That boosts the surface area of the filter , decreases the size of particle filtered and allows the machine to breath better in order to keep it closer to the 650 mark . I also use it to clean up the shop floor now rather than sweeping because it sucks so well.If you already have a Shop Vac , even with a 5 gallon separator , this will blow it away . I would also highly recommend adding a chip separator to this machine when working with planers or jointers and keep the pipe or hose as straight and as short as possible . Happy woodworking !	1
I 've had mine for years and it works great . I use primarily at the Miter Saw since that 's the only tool in my shop that is stationary . For any small shop it works great . This used to be my DC for my basement shop before I moved into the garage . The only problem I had with it was on my belt/disc sander . It did n't pick up the dust that well but the there was roughly 25 feet of hose and PVC to go thru . Not the DC 's fault . Overall , I 'd recommend it for any small shop	1
For years I had been kidding myself by hooking up my Fein Turbo II vacuum to major power tools such as a tablesaw and planer and thinking that was enough . Even though that is a super powerful vac and it did a pretty decent job all things considered , I still made a mess and breathed a ton of dust . So I decided it was time to upgrade to a proper dust collector . I shopped around and finally ended up buying this Jet 650 cfm unit ... and I am glad I did.I have a small but very well equipped woodshop where I regularly generate alot of dust/chips . Between the tablesaw , band saw , radial arm saw , miter saw , jointer , and planer , I can create a big mess in a short time.Because my shop is small - the main area is just 12 ft by 19 ft - I decided to run a 4 inch metal duct down one wall and hard connect several of my more stationary tools . Because I had to run the duct near the ceiling , the fact that this Jet DC-650 has an inlet that points upward made it much easier and more efficient than the other units with lower inlet ports . I also included a waist-high connection to the ductwork halfway down the main wall so I could easily connect tools on mobile bases out in the center of the room . By not having to move the dust collector unit to and from each tool , I not only save time but precious elbow-room out in the middle of my shop.Now to the nitty-gritty . In use this collector is surprisingly quiet . The low whirring sound made by the motor is not hard on the ears ( or the neighbors ) . As for dust collecting performance , I estimate that the longest run that my collector has to pull through is about 20 feet ( a combination of 4 inch metal duct and 4 inch flex tube ) . By closing all of the blast gates except the one on the tool I am using , I get EXCELLENT results . I can break a full sheet of plywood down into cabinet parts on the tablesaw and have maybe a couple tablespoons of dust inside the saw cabinet and none on the floor when I am done ! In case you are wondering , I have a DeWalt 746 hybrid saw . I also am getting amazing results when I use this Jet DC-650 with my Delta 22-580 planer and older Jet jointer . Knowing that poor dust collection is usually a reality on a miter saw , I have to say that I am happy with the 75 % ( or so ) efficiency that I get with this unit on that saw . The only real disappointment is my inability to efficiently collect dust from my old Craftsman radial arm saw . The Jet DC-650 does n't have the oomph to do an adequate job on that tool , but that is more likely a result of the ( poor ) dust shroud on the radial arm than any shortcoming in the collector.Overall I find the Jet DC-650 to be plenty powerful enough for a home shop where only one dust generating tool is in use at a time . The bag changing is a bit of a hassle ( as it is on most affordable units ) , but its not really a deal breaker either . The quiet yet powerful operation easily earns this tool 5 stars in my book .	1
This collector does a fine job . It has great power and makes little noise . I ran hundreds of feet of hose and bought all kinds of blast gates and attachments for everything I could think of . It works but only for one tool at a time . I guess I 'm trying to do too much with it . It will run all day without a complaint . I bought a remote start for it though . I think it 's a good thing to have . If you have a small shop you ca n't beat this unit . It has a little more power than some of the others in this price range .	1
I just punched 60 1/2 & quot ; by 3/4 & quot ; deep mortises in rock maple , and the Jet performed like a champ even with the chisels supplied . No complaints so far .	1
I 've built several projects with this mortiser over the past year . It has done a great job . The stop mechanism works great , it 's sturdy , and the chisels that come with it are plenty sharp . I 've built about 4 tables with this machine , and I am currently building a cabinetmaker 's bench , which requires me to bore mortises about 3 inches deep . Since I am using poplar for my base it did n't bog down the motor like maple would , however , the base was n't wide enough to accomodate the large legs . No biggie : Rockler sells an extension table for this model that I am considering buying.I wish they would have included mounting hardware ( like my Delta drill press ) , so that I could mount it without any further trips to the hardware store .	1
first i must say this is the only mortiser i have used.the machine was easy to set up 10 minutes from box to running . i got a free jet chiesel set with purchase.the first thing i played with was popular cut sweet , next scrap cherry a cake walk ( 1/4 mortise made ) .the only thing i see is seal the base ( which is mdf ) . i ordered chiesels from lee valley for the dresses project i got this for.saw final word for the average woodworker/weekend warrior a+ machineoh yes as stated before i got free chiesels , free prime delivery fast and well packaged , good price and a stellar toy.if you dont have one put on your bucket list .	1
This the first Jet tool I bought and own when I started making this mission style bedframe ( On cover of Jeff Miller 's Beds ) about 6 months ago . Because this tool , I bought two more Jet tools so far ( 650 dust collector and the 6 & quot ; jointer ) . This mortiser is everything I wanted to do with mortise . I made 132 mortises for the slats on the bedframe that turned out beautifully . I am making two matching nightstands and a mission style coffee table . The three chisel bits come with the machine along worth more than $ 100 . I looked at other mortisers before buying this one , they all require you to buy extra things to get started . The setup was easy , changing bits was a snap as well . I mounted the mortiser on a piece of thick plywood siting on top of my workbench . When I had to work on thick stocks ( 6-7 & quot ; ) , I just took out the three mounting screws and rotated 180 degrees . That gives me another inch or so distance from the plywood base . It makes very clean cut . But sometimes it sounds pretty lound if the bit rubs the chisel , and you have to clean the dust fast enough to avoid burning when making deep cuts .	1
This is a handy little tool ! It makes nice , neat mortises if you take the time to set up correctly . For straight-forward mortising , it 's a snap . More challenging situations require some ingenuity and patience , but it 's worth the trouble . Glad I read the reviews ... .mine was bent in shipping also . The motor fan housing was mashed right down on the fan blades . Just took the housing off and laid it flat on a table and carefully bent it back where it belonged . No problem . They do need to pack it more carefully .	1
I purchased this mortiser a few weeks ago and have made many practice mortises and a few real ones in a piece of furniture I am building . I ca n't speak to the durability of this product , but I can talk about everything else . It came promptly from Amazon , no parts were missing . Setup was simple . I 've seen some people complain that the platform is n't parallel to the fence . This is a total non-issue . All you need are a few pieces of paper to act as shims , a t-square , and about 5 minutes ... and a phillips head screw driver . I took off the platform , squared it to the fence , and added a few pieces of paper until it was square , then tightened it back down checking again to make sure it was still square . Setting the machine up took about 10 minutes total , then installing and squaring a chisel took about 5 minutes . I am giving this 4 stars because my 1/2 inch chisel just did n't work well at all . I would give 4.5 if I could recognizing that most of what I paid for was the machine and not the chisels , but I would have expected all 3 chisels to have been in top shape . The 1/2 inch kept burning my wood , I increased the auger lead and it worked a lot better but still not great . I 'm going to be buying a new 1/2 '' chisel . The action on the rack and pinion lever was really stiff at first , I added some WD-40 and it got a lot better . Really easy to use , really smooth , I would advise facing the opening in the chisel forward instead of to the side . I am now looking at buying a Jet bandsaw just because I appreciate the quality in my mortiser .	1
Although the Jet has the same limitations as most other benchtop motisers , it is one of the best out there . It feels solid , it does a decent job of cutting mortises , and the motor has held up well . The supplied chisels are decent too . It could use a better fence positioning mechanism , the hold down need to be redesigned ( preferably like the Multico ) , and I 'd like to see a clamp that holds the work to the fence . I returned a Fisch mortiser for this one.I 've used the Jet to cut more than 800 mortises in western red cedar without a problem . More mortises in oak , mahogany , hard maple . It does have a tendency to burn the harder woods , but it does n't clog , and it does n't stall .	1
If you utilize mortise and tenon joints and have been creating them with a router or a drill press with a mortising attachment , you will really enjoy this product . There are several positive attributes about this tool and one negative.Positive Attributes:1 ) HP is quite adequate.2 ) The chisels and bits I received were very sharp . They believe that they would serve the non-professional well . I usually use Clico bits , but I recommend that you at least try these before you purchase an expensive set . You might be as pleasantly suprised as I was and you could save yourself some money.3 ) Fit and finish is very good.4 ) The column mounts to the base structure with capscrews . The Jet engineers were thinking , because they provided two assembly hole patterns . The second hole pattern allows you to turn the head around 180 degrees . This will enable you to mortise stock one or two inches taller than normal designed capacity without a major setup changes.5 ) Good quality for the price.One Negative attribute : If you have read any of the reviews of mortise machines , you will notice a common issue with bench top mortise machines is the hold down fixture . Jet is considered to have one of the better hold down fixtures . If you have used drill press with a mortise attachment you have lived the pain of setup and hold down . This machine is by far a huge improvement over a drill press attachment . However , this hold down fixture could also be improved . Mine is not parallel with the base surface or square with the back fence . This allows the stock to rack slightly when withdrawing the chisel from the mortise . It does n't take much movement of the wood to bind the chisel in the mortise.Note : I am upgrading to the Powermatics floor model because of the improved hold down , the translating table , and the larger chisel capacity . I am very happy with my Jet mortiser and do regret purchasing it . I just want more.Operator errors to avoid : A ) If you try force the chisel and bit , you run the risk of elevating the temperature of your cutting tools and ruining the temper . Try to keep the wood from smoking.B ) If you force the cut faster than the helix on the bit can remove the chips , you can induce too much heat into the cutting tools and could stall the motor.C ) The HP is fine . If the wood is smoking , slow down.D ) Lastly , it seems too obvious , but be prepared to mount this to a table or some other ridgid structure before use .	1
I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using . This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it . Assembly was easy . If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating , this tool will cut perfect mortises every time . This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine . It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening .	1
I 'm a Delta fan and read the earlier Amazon reviews on JET'smortiser . I passed over the Delta model because of these reviews . TheJET is quickly and easily set up and it runs smoothly . Very nicely designed . Adjustments are simple and quick . The hold-down should have a horizontal adjustment to prevent binding on the upstroke , but that 's a minor matter ...	1
Based upon the build quality of my other Jet shop tools and on Amazon reviews , I selected this machine . I needed a mortising machine for a project of building 12 chairs . There are lots of rave reviews already out there , so I wo n't repeat all the good stuff . Just believe it ! What I will do is to defend this little machine 's only few weak spots , or at least the criticisms in the reviews . The main one is about the table being too small , and because it is made of MDF , `` cheap . '' Well , the table is actually the cast iron base , and it has a piece of MDF bolted down to it to protect your chisels should you drill clear through a piece of wood . Others complain the table is too small . Not exactly sure why you would need it to be any bigger , but I had no issues with that doing 144 mortises in some pretty strange shapes of wood . The hold-down is , in fact , poorly designed , but it 's such and easy fix that it is laughable . I just cut two small wedges of wood and installed them on the bottoms of the two hold-down arms ( with a wrap of masking tape ) so that now they press down evenly on the workpiece instead of only on the side toward the machine . End of difficulty extracting the chisel from the workpiece.For some of my pieces , to get them placed in the same spot each time , I used a drill-press vise bolted to the cast-iron table . I clamped a stop onto my work table to locate the end of the workpiece and the little vise did the rest.The three chisels that ship with this machine are incredibly sharp and worked perfectly . ( I only used two of them . ) The motor 's power is more than ample , the machine is designed so that the pull-handle can be locked into whatever position that is the most advantageous for the situation . It does take a hefty pull , so that 's important.For its low price , this is a terrific machine . I highly recommend it . BTW , it arrived from Amazon well-packaged and in perfect condition . And no , I did n't get paid to write this review ; I just like to give praise when it 's due ! I 'm giving 5 stars in spite of my only criticism , the hold-down , because it was such an easy fix , and also because had I wanted a more `` perfect '' mortiser , I could have paid $ 1000 for a professional machine . This is a tool I will not use every day , and for the price , it is perfect . I thought it was actually fun to use ! Imagine drilling square holes !	1
The Jet mortiser sets-up easily . There are only a few pieces to assemble . Plug it in and turn it on . The chuck is easy to reach . It is also very quiet , the only significant noise coming from the auger bit inside the chisel if it rubs.The chisels that came with it have been great so far . Nice clean cuts.This and the Delta tenoning jig make building mortise and tenon joinery furniture easy . Cut your mortises with this , then use the mortise to set the size of the tenon on the tenoning jig . Very easy to reproduce the cuts for each leg/stile and rail.It can really improve your work if you use mortises .	1
First of all , I must tell you that I am very glad to finally have a table saw . I have been shopping for over two years and was not really sure I wanted the Jet until the Christmas tool sale at Lowe 's . Had it not been for that I ca n't say that I would have committed to this saw had it still been at full price.Actually , the Jet was my first pick but I had since developed some doubts about them . The bargain price lured me in ( much better than here , ) but if you 're like me you want to know what I like and dislike about it.First the bad , in order of personal annoyance:1 . As I had stated , I have upgraded with the cast wings from Jet ( Big $ $ $ $ ) but in the end it was worth it . 'Nough said.2 . The fence and miter gauge . They are both just OK , but to get real accuracy you will need to spend at least another $ 400- $ 500 to replace both ... the cheapest ( ... ) Or for a total of $ 950-1000.00+/- ( saw included ) for good controllable , stable set ups . ( edit : Though I had come to terms with it after much playing around , but found a newer Micro-Adjust fence on eBay . An improvement to be sure . I 'd still replace the miter gauge , ( Delta seems to make a nice one that does n't cost too much ) but it is usable as long as you check it carefully after EVERY adjustment . Do n't rely on the scale or the `` flip-stop '' ( it bends easily ) to do it for you . It wo n't ! Trash the `` JetFence. '' 3 . The dust collection `` hood '' stinks ! I will replace this too . ( Edit : I made my own . See my review of the Jet hood # JW1005 and I 'll tell you how. ) 4 . The safety splitter and anti-kickback paws are nearly useless . They are difficult to install and uninstall when necessary , real knuckle busters . OK , we all know that most people who actually USE their table saws remove these items most of the time , but I would use them more often ( I 'm a safety guy . I like my fingers right where they are ) if it were n't for the time and effort it takes to uninstall them when I need a dado blade , or am running 4 '' tall material through the blade . You can replace these with aftermarket quick release/quick setup items for around $ 430.00 . What a bargain . } : - ( That 's nearly as much as the saw originally cost.5 . The drive belt : Before I made any important cuts with this tool I immediately replaced the drive belt with a PowerTwist Plus A20-60 . My cheap Jet now runs smoother than my neighbors ' more expensive Delta . ( Please see my review of this product for complete details . ) It 's WELL worth the $ 30.00 investment.6 . Mostly the manual was enough for setup . As others here have said , I set mine up in about four hours except a few areas where I found it lacking : It was a little vague in the area of converting the saw/motor to 230 volt operation , like what current ( amps ) it would draw at 230 ? Should I install a 20 amp plug , receptacle and breaker , or a 30 amp ? ( Answer : Install the 20 amp if you convert ) ; Also a few more suggestions about lining up and leveling the side extensions would 've been nice , like how to bend them more accurately ; and finally , not all of the various hardware bags were clearly marked and I found myself guessing ... correctly as it turns out , at what hardware the manual was referring to.Note : For those who have read other customer reviews here , mine did come with it 's own blade . It 's a 40T , carbide tipped , and it ai n't bad either ! It does leave a little to be desired in the cross-cutting department . I do get some tear-out with it , but it 's OK . I will replace it with a better one eventually , but it is quite good for a `` get acquainted '' type blade . ( I did ! See Freud TK406 , F60T . For $ 35.00 you ca n't beat it with a Forrest . ) The good:1 . The motor is strong and starts , and pulls evenly to full speed , and can be converted to 230v operation.2 . The arbor assembly is strong and smooth ( gear , not belt ) operating.3 . The blade ( see above comments. ) 4 . For the most part the saw was easy to setup.Suggestion : No matter how much room you have or do n't have , get a mobile base . Jets ' own works well and is easy to set up but is a little clumsy in actual use . The Jet base has four individual wheels ( back ) /casters ( front ) to lock and unlock which is not so convenient when you have 30 , or 52 '' fence rails to get around , and it does n't allow for easy side-to-side movement either . On the other hand , my neighbor recently set up a Ridged Herc-u-lift on his Delta ( he said , `` $ 50 ! '' . ) Four casters that come up all the way when not in use and a one foot pedal operation . I am not a fan of the `` Big Orange '' but I should have done this.My recommendation : If you are set on getting the Jet , get this model with the cast iron wings ( suffix : '' CW2 '' Usually about $ 100 more , and it will cost you a LOT more ( $ 250.00+ freight ) later to do it as I did ) and if the funds allow , the Xacta fence though the new Micro-Adjust fence from Jet is an improvement.If you are cutting a lot of sheet material plan on building or buying a side table extension and an outfeed table . They 're easy to build yourself and make a nice first project . ( See Rockler for hardware kits . ) I hope this helps you decide and Good Luck with your own dreams !	1
For the price I do n't see how you can beat this saw . I 've been researching table saws for about two months . Knowing that I would either go with a Jet or a Powermatic I decided on the Jet . Ca n't beat the price for double cast iron extensions.Figuring I would buy a good quality Bes or Vega fence later I decided that the table was were the money would be best spent.After a four hour take my time no issue setup I decided to check a few cuts before making any critical adjustments . This thing is about as square as you would ever need straight out of the box at .003 '' out . That 's even with a stock Jet fence and a Dewalt 7150 blade.New fence can wait blades are now the direction . I would recommend to any weekend wood warrior , even an experienced cabinet maker.PS . Respect your purchase get a mobile cart . At 300lbs . you and your saw will both appreciate it . Room or no room .	1
This saw was perfect right out of the box . No adjustments necessary . I also like the fence . I recently completed a full kitchen load of cabinets and the fence stayed accurate all the way through . As a matter of fact , I only had to adjust the fence once ( when I first got the saw ) and have n't had to touch it since . Someone mentioned on one of the ratings that the blade guard has to be removed in order to change the saw blade . NOT SO ! I do n't know where he is going wrong . You only need to crank up the blade up to its deepest cutting position and remove the insert . Very easy . If you are in the market for a contractors style saw , you ca n't go wrong with this one . Also , worth mentioning is the great Jet Service available . They will take any question you have and treat you with respect . This company is known for their service , so that should come as no surprise .	1
This was my first Jet purchase.Runs very good . I never liked the Jet fence though , it seems a little short and I wish it had more support on the outfeed side.I ended up buying a xacta fence II which is made by HTC . Was like night and day.This functions almost like a cabinet saw , at least in my dreams with these additions : I replaced the v-belt with a link belt which made the saw quite and a bit smoother . I also replaced the manufacturer supplied trunion bolts in the saw with the PALS ( Precision Alignment System ) which allows you to micro adjust your blade 's alignment.Assembly as all my Jet purchases have been a breeze . Until it 's time to align the belt and apply tension to the belt . That is the tricky part with a one-man assembly .	1
I have the older version of this same saw with the stamped metal wings and in the old blue-grey color paint job . But these comments are still valid for this saw.This is a great saw for home use , for a hobbiest , and even for a low production professional . If you were a pro cabinet builder and you run your saw all day long then you would want one of those enclosed base table saws with more horse power . But I have yet to do anything with my saw that requires more horse power than it can put out.I 've replaced the existing drive belt with about 5 feet of link belt . If a solid drive belt sits in the same position for a long time ( like if you do n't use your saw for a few weeks or months ) then the drive belt will develop a kink where it goes around the drive pullies . When you start the saw back up you 'll get a lot of vibration . If you will have periods of non-use then a link belt would be a good investment.I also had an electrician follow the instructions in the user 's manual for changing the saw from 110 to 200 volts . It draws half as many amps and ( i 'm told ) that moter will last longer.Get yourself a really good blade . You can get a Forrest Woodworker II blade right here on Amazon and you 'll be glad you did . You 'll be amazed at the difference a high quality blade will make.Before you run the saw follow the setup instructions to make sure the blade is aligned to the miter slots . I checked mine with a dial indicator accurate to 0.0005 '' and my saw was perfect right out of the box.Also follow the instructions to make sure the fence is parallel to the blade . I used shims cut from a soda can to adjust the fence slightly . Then shim the fence to make the face absolutly 90 deg to the table . By the way , the fence on this saw is wonderful . It 's very accurate and repeatable . It 's easy to adjust and it locks down solid . I 've never had it move during a cut.USE THE BLADE GUARD AND SPLITTER ! Although most people seem to take the stock blade guard off , you will be vastly safer if you leave it on . The stock blade guard that comes with the saw has a splitter with built in anti-kickback pawls and it 's easy to remove if you need to make dado cuts . Leave the guard in place.Level the saw on it 's frame , read the safety instructions one more time and start her up . My saw can pass the `` nickle test '' where you balance a nickle on it 's edge on one of the saw 's table wings , start the saw up and if the saw runs smoothly enough the nickle wo n't even fall over when the motor starts.Now , get yourself some push sticks , eye protection , and hearing protection and use them EVERY TIME . The quality of this saw is such that it will last you a lifetime . Stay safe and enjoy it and you 'll pass it down to your grandkids .	1
This table saw with it 's fold down wings is just what you need for when you do n't have a lot of room to move around in .	1
This is a great saw . the table is awesome . I like the fence better than the & quot ; premium & quot ; biesmeier knockoff jet makes , too heavy hard to slide . The Simple jet fence is perfect for 90percent of the stuff anyone cuts . Vega fence is best . ( I am sure there are others excaliber etc . which are fine too . ) This thing is heavy , not very portable beware of thinking of jobsite use . Top heavy as well not good moving in rough areas ... A person could use this saw for a long time , I am obsessive , and purchased a Robland x31 for the shop and now this guy sits , but it is far nicer than delta , I have had , craftsman ( cringe flex shaft drive ) or any little makita 40lb deal . I am used to a 3hp motor , and I have a tough time expecting this saw to deal with the speed I feed but thin stock , and sheet goods it is fantastic . I use a 7 1/4 inch blade usually for most stuff the 10 inch bogs down . As with all saws of this ilk . Good luck ! you will likely enjoy this saw .	1
I put off this purchase for quite awhile because I did n't & # 34 ; think & # 34 ; I really needed a spindle sander , well I was wrong . This sander is great and did I say its quiet . it has to be one if not the quietest machines in my shop . I looked at the Grizzly and the Jet model before I pulled the trigger and i 'm glad I purchased the Jet . I own both Grizzly and other Jet products and love them both , but I think Jet 's & # 34 ; fit and finish & # 34 ; is better than Grizzly and you just can not go wrong with Jet tools standard 5 year warranty . They build a very solid product and stand behind it , and thats a hard thing to find in today 's market . The sander has a 1hp motor with a sight glass in the gearbox to keep an eye on the fluid level , as I was quite surprised this thing hold close to two quarts of 90 weight gear oil , its a quality product that was worth every penny . If I had one complaint , it would be the lack of a 26mm wrench to tighten the nuts on top of the spindles , but other than that no complaints . Thanks Jet for another quality product in my shop .	1
This is such a great addition to the 14 inch Jet bandsaw that I 'm surprised Jet does n't just make it standard on all their 14 inch saws . I was able to install it by myself , and I 'm an old guy . I rigged a rope from the ceiling to support the top arm of the saw , disconnected the bolt , and lowered it to the floor . After that , the installation goes very easy and straightforward . Putting the top arm back on was the opposite of taking it off , but be sure that you can tie off the rope so you can use both hands to tighten the bolt.The only negative is the blade that ships with the riser block - it 's not very good . Buy yourself a selection of Timber Wolf blades to use for resawing.Having the extra resaw capability if really nice and increases the usefulness of the saw . I recommend this accessory .	1
I recently purchased a Jet 14 inch closed base bandsaw . It works great . Before I ordered any blades for it , I decided to get the Riser block first . The Riser block increases your cutting height from 6 to 12 inches . Your band saw blade size will then go from 93 1/2 inches to 105 inches . If you need this , get it before you buy any blades because your old blades will be too short . This is not an item that you can take off at any time . It is a permanent option . The Riser Block was very easy to install . You remove the big bolt that holds the top wheel support the the bottom and add the Riser block and use the new bolt to secure it . The kit comes with a metal rear blade guard . The one that came with my saw was plastic . The only tricky part was lifting off the upper wheel and reattaching it . Since it is fastened at the back , it wanted to tip forward . With me Riser installed , I can resaw fire wood and thick beams into boards . Think of all the flavors of wood you can now use for projects .	1
Installing this upgrade was a snap . The instruction sheet was barely useful , but the installation is simple . Alignment is unaffected by the riser and the increased resaw capacity is great.The blade supplied did n't hold up , but with a good blade my Jet 14 '' cuts beautifully with the riser in place .	1
I got this kit and it took me 15 minutes to disassemble , install and reassemble my Ridgid saw . Literally . I do n't know why others have had such a hard time . The wrenching is tricky and you need a big one , but c'mon now ! For my saw this was an EXACT match ( the Ridgid branded one was $ 150 ! What ? ? ? ) If you are not mechanical or not very strong , you 'll need help , but if you are ... Just get it ! I got another for the Jet saw at my company 's shop and it unsurprisingly worked perfectly.Completely recommended .	1
I added the riser block to the 14 & quot ; closed stand Jet bandsaw . The installation was easy , the instructions straightforward . With the added height , I can now resaw some serious wood ! Just a note , if you are thinking of buying this , you will need all new blades . The standard ones will not fit after you put in the riser .	1
If you do a lot of resaw or as in my case , make a lot of bandsaw box 's this is a great addition . As other 's have mentioned its a two person job , but the instructions and materials are top notch.I would also reccommend that you add Carter type guides to your saw at the same time . These really help with the resaw aspect and are a must for the small blades used in making bandsaw box 's . The included blade was n't much but I didnt think it would be , so no dissappointment there . The rest of the parts were good quality and everthing fit well . Took about twenty minutes to install and a few more minutes of adjusting . Thanks to the other reviewer for the tip on reinstalling the power cord . With a Timber Wolf 3/4 '' resaw blade I can now square up larger pieces of `` firewood '' to use for my bandsaw box 's and it also enables me to get away from the 6x6 dimension that was my standard . I would reccommend this add on to anyone wishing to increase the size of material they can work with .	1
Very nice addition to recreate the standard Jet bandsaw into something much more versatile , and price was great . Amazon shipped really quickly even with Supersaver . The instructions are generic for all the bandsaws in this stable ( wood , metal , meat , Jet , Powermatic , etc . ) and some of the instructions do not apply to the Jet . Luckily Jet tech support is pretty easy to get on the phone . Do n't bother with the blade that comes in the kit -- have your own on hand . I followed Lonnie Bird 's recommendations in The Bandsaw Book and have been delighted.I installed the riser at the time I got the saw , so it was no problem as a one-man operation . After reading the other comments I was surprised at this . Given that this is my first bandsaw , it was really pretty simple except for the ! ? # & ! ! @ * ? ! power switch relocation . Would it be so hard to put a one sheet addendum into the box ? The guy at tech support was nice about it.The thing that frustrates me about the finished product is that I have to readjust the cooling blocks if I change the height of the guide assembly significantly . That is , the post does n't move perpendicular to the table . I 've tried everything to look for something out of alignment but ca n't find it.All in all , this really cuts you loose with resaw capacity . Too bad it 's not standard equipment .	1
this is a replacement for a hand me down i had . works very well . i have not had any issues at all .	1
I 'm a bandsaw rookie , so I 'll make no promises that I know what I 'm talking about . That being said , I lean on these reviews for my purchases , hopefully this will be useful for someone else.The Delta v. Jet debate was settled by a clearance of this saw at Menards ! It seems that the folks unhappy with the Delta thought the Jet was a better machine . So when I can get it for less than the Delta , decision made.1 . Pros : I really enjoy putting a new toy together . The Jet assembly was nearly flawless . I even had my 2 1/2 year old helping ( true - I 've got pitures ) . About halfway through the stand assembly I figured out that you can make a shelf on the leg braces ( 17x20 is perfect ) . Almost a two man job ( two year olds do n't count ) . It is HEAVY and AWKWARD . All of the Jet assemblies were put together well , the blade tracked correctly and needed no adjustment.2 . Cons : Lower guide blocks are really tough to reach and adjust ( all of the saws this way ? ) A couple of the tapped holes had paint in the threads , just an annoyance , but not a big deal.With a good double check , crossed fingers and a smile you flip the switch and ... ..a beautiful Fathers ' Day whirrrrr .	1
This is my first bandsaw . It 's pretty solid and easy to assemble . It needed some tuning before using it to get it to cut right but once that was done it 's working great . The picture Amazon shows is not the same design as the bandsaw I got , however . The motor is to the side and it 's not a 2 '' dust chute but a 4 '' on the side of the saw .	1
Way-back-when the first really good small band saw came out we bought it and loved it ( the R-brand which is now the D-brand ) . A while later JET came onto the market with a 14 '' but being reluctant to change something that was n't broke we kept our R-brand for many more years . One day someone offered us a lot of gold for our whole woodshop and the old enclosed base band saw went with it . Later we started a new shop that produced models and prototypes for other shops . When outfitting the shop and generally being in like with our wallets slightly more than our machines we considered the JET 14 '' for the first time . After a few trials and a lot of jabber on the jungle telegraph we took the chance . At that time the open base was a new thing . While not as svelte looking as the enclosed base we soon found that it was easier to clean up after and we could store stuff underneath - valuable space for those once-in-awhile jigs . It also seemed to run quieter without those flat sheetmetal walls . About the only thing the D-brand has over the JET is the quality of the motor but that was not enough to convince us to part with the extra money . The JET 14 '' has very good everything else and is a valued piece of equipment in the shop . Of all the 14 '' saws it is clearly amongst the best - which is good as it is also one of the least expensive . Hints : Buy the frame extension - it does not weaken the frame measurably and you will enjoy the added working height . If you do not buy it now you will accumulate blades which will not fit if you buy it later . Use a 3 '' 45 degree PVC elbow modified to a clamshell to fit over the lower guide and blade to provide better dust extraction . Keeps the sawdust off the lower wheel . Wear safety glasses . Pay attention : this is not a machine where you want your attention wandering unless your goal is to receive disability payments . Somewhat enigmatically I still wish we had the closed base . It looks better .	1
I mainly cut MDF , and am always looking for blades that can cut it cleanly . Well , this is one such blade .	1
This blade is amazing . I bought it for ripping 3/4 '' birch ply to be used for a bookcase . I used it in a Milwaukee circular saw with an edge guide . This blade produced absolutely no tearout or chipping . The edge was finished as good , if not better than my table saw can do.Do n't bother with a plywood blade . In my experience , they get hot and burn your material . This blade has made me a Freud man for life .	1
This blade is excellent ! Very smooth cuts on birch cabinet grade plywood .	1
When I put this blade on my old skil saw , I thought for sure someone had switched saws on me . If your skil saw is giving you any difficulty at all , try switching to this blade and see how it should be done ! I 've been cutting some 1/4 & quot ; oak finish beaded paneling and I do n't even have to turn it face down . My old saw blade would have chipped and torn out much of the oak finish if I tried to saw it face up . Not this blade . I rubbed the bottom of the saw with wax paper and away I went . Not a mark to be seen . Great blade !	1
I purchased this blade for my elderly Skilsaw . I have a very small shop and have to cut sheet goods outside , under the carport , before I can get them into my basement shop . I 've always had to cut my piece 's oversized and then trim them on the table saw to get nice finished edges , but this blade gives me a nice finished edge without the extra steps . I have used it on Oak veneer ply and melamine sheets and the chip out is very , very minimal and stalling and binding are non existant . I understand that the teflon coated version of this blade is even better . I find that hard to believe as this little blade is simply amazing . This is the third Freud saw blade I have purchased and they all perform beyond my expectations . I also use Freud blades on my table saw and miter saw . I highly recommend this blade to anyone needing nice cuts with a small saw .	1
I used it to cut both hardwood and MDF , never laminate . Always gave a very clean cut , lasted until I sold my saw after 2 years weekly use .	1
edit-01/23/2006 : It 's been several months now and I still LOVE this blade . I have used it to cut everything from oak to treated pine to plastic but it even handles that stuff like a real trooper . It is a little slow to rip with , but not bad . For what I do in my hobby shop I do n't mind at all . The last cut I made with it is as smooth as the first.original text : I have to admit that I only bought this blade this morning and could n't wait to try it out . I installed it on my Jet JWTS-10 table saw , the cheapest of the line . I have made other improvements to the saw but this blade has been one of the best.In my review of the saw I state that the original blade is good for a starter blade . This one DEFINITELY takes it to the next level and beyond . No tear out AT ALL , either ripping or cross cutting . SMOOTH finish . NO SAW MARKS ! ! ! And it 's fairly quick at ripping too . I was concerned about buying another blade designed primarily for cross cutting , and Freud does n't rate this blade as the best for ripping either , but my results so far have been excellent.I may add a blade stabilizer , though Freud claims you do n't need one with this blade . The plate is a bit thicker near the arbor than it is at the teeth . A 3.5 '' should do it.Enough said . Buy it ! ! For around $ 35.00 you ca n't , CA N'T go wrong . A Forrest Woodworker of this quality will cost you nearly THREE TIMES as much.I hope you find this review helpful , and as always , Good Luck with your own dreams !	1
I installed this blade on my radial arm saw . I sighted along the blade as it came to a slow stop , to be sure it was mounted true , with no wobble . I had to loosen the nut , turn the blade slightly , and retighten a few times to get it perfect . Without a blade stabilizer , or not bothering to check the trueness of the spin , no blade will perform properly . I never have to do this with the table saw , just the radial arm saw . Once trued up , it cut like butter , and the surface was really like glass.I also bought the Forrest II blade when I read the reviews in this months Fine Woodworking magazine , they rated it as number one , and Frued was number 2 . The top 1 and 2 out of all of the blades , not bad . Fine Woodworking mentioned that their was n't any tear out . Well I got those same exact results with the Freud . No tear out at all . The magazine rated the Freud as excellent in smooth cut , but only very good in tear outs . My experience is that when ripping 3/4 '' material , this blade produced a smooth cut without any saw marks . Nice enough to mount as an exposed edge on your project . Of course , a true fence is critical.With the flawless results I got with the Freud , I am wondering why I paid three times the price for the Forrest . The Forrest Woodworker II is designed for Table Saws . The Freud is advertised on the package as being ideal for Table Saws , Radial Arm saws , and Miter and or Compound Miter Saws . I am keeping the Forrest for the table saw , I have spoken to Forrest owners who love their blade , even a year after using it . They love not having to change the blade for different kinds of cuts , and state it is still sharp after a year . I 'm expecting the same kind of results from the Freud . Both of these blades have 5/8 '' arbors , and are a 1/8 '' thin kerf . The Forrest has a thinner 3/32 '' model as well , but some of the reviews indicate some inaccuracy on that model.I highly recommend buying this Freud blade.It is hard to find a blade that will cut plywood , and melamine , and do crosscuts , all excellently , and do rip cuts good as well . This one does all of them . To see Freuds blade use recommendations chart , click on the blade picture at the top of the ad.I installed the Freud on my table saw , and got the same excellent results . So I bought a second one of these Freuds . I like the 60 teeth . Commonly the 50 tooth crosses the line between great ripping and crosscutting . This 60 tooth appears to do the job beautifully , and still give you that extra smoothness that comes with the additional teeth . The Forrest is still covered in the protective rubber dip . Some day , I will break out the Forrest II , I just have a hard time even thinking about taking this Freud off . How can you top perfect ? Hope this was helpful .	1
This is an excellent blade it 's very sharp and produces a finish quality cut.You can cross cut anything and the results are always perfect.The expansion slots the thin kerf and the carbide teeth balance out nicely resulting in an excellent blade.This one is worthy of re-sharpening ... eventually . Now get out there and cut some wood .	1
I do light woodworking to keep up a commercial pottery craft fair booth . Shelves , boxes , cases , like that . Reading reviews of vastly more competent wood crafters that myself on this site compelled me to try this blade and replace the 50 T sidekick OE on the DELTA Tablesaw . WoW . Cutting spruce , cedar , fir stock ; thin plywood , doorskins , particleboard , this blade excels.Really and truly.I had to wait awhile for the order/ backorder to clear , but worth it .	1
I purchased this set because I noticed a little bit of wobble in my blade as I shut down the machine even though the blade is tight against the arbor . I had some doubt as to how much effect stabilizer would have on the blades performance . My package noted that these were two sets . I gave the other one to a woodworking buddy . I am completely satisfied and impressed with this stabilizer . It completely eliminated the blade wobble at start up and shut down of my saw . I had one thing that abolutely puzzled me . I installed the stabilizer on the outside of the blade on my right tilt saw . There should have been no change in the blade placement . My zero clearance insert would not go over the blade . It rubbed probably a 1/64th of an inch or so . I lowered the blade all the way down , put in the insert and powered up my saw . I then raised the blade . It cut the expected 1/64th of an inch or so and I let it run a minute to clear out the insert . I was amazed at how well the stabilizer worked . No more wobble . I own a Delta contractor saw with cast iron extensions and tons of add ons . I am completely sold on this product . I am certain that my old arbor flange was slightly warped , although I never noticed it . I highly recommend this product and it is so inexpensive .	1
I mainly purchased these to replace the standard thrust washer that came with my tablesaw . So with that in mind , they work great . As for the stabilizer part , I do n't think they add much for standard kerf blades , or at least I do n't notice any appreciable difference . I do n't use thin kerf blades as a general rule so I ca n't speak to their usefulness while using thin kerf blades.I had n't really intended on using both pieces when I ordered them , again intended to replace the thrust washer . One added benefit that I did n't think about is that it shifts the blade over , in my case , to the right . Now I can reuse some of my old chewed up zero clearance inserts ! I do only use the outside stabilizer with my dado set .	1
I brought this because a friend suggested it and it ... [ was n't expensive ] . I have to admit that I was not convinced until I used it . I use a Freud 80 tooth 10 '' blade that is the best blade I 've found and I did n't really think there was a way to improve my cuts more than by owning the best blade I could find . I was so wrong . The difference was immediately seen and rather amazing , especially for something so [ inexpensive ] . ( I just ca n't seem to be able to get over the fact that for about ... [ a less expensive price ] I improved my cuts by at least 100 % . ) My first clue that something was different was before making my first cut . I placed my homemade panel cutting jig on my table and the blade was about an 1/8 '' away from the jig where as before it was so close that I could hear the blade brush the jig as I ran it past . The first cross cut was so great that I had to rip a piece of scrap to see how it would turn out . It looked like I had just ran it through my jointer.Here is the bottom line . It is ... [ not expensive ] and it works amazingly well , so basically if you do n't have one get one .	1
The stablizer maybe make a little difference but I think that it also depends on the quality of the saw blade , the laser cut blades are a lot more true then the stamped blades	1
If you run 10 '' thin kerf blades this is a great addition to your saw . I purchased this set from another source , impulse buying is usually not something I do , but it said Freud so I knew it had to be good . The machine work and finish is everything you would expect from Freud . When I installed both stabilizers I found that the blade would rub on the throat cover . Due to the design of the top of my table saw , making a zero clearance one is gon na be a real pain . I worried about running only the outside stabilizer until I read the review of `` rohoove '' . I decided to give it a try . Works like a champ . It definitly improved the cutting performance of my blade and for some reason has made the saw run quieter when cutting . It is a noticable differance in both aspects . This is a definite must have . I may try the other stabilizer on my old chop saw , see if it helps there also.PS ... It 's now November and have used the stabilizer since Feb. Have it on the chopsaw now and there is a noticable differance in the sound . No more `` clang '' and the whining noise is appreciably less . Do n't notice that it cuts any better , it always has cut well , but the reduction in annoying noise is worth the few bucks in my small basement shop . Would reccommend this little item to everyone , especially if you run an underpowered saw and thin kerf blades .	1
This item does what it is supposed to do . It about eliminates blade wobble .	1
I ordered this stabilizer to mount on my DeWalt dw746 tablesaw . I had been using a DeWalt 5 '' stabilizer plate with a Forrest WWII thin kerf blade . At 5 '' in diameter , the DeWalt stabilizer effectively limited my depth of cut to about 2.5 '' . After trying out the Freud 3.5 '' stabilizer , I can honestly say that I did n't lose any noticeable performance , and I gained enough blade clearance to once again rip/crosscut 3 '' stock.As an added bonus for the price , this product comes as a pair of stabilizers ! I only mounted one stabilizer on my saw ( on the nut side of the blade ) , and was able to mount the other to my radial arm saw and greatly improve its cuts as well.I highly recommend this set of stabilizers as a good product at a great price .	1
I bought these because the Freud six inch dado stack I bought came with only three 1/16 & # 34 ; ( .0625 ) shims . I needed more shims to increase the range of stacks I could create . It appeared these would allow me that capability.I bought these through Amazon . Other sources sell sets for less , but with Amazon Prime free shipping , the prices seem competitive.I 'm pleased with the number of and variety of shims I received . Too , each shim has its thickness laser etched on itSIDE NOTES : I got by using Mylar shims I cut from some old Mylar sign material a store gave me . The sign material produced 1/64 & # 34 ; ( .015625 & # 34 ; ) shims , each of which I labeled with their thicknesses . Additionally , the metal shims that came with my set were not labeled , so I used my micrometer to determine their thicknesses , then used my engraver to note the thickness on the shims.Because I grew up with fraction measurements , I tend to think in those terms . However , when dealing with dados , figuring stack widths is much easier if I convert fractions to decimals ( top divided by the bottom of the fraction ) and work adding decimals .	1
Freud SS100 Dado Shim SetThis product does what it says it does . Is it really necessary ? Probably not . In order to size a dado precisely , you measure to approximate the set of dado blades used to the desired width . Then you start cutting test grooves in scrap stock and adding or change shim thicknesses and cutting another test . Depending on your skill and luck , you may get it right in several tries.It is just as effective to select the dado blade set , with no shims , for a groove a little undersize . Then make a slight rabbet cut on the inserted board ( shelf ) to fit the dado , like fitting a tenon to a mortise . Use a piloted rabbet bit in a router to make the fitting cut . Once adjusted to depth , you can repeat the process accurately as many times as the project requires.I bought the shim set because I thought I was missing something , but I probably will not use it much .	1
This set allows fine adjustments to dados - The Freud dado set at the 1/4 inch cut is just slightly short of a full 1/4 inch . In these cases , this set allows a tight fit at exactly 1/4 Inch - more precision - less sanding .	1
This set came on time and packaging was good . There were some rust areas on a few of the shims ; however , no issues with performance . A little scrubbing with a brass brush and mineral spirits did the job . For the price you ca n't match this shim set . Now my joints are a tight fit .	1
I 'm a hobby woodworker and do n't use a dado set too often . So when I went looking for a dado set , I wanted one that was low cost . I first tried a set from Avenger , which is a set made in China . It was a real piece of junk . It did n't make accurate width dados and the chippers were different diameters , which left grooves in the bottom of the dado.I finally took the Avenger set back and bought this Freud 6 inch set . The difference is night and day . If I set up the Freud set for a 3/8 inch dado , it is dead on at 3/8 inch . The bottom of the dado is absolutely smooth - not even a hint of unevenness.The only negative about the Freud set is that the spacers are not marked and it 's extremely hard to tell the difference between two spacers that are close in size . I realize that Freud may not have wanted to stamp them because a stamp might have changed the thickness in the area of the stamp , but the sizes could have been etched on.Other than this one problem , I am completely happy and satisfied with this dado set .	1
The dado set is very well made and preforms great . The combination of cutters allows for many options . Cuts a very nice square bottom dado . The storage case is very helpful as well .	1
I 've made hundreds of cuts on this 6 '' dado set over the last 5 years.I 've been happy , but it 's not perfect , and I think Freud sometimes charges for their name when less expensive competitors are about as good . I would tryMibro 491071 6-Inch Stacking Dado BladeorOshlun SDS-0630 6-Inch 30 Tooth Stack Dado Setif I needed another set.The case is well designed . Saves you time , and saves the blades . The red plastic wing nut thingees both cracked , but Freud sent me new ones when asked.It would be nice if the shims were factory labeled . You need to clean , measure , and mark them , and the marker writing eventually wears off.There is sometimes a little blow-out on the cross-cuts , but any dado set will do that . Use a scrap of wood against the trailing edge .	1
if you are like me and not ready to spend [ money ] on a dado set , look no further . this baby performs . i chose the 6 '' for my 10 '' delta contractors saw . i believe this is wise to compensate for the lower horsepower of my saw . a smaller blade will have more rpm 's than an 8 '' or 10 '' . its physics . anyway , i like the case to keep it all organized and it comes with a handy guide that tells you what chippers and shims to use for certain cuts . quite handy for undersized plywood . big carbide tips that look like they will stand up to several sharpenings.so why did i only give it 4 stars ? someone at freud just got off break on friday just before quitting time and shorted me an 1/8 '' chipper . Quality control cost ya a star Freud .	1
It is reasonably priced for weekend wood workers . It works well for my Delta contractor saw ( 1.5 hp ) , which is supposedly & quot ; underpower & quot ; . The Tool-Crib rep said that 8 in . dado blades could be a bit too much for my saw . It came with a sturdy plastic storage case . Ah , not much instruction came with the set .	1
My previous blade was an old craftsman 6 '' dado . Not that i have anything against craftsman ( my table saw is great ) , but these things were so old and worn that they burned the wood away instead of cutting it . This influenced me to get a new set . I am glad i did . With this set , the saw dose n't even bog down in going through the wood . Wonderful to be able to cut something without buring it . Cuts an *almost* flat-bottomed dado . I have only done cuts about 3/8 wide max , and it seems that the chippers leave a *slight* raised area at the middle . I am not sure if this happens with larger sizes . The carbide teeth on the chippers are nice and large , which makes me happy . Now , if it can only help me think straight and not make four left legs instead of two left and two right . Oh well . I 'll have to practice more .	1
This is my first dado , but it does what it is supposed to do and does it well . My only complaint is I wish they would mark the shims so you can tell them apart .	1
Quality makes all of the difference in a dado . This is a quality product that performs very well . Yes it is a bit pricey , but you get great results so it is definitely worth it .	1
Clean cuts . Great for low horsepower saws . Nice flat bottoms in my dado cuts .	1
I purchased this dado set on the recommendations of my brother , who is a professional finish carpenter and cabinet maker . He only uses Freud blades . I had previously had another brand that was fine for ripping dadoes but destroyed any wood during crosscut dadoes . The set arrived last saturday and I dropped what I was doing and had to try it out . I spent two hours & quot ; playing & quot ; with the set , cut dado 's in melamine , birch plywood , oak plywood , solid maple and oak , mdo and mdfb . Man , this is a great little set . Though smaller than the set my brother uses ( same set my Dad used for years ) , it suits my so called & quot ; underpowered & quot ; saw . Every dado was as clean as anyone could hope to accomplish , even on crosscuts . The tearout was so minimal , it 's not worth talking about . The channel is clean and flat , every bit as nice as any dado I ever cut with a router . No burning and the feed rate is consistant with what I would use for crosscutting veneer plywood . After recieving the set , I recieved my latest copy of & quot ; American Woodworker & quot ; , they had just done a review of dado sets and the SD206/208 was rated & quot ; Best Buy & quot ; . For those of us that do this for fun , this is definitly a & quot ; Best Buy & quot ; .	1
Purchased the Freud 8 & # 34 ; dado and it worked as well as this one , however even though my Bosch 4100 table saw is adequate for that size , after a couple of cuts I traded it in , came to Amazon and am pleased with this 6 & # 34 ; preferring it much better . I simply did not like the sound my motor made pushing the heavier 8 & # 34 ; body and noticed it even more after using this 6 & # 34 ; . I am enamored with my Bosch and plan to have it around a good long time , so why strain it . I am a hobbyist in the garage and see that this product does all I need to have done . It is a far cry from my Craftsman spin dado . Clean cuts , square corners , the whole enchilada . Though the documentation is sparse and even in error for some of the settings ( IMO ) working it with practice cuts pays off well .	1
I usually work with 10 & # 34 ; blades on my table saw . Going down to a 6 & # 34 ; quite a change because you kind of wonder what this little disk will do . I have a Rigid R4510 and that is what is recommended for this particular saw so I ordered a set . Only difference is that mine is silver , not black like the picture . I do n't think that matters all so much , but wonder why the difference.Finally got around to using it and tried out a groove cut on a 24 & # 34 ; piece of Ash . It cut a perfectly flat bottomed smooth groove all the way down . Just the two outer blades make a nice cut to put a piece of 1/4 & # 34 ; plywood in . Just like I 'll be using for the backing of the dresser I 'm building . The real test will be running it down the 70 & # 34 ; panels next . I 'm predicting I 'll get excellent results.If you have a smaller table saw and need dado or groove cuts for a job , get this blade . I ca n't wait to try it out at max width .	1
Very pleased with the look , the fit , and the performance of this product . I was somewhat confused with the labeling of the shims . The package labeling uses inches , the shims themselves are labeled in mm . The chart I found on-line was much clearer . Also , I would like to have seen the shims labeled in such a way that it would be less difficult to read the sizes . Not a big problem - I can certainly do that for myself . I have n't used them enough to know if it was a good idea to save a few bucks on the 6 & # 34 ; rather than purchasing the 8 & # 34 ; .	1
Being a woodworking hobiest making a value judgement on a product is somewhat difficult so take this review for what it 's worth . The set came early and in good condition . I was impressed with the quality of the blades and their high polished look.. As I looked through the instructions I found them a little confusing as they are written in tiny print on a sticker afixed to the case and in multiple languages . The case itself is plastic , stury enough but probably the weakest component and does have a higher potential for breakage . The set comes with spacers when added to the stack , make fine adjustments to the size of cuts . Beyond that the setup is pretty simple and straightforward . I made a couple of test cuts on pine , plywood and maple and the blades cut through each like butter and measured accurately . Ca n't say anything about blade durability but for my purposes I suspect they will last many years . I reccomend them for novice woodworkers . You professionals and experts will have to make up your own minds .	1
This dado set met all my expectations . It makes clean cuts of varying dimensions every time . I have used it on pine and oak successful . I would recommend for the hobbyist .	1
This is a good setup , overall . Tearout in CDX plywood and hardwood is minimal ; I have n't yet cut dadoes with it in birch plywood or any other expensive veneered lumber so I ca n't rate it in that area yet . It does n't make glass-smooth bottoms in dadoes , but neither does it cost what a Forrest stacked dado head cutter does !	1
I picked up the basic Freud SD206 6 '' stacked dado set on sale at a local hardware store . Despite what some reviewers have written here , I had no problem mouting this dado stack on my DeWalt 746 table saw . Granted , when all of the chippers are in use the arbor is completely filled - but it does fit . After making many 1/2 '' deep and 3/4 '' wide cuts in white oak I found the performance of this dado stack to be excellent . There was no chipping or tearout whatsoever when I was cutting with the grain and only very minor chipping when cutting across the grain . The dado cuts were very smooth on all surfaces and the bottom of the cut was perfectly flat . Also , I was happy to see that the shims included were of very high quality ( thin metal rather than paper ) .I chose the 6 '' model because I will probably never have a need for a dado so deep it requires an 8 '' set . Overall I am very pleased with the quality of this product and recommend that you shop around for a deal like I got ( twenty five bucks less than the Amazon price at a local store ) .	1
This was a bit cheaper than the other dado setups . Takes a little patience to set up the cut width . Once setup , it performs very well . I use mine on a Dewalt 744x .	1
I might have given this just 4.5 stars , if that option was possible , as the spacers could be better identified/marked . Apart from that , an excellent dado set . Cuts really clean dados fast . What more do you want ?	1
Hooked these up on a Ridgid R4512 Table Saw with no problems.The cut was near perfect on 3/4 maple ply at exactly the right width . I did use a zero-clearance dado throat plate which may have helped too.In short , great cut for the price , just make sure to test the width on a template first .	1
It no way effected the performance of the product , but the ones i received were silver and the ones advertised where black . The one issue I had durning set up , using the 3/8 set up that the chipper and the two outer blades carbon kept bumping into each other and it took me about 20 minutes to figure it out . Hopefully I do n't have to use that set up to often .	1
I would have liked to get the Freud dial dado set , but do n't use a dado blade often enough to justify the cost . Unlike some other reviews I read , my set was good quality and gives me a clean cut . I use a lot of Freud blades and with normal maintenance they have served me well .	1
Do yourself a favor and alway do a test cut.The big box stores only sell crap as plywood thesedays at ridiculous prices and some of the shims aresometimes not spot on . I 've labeled all mine withsharpies , but I alway test on a piece of scrap . If youhave ever screwed up a carcass getting in a hurry , you'llknow what I mean . Not that I 've ever had that happen . Ha !	1
I used these blades on a 1hp , 3450rpm Craftsman tablesaw . I am pretty experienced at rough carpentry and am just now getting into finer woodworking.First of all ... these reviews include many people complaining about how difficult it is to put the shims on and off ... I dunno , I 'm a VERY impatient person , but I found the 5 seconds it takes to add/remove a shim worthwhile.Also , some folks had said that the measurements are `` nominal '' and not actual ... who knows ? Bottom line is that you need to do a test with scrap wood to make sure you have exactly what width you want ... ( and doing a test with scrap wood is a good woodworking practice and a good habit to form . ) In the `` box '' : the outer blades , chippers , shims , and a case/rack which holds it all quite well . ( Note , most other sets in this price range do n't come with shims . ) Freud includes instructions which are pretty straightforward , but again you should run scrap because every bit of wood is different -- not to mention that humidity can affect the thickness of your stock.I find this set to be excellent and well priced . Could n't be happier . Easy to use , well packaged in a carryall/case.Worked so well my wife thought Norm had dropped by to help me. -- -- -EDIT : I 've now had this set for years and have since upgraded nearly ALL my tools , including the purchase of a cabinet saw . I still feel no need to upgrade this dado set . Works great and gives nice flat dados .	1
I purchased this to work with my Jet JWTS-10jf table saw and it does a very fine job . I have used it many times since owning it and have not once second guessed my purchase . Money well spent .	1
I purchase this dado blade since it was rated American Woodworker Best Buy in the April 2001 issue . The other dado blades on the market are $ 130+ . I figured at $ 70 this is a great value.The cuts on this blade are extremely smooth . I used it on some malamie to build an outfeed table for my table saw with no chipping.I was concerned that it did not come with a case , so I figured I would just build my own . However , the blade comes in a red heavy duty plastic blade & quot ; rack & quot ; that has the outer blades and shims on one side and the chippers on the other . The blades are held in place with knobs that screw into the rack . The rack also has a nice comfortable handle for easy carrying . Thanks Frued ! This rack makes a case unnecessary .	1
I do n't know what all these reviewers that talk about chipped teeth are talking about ? The chipperd have flat top teeth and the outer blades have beveled . As for perfectly flat bottom dados - no dado set makes perfectly flat due to the fact that there is space between the chippers and blades and as for the kerf ticks in the corner again this is how they are designed all dado sets to this . Ugh some people ! ! This set is perfect for the hobbiest and weekend wood worker for the price you ca n't get much better .	1
Item performs as expected for a $ 100 tool accessory . Would consider purchasing again if there were a need for another .	1
Works beautifully.Clean cuts , flat bottomed trenches and no tearing . Instructions that come with the blade are a bit light on but information online is excellent . The blade provides the ideal range of cutting depths and widths that I require	1
I purchased this dado a few weeks ago and I would purchase it again . It comes with 2 blades , 3 chippers , spacers and shims . It 's really easy to setup for the thickness you want even if you need the spacers or shims . The more common widths typically use just the blades and chippers and are really fast on setup . For example , one blade will give you 3/16 and 2 blades for 1/4 . 2 blades and 1 chipper for 3/8 , I 've only had to use shims once on an odd ball width I needed . I have noticed some minor splintering on some edge cuts on pine , and I made a 3/8 '' dado that was 1/64 short , but you should always do a test cut first anyway ( at least one test cut for a new width ) and then you could just add a shim . I think this Dado is definitely worth the price , I 'm pretty happy with it .	1
I picked this set over the ones my local big box home building supply offered . Shipping was fast and packaging was superb . The set had no chipped teeth and was complete . I would suggest checking out YouTube Freud videos for better information . For sub 100.00 they are great . Cuts are clean and bottoms are flat with good sharpe corners .	1
once you get the right combination of blades , shims and spacer this is a must have for cutting dado grooves works excellent no problems . highly recommend .	1
I have been using my data blades for a few months now and they are still sharp and running smooth . I use my set frequently on red oak with no issues and little chip out . This is my first and only Dado set , but I can not imagine a better set .	1
Have not used the product yet , but I expect it to perform as it should . I bought it on reputation alone after reading many reviews about various dado sets .	1
this dado set is 100 times nicer than the couple of other cheap dado sets I own . Easy to use and works great .	1
I 'm a casual woodworker . This blade performed the tasks I needed it to do . It 's a little hard to set up and get the correct cut width . Once I got the hang of it worked well .	1
I purchased these Dado blades after becoming frustrated with tear out and rough bottoms on my box joint and other dado cutting projects . These blades are great ! They leave a clean cut bottom in all the joints and tear out is a thing of the past . I would recommend the blade to anyone needing quality dado blades .	1
Good old Freud blades . These are sharp , well balanced , and silver ! The picture is not right , its a silver set . And for those of you like me that have used this Dado stack for years , it has changed a bit . Now , there are fewer chippers , with wider teeth and more shims . It still works just the same , and is maybe even a little easier , because there 's one less chipper to put in the stack and take out .	1
Excellent dado set for the price . Splinter free cuts in 3/4 '' birch ply crosscutting the front veneer grain . Very pleased . Blades are very quiet when running at speed . Look forward to years of use .	1
This worked great the first time . It is quiet and has no additional vibration as compared to a regular saw blade . My only complaint so far was the documentation . The instructions consisted of a folded piece of cardboard with washed out 8 pt . printing on gray cardboard . I did figure it out and I am very happy with the saw .	1
Nice set and an interesting 2 sided chipper wing . Does not cut perfectly square corners as the item description may allude , but it is very close .	1
As a keen enthusiast woodworker , this is a great bit of kit . It makes very smooth cuts and is surprisingly quiet.I made up a new zero clearance insert for it ( 3 actually , as its a Dado ! ) and It has been absolutely wonderful for boxes.It has saved me heaps of time . I use it with my Incra box maker and it makes a tedious job very fast.My curse ? Not speaking Imperial . Shame there is n't a metric version , no doubt it would be very popular .	1
Get 5 blades at a great price . Product I got is flawless , cuts like knife through butter.2 day shipping saved my arse . Had a contractor for only 3 days and we needed custom nosings for my floor , all the blades I looked at locally in Canada were $ 200 plus , and not even complete sets .	1
This is a great set . It measure a few thousandths off when I get into anything above a 1/4 & # 34 ; just on the small side so I have to shim it into place . The small guide to the sizes is pretty darn close to right on and is great to use . The packaging/storage is a plastic case that works great . I wish there were directions but basically it has shims on one side with the blades and then spacers on the other side with the chippers . Blades are heavy duty , make a solid cut and a pretty awesome noise on my table saw when it 's runningCons : - The surface that is cut when using the dado set leaves very small grooves . This does n't affect my projects so far since my dado 's are internal but it if you had any of it exposed it would need to be cleaned up- The cut leaves two small over cuts in the corners of the dado . If you raise your saw up so it is supposed to cut 1/4 & # 34 ; the entire middle will be exactly the same but in each corner of the cut there will be a small corner that is a bit deeper in the shape of a triangle ( blade ) . If you have any exposed dado 's then you need to cut a bit shy of your final and shave it into place . This is n't ideal but for 1/3 the price of the nice sets I ca n't complain .	1
I have wanted this dado set for a long time now and finally saved up enough to make the purchase a few weeks ago . One of the best purchases I have made for my woodshop . Superior quality ... .packaged perfectly for storage ... highly recommended ! !	1
I have been using this set for furniture making . The bottom cut is even and the cuts are clean with no tearout . This is an excellent dado set . What more can you ask of the blades ?	1
This dado set is as good as described by all the readers . Also it is very easy to install and remove the blade . A caliper will be a handy thing to have when using this stacked set.I do n't want to repeat the good things that all the readers have already mentioned .	1
I have used this tool to place hundreds , if not thousands of biscuits on all kinds of projects . The fence can be a little tough to adjust , as it tightens with a wing nut on each end of a threaded rod . You must turn both ends at the same time to get a tight grip . I find that I use it without the fence most of the time . The blade is mounted such that it hits the middle of 3/4 & quot ; stock just sliding on the base . I clamp my work to the extension table on my table saw and just slide the biscuit joiner on the table surface . It is easy to hit your marks on edge joints this way . For right angle joints , I use a guide clamp ( like a Tru-Grip CT24C ) squared on the workpiece ( i.e . the side of a bookcase ) so the base of the joiner rests where the bottom of the shelf will be . It is easy to make a verticle plunge into the board resting on the table.The depth of cut is easy to fine tune , and there are positive adjustment stops for three sizes of biscuits.One thing I do n't like about this tool is the & quot ; clattering & quot ; sound it makes while running . I have run this machine quite a bit and never had a problem , but it has sounded like a loose bearing from the time it was new . The fence could use some improvement , but that is easy to work around.If it ever breaks down and I have the cash , I 'd like to try a Lamello . That 's the one Norm has on the New Yankee Workshop !	1
I purchased this as a first plate jointer to get some experience with how they can be used in my projects . I have n't experienced the issues with noise that several reviewers have noticed . Considering many of these jointers can go for double the money , and that my projects are relatively basic , this seemed to be a good match . I think this is a great unit for beginners or as a backup unit.UPDATE FEBRUARY 2009 - When I bought this unit , I figured it 'd be good for maybe a year or two . Four years out , it continues strong . It has an annoying tendency for the chip chute to clog up from time to time , which takes a bit of effort to unclog . But it does great work , and with a little bit of care ensuring your alignment is clean , it works well . Wish all of my tools were as bulletproof .	1
I 've made a few bookcases using screw fasteners , and wanted to clean up the connections . This thing is the cat 's meow.Its simple to use and works great . Move over Norm , I have at least ONE of your Yankee workshop gadgets now . : - )	1
I use this joiner to build solid wood panels for table tops and cabinet doors and for this it works fine . The tool seems well built , has adequate power , and I do not need a tilting fence for beveled joints . The fence height adjustment could be a little easier , but I almost always use 3/4 '' stock so I rarely have to adjust it . It does make a disconcerting rattle when it is shut off , but this seems to be normal . The price is also reasonable for what is basically an angle grinder with a fence and carbide blade . If you are a typical hobbyist like me , then this joiner is all you 'll ever need . Save yourself the $ ... that you would need to spend on the fancier models for biscuits , glue , stock , etc .	1
Having looked at various reviews of other manufacturers , and having gotten a feel for different models ( ... ) , I finally settled into the Freud JS 102 . I am glad I did. ( ... ) The Freud is an all-metal design , except the handle shroud . It is well built , and substantially made . Its price tag belies its engineering and performance . It 's 5 amp motor did n't even slow down during cutting . We are not chain sawing oak ; we are only cutting a tiny slit on the side of wood . The fence detents of 0 and 45 degrees are accurate . More importantly it does not slip when cutting a biscuit . Dust collection appears to be one of the best . Even with the collection bag off of the unit , the shavings exited readily out of the chute , off to the side , and away from the operator.The only drawback is that in order to adjust the height of the cut , you must loosen the locking nut , and manually move the fence up or down . With this method it is possible to jump to a spot , which may be more or less than is needed . A micro fine adjusting knob would be nice . Some of the more expensive units have that feature . Freud chose to use a precisely fitting ( no play ) front `` sled '' with linear measurements inscribed on its face , and a locking lever that is very exact.On the other hand , the depth of cut is easily adjustable , and like the rest of the unit , very precise.If your the kind of person who coddles to the very best , and will be using it for your own projects , no matter how many you undertake , and are not dependent on biscuit cutting for a living , then this unit is for you . The only reservation is the height adjustment . Do n't misunderstand me . You can get an exact height adjustment with this unit . A perfect setting as a matter of fact . You may spend an extra 20 seconds getting it there . If you cut a 100 different biscuits a day , that 20 seconds could add up.I am new to this machine and am convinced that with a little practice , I will be able to precisely adjust the height first time , by the way that I hold it , and visually measuring the difference using the measuring ruler on the fence face.All in all I give it 5 stars because of the quality of the tool , and the surprisingly low price . It appears to be a tool that will give you years and years of dependable use . Freud router bits are among the very best , and I believe this tool is worthy of the Freud name .	1
The quality , fit and finish of this joiner are excellent . It is easy to setup , all the important parts are solid cast metal and no flimsy fit here . the issue with the fence slipping is one minor annoyance but can be dealt with easily by either replacing the rubber washer that gets pinched between the fence and the body or by tightening ( ever so slightly ) with pliers.If you are having fit problems with the thickness of the slots , look at the biscuits you are using and not at this machine . This joiner cuts extremely accurate and consistent slots but biscuits can vary in thickness if they are of poor quality or if they have been exposed to the air and have absorbed some moisture . The best biscuits I used have been the Bosch ones but they are usually significantly more expensive than the Porter Cable ones . If you use the lower quality biscuits , make sure you check them for fit before assembly time . You will end up throwing some biscuits ( maybe 5 % -10 % ) but that is not bad considering the price difference . However , if you are doing some fine work , go with the high quality biscuits because the difference may show then.Adjustment is very easy and cuts are very accurate . I do n't know what was the issue encountered by the person who could not adjust the blade but all the tools that came with the joiner fit fine on mine but I would use my higher quality tools when I work on machinery rather than the inferior ones that come with the machines with very few exceptions . If you are doing woodworking and using a plate joiner , you must have a few tools around to take care of minor adjustments.Dust collection is practically non existent unless you connect a shop vacuum to the unit in which case you will not get any external dust . All the biscuit joiners ( and for that matter all woodworking machinery ) will have dust problems if you decide to use the built-in collection mechanisms.The noise level is high but that is the case with almost every machine in a woodworking shop so you better be wearing your ear plugs . The placement of the switch could be better as one reviewer pointed out but you get used to it after a while.Bottom line , you can not beat what this joiner gives you for the money and you can get excellent results if you use it right .	1
I purchased the Freud JS102 biscuit jointer in 1998 and have used it to build many furniture projects in the time since . It is a quality built machine that is worth its modest price tag . The only fault I can find with it is that the dust port leading to the cloth bag tends to get clogged up . This is not a big deal though , as it is easy to clean out . I would buy this tool again in a heartbeat for its reliability and the value per dollar spent .	1
I must have a different machine from the other reviewers or maybe I need less hand holding . The one I have is easy to set and accurate . In fact , it seem to be identical to the Lamello in design . The fence can be set crooked if you try but turning the handle to lock it pulls it in to parallel . For dust collection a shop vac is best but the bag does a fair job . I highly recommend this tool for those that want a machine like Lamello 's without spending $ 400 .	1
This router is a terrific value if you need a powerful router to put in your router table . At this price point , one does not expect electronic start ! The router is well-constructed and heavy - I would not recommend it for hand-held routing , unless you are Arnold Swarzenegger . The finish is not top-notch , but who really cares for a router table router . Runout is excellent . I also installed the Router Raizer on it , and now it is a breeze for me to change bit depth from atop the table . If you have the extra money , go for the Bosch , Porter Cable or DeWalt , but for my money it is perfect .	1
I bought the Freud FT2000 and mounted it in a table like everyones suggestion . Its great ! It cuts through hard wood , like it was n't there . I do n't find it any noisier than my other router . In fact I believe that it is quieter with the exception of a high frequency tone at the higher speeds than my other router , ( Craftsman 1 1/2 HP ) . I highly recommend the FREUD FT2000 for table mounting and heay duty work .	1
The jury is still out on this one folks . I received the router quickly after ordering it and I was impressed with it when I saw it . A good solid machine . I was not too impressed with the edge guide . It appeared to be cheaply made and the coating was flaking off of it in rather large sheets . Oh Well ... It was a freebie anyway so I did n't get too excited about it . I set the router up in my router table ( which is why I bought it in the first place ) and switched it on . It started fine , the soft start feature is great . I started routing a 1/16 '' chamfer in 1/4 inch oak and got about half way through the first cut when the router quit and gasped a small puff of blue smoke . That was about all she wrote . It would n't start again . I went through the bother of removing it from the table , repackaging it , and taking it back to UPS to return it . I did ask for a replacement rather then a refund , as I have several Freud tools and have been very pleased with the value and quality they offer . I trust that the router I had received was one of those rare lemmons that happens once in a while . But for now I can only rate it with one star . When I receive the replacement I will update my rating accordingly and give it a fair rating based on the tools quality and performance.I will say this for Amazon.com , they make the return process as painless as possible . It was much easier then many store returns I have had to make.UPDATE - I got the replacement router ( very quickly I might add ) and after a bit of a delay got it mounted in my router table . This time it performed as I expected . No problems this time . The machine ate through red oak with no problem . Each cut was smooth , and trouble free . This router has power to spare , at no time did it hesitate or bog down , ( I must admit that on one occasion I tried to do so ) .The only reason it gets 4 stars rather then 5 is due to the base plate . It is made of pliable plastic , and in my opinion not suitable for use as a hand held router unless the base plate is replaced . It does not appear to be perfectly flat and could cause imperfections in the cut . Freud should upgrade to a rigid phenolic plate . But otherwise a great value in a power tool .	1
The old Craftsman finally died after many years of faithful service , so I purchased the FT2000 . I already own the FT1000 ( see separate review ) , so figured I might as well have a matched set.I have to agree with other reviewers , the `` manual '' is dismal , get Router Basic 's and The Router Handbook , by Patrick Spielman , and you wo n't care about the manual . I bought this monster to mount in a table so the weight is n't really a big deal , and put it to work almost immediatly on some red oak ( what is the deal with red oak ? does n't anyone like pine anymore ? ) I am shaping for a chest project . Some reviewers have compared the noise to a 747 , I think it is more like the Space shuttle taking off , but with ear protection its not too bad . Started out with the speed setting on 5 , but dialed it down to 3 , it had no problems swinging the 3/4 beading bit and did a real nice job . I like the adjustment knob and the on/off switch , both easy to use . Had no problems with the collet/nut as some reviewers had . I thought I might have to beef up my 1/4 phenolic plate , but it handled the weight just fine . Finding screws to mount it just took a trip to the hardware store and we were in business.Did n't get a case with it , but do n't expect to remove it from the table so wo n't miss it much . The guide will end up stuffed in one of the bin 's in my shop hutch and will probably live out its life there . The finish could have been better , but I do n't plan on displaying it , and it does n't effect its operation . Overall I am pleased with the router and plan to buy another to install in another table , and leave it set up with a 3/4 straight bit for cutting dadoes . For the price and what you get , power/smooth operation/easy adjustment , I do n't think you can beat the deal . I think its a perfect table router . Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the `` manual '' .UPDATE-APRIL 2005 I 've had this router a little over two years now and it is still performing extremely well . I have used and `` abused '' it a lot and have had zero problems with it . Still highly recommend this router to anyone .	1
Most people here seem to have extreme reactions to this router . My review will fall somewhere in the middle , though closer to the positive side . I use this router exclusively for free-hand work , preferring a smaller , lighter model for table-mounting . I would suggest that anyone who buys this router use it freehand , as it is too tall to be mounted easily to most router tables.Positive features first . One thing it definitely has going for it is power . After researching several of the & quot ; high-powered & quot ; routers ( DeWalt , makita , Hitachi ) , this one was obviously better . You get about another 1/4 HP for a price that 's still reasonable . Also , the router comes with a very nice height adjustment mechanism that usually costs extra with other routers , such as DeWalt . The router is easy to hold when doing free-hand work , and because one side of the base is flat , it is easy to run across a straightedge or a jig ( as compared with other routers that have round bases ) . It is relatively quiet , considering the power it has.Now the negatives . The router has an awkward power switch that clicks up into position . For comparison , I use the Bosch 1617EVS router , which has a toggle switch that turns on and off with a light push . This is a relatively small matter , especially when plunging ( in my opinion ) since you usually turn the machine on , then SLOWLY move it into the wood or lower it into the workpiece ; you 're not trying to hurry up and plunge right after you flip the switch on . The plunging operation of this router is accurate , but a little stiff . Again , not a big deal , although I suppose other routers edge it out in this category . The last negative I have about this router is that it comes only with the 1/2 & quot ; chuck . I have many 1/4 & quot ; bits , but I can not use them with this router . This , again , is a relatively small matter , since 1/2 & quot ; bits are preferable anyway . Also , many of my 1/4 & quot ; bits would never be used free-hand . But , comparitively speaking , other router have an edge in this category as well.The bottom line for me is that the power and height adjustment features outweigh the negatives of this router , and , when you compare the price , it seems to edge out DeWalt , its biggest competitor . With many of the negatives , we are n't talking about anything bad , we are just saying that this router is ever so slightly behind other routers on the market in some ways . But for use as a free-hand router , it 's got to be in the top of its category .	1
I purchased this router specifically for use with the Woodpecker PlungeLift router table insert/lifter in my `` New Yankee Workshop '' router table . With a little modification of the plunge mechanism , it fit right onto the lifter and into my router table , where it stays.This router is no lightweight , but then , I do n't want it to be . It has power to spare in my routing operations and has not let me down . I find I can crank the router up and access the collet to change smaller bits without removing the insert ( though this can be a little tricky ) . The soft start on the router is outstanding and , probably because it 's in the router table , it is very quiet . The shop vacuum that sucks the chips away is much louder than the router ! Like many other people , I could not quite figure out the collet arrangement at first . I swore that something was wrong and that the collet was undersized . However , I had read about the problem here , so I prevailed , and finally realized that I had to put the collet into the nut before I attached it to the motor . It does work ! I must admit that I have not used this router for plunge routing by hand . I have a DeWalt 621 that fits that need . Besides , it makes no sense to me to keep taking a plunge router out of a router table and putting it back in order to use it for free-hand plunge routing . Too much hassle , unless you can only afford one router.Fit and finish are fine . I want a tool that works . It does n't have to be particularly pretty , but there is nothing wrong with the Freud anyways.Value was what I was looking for , and value is what I got . If I needed to buy another router for my router table , I would do it all over again .	1
I read about the blade and bought it . It works great . Only thing the blade is really brittle and easy to break . Another thing it 's expensive .	1
fine teeth and leaves a good edge need to have for special cutting in the blade selection of the fein multimaster	1
I have used several times with no complaints . This blade works fine and is dependable . I highly recommend purchasing it .	1
This really helped me rip out old linoleum from our entryway . I used it for probably ~4-5 hours and it still has plenty of life left in it . Simply flip it over once one side becomes dull as the other side usually has sharpened from its use . It has a nice balance between flexibility and rigidity .	1
THis works to scrape off just about anything from glue to caulk . It works best on a level surface . Some adhesives need to be softened before scraping . This is much better than the old hand scraper method and with much cleaner results .	1
Since I finally broke down and purchased a Multi-Master -- and realized how much time and effort I wasted not getting it sooner -- I have purchased additional blades for various jobs . This has been a perfect blade for zipping mastic off a concrete slab floor in preparation for re-tiling .	1
See my other Fein blade reviews . These are geniune Fein blades at much better prices than at the Orange guys or at Big Blue . Do n't buy the cheap generic multi tool blades . They do n't last and , frankly , they 're dangerous . I think they can break at the wrong time and you can get hurt . Buy genuine Fein blades , and get them on Amazon for the best pricing by far . Remember : always wear your safety glasses when using your multi tool .	1
It is exactly as the description said . Very good quality and fits my 30-year old FEIN sander using an adapter .	1
The blade itself is good quality , but what you get is not exactly what is shown in the picture . I ordered the rigid scraper blade a what I got was the same blade that I already had , which was not my intention . The blade is semi-flexible .	1
Fein makes a great machine and blades . But if I have a large project I buy the much cheaper blades and find that more cost effective . But when buying one to have in the tool box I buy Fein .	1
All the reviews of this and similar Fein blades are true ; they cost a lot and they are fragile and easy to break . I am now faced with the prospect of replacing some of my broken and dull blades and I am willing to pay the price because I must . I have invested over a thousand dollars in blades and sandpaper for the Multimaster and the capabilities that having this kit gives me are too numerous to mention . My advice is to use this particular blade as a last resort , those few instances when no other method can perform the task without risk of peripheral damage to the valuable stuff that we tradesmen and tradeswomen have to cut into . Fein blades are like auto insurance ; they are an expensive burden when you do n't need them but when you do , you will be very glad that you have them .	1
Nothing cuts like the Fein saw blades . I do n't know why I have to say so many words to describe these great blades . There is not another blade made that is comparable .	1
I use this blade on my Dremel tool for making cuts on wood . It also cuts Plexiglas very well too . Blade is very sharp & you should always wear eye protection glasses when cutting . This is an excellent saw blade for making small cuts in wood or Plexiglas . Highly recommend . Highly recommend .	1
This served my husband 's purpose . He felt it could have lasted a little longer but was satisfied with its performance .	1
USE IT AND ONE IT REALLY WORKS FOR WHAT WOOD WORKING JOBS I DO AT HOME . IT REALLY MEET MY NEEDS TO DO MY TIDE SPOT AND QUICK CUTS WITHOUT THE USE OF POWER SAW.. I AM A HEAVY WOOD USER AND THIS BLADE MEET MY EXPECTATION IN MY MULTI PURPOSE MACHINES . THANK YOU	1
good quality . Arrived packaged well to avoid transit damage . It fits my 30-year old FEIN sander with the use of an adapter .	1
I have purchased almost all of the Fein blades available and this one , like all the others has certain capabilities that no other tool , Fein brand or otherwise can offer . Unfortunately , Fein has an exclusive on this product and since there is no competition they can charge whatever the market will bear . Sometimes you have to spend money to make money.You do not want to use this blade if there is any chance of hitting a nail or screw because it will be ruined . I use the HSS blades where I might hit metal . However it is easy to snap the brittle and equally expensive HSS blades and there are many applications where the flexibility of this blade works for you . I am confident that this is the finest blade currently available to saw through paint stuck tracks in old style double hung windows . I do a lot of this type of work and nothing else available works as well . The HSS blades will snap if you get even a little careless trying to do this operation . I have been able to unstick more than 25 window units per blade and I estimate that it takes about a third of the time that it takes to do this operation in the old way . Furthermore , you will be able to dismantle the unit without breaking the stops , the parting beads , the sash or the glass . This blade has increased my production by a factor of 3 or more in old window repair and restoration . That typically amounts to twelve units a day rather than four.This blade is also super for cutting calking or paint along joints when dismantling wood trim that has to be reinstalled . Run it along the calked wallboard or plaster to wood joint and you can pull the trim piece off without tearing the paint or wallpaper on the adjacent wall . I used to use a razor knife for this ; I also used to make a lot of slash marks on the walls and trim.I prefer the e-blades for occasional undercutting of door jambs . They have a greater depth of cut . It is worth mentioning that although I have used a multimaster for undercutting door jambs and even door bottoms , I only did this in emergency situations when I did n't have a jamb cutting saw on the job . A power driven jamb cutting saw is way faster , much easier and the replacement blades are cheap . I feel that Fein is wrong to promote the multimaster as a professional level tool for this purpose because its rate of cut is not comparable to circular jamb saws .	1
This little gem is great for making those difficult flush cuts to make baseboard molding fit into doorjambs and other tight spots.It makes me look good , and makes my woodworking look good . If you do a lot of baseboards , you need this tool .	1
I . Love . My . Fein tool . It has accomplished some tasks that I doubted could be done , in renovating a 100+ year old home . Some have found the blades do n't last well but they have for me . I 'm going through hard heart pine with big nails and do chew up the teeth on some blades but , considering how much time and aggravation they 've saved , it is well worth it . I do n't do that kind of cutting with this flush cut blade , of course , but it is one of those tools that , when you need it , you need it and there 's not a very good substitute except for expensive flush cut hand saws.How much is one 's time worth ? That 's may vary but this blade and it 's multitool can make it worthwhile , that 's for sure .	1
blade works as designed and certainly a must for the blade selection for fein multimaster , great for fine cut shipped fast	1
I do n't think we can quote prices in reviews , but I got a good deal from amazon.I used these blades to cut vinyl siding . I had over 100 feet of siding that needed to be cut into bundles of 16 '' for trash pick up . That means that I made 80 cuts with it , through a medium quality siding . It cut through like butter.Now , just a tip for plastic cutting . You need to play with the various speeds on the Fein tool . There is a `` sweet spot '' where it cuts like butter . It is fast enough to cut , but does not melt the material.It worked great for my purposes , ca n't comment on other materials .	1
Like this company . Have been satisfied with a number of their blades because they get the job done the way I want it .	1
I do really like the Fein Multimaster and have used it quite a bit . There are a variety of blades to use and this Flush Cut Blade is very useful . I was using it to cut door casings and also some shim stock from a door frame . Cut like butter , I was happy and surprised . I would recommend this blade as a general use blade and keep a spare for back up .	1
I have a Multimaster and since the patent expired on the blade holding method , other brands are now available Now I can afford to use it without fear of blade breakage . The Fein blades are still my favorite because the Multimaster is a industrial grade tool and the blades are too . Fein blades on sale makes it that much better .	1
This is a great tools but use it only within the limits of its planned and projected use . If you try to force it to do jobs intended for larger , more expensive tools , it will fail . To buy an equally efficient , FAR LESS EXPENSIVE clone of this tool , go to your local HARBOR FREIGHT TOOL STORE , go to their web site ( HARBOR FREIGHT TOOLS.COM ) or call their 800 number . I bought their equivalent tool ( Made by Chicago Electric which is a subsidiary of Harbor ) and it is equal to nationally known brands in every respect , except for the FAR LOWER price from HARBOR of $ 16.00 and they included most every tool attachment available for this tool for a grand total of $ 32 , including the tool.I have had great experience using the Chicagoi electric tools and their battery models are superior to other brands at about 1/3 the cost . PLUS , every hand tool ( manual or power ) Harbor sells is guaranteed for life . Yea Harbor !	1
I bought one of these for light duty planing tasks - relieving corners , cutting dowels flush and etc . You do have to hone the pre-ground edge before you use it the first time . It is ground to 25 degrees and recommended final angle is 30 after honing . I used a Veritas honing guide and a Japanese water stone to do the job . It only took about 5 minutes with the right tools ! The mouth is easily adjustable with the front knob to regulate the size of your curls . The blade is easy to adjust with the brass knob at the back . It is easy to grip and use . I look forward to getting may years of use out of this well made tool !	1
Ok , this is no Lee Valley , Lie Neilsen plane etc , and the title marks it as contractor grade anyway ( not fine cabinetmaker ) so I was n't expecting a perfect tool . out of the box the product seems strong and quite well made . The sole is as flat as it needs to be for the type of work the block plane is used for . All adjustment features seem to work well , although a little stiff out of the box until you use them a little more , then they start to free up a little and are easier to adjust etc.The blade itself is ground at 25 degrees and mine actually had a bit of a ding in it out of the box , however , the manual states the blade should be honed to 30 degrees anyway , so after about 20 minutes with a diamond sharpening stone and plane blade sharpening jig , I was able to remove the ding at 25 degrees and then hone a nice sharp edge at 30 degrees . A few quick tests of the product and it worked great.The secret is in the sharpness of the blade . Hone a very sharp edge on this block plane 's blade and it will work just as well as a block plane costing 10x as much . The block plane makes a great addition to any contractors/carpenters kit bag , or even for the fine woodworker too as long as you are prepared to spend that 20-30 minutes tuning it up to shape straight from the box .	1
This is a fine tool once properly tuned up . There is a reason a Veritas is 4x the cost - tighter process controls , thicker A2 blade , some design improvements . Any of the lower cost planes require the purchaser to finish the production process , and no , one does not have an equivalent tool to a Veritas or LN when finished . However , one does have a tool that works very well for low cost + time to tune it.It took about 3 hours to flatten the sole , blade , and cap iron , and deburr everything ( I spent 1 1/2 hours on a Veritas LAJ cleaning it up to my liking ) . The sides are not perpendicular to the sole , which is ok for me - this plane is too light to use on a shooting board anyway . All the other surfaces are in correct alignment and just needed to be smoothed up . I now get blade wide whisper thin shavings , as well as thicker ones without chatter if wanted - I believe that is the purpose of a plane . Blade and mouth adjustments are smooth . I really like the thinner profile/width and lighter weight of this plane vs the 12-920 and 12-139 ( own them as well ) . It will be very good for light trimming/edge clean-up activities where my other block planes feel a bit bulky.I 'm rating this tool based on the value it delivers - how well it accomplishes the designed task vs its cost . It accomplishes the task very well at a relatively low cost = high value .	1
I own the Stanley 12-960 and I am happy with it . Spend the time and effort to tune it and you got yourself a very good `` Contractor Grade '' $ 40 plane that will meet your needs . It 's not fair to compare it to Lie Nielsen or a Veritas plane that cost a 100+ dollars more.Pay attention to the product review line , Amazon combined reviews for Stanley 12-101 Small Trimming Plane in this same review listing .	1
The product is not bad . Like many of the previous reviewers , it is not the best plane that you can get . But , for the price , it does its job very well . I recently purchased an older house and am remodeling it . This plane has been very useful to shave down doors in which I ca n't fix by adjusting the hinges . As one of my carpenter friends told me : `` An expensive tool is no good if you do n't know how to use it . ''	1
This plane is a very good value for the money . It is NOT a hand-crafted , artisan-quality plane , like a Lie-Nielsen , but , then again , it does n't cost a couple of hundred dollars , either . In my view , I got a lot for the money I spent on it.Many of the other reviews say that you 'll need to do considerable tuning work before it can be used . That was n't my experience . I found it to be fully functional right out of the package . All I had to do was fiddle with the adjustments a little to correct the jostling it got in shipping , and it worked very well.I did take it apart and tune the blade by honing the bevel and flattening the back . It gives me a very long , clean shaving on most woods , but , in reality , it did almost as well before the tuning.In summary , I think I got all that I paid for -- and a lot more . I ca n't complain a bit . I 'm happy I bought it , and I 'd do so again without hesitation .	1
No matter how many power tools you have in your builder 's or cabinetmaker 's kit , you need a block plane , and the Stanley delivers 90 % of the performance of the high-end tools at a fifth of the cost . I 've used mine for heavy duty work , like triming new window casings flush with walls , as well as for delicate trimming in repairing musical instruments.The bases of the Stanley tools may not be as perfectly flat as those of the expensive Lie Nelsons , but that 's easily rectified in short order with some sandpaper and a sheet of glass . A fine tool at an excellent price .	1
I just purchased this neat little plane and I love it ! It 's well made , feels great in my hand , and does a nice job.You 'll never find a better plane for the money.I mean NOWHERE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Certainly not a Lee neilsen , but who cares ? ? I buy tools do use , not to brag about having .	1
Sturdy with an adjustable mouth and blade tilt.Understand you will need to prep this before use . The sole is not precision ground but machine rough , so you will need a granite block and sandpaper or a set of flat block diamond hones . Once you have your sole ( and sides ) honed and flat you will need to sharpen the blade . There are several jigs and sharpening tools to assist in this . After all is done apply an anti-rust agent such as wood wax or Boeshield.Once prep 'd this is a great plane .	1
After reading all the reviews , one might wonder if everyone is talking about the same plane . Well , they are and are n't . Let me explain.I own 12 different bench and block planes ( # 1,3,4,4 1/2,5,5 1/4,6,7 , standard angle block plane , the low angle block plane , and small trim plane ) , all but two are new Stanley 's ( the # 1 which is a Lie-Nielsen and the 5 1/4 which is from the late 70 's ) and the quality of the planes are all over the place.My # 3 , 5 , and Low angle block plane are great . I love them and could n't ask for better . The # 6 , and 7 are exceptable , while 4 , 4 1/2 , 5 1/4 , and stanard angle block could defiently be better . But to be fair , even my Lie-Nielsen # 1 gives me fits ( the frog screws work lose and the lever cap keeps popping out ) . The real fact of the matter is that buying any tool is a crap shoot . Some work great , some do n't . I do n't know why that is in an era of modern machining . Every tool should preform as well as any other made by the same company , but it 's not.All I can say is this ; my low angle block plane has worked great from day one and I love it . But I ca n't garantee yours will . Which at the end of the day says it all .	1
A great plane , once honed , removes material cleanly . A nice and useful addition to your tool cabinet . I would highly recommend .	1
After an unsuccessful attempt to find a decent vintage low angle block plane , I finally decided to try this one . I 'm glad I did . The fit/finish is flawless and the performance is great .	1
I love the feeling of a sharp plane slicing through wood . Stanley has been making planes for a long time and they really know what they are doing . You might veiw this as a plane kit . When you get it you will have some work to do on it . First you will probably need to lap the sole , and the back of the iron.This will remove the grinding marks from the factory . Then you will need to hone the bevel on the iron . Depending on the wood you are planing the angle might be right . Since this is a low angle plane 25 degrees is good for hard woods . You could even go as low as 15 degrees for soft woods . If you spend a little time tuning this somewhat rough tool up you will be rewarded by that feeling of slicing through the wood like it was butter . I prefer my Lie Nielson block planes over these.They are works of art and they perform like they are . But they cost several times more than these perfectly adequate stanleys .	1
Do n't get me wrong , you ca n't do any better for the money , but ... Blade does n't hold edge for long , lateral adjustment control is constantly in the way and moves the blade when you 're planing , sole needs additional flattening.For this price it 's expected to spend some time getting it in working shape , and afterwads it does perform ok , but leaves me wishing it had a better blade ( especially since you 'd commonly use this low-angle plane on end grain ) .	1
I 've looked at Lie Nielson and Vertitas low angle block planes and concluded that I do n't deserve such works of art . I 'd be afraid I 'd pick it up with glue or paint on my hands or drop it on the concrete floor ( ouch ) . So , I bought the lowly Stanley low angle block plane . For what I do , it suits me . The fit and finish is a little rough but it works just fine and the price was right . Out of the package it was fairly sharp and it did an excellent job .	1
Great little block plane . Comes in handy when you need to soften an edge , Butcher a pig or cow , Does not work good on sheep . Okay I was kidding , Amazon said I needed a few more words and what else can one say about a block plane other than it works great .	1
Stanley invented metal hand planes , they are part of our history , like all hand planes you will need to check the flatness of the sole and more than likely finish the sharping of the blade but one you had performed these two items you will have a first class hand plane . Had i not lost mine on a job I would not have had to replace mine . The first one was 12 year old and did a fine job . I believe this replacement will also last me the rest of my life .	1
Bought one of these ~ 3 yrs ago when I was just starting out with hand planes . About 30 wooden and iron planes later , I really like this one . It definitely requires tuning up properly , but once it 's brought into shape it works very well . As a rookie this plane frustrated me , but as I learned what was important about tuning them , this plane performed better and better . The stock blade works just fine when properly sharpened , and the lateral adjustment works fine , as does the blade depth adjustment . I use this higher bedded ( 21 ) block on smaller edgee and faces to reduce tearout vs a 12 block for end grain.For the more seasoned user , this plane will work well after a couple of hours tuning . For the rookie , it provides a good learning base - it 's not very expensive so you are n't as afraid to do something to it to learn how to tune it . It will never be quite as good as a Veritas or LN , but it can be 90 % as good at about 25 % the price . Spend time researching the internet for tuning how-to 's - there 's a lot of good and bad information out there . Learn how to sharpen - Brent Beach has an excellent site . Stone or sand all edges to deburr until things adjust smoothly . Get the sole flat . Get the end of the cap against the blade flat . Enjoy learning about hand planes and in the end you will have a very good user .	1
I held off buying a plane for a long time . How foolish ! This little plane has saved me lots of sandpaper , and it 's really fun to use . I shaved the high spots off of some old drawers that I had to install some slides on , and took some layers of paint off the edges of some old cabinet doors . The old paint was really tough to get off the bottom of the plane , since I did n't have any solvent . I finally tried spraying a little carburetor cleaner on it and it came off pretty easily.If you have n't used a plane before , this is a good one to start with . It takes a bit of practice to adjust it properly , but it 's easy to tell when you get it right .	1
This block plane is very similar to the old block plane I used to have . It is a working mans tool and will last for years . It has grinder marks on the sides and sole , but that does n't hurt the function . It is sharp to my surprise and only needs a little touch up to make it super sharp .	1
This is not the best quality but was fixable in about an hour . First the front adjustment bolt weld was pretty shabby . Lots of flashing . Filed down . Then the japaning spilled into the front opening . Had to make a jig and file throat and blade bed smooth and true . The base was warped ( cupped in the center ) Took a while but sandpaper took care of that . Blade dull , sharpened . One thing I ca n't fix is the two and 1/2 turns of play in the adjustment mechanism . I 'll have to get used to that . It actually looks like it is designed that way . Does n't much matter but shows a design that could use some improvement.. All told this is not what Stanley used to make but it has the basic design that makes it worth the twenty bucks or so after it is tuned up . Would I buy again ? sure . for twenty bucks it is serviceable .	1
If you 're a carpenter , you probably have one of these in your bag . If you 're not a carpenter , you should know that even in this age of all sorts of sophisticated power tools , there 's no replacement for a quality block plane . There 's no other tool that will shape and smooth wood as effortlessly and as accurately.For the price of a cheap , throwaway power tool , this is a precision tool that with care will outlast more than one owner . You can spend more , but the Stanley has all the necessary features- a decent blade , an adjustible throat and solid steel and brass parts . With a little tuning ( a half hour 's work with some sandpaper and a sheet of plate glass ) it 'll cut as well as the fancy $ 250 planes . For most woodworkers it 's probably the only hand plane they 'll ever need .	1
This is a hand plane that is precision made and molded to fit the hand flawlessly for perfect performance . I love it .	1
I could n't be happier . I should have bought this brand years ago . It 's heavy duty , easy to maintain , sharpen and use.I 've used it several times and it has performed better than I hoped for .	1
This is a good general purpose plane for trimming long grain edges and for chanfering . I recomend the low angle block plane for end grain work though . What really impressed me though was how tough it was . I accidently dropped it about 4 feet onto a concrete floor and it did n't have a scratch or crack on it .	1
Plan to spend an extended amount of time tuning this plane and sharpening the blade . I am operating on a very limited budget so I had to go with the cheaper route for my planes . I 'll have the plane set up nicely when I 'm finished with it , but it is a significant amount of work out of the box . The sole was n't flat , the mouth was n't square , the bed was n't flat , the blade ... . basically a butter knife , and it did take a good few hours to make it a decent tool . For a plane of this size , it was n't a huge effort , but it is an effort and it is time spent tuning rather than time spent working wood.If you can afford it , get the rabbiting block plane from a highly reputable name instead . If not , go ahead and get this one but do n't cry when it takes you hours to get it into good shape .	1
This was my first time using a block plane and I have nothing but praise for Stanley this time around . Product was in perfect condition . Though not ready to use out the package , I definitely understand the use of a block plane is a form of art and needs precision adjusting . Well , adjustment to my needs was simple and took only a few minutes . Instructions were not necessary.Used this to remove almost a quarter inch from a 2ft section of 2x4 . Worked perfectly , now i 'm perfectly FLUSH ! I will have this sturdy plane for a long LONG time .	1
Mine came without a flat bottom ( so did my expensive Veritas ) . Flatten the bottom and sharpen and this is a fine block plane . Do n't get me wrong - my Veritas is a much nicer tool with a much nicer blade but I keep this one adjusted differently and use it almost as much . In soft woods with a sharp blade the difference is not noticeable .	1
Stanley has been making planes for a long time . They do know what they are doing . I have a few of these around for general purpose work . I also have some Lie Nielsons and I love them but I keep them safe and out of reach of others ' . I do n't care who uses the Stanleys . I know if they get ruined , I 'm not out much . With a little tuning a stanley will do a respectable job . Lap the sole and the iron , put a good bevel on it and it will cut aggressively or produce a fine shaving . The adjustable throat is a must for avoiding tearout . I like the low angle version of this plane a little better . It is easier to control .It also makes a finer cut . It wo n't cut as deep however . To get a better plane you will have to spend at least twice as much so this is not a bad deal .	1
I purchased the plane even after reading the bad reviews . I have own many Stanley planes some antiques and son giving to me by my grandfather . I have always been very happy with them . So , I purchased this rabbet planer with the purpose of cleaning up the middle ridge made by a dado . When I first got the plane , like you need to do with all planes , I tuned it and adjusted it . The plane works great . I have been using it with no problems . It did take a bit of time to adjust . If you are not sure on how to adjust the plane or the tuning of it , you can e-mail Stanley 's service department and they will be glade to mail out the information on the model you have . I would and more then likely will purchase other Stanley plane in the future . I gave this four stars because nothing is perfect .	1
I received my rabbet plane on time in good condition.I first check to see if the surfaces were true , removedthe blade and set the block on a precision machined surface.Check for signs of visual light under the bottom . I foundsome checked with feeler gauges . The corners were high by0.0001 '' set plane on precision metal diamond sharpeningsytem medium grit , applied 3in1 oil in about 7 to 10 gentlestrokes bottom trued perfect . This is normal ! Machine toolsfor wood work are not hardened steel and can become a littleoff true flat from bumps in shipping and handleing . Afterbring the blade to the needed sharpness I found the use of thetool perfect as it was designed for . `` Love '' I it would recommendit to any accomplished wood worker . Great job Stanley	1
This vise is great for my woodworking bench . It installed easily and works like a dream . The quick release feature is really nice to have . My only beef is that the wood handle comes prefinished so that you can not glue the end caps on unless you use gorilla glue or something similar .	1
I made my workbench top 2 1/4 inches , which fit the vise perfectly . It mounted easily ( I clamped the vise to the workbench rather than using the template ) . Everything lines up well and the mechanism functions like it should . I wish I had taken the advice to put a couple of O-rings on the wood dowel before I glued the caps on .	1
I have now had my Jorgensen vise for a couple of years now & it works great , has a good casting & the jaws are aligned properly . Some of the other reviewers have had a problem installing the vise because the mounting surface of the rear jaw is n't parallel to the jaw face . While this was the case with my vise too , the fix & installation was easy & makes for a very secure installation . NOTE : The installation was easier to do with the bench on it 's `` back '' & the vise facing up . It 's kinda like glass bedding a rifle action . 1 : inlet the front of the bench to the thickest amount needed to get the jaw face flush with the front of the bench . 2 : clamp a straight 2-1/2 or 3 foot long 2X4 in the vise . 3 : make sure the vise fits the inlet by clamping the 2X4 to the front of the bench aligning the vise with the inlet & keeping the vice even with the top of the bench . 4 : remove the vise from the bench & use masking tape to protect all wood surfaces around the mounting area . ( and to protect any of the 2X4 from sticking to the bench ) . 5 : mix up a batch of epoxy & smear it all over the back of the vise & the inlet , align & clamp the 2X4/vise assembly back in place & let the epoxy set . 6 : remove clamps & tape and drill holes & install all bolts , washers & shims ( if necessary ) to secure the vise . I suggest gluing thick leather pads to the faces of the vise with contact cement . Leather protects the wood , is cheap , easy to replace & best of all takes up less of the jaw opening than wood faces .	1
I purchased this vise a couple years ago and I am pretty happy with it . I mounted it to my workbench and it holds material well . The only issue with this vise is how it is shipped . It is literally placed in a box with no padding/packaging and by the time it arrives at the door the box looks like it barely survived a war . Regardless , the vise is very heavy and solid and it was not damaged during shipping . I guess when a product is build like a tank you can just slap a shipping label on it and send it anywhere in the world unscathed .	1
I got this vise when it went on sale for $ 132.25 with free shipping . I am very impressed with the vise . It is well built with all the correct grinding and painting . It works very slick with the half turn counter-clockwise to unlock and clockwise to tighten.The vise has a coating of paint that comes off very easily . If you have a oil and grease free work bench and want to keep it that way , I suggest that you protect your bench . I used the carboard box lid to set the vise on before installing it . I also wore latex gloves . I like getting dirty , but I hate cleaning off grease and paint from my bench and from the beautiful woods that I work with.After reading the reviews , I made sure that I added 1 '' diameter `` O '' rings to the handle to prevent the wooden caps from breaking . The instructions say to make sure that the handle ends are sanded before putting on the caps . I sanded one end and glued on a cap . I used the vise to clamp the cap on while the glue dried . After a couple of hours in the vise , I removed the handle and drilled a hole in the end of the other cap and handle . I used a # 6 - 3/4 '' long round headed wood screw to fasten the cap on . If I need to remove the handle in the future , I can just unscrew the screw.The template for drilling the holes in the workbench looks like it has been photo-copied too many times . My template was off about an 1/8 '' of an inch . I did n't use the template to drill the four ( 4 ) mounting holes . With two ( 2 ) clamps and a 1 '' x 1 '' x 15 '' ( approximate dimensions ) piece of wood , I was able to clamp the vise to my bench securely and then drill the holes . This allowed me to visually adjust the position of the vise before drilling the holes . I used a center punchEmpire Level 2720 Automatic Center Punchto make sure the holes were marked in the correct spot , before drilling.The shipping box arrived pretty well beat up . Fortunately , the vise did not mimic the condition of the box . It `` took the shipping and kept on ticking '' ! ( Sorry , I just could n't pass that one up ) . The vise was in excellent condition , in spite of the shipping box.I used the vise today and found that it worked very well holding a piece of wood that I was using a wood chisel on . Nice and smooth with a tight hold.As I mentioned , I am very impressed with the vise . I am looking forward to using this vise until it passes to my will .	1
I 've used the Jorgensen Bar Clamps for years . Bought some other clamps as they were cheaper . Over the years I know when I am picking up a Jorgensen Clamp . Fit and finish does well in my workshop which rusts tools ! Needed a good vise . It was highly rated and I am impressed by the company . Have yet to install it but it looks well made and it is sturdy.Down side is they need to have a better set of instructions . Ca n't find anything when I Google it . Some You Tube Videos by ambitious woodworkers , but companies should be doing it !	1
A well engineered product released after they 'got the bugs ' out . Does n't sound very American . Jorgensen has a well known reputation and they seem to want to maintain it . The metal is clean , all parts align and the size and weight are a good mix for most applications.I would only suggest two additional things . The handle 's end caps do n't fit well ( sometimes ) . Do not force them on or they will split . Lightly taper the handle and either screw , glue or do both . 'J ' could send 3 to avoid user problems . Secondlyly , I would like to 'J ' supply a pair of hard wood inserts for the steel jaws . TJS	1
This is a very nice vise . It is truly heavy duty and seems to be well made . The template was no help as a guide for installation as the holes did n't line up on the face . I held the base in place with Irwin clamps and used a center punch to mark the hole location . The installation screws/bolts were included . I also felt that the handle was a little on short side , so I cut a hardwood dowel to 16 inch length and attached the end caps that were provided . The quick release feature is wonderfully clever and easy to use . I attached maple faces to the vise using the threaded holes on the base and the through holes on the front	1
I 'm very pleased with the quality of the workmanship of how this woodworker 's vise is made ! Only complaint would be that the installation instructions are not real clear .	1
Sturdy , heavy , and machined well . It 's easy to use . Mounting it to my bench was straight forward and only required one person , though two might have added some efficiency . Wish they had supplied a way to affix the bar-end caps - I ended up using some tiny wood screws , but it was n't as simple as it might have been had there been a pre-engineered method .	1
it is a belt with sand on it . it sands my wood . and that is about that . more words more words more words	1
I bought this product , it works there is n't much more I can say . I would buy this product again	1
I ordered the 3 x 21 and am very satisfied with the durability of the belt . It tends to be very aggressive longer than some and cleans quite well with the crepe cleaners available for such a purpose . Stands up to the heat of a prolonged run . I will buy more when I get through the box .	1
This will clog just as fast as any other paper I 've used on shellac .	1
The purple belts does me the best job they last a long time I will tell my friends to get the purple belts	1
Fantastic sanding belts with much more life in them compared to others I 've used . I will be buying these exclusively .	1
I love the purple sanding products , they last a long time in any application and clean up easily with a sanding stick . I have multiple grits and they all work.Pat	1
These are excellent cutting , non clogging , long lasting belts . I am running hundreds of board feet through before a change is required .	1
These may cost a bit more but they last and save time not to mention money . Use them to remove material that has not been coated with any type of VOC poly or paint and they will outlast other types of belts . They are too good to use in a situation where heat and goo will clog the grit . Better to use a cheap belt first then go to these for efficient quality removal . Clean the belt often with a belt cleaner especially if you think it is getting so hot that it is melting the finish instead of abrading it .	1
I do woodcrafts , and this works great on my 4 1/2 & # 34 ; orbital sander and my sanding blocks . Will be buying more of these .	1
This paper is excellent quality and the length is going to be saving us money time and time again vs. purchasing sheets from the home improvement stores here in town .	1
I have been using this all week with a sanding project I am doing with garden furniture ... they work great ... stick amazing.. and last a long time ... Great productI have been using this with Trade Associates AF44L 7 Piece Dura Block ... they work great together	1
JUST STARTED USING THIS AND SO FAR i LOVE IT . GIVES MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR CHANGING OUT GRITS ON MY SPINDLE SANDER . STICKS TO SPINDLE BETTER THAN PRE-FORMED ONES .	1
I do n't know what I and my guys would do without having this for our finish work in remodeling places . It so convenient and the price is right .	1
I have a very old ( 20 plus years ) Craftsman 1/4 sheet sander . I got it because you could cut down full sheets and clip them to the sander . Well after 20 years the clips are just plain worn out and no longer hold the sheets in place . Well 1/4 sheet adhesive backed paper is WAY too expensive , and I have not found any full sheet sticky back . I was just about to toss the sander in the garbage when I stumbled across these rolls . I decided to give them a shot and I 'm so glad I did . The adhesive sticks well to even my 20 year old rubber pad . The sandpaper is very durable and long lasting . I 'm using this mainly for wood , but wo n't hesitate to go after metal or fiberglass ( should the need arise ) . At only 20 cents a pop this is one of the most economical adhesive backed options around . I 'm gon na have to order a couple other grits cause this stuff is great .	1
if you are doing a large project this is the most cost efficient method for sandpaper . only downside is you must cut it in the right form to fit your sander .	1
This sandpaper is probably the best I have used in 25 years . The grit is even , stable , and quite long lasting . I use this primarily on wood . I have some paper on blocks , electric sander , as well as free hand on the lathe . The glue backing performs very well .	1
Works good for my 4-1/2 & # 34 ; orbital sander . I build wood crafts and this can be used to stick to sanding pad or on your sander . Low dust build up makes it last longer the most papers .	1
the adhesive does not stick to wood as much as I would like it to . The pieces come off too easily .	1
This is an excellent product easy to use on my three block sanders . I keep all grits in stock . The adhesive does not dry out .	1
I buy sandpaper by the box , and have burned through many boxes . But only recently did a friend mention this adhesive-backed paper , and I 'm glad he did . Durability-wise , it performs considerably better than regular sand paper , but what makes it so useful is the adhesive back . Here a few random points:1 . Less waste - you adhere a piece to the face of your sanding block , and do n't have to wrap any paper around the sides . Result - you use 100 % of the paper for sanding2 . For precise sanding , stick a piece of this paper at the very edge/corner/whatever of a sanding block , and you use the straight edge to get into tight corners , etc.3 . Need a third hand ? Stick a piece of the paper to a piece of wood and clamp that wood to your workbench . Then , for small pieces , use both hands to slide the piece back and forth over the flat ( and immobile ) sandpaper . Hint : cut a piece or two of the paper and adhere to the `` top side '' of the piece you are sanding . This gives you great grip on the top as you slide the piece back and forth over the horizontal paper . Update : I found an old sample floor tile - it was very smooth and now serves as a great flat sanding surface with adhesive sandpaper ( plus I can clean off residual adhesive easily with lacquer thinner ) Eventually the `` stickyness '' gives out on the paper - especially for the `` gripping '' pieces mentioned above , after you swap them a few times . The grit is still good , but the pieces wo n't stick . I use them like regular paper then.I bought several different grits , and use both sides of several boards to stick on successive grits .	1
We do alot of sanding of furniture . This roll was purchased to fill a temporary void , before I would purchase from our regular supplier . It was supprising that it was such a superior quality , lasting as much as twice as long as our previous paper . Highly recommended.Jerry/Windsor House Furniture	1
Very good and well made product etc , I use it to prepare surfaces for painting and other uses as well .	1
I use a lot of sandpapers for my wood toy works but thisadhesive-backed sanding roll is so far the best solutionsfor various applications I will continue to find.I bought 120 grit and 320 grit Porter-Cable sanding rollsand I am definitely happy with both of them . In additionto the adhesive-backed feature , which I find very useful , they also seem to last much longer than other conventionalsandpapers.Highly recommended !	1
Works pretty good ! Arrived on time as scheduled . The sand paper seems to last and last . I highly recommend this product .	1
Exactly what I was needing and at a price that ANYONE can work with ! This paper would cost about 4 times as much from any hardware store . If you are needing some of this , ... get it here !	1
This sandpaper is probably the best I have used in 25 years . The grit is even , stable , and quite long lasting . I use this primarily on wood , but also use as a flat stone to sharpen my hand chisels . I have some paper on blocks , electric sander , as well as free hand on the lathe . The glue backing performs very well .	1
Paper works fine . I bought for getting nicked chisels back to a useable state . Unfortunately when I went to pull it off the granite slap it left all the paper and adhesive behind . Took quite a while to get off . I 'll have to stay with the 3M version instead .	1
Porter Cable Paper for pad sanders . Nice quality paper , seems to last a while . Decent Value . Would highly recommend to anyone .	1
Best stickyback sandpaper I 've used . Sticks to my 20 year old craftsman palm sander pad very well . Papaer is long lasting and rarly clogs ( unless your sanding stuff like resin oozing pine knots ) . I love this stuff and it is soooo much cheaper than all that precut junk . I 've used this and the 80 grit and they are both really awesome .	1
Mirka has been a good brand for years.. Very steady with grade . Would recomend to anyoneI am a woodworker of 21 years . Mirka has a good line and with the name I would trust a product that I never tried before .	1
small packages run out quicker - - then , you have to STOP what you are doing , GO to the store , and BUY MORE .	1
Now that Amazon sells most of Mirka products for my power tools , I am very pleased with these products . The price is reasonable and I use Mirka for my belt sander and two 5 '' Orbital sanders . Hope this helps .	1
We use these daily for all of our finish woodworking . Packed in a durable box and good price . Mirka always put out a great product .	1
Bought a box of this to go with my PC 343 sander . Do n't make the same mistake as I did . The PC 343 is 8 hole . This sandpaper is 5 hole ! But other than my mistake in ordering it , I have used it with the PC343 and it sands and sands and sands ! The paper is heavyweight and last a lot longer than what I was using with my C-backed 3M sander . Picks up dust reasonably well considering I am only using approx 2 or 3 out of the 5 holes . Probably the best sand paper I have used in a long time.Price is alright if you are buying just one box . I have found suppliers selling it for $ 16 for all grits . If plan on getting several boxes or the higher grits , it is available from other online suppliers for $ 16 a box ( Plus $ 6 shipping ) . Just do some surfing , you may get better deals from time to time with store promotions .	1
Works great on my Porter Cable 333 . Not a failure in the box . High quality	1
When I first bought my Bosch 3727DVS , I bought a box of the popular grades ; 80 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 220 , and 320 . The 100 , 120 , and 150 are the most frequently used.To tell you the truth , I rarely use the 320 . I just went through over 50 boards of 80+ inch cedar , in three grades , and I only used about 10 sheets all combined . That is about 3 for each grade . The advantage to quality paper , is that you can get in a groove with some consistency . Instead of having cheaper paper that gives you the new disc agressiveness , then quickly to the used paper smoothness , which may be a grade finer , and miss the deeper lines from the coarser grade of paper in the previous step . Additionally the backing paper is stiff enough to do the job . That way you do n't wind up with a buggered edge on your sander . The 6 or 8 hole paper is nice for the dust free environment . I simply attach a 2 1/2 '' vac hose to the dust port on my Bosch , which is way smaller than that , so a lot of air escapes . The vacuum draw that leaks around the inlet , sucks up that last 1 % of the dust coming off the paper . It is still recommended to wear a mask because the shop vacs only capture to a micron or so . So technically you have a vac system that is actually a mini-part of a micron , invisible dust manufacturing plant . Over time , even that is a consideration . A good respirator , not a paper mask is advisable . A fresh air system is even better.I had a body shop for 20 years , and after using the cheaper paper on the random orbit sanders , and winding up with a floor full of used paper , I can attest to the savings of using quality , aluminum oxide paper . It is actually cheaper , in addition to doing a better job . Highly recommended .	1
Been using this product for years . Stands up well . Still need to shop for decent price . Good value although I 've bought it cheaper .	1
Mirka has an outstanding H & amp ; L product . The 100 grit cuts extremely well , has tremendous lasting capability and is easily reusable many , many times .	1
Fit my Porter Cable 390k sander perfectly and stay attached . careful , these with remove material quickly ! I bought 3 grits .	1
I have purchased every grit of Mirka sanding disks from Amazon , and I find them to be good quality . The price per disc works out to be a great value if you purchase them in packs of 50.I used these disks on my Bosch random-orbit sander . The hook-and-loop backing is strong and holds on through rough sanding . The aluminum oxide sanding material lasts for a good amount of time . I 've used them on a variety of wood surfaces , and I have used them to remove paint , and they last long enough to take down a lot of material . I have bought other brands of sanding discs that do last longer , but the Mirka discs definitely hold up well.The discs are packaged in a sturdy box with a cover , which makes it easy to dispense them as needed . Also , having them stored in a box keeps them clean , which helps the hook-and-loop function . This actually helps out a lot in the shop . Other brands come wrapped in plastic , and you have to find a container for them , or let them sit on a shelf and get full of sawdust . I appreciate this extra touch.The paper stock is somewhat thin , but this does not really affect their use . Since they are stored in a box , they stay flat . Other brands , which are stored in bags , get curled up on the edges.Bottom line : these are good quality sanding discs that last for a good amount of time , are a good value for the money , and are packaged in a convenient way .	1
Good sanding pads and a good value for the number you get . They work well with my DeWalt orbital sander .	1
Most of the big box stores used to carry this paper , but they have switched brands . I have been using this paper for general purpose sanding of pine , and it works great . For a while I was buying paper from HomeDepo and I was using more then one sheet for each cabinet door . With this paper , I can sand three doors with one sheet . I use different cloth backed disk for hard woods , but most of my sanding is done with Mirka paper . Put this stuff on an air sander and you can cut your sanding time in half .	1
I do a lot of woodworking and this is the only brand of paper I use . Leaves a very nice finish	1
This is my third box of this stuff , and I do n't see any reason to buy anything else . I have used a few brands of discs . most are OK. this is as good as any , and better then most . paper is nice and thick and holds up well . the stuff stays sharp . There are better brands , but they tend to be about 75 cents a sheet . This stuff also beats the pants off the crud you get at HD too	1
Bulk sandpaper for an orbital and cheap too . Use this brand professionally . Good value good performance . I have used on a craftsman and Bosch orbitals	1
These sanding discs are a great value , best disc I have found at this price . Seem to last as long or longer than much higher priced discs . the hook & loop surface has great gripping strength , never had one come loose from sander .	1
Been using Mirka sandpaper for years . Seems to last just as well as the more expensive stuff.Far cheaper than buying it at the Big Box stores .	1
I spent over an hour trying to decide which paper to buy this round . I really hate spending money on sand paper , but it 's so important . I 'm a hobbyist woodworker.I decided to take a change on Mirka because of the reviews and I was thrilled with the decision . I bought a box of each grit . This paper works just fine . As well or better than my Norton in my nonscientific evaluation . I used it extensively on a walnut blanket chest project over the course of several days and found it to be quite durable.You will not be disappointed with this paper !	1
I have been using these discs for years.I really like the diapenser pack box . It keeps them in until you pull one out . The paper cut very well and lasts reasonably long . Better can be had but you 'll spend a lot more for them . Use these until they lose their edge and slap a new one on . If your time is worth money you will save by throwing a worn pad away instead of trying to wring the last bit of life out of it . As another reviewer already said , with these you can afford to throw them away . I plan on ordering more pretty soon in several grits .	1
I like to get the boxes of sand paper so I do n't run out . These match my Dewalt DW421 just like they are suppose to.They line up easily and are easy to attach and detach later . But they stay put while in use.100 grit is about as rough as I like to go with a ROS . And that 's usually just for some light rounding .	1
These are so dang handy ... .no fuss pads . I love that . When I am in the middle of doing a project , I do n't want to sit there and fuss with handles and screws . It sticks to my orbital sander and when they no longer serve their purpose ... I pull it off and stick another on . So easy to use . Stays on my sander with no shifting whatsoever .	1
Mirka is far and away my favorite sanding disc . They are n't cheap , but they last ! The grit sizes are consistent , unlike bargain abrasives . There is nothing worse than finding a large grit in 220 or 320 grit paper , and it happens with cheap stuff ! I ca n't get these locally , but Amazon Prime and my iPhone app makes keeping them in stock painless !	1
I have used hundreds and hundreds of velcro sanding discs , first time with this brand . They hold up well ! Dont pack up with dust quickly , stay sharp for a good amount of time . The amount of discs you get is a great deal over buying them at the big box home stores ! I will order these for my woodshop again for sure .	1
I have used these in house painting prep many times ! Great product and the price is great ! I would recommend these to anyone : )	1

As my review stated on the 220 paper , this holds up really well also with minimal build up . I like the hook and loop style much better than the clip on square pads . Will buy this again .	1
These are really great sanding discs . I bought 50 of these for the price of about 10 in the hardware store . They wear well on wood products , and they stay firmly on my 5 '' orbital sander with the hook and loop fasteners . The holes in the center really do allow sanddust to be picked up easily by the dust collector . It makes a tremendous difference over solid sandpaper .	1
I 've used this Mirka sand paper for several years now and I can say it 's the best I 've used to date and I 've been a professional woodworker for many years . It holds up to a lot of usage with very little wear . It does n't clog either like many of the papers I 've used in the past , so I 'm highly recommending this sand paper .	1
Good price good quality and works great with my orbital sander . I could n't believe the price for 50 disc and work great .	1
The next step after 80 Grit or 100 Grit , I would then go with 180 Grit paper , then 220 Grit paper.Stain and lightly apply poly , let dry and gently hit with 300 , apply poly , and repeat two more times.Are n't Mirka products great ?	1
Pretty decent quality . Nice that it 's this large a package and the pads seem to hold up fairly well . Not as good as the black oxide type sanding discs but still works just fine for my various woodworking projects .	1
Speedy shipping and the 120-Grit Dustless Hook and Loop Sanding Discs look to be excellent replacement disks but I have yet to use one of them !	1
Best sand paper I 've ever used , does not clog like the cheap brands yet cost less then they do .	1
I am in the process of finishing a custom office in my home with a ton of custom wood work pieces . I was tired of purchasing the junk sand paper that is available at Lowes and Home Depot . So I went out and did some research on a few finishing forums and everyone recommended Mirka sand paper . Well all I can tell you that this is the best sand paper that I have ever used and I have used almost every sand paper on the market . If you are looking for great sandpaper for you next project look no further than Mirka.Mirka offer sand paper for almost ever tool and they offer sanders also . I have already decided that the next sander that I purchase is going to be a Mirka.Also before I forget the cost savings of buying Mirka sandpaper on Amazon vs buy the junk sandpaper at Lowes & Home Depot is Great ! ! ! !	1
I use them everyday , they last long , are strong , give me a good sandpaper and I am happy . These make me happy .	1
great stuff quantity and price the box stores are just a rip off . I use my sander alot in pipe making .	1
solid product for the price . works terrific on my orbital sander and it 's way cheaper than Home Depot or Lowes .	1
Sands well but seems to clog faster than other brands I have used . I use a lot of cedar which is oily and that may be the cause . Oak or other less oily hardwoods might be different .	1
great paper.this has been my standard for sanding since i bought my first orbital sander.i used up all of my paper but now ive switched over to diablo paper.it fits any 5 inch sander and compared to mirka with shipping diablo is about 25 cents cheaper per pad of paper.it also lasts longer.but either way mirka is just as good just a bit more expensive .	1
These guys do a great job on bare wood . The keep cutting and produce a nice finish . They tend to get gummed up rather quickly by paint or finish - but I am not sure it is any faster than other sanding product . I have bought these in a variety of grit and will buy more Mirka sanding products in the future . The value is terrific !	1
I have been using Mirka products for years and they never let me down . I can get quite alot of use out of one pad.Price is much better by the 50 pack than at the big box stores . I keep at least 4 grit grades around the house at all times.60 , 120 , 220 and 320 .	1
this paper work very well , 50 sheets for $ 1500 is a great value recommend this for all work in home and shops .	1
The sanding with this product is very nice and lasts a very long time . Worth the money.Timothy the tool man	1
Now THIS is sandpaper ! I bought several grits and used them on different woods and projects . Talk about FAST cutting and clean ! Trust me , once you use this stuff you 'll never waste money buying three sheets of domestic stuff for $ 5 . Look at how many sheets of this stuff you get for the price . And it easily lasts three times as long as the hardware store stuff does.Try it . You 'll stock up on it , just like I did . Great product .	1
I like to get the boxes of sand paper so I do n't run out . These match my Dewalt DW421 just like they are suppose to.They line up easily and are easy to attach and detach later . But they stay put while in use.It is much easier to get a smooth finish if you step your way up through the grits . Get them all and work your way up and you will get a nice smooth finish .	1
I have painted a bunch of houses now and these work great . I use them a lot and they hold up well .	1
I found them very good , and the price is excellent for the product . They lasted long enough to finish my work .	1
I 'm a woodworker and furniture maker and I 've been using these sanding discs for several years and think they 're great . Probably 90 percent of my sanding is with my DeWalt random orbital sander . I find that the 80 grit and 150 grit is all I really need to sand my furniture . I rough sand with the 80 grit and finish sand with the 150 grit .	1
The product was exactly as advertised and fit my sander just like brand name item but at a much less price .	1
Fit my Porter Cable 390k sander perfectly and stay attached . These worked great for doing seams of shaker doors . Bought 3 grits .	1
Good cheap sandpaper . Does clog faster than some of the more fancy stuff , but for the price , the quality is there ...	1
Compared to the prices in the big box home improvement stores this is a great deal . This is the second time I 've purchased this brand and they work well and are reasonably priced . I would recommend these and will buy again .	1
This is an excellent value if you 've got a lot of sanding to do . These are equivalent to more expensive brands , and much cheaper than what you 'd pay at a big-box store . We used them for sanding down wood trim and they were perfect for that application.Inexpensive , well made , and durable . Recommended .	1
After discovering the long lasting and performance of Norton 3X sandpaper , I never thought of buying any other brand . These Mirka sanding disks have changed my mind . I have every Mirka grit available for my random orbital sander .	1
I use this for sanding fiberglass on my surfboard and it is super awesome for getting it nice and flat	1
Great quality and finish sanding disks . Used these on a Porter Cable sander and worked extremely well . Costs a little more but worth it .	1

These hold up well . Sand nicely . And are at a good price . Did I mention they hold up well ? : )	1
This stuff is pretty nice . The grit is normal , holes line up , and it has nice velcro . You 're even able to reuse the same paper multiple times without the velcro getting too worn out .	1
The Mirka brand of sanding disks were delivered promptly and in good condition . The abrasive disks appear to be good quality , and fit the standard hook and loop 5 '' sanders . I ordered some in several grit sizes and all seem to be of good quality . I have only used one grit size so far , but it performed well . The cost of the Mirka disks was lower that several other brands , so if the performance is equal they should be a very good buy . Since I have n't used them to any extent at present , I ca n't really comment on how they compare to other brands , time will tell .	1
You would be better served if you did your shopping on eBay . I 've found this same item on eBay for half the price and `` free Shipping '' I just purchased one hundred discs for $ 14.00 and no shipping charges .	1
Pleased so far -- not the heaviest paper but seems to give good service for the price . Use more sheets than discs with heavier backing paper , but I tend to try to keep using those too long after the grit is worn out .	1
For my random orbital sander . About 1/5 the price on Amazon in this quantity then buying them in 5 packs at Lowes/HD .	1
Some years ago I stopped buying any sandpaper that was n't Norton 3X . It lasted 4-5 times longer that any other I had . I only used a finish sander and sanding blocks . When I purchased a random orbital sander and went looking for paper these looked like they were worth a try . They last so long that I probably have a lifetime supply ( I also bought all the other grits available ) . Most of my sanding is on raw wood . When sanding finished/stained wood ... well I have n't yet found a paper that does n't clog . Still use the Norton for all finish/block sanding jobs .	1
I find Mirka and 3M interchangeable . They 're both high quality abrasives which work very well for my little cabinet shop . Worth the extra money over some other brands .	1
the Mirkas hold up very well with very little build up and excellent edge wear	1
Typical sanding disk . Nothing else will do the job . These are much better than the Dewalt ones , they seem to load slower and smear finish less .	1
I have been using these for years they have always held up well . Most of my friends love them and buy them now also .	1
In comparing these to the Norton 3x sandpaper , it 's obvious that the latter lasts noticeably longer BUT it costs a fair amount more too . These discs are pretty good , and definitely good for the price . I make bed frames for a living and just sanded a walnut one with these . I think I used 3 discs . Granted , I did n't start at 120 grit ( my planer leaves a pretty good finish ) , but I probably would have used only one of the aforementioned more expensive discs . But I 'm back here buying another box of these because they do a good job and last a decent amount of time , certainly long enough to make them worth it.I wo n't buy any sandpaper that is n't stearated , disc or sheet or whatever , because it really does make a difference in how well it performs and how long it lasts . The sheet sandpaper from a certain discount tool store with a boat-dock-related word in its name is a total worthless joke compared to this stuff .	1
I love the hook and loop paper and this works well on my new B & D 5 # palm sander . With minimal build up this paper holds up a lot better than the cheap paper . I 'll purchase again .	1
Fine Quality as much use as any other for less than half the price.tight Velcro also.Will not fly off too soon	1
I use these in my Bosch sanding tool and was happy to see them available on Amazon for much less than I pay for them in local stores .	1
Fit my Porter Cable 390k sander perfectly and stay attached . Used this grit to prep shaker doors for painting . Did a nice job !	1
Make refinishing the kitchen table a snap . Good product . Good price and will buy more when I need them again .	1
I use Mirka for different grits of sanding - I am very please with this company and than goodness Amazon carries these type products . You will not be disappointed on product nor price . Hope this helps .	1
This brand of gold paper last far longer and clogs up far less then any I 've ever used.I have gone heads up with many people using a different brand and blew them away . After 10 min . of sanding poly the other brands were clumped up and were making scratches on the wood , mine still looked new !	1
I gave these to my daughter , a professional wookworker . She had them on her Wishlist . She used them but gave some to me to use . They worked and stand up just fine . A good investment .	1
I now use this sand paper exclusively , when it gets too worn out for the RO sander , it gets tossed around the shop for years , It just lasts forever , albeit at the next hightest grit .	1
I have used a lot of different sanding pads but theses are well above the rest . They really take a beating before they give out . That is not a general statement but fact . They last much longer then the normal pad . Very good grit quality . The mounting surface is very good also , very strong quality.I will not use any other brand from now on .	1
I have purchased every grit of Mirka sanding disks from Amazon , and I find them to be good quality . The price per disc works out to be a great value if you purchase them in packs of 50.The 220-grit discs do a great job leaving a silky finish on wood . I use them on cutting boards and table tops , and when you 're done sanding with the 220-grit , you are ready for applying finish.I used these disks on my Bosch random-orbit sander . The hook-and-loop backing is strong and holds on through rough sanding . The aluminum oxide sanding material lasts for a good amount of time . I have bought other brands of sanding discs that do last longer , but the Mirka discs definitely hold up well.The discs are packaged in a sturdy box with a cover , which makes it easy to dispense them as needed . Also , having them stored in a box keeps them clean , which helps the hook-and-loop function . This actually helps out a lot in the shop . Other brands come wrapped in plastic , and you have to find a container for them , or let them sit on a shelf and get full of sawdust . I appreciate this extra touch.The paper stock is somewhat thin , but this does not really affect their use . Since they are stored in a box , they stay flat . Other brands , which are stored in bags , get curled up on the edges.Bottom line : these are good quality sanding discs that last for a good amount of time , are a good value for the money , and are packaged in a convenient way .	1
Five star rating . My finishing crew can use up to 100 discs a week , these discs are as good as if not better then Norton Gold , far better then Gator , better then 3m as well as Makita .	1
This is the only sandpaper brand that i use . I like the different grits available and the finish it leaves	1
This is my 2nd 50ct box of these MIRKA 's that I have tried and I think they work well . They last better than most and the price is good .	1
In both vertical and horizontal applications the Mirka sanding disks stays put , does n't slide around and outlasts their competition . I used them on my Porter Cable Orbital sander with dust collection and I have n't experienced any clogs or dust accumulation around the holes . What else is there to say ?	1
I purchased this Mirka product , their assorted grid 50 pack and their wet-sanding 9 x 12 sheets in 4 grids . There are probably better sanding products than these but they are a good enough value .	1
First of all I have to say that the reason why I happen to be writing this review is because I was on Amazon ordering another box of these sanding discs ! There is no higher praise in my book than a return customer ! Now for the review : I have to agree with the other positive reviews and say that I have long been a fan of these Mirka sanding disks . I am a home woodworker whose projects range from DIY stuff around the house , to refinishing , to building fine furniture projects . I have been using these discs for years ( in every grit from 80 to 220 ) and could not be more pleased with the smooth surfaces they produce with my rather inexpensive sander.I completely agree with the assessment that although these are not the absolute best hook and loop discs on the market , they have performed every task I have asked of them . Overall , I would give this product an A- for quality/performance , and an A+ for value .	1
We have been using Mirka sanding products for a couple of years now . Very reasonably priced but last longer than the other bramds . I highly recommend all of Mirka 's products .	1
Inexpensive but the hook and loop lasts longer than the ones I purchase at my local hardware store.I purchased these to finish sand drywall and they do a good job . The holes line up perfect with the holes on my sander . When connected to my shop vac the dust is minimal while sanding drywall.I only wish I could get more life out of each pad . I may be expecting too much from a product at this price point .	1
I like to get the boxes of sand paper so I do n't run out . These match my Dewalt DW421 just like they are suppose to.They line up easily and are easy to attach and detach later . But they stay put while in use .	1
have switched all our sanders to mirka paper and have really been happy with the results ... the 320 is the last level of finish before you stain or btween coats on clear finishes .	1
Got this to sand some woodworking projects . Works really well with minimal buildup . I will surly purchase this again instead of the cheap stuff .	1
Before i would buy small 5-10 packs of these sanding pads at my local hardware store but i dont think i will be doing that again . They work very well and are lasting about the same amount of time as the other more expensive brands i have .	1
After seeing small packs of these at about a dollar a sheet , I was THRILLED to spy these on Amazon.com ! These are TOP quality and work EXTREMELY well . What pay more ! ? ! ? VERY happy with this purchase ! !	1
This is a real value for the money . These disks hold up well , and last a good while . Highly recommended .	1
Ive been using these Mirka disks for the last 2 years and have no complaintsthey work well and leave a smooth finish which makes my work look beautiful.When im done i save them to use on my wood turnings saving me money on turners tapeso they do double duty , I wont use anything else , price per disk is low and they work great .	1
For inexpensive sanding disks , these hold up quite well . Could n't find anything finer than 220 in stores . For me , this is almost a lifetime supply .	1
I get alot further with these discs than sanding by hand . They hang in there . Good construction and they last .	1
I 'm a Mirka fan and have been for a long time . This is my go-to brand and Amazon makes it easy .	1
I hade n't seen this fine grip paper before so I wanted to try some . For me it has really added some fine finish sanding capability that I did n't have before . Good value and long lasting paper .	1
Best sand paper I 've ever used , does not clog up and cuts really fast .	1
Great quality and last about as long as the home store ones , for a whole lot less money too . I recommend these sanding disks to all woodworkers and hobbyists .	1
Works as well as any sandpaper I 've tried and is very affordable in comparison . Even sanding water based poly , loading was n't a huge problem and longevity was good .	1
I have purchased every grit of Mirka sanding disks from Amazon , and I find them to be good quality . The price per disc works out to be a great value if you purchase them in packs of 50.With the 320-grit , you get an amazing , silky finish on your wood surfaces . You can stop sanding at 220-grit , but if you take another step to 320 , the wood really is beautiful to the touch ! I use these discs all the time on cutting boards and table tops.I used these disks on my Bosch random-orbit sander . The hook-and-loop backing is strong and holds on through rough sanding . The aluminum oxide sanding material lasts for a good amount of time . I have bought other brands of sanding discs that do last longer , but the Mirka discs definitely hold up well.The discs are packaged in a sturdy box with a cover , which makes it easy to dispense them as needed . Also , having them stored in a box keeps them clean , which helps the hook-and-loop function . This actually helps out a lot in the shop . Other brands come wrapped in plastic , and you have to find a container for them , or let them sit on a shelf and get full of sawdust . I appreciate this extra touch.The paper stock is somewhat thin , but this does not really affect their use . Since they are stored in a box , they stay flat . Other brands , which are stored in bags , get curled up on the edges.Bottom line : these are good quality sanding discs that last for a good amount of time , are a good value for the money , and are packaged in a convenient way .	1
I 'm glad that I purchased this since I do a lot of woodwork . Definitely bets getting from the blue or orange stores . : )	1
This product produces barely any dust and when paired with a DA that has a vacuum , virtually all the dust from sanding is eliminated ! Great sandpaper and I will stick with this brand !	1
I 'm using this on cedar furniture to get it super smooth and it works great . The paper is a bit thin so it can sometimes fold and crease when sanding across slats but I 've sanded several chairs and tables and outside of the first sheet folding because I was n't paying attention they have performed flawlessly . Plus , They seem to last quite a long time and I 've barely dented the box ; one sheet will easily last me about three chairs ( these are large , deep-seated slat chairs ) or 2 tables each . For comparison I go through about one sheet of 120 grit per chair and 1.5 sheets of 120 per table . I will buy these again and again , when I run out in a few years .	1
As I have said in previous reviews of this company 's products : I find Mirka and 3M interchangeable and other the extra couple bucks I pay . Quality is very consistent and the grit is ALWAYS & # 34 ; on the money. & # 34 ;	1
These discs provide a mirror smooth finish off my Dewalt orbital sander . Great for an oil or `` clear '' finish . The backing on them is high quality and they stay on the sander pad very well . They do n't last quite as long as the Norton 3X brand , but at this price , I 'd rather have a fresh disc more frequently anyway .	1
I 've been using Norton Brand for years just because it is readily available locally . When it came time to stock up , Mirka was recommended , so I decided to give it a try , especially since a 50-pack costs $ 17 , vs. $ 9 on a 10-pack of equivalent Norton Sandpaper.After using the Mirka for a few weeks , there is no comparison . The Mirka last longer and the 320 grit leaves a smoother finish than any other 320 grit paper I 've used . As I use up my Norton paper , I will be replacing it exclusively with Mirka H & L ; disks .	1
I like to get the boxes of sand paper so I do n't run out . These match my Dewalt DW421 just like they are suppose to.They line up easily and are easy to attach and detach later . But they stay put while in use.It is much easier to get a smooth finish if you step your way up through the grits . Get them all and work your way up and you will get a nice smooth finish.I do n't always go to 320 grit , but many of my projects have a more natural finish ( oil , shellac and wax ) so those really nice the 320 grit for a super smooth finish .	1
I 've used these discs for years now and consider them a bargain . Whether grinding fiberglass when doing boat repair or taking paint off an old door , these are all I 'll use . A major tool publication recently rated the popular brands , and when comparing sanding speed , durability and price , Mirka had nothing to be ashamed of.Great product , great service & quality I can depend on .	1
I have bought may different grits of the Mirka sanding disks for my orbital hook and loop sander and I must say that these are the toughest and most long lasting ones I have ever used . I had always purchased other brand name disks so these were the first Mirkas I had ever used . Believe me , there is NO comparisons between the other brands I have used and Mirka 's . If you can find a supplier who offers better longer lasting sanding disks , I would love to know their name and where to get them .	1
These are of very good quality and much more affordable than buying a package of 5 at home improvement stores !	1
Bought a box of these for paint removal and they work well , adhere to the sander perfectly and do n't clog up with paint too badly -- think I would get the 60 grit next time , however as it would take the paint off faster .	1
I bought three different grits of Mirka , and it was a great purchase . Will last for a while . High quality sandpaper . I like it a bit more than Freud .	1
I use these with theBosch 1250DEVS 6-1/2-Amp 6-Inch Random Orbit Sander with Vacuum Portand they work well . Mirka offers good quality sanding disks at affordable prices thus they have become my standard sanding disk . All in all , a recommended product .	1
I bought the Mirka 80 grit sanding disks based on the reviews I read . I must say they exceeded my expectations , they are the longest lasting discs that I have ever used .	1
When I first bought my Bosch 3727DVS , I bought a box of the popular grades ; 80 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 220 , and 320 . The 100 , 120 , and 150 are the most frequently used.To tell you the truth , I rarely use the 320 . I just went through over 50 boards of 80+ inch cedar , in three grades , and I only used about 10 sheets all combined . That is about 3 for each grade . The advantage to quality paper , is that you can get in a groove with some consistency . Instead of having cheaper paper that gives you the new disc agressiveness , then quickly to the used paper smoothness , which may be a grade finer , and miss the deeper lines from the coarser grade of paper in the previous step . Additionally the backing paper is stiff enough to do the job . That way you do n't wind up with a buggered edge on your sander . The 6 hole paper is nice for the dust free environment . I simply attach a 2 1/2 '' vac hose to the dust port on my Bosch , which is way smaller than that , so a lot of air escapes . The vacuum draw that leaks around the inlet , sucks up that last 1 % of the dust coming off the paper . It is still recommended to wear a mask because the shop vacs only capture to a micron or so . So technically you have a vac system that is actually a mini-part of a micron , invisible dust manufacturing plant . Over time , even that is a consideration . A good respirator , not a paper mask is advisable . A fresh air system is even better.I had a body shop for 20 years , and after using the cheaper paper on the random orbit sanders , and winding up with a floor full of used paper , I can attest to the savings of using quality , aluminum oxide paper . It is actually cheaper , in addition to doing a better job . Highly recommended .	1
These are some of the best and longest lasting sanding disks I have ever used . I also bought other grits and they all very exceptional .	1
I have a Ridgid 6 '' random orbital sander that I needed some paper for , it 's hook and loop and every local store I went to here only carries the 5 '' stuff . I did find some stuff at the local Home Depot but it did n't last nearly as long as the Mirka . This 50 pack is going to last a long time based on my success so far .	1
These sanding discs last longer than any other discs I have used . The price is very good and theydiscs for just about any sander you might have . I have gone through several boxes in the last few yearsand I would n't switch .	1
When I first bought my Bosch 3727DVS , I bought a box of the popular grades ; 80 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 220 , and 320 . The 100 , 120 , and 150 are the most frequently used.To tell you the truth , I rarely use the 320 . Local home centers sell the 5 '' variety , so if you are enjoying the additional cutting surface of a 6 inch , this is one of the best places to stock up.I just went through over 50 boards of 80+ inch cedar , in three grades , and I only used about 10 sheets all combined . That is about 3 for each grade . The advantage to quality paper , is that you can get in a groove with some consistency .

I have posted before about these discs but different grits . They are the best and longest lasting discs I have every used .	1
`` Works great '' . I have a Ridgid 6 '' random orbital sander that I needed some paper for , it 's hook and loop and every local store I went to here only carries the 5 '' stuff . I did find some stuff at the local Home Depot but it did n't last nearly as long as the Mirka . This 50 pack is going to last a long time	1
the disc work well they stay on the sander where you put them and have long lasting , good value for the money	1
These Mirka sanding discs work extremely well and last a long time . They are not for taking off much material ( use a coarser grit for any significant sanding ) and leave a very smooth and workable ( stain/paint ) surface .	1
Well , I use this for wood , it works well , it stays on great , and it has well-aligned holes . Ca n't say much more about it .	1
Mirka sanding disks are n't the highest quality -- there are other higher quality brands but cost much more -- but they are good ! And for the price they offer a great bang for your buck especially when you know you will be clogging them up.Mirka sanding disks are my go to brand -- good quality at great prices .	1
This is the second time I have bought these discs in varing grades.They last longer than any other discs I have used on all types of material .	1
Very rough paper , made sanding down the body on my 1981 Camaro Z/28 a breeze ! Would definitely recommend to a friend . Very sticky pads , no worries there .	1
They work great and seem to last for a long time.I use them on wood , steel , aluminum and many other items .	1
I am always trying to buy American made products when I can but every once in a while something so good gets imported that even I have to buy it . These discs are an example . Made in Finland . I was using 3M gold discs on a fender sanding down some paint and there was a little rust on it also . The 3M was doing decent job but then I put these on and it was literally night and day difference . These cut literally 2 times as fast even though are the same grit I am not sure how it is possible but the proof is in the pudding . Lasted longer also . Will definitely buy again .	1
You just ca n't go wrong with Mirka abrasives , so much better than the no-name cheapo stuff that may be less expensive due to cheap materials being used but they do n't last or work as well as Mirka . I 'll find somewhere else to skimp , I love quality abrasives too much to be stingy here .	1
THESE SANDING DISC ARE REALLY TOP OF THE LINE . THE ADHESION IS GREAT AND THEY REALLY GET THE JOB DONE FAST . YOU CA N'T BEAT THE QUALITY OR THE PRICE .	1
I needed something to remove and prevent rust on the cast iron table of my table saw . It sprays on kind of powdery . I must admit being a little skeptical . With a fine emery cloth , I was able to remove the light rust on the table . During the course of the hot humid summer here , no more rust has formed . I think I will use it one more time before winter hits . Do far , I am happy with it .	1
Have used this product for years and have never had rust on any of my woodworking tools . I do however have a pretty well controlled workshop ( relatively low humidity and good air movement ) . I use it 2 to 3 times a year and although it is expensive it does the job .	1
I 've been using top cote on my machine tops , metal fences and guides for about five years now . I live in western Washington and moisture here can be a problem . Especially when your shop is in the basement of a 80 year old house , on the shores of a lake.I have never had a problem with rust on my machine surfaces when I prepared them properly . The last step , I take , before applying the top cote , is to wipe the surface with alcohol . This removes any residual moisture and cleans the pores of the metal . Using a quality car wax will import silicon to your metal surface which in turn will transfer it to your wood workpiece . This can really cause problems with a lot of finish 's . Silicon is very difficult to remove from wood and will block penetration of most oil based finish's.It can also affect `` natural '' wax 's , such as carnuba and bee 's wax.The top cote layer does provide a nice slick surface and I have no difficulty telling when a new treatment is needed , especially when ripping hardwoods.I also use Dri Cote ( seperate review ) on my blades and cutters.I recommend this product to everyone , follow the directions on the can and you wo n't be disappointed .	1
This is a great product . I use in on all surfaces and fences on my table saw and shaper tables . Makes items glide easily over tool.Lasts a good while also .	1
This is the only product I will use on my table saw/wood working surfaces . Makes the service very slick and helps prevent rust . Love the product and have used it for many years now .	1
I have to admit I was a little skeptical of this product before purchasing it but I decided to order it to put me over the `` free shipping '' cut-off amount . I have not been disappointed . The various heads allow you to put the glue where you want it very efficiently . The dowel hole heads and pinpoint applicator have been great . Also the roller head is very efficient for large glue-ups as the glue is distributed evenly and results in very minimal squeeze out . The only thing you have to stay on top of is cleaning the heads as soon as you complete the assembly of your project . It is not a big deal and nothing more than running them under some warm water for a few minutes . You 're then ready to go for the next project . I keep it in a convenient spot on my workbench and would recommend it , especially if you are looking avoid to paying shipping charges .	1
I just used this kit for the first time . I was gluing some melamine sheets with Roo Glue ( specially made for melamine ) The set up time was 15 minutes , so I had a lot of surface area to cover in short order . This glue kit , using the glue roller did a nice job . It enabled me to cover a lot of surface area quickly . The amount of glue that is released is based on how much you squeeze the container . You can easily see the flow , so guesstimating is pretty easy.My only dilemma is when doing biscuits and glue edge joinery ; it is necessary to switch heads . When you are dealing with glue that is sure to get messy . So my quest is to find a dedicated biscuit joining glue bottle . That way I can use both at the same time without making head changes.I think this kit is a great idea . It might be all plastic , but is ideally suited for the purpose . Highly recommended .	1
This is simple and straight forward . The roller works very well ... I will tell you not to let the glue dry on the roller , while it may not stick to the roller it is not easy to get off once it does dry . When you are done take a couple of minutes and rinse off the roller in the sink.The rest of the attachments are a cool idea but the hassle of changing them out makes them less friendly to use than the standard nozzle on a regular carpenter 's glue bottle . I love the roller and use it all the time and that makes this item worth having but I would n't get excited about the other attachments if I were you .	1
I never really looked at a glueing project as being an art , but this glue set allows you to be a true artist . Just as a painter has to have the right paint brush for a project , this glue set gives you the right glue attachment for the project . And it has made all the difference in the outcome of that project . The right amount of glue is placed exactly where you want it , no drips , very little excess , no spill overs onto the main surface of the board.Each attachment , easily kept available and stored when you can find it , works with each specific project . Whether it is a dovetail , dado , bisquit spline , pinpoint or just joining two boards together , this set gets the job done.The wet well works just fine , keeping the glue & quot ; wet & quot ; and the bottle inverted for easy glue extraction , especially when the bottle is getting low.I did n't think I really needed this glue set , that there is not an art to glueing , that all those attachments were just extra & quot ; fluff & quot ; . I have learned my lesson , I REALLY enjoy being a glue artist , using the right tool and getting the project completed with NO glue overflow ! !	1
I like this set . I use the attachments for biscuits and pinpoint glueing . The attachments are easily changed . The roller attachment has an opening in the base for the glue and a integrated stopper when you 're done . The wet well is a nice touch.Its a nicely thought out unit ... and the price is right.Go ahead and give it a try .	1
The Big Horn 19119 All In One Glue Spreader Kit has everything you need to glue a variety of projects , well , almost everything , you do have to buy the glue ! Another reviewer said he would buy the kit just for the roller but I need to glue using a variety of applications so , I find the total kit very useful . Works with all types , Silicone Metal Glue And Seal , Franklin International Titebond II Premium Wood Glue , Carpenter Interior Wood Glue-4oz , Gorilla Glue Adhesive . I like it ! ~ The Boss	1
Great gift idea for the woodworker in your life . I use it often and got it on sale with free shipping .	1
I 've used this to apply woodworking glue to many projects . I find the roller is n't as useful as using a scrap of wood as a spreader , however the tips are very useful in situations where access is tight or visibility is an issue should dried glue remain . It 's worth the money .	1
I have used this glue for a number of projects , but it is a little difficult if you have a large area to spread glue on or a complex assembly to line up ; it sets fairly quickly and gives you a very strong joint.The biggest gripe I have is trying to clean up squeeze out , especially in inside corners . A wet towel will pick it up if you work quickly , but that tends to spread a thin coat of glue on a wider area . Scraping the wet glue up with a little shingle seems to work a little better . After it is dry , the wood that has even the smallest amount of this glue on it will not take stain evenly . The only solution is to sand or use a cabinet scraper to get to a layer with no glue.Overall , this is a good , strong , versatile glue , but you should try to limit squeeze out to avoid cleanup problems . If you are going to paint your project , it is no problem , but if you want a natural wood look , this looks unnatural . I prefer polyurethane glues that do take stain ( such as Gorilla , available on Amazon ) when doing natural wood projects . Polyurethanes are also better all weather glues . They have a whole different set of quirks which I explained in my review of Gorilla Glue .	1
Rarely does a woodworker need or go through a gallon of wood glue with a project or two . It may seem cheap to buy a gallon but if you do n't use it before it goes south ; it 's a waste.This may be a little small for some projects but it is a good sized bottle . And I have when planning to go on a major binge of work ; bought a gallon and refilled this size container as needed.It will get 'crusted over ' with time and need replacing now and again , but I can easily pour three gallons through one of these before I decide on 'replace the squeezy bottle'.That being said , Titebond II is a glue I turn to for a lot of things . I have used it for craft as well as wood ; especially in making padded upholstered display panels . ( smear onto plywood , lay 1/2 to 1 & # 34 ; closed cell foam over it , put another piece of luan and a few carefully spaced concrete blocks to dry overnight ... ) It will adhere the foam to the backer board , to then be covered . I have also glued upholstery fabrics to the top of said foam with it , leave about 4 & # 34 ; unglued of the foam around the edge , then tuck fabric into place , glue , recover and reweight for the night ; and it will turn out well . Test bleed , it can bleed through and make stiff.I go though a lot of Titebond II , the other is the polyurethane 'foaming ' glues that are water activated . This is a good size unless you are after a large project , in which case buy a larger jug and use one of this size as a handleable 'field squeeze ' bottle . This is a definite go-to glue for me , and in the ways I do wood and other projects , a glue I reach for . Do keep it from freezing !	1
Dries fast and semi clear . I use it to glue figured tops on guitar bodys and havent had any problems yet .	1
Works very well . Franklin also has an & quot ; extended & quot ; open time version of Titebond II and its original formulation . If you 're like me , the longer open times allow for much less hurried glue ups . I hope that Amazon considers carrying the extended versions !	1
This glue is the standard for most woodworking hobbyists . I buy this size bottle rather than bulk so that it gets used up in a reasonable period of time . There is generally a one shelf life for this type of glue to be most effective .	1
Perfect glue for trim applications because its not runny which is a must . The 16oz is probably more than i need as I use it exclusively for DIY projects .	1
This glue seems to be a staple amongst professional woodworkers . I like the bottle design , which squirts the glue in a more controlled fashion and is easier to clean . Here is my summary of pluses and minuses:1 . This glue is very strong.2 . The glue sets very quickly , so you have less working time.3 . If you get a lot of squeeze-out , it 's difficult to clean the glue off the wood . Heavy sanding is necessary to remove traces of the glue.But if you are careful , this glue pays off .	1
I use it all the time . I do a lot of wood art and crafts . I love the short tack time and the final cure strength .	1
Always use this glue for woodworking projects in my shop . It seems better than any other brand on the market .	1
Titebond I , II or III ? You want this one . Plenty of time to apply and then clamp & # 34 ; work time & # 34 ; but still has enough tack for set-up . It 's water resistant where Titebond I is not . If you need water-proof , get Titebond III , but it 's a lot more expensive . Just remember to use a wet cloth to remove any 'squeeze-out ' after you clamp . Sanding off glue residue is time consuming and frustrating . There is nothing better on the market to glue wood than Titebond II .	1
I have been buying this glue in this exact quantity for years now and I am here to say that it is an absolutely great performer . Though I have used polyurethane glues and epoxy ( I have yet to try the new Titebond III ) , this Titebond II is the glue I turn to 99 % of the time . It has never let me down in any application - I build mainly indoor furniture and jigs.Once cured , the strength of this glue is consistently stronger than the wood around it . I have had good luck with letting it dry and scraping the squeeze-out away with a sharp chisel and/or a flexible putty knife . After sanding I have had no problems with splotchiness in finishes.I made the mistake of buying too much of this glue at once a few years ago and learned the lesson that it will go bad over time . Now I always buy this glue in these bottles and never have problems.Highly recommended !	1
I really like PU ( PolyUrethane = Gorilla ) Glues for certain jobs even though they can be messy , but for gluing wood to wood , you simply ca n't beat Titebond II or IIIFine Woodworking Magazine # 192 showed that aliphatic wood glues are almost TWICE as strong as PU glue.Titebond II or III are the best of these in my opinion . I 've been a woodworker for about 30 years . There are other brands of wood glue ( Elmers , etc ) which are close , but the small difference in price is nothing compared to the cost of the wood or the hours I put into a project . Interestingly enough , common yellow glue is as strong as this stuff is , but I 'm willing to spend a bit more for the water resistance . You never know when something will get wet.Titebond III is almost twice as expensive but you do n't gain a whole lot except longer work time . Technically Titebond III is waterproof while Titebond II is water resistant , so if you 're making something that will be submerged in water regularly ( wooden deck on the back of a boat ? ) then you will want III . Patio furniture ? II is fine.It also cleans up nicely with water . After a brief fling with PU glues I 'm back to wood glues for wood.One thing - DO N'T LET IT FREEZE ! ! ! It will last for years if kept cool and dark but it will be toast if it freezes . Do n't ask me how I know this.If you have found this review helpful , please let me know !	1
When you glue properly prepared joints with Titebond , they stay glued . Easy cleanup with water and waterproof when dry . Everyone uses it . Dries yellow , so you need to be sure to clean up any runs or overages .	1
Worked for me filling small and big splits in a walnut table . Built it up in layers stainning as I went . Finished with layered , stained filler . Respectable finish .	1
I use it for glue my wood that I use on my Lathe..This glue works great and even the top works real good for opening and cutting off the glue .	1
All the projects I have built was glued with Titebond II.Better then any other glue I have used .	1
This company makes the best wood glues that you can buy as far as I 'm concerned . There are 3 levels for various degrees of stress/moisture .	1
Seems like its just fine not a knock off . Was a little hard to open but thats probably a good thing . Means its fresh.READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.I was gluing a basket to my dashboard of my car to attach my android otterbox case to so I can use it as a gps and we used WAAAY too much . IT WAS OUT FAULT THO . Your supposed to leave space around it so it expands and it does . Ours leaked all out the sides and messed up the dashboard . Got most of it off and it was covered by the second try anyway but almost ruined the ventalation duct when I caught a drip just before i went in .	1
There are a couple complaints from people saying how the glue did n't work on some other materials ... like stone or ceramic . That 's not what this stuff is for ... it 's for wood . Use it on wood , it 'll do well . Very well.The wood needs to be mildly moist , as this stuff reacts to moisture . The wood needs to be clamped , as this stuff expands . It 's polyurethane foam , for the most part . I have n't found another commercially available wood glue that works half as well as this does for it 's intended purpose .	1
If you need glue to fix most anything and your do n't car what it looks like , just not to fall apart . . . well . . this glue is for you . It foams and fills before it dries . Make sure you put something under the object being glued becasue when it foams outside the joint , the object will be glued to whatever surface it is sitting on . I highly recommend the product .	1
Bought this as part of my 'get home kit ' that I keep in my truck . Would definitely purchase again for a second 'get home ' kit .	1
It sticks like crazy to most surfaces . I bought these smaller packs as it tends to go off when opened . For anything that really needs to hold this is my goto product . Note this stuff foams a bit so not ideal for decorative joins but otherwise awesome.TIP if contact between surfaces is n't tight , spray a little water on ; it will make the glue foam up and bridge any small gaps .	1
8oz Original Gorilla Glue . This is a good strong glue . I use the full line of Gorilla products . I can always count on the quality of their products .	1
Good : Extremely strong bond . Versatile over many types of surface applications . I glued the foam back together on a set of Oakley ski goggles two days ago . Slope tested yesterday , it worked excellent.Neutral : Water activated . You have to wet one side before applying it . Limited shelf life-squeeze the air out each time , and next time I 'd probably buy the 4oz version unless you 're using it constantly , because it goes a long way.Bad : Foams a lot for a glue , and has a tendency to squeeze out from tiny cracks under compression . This means you have to sit and monitor it and wipe off the foam as it comes out . Silly boy you say , just use less glue ... .I did ! I had about twenty feet of a finished wood extender to put on our new kitchen cabinets to we could get the crown molding to fit . By the end , I 'd learned to put the glue on towards the back of the piece so it did n't squish out the front , and was using a very thin bead as well.Bottom Line : If I had two pieces of something to glue together and did n't worry about seeing some glue lines , I 'd reach for this . If I had something I planned on showing a finished face on , I 'd use regular wood glue . Depending on the strength I needed , I might use this , but I 'd be very , very careful , otherwise you could wind up with a hard foamy mess on a finished surface .	1
I have restored many old desks which I acquired from a local University surplus auction . These oak desks were very good quality , but they unfortunately had an ugly black top on them . I am unsure of what the black surface is , but it seems to be some sort of plastic/synthetic . After stripping the desks and removing the edge trim from the tops , I used Gorilla glue to attach furniture grade oak plywood to the black surface . After making a new edge banding and using traditional finishing techniques , the desks look like a million bucks . I experimented with other adhesives , but found Gorilla glue to be the absolute best for strength , working time , and cost . There is a bit of ooze-out when clamping pressure is applied , but I just wait for the glue to dry and scrape the hardened seepage with a chisel befor sanding . I highly recommend this glue ! ! !	1
This type of Gorilla Glue is a reasonable glue for crude jobs where you wish to fill small cracks . It is not a good glue for situations you want to sand over wide cracks to get a smooth surface.Gorilla Glue 50008 is a urethane glue , so it resembles honey . It is sticky and messy . The cap on this particular product can be conveniently left attached to the bottle by a plastic strip so you wo n't loose it , but if you leave it attached you 'll find the cap inconveniently springing back in front of the spout as you are squeezing out glue.The fact that urethane glue is messy is significant because it sticks well to skin and wo n't completely wash off even before it hardens . On your skin it quickly picks up dirt and becomes a dark crusty patch . You end up with hands that look lilke a mechanic 's but you ca n't wash them like a mechanic - not with Lava Soap , mechanic 's hand cleaner , acetone , or brake fluid cleaner . Gorilla glue has never irritated my skin . It 's just a cosmetic problem . You have to let it wear off , which takes about 4 days . There is no practical way to clean Gorilla Glue out of fabrics . If you want to keep your hands clean , put lotion on them and use rubber gloves . Expect drips of glue to fall on the work table and on the floor and remain sticky for hours.Like honey , Gorilla glue becomes viscous in cold weather . When the glue gets cold , seconds tick by before you can begin to squeeze glue out of a half empty bottle because you must wait for it to flow down to the spout . So it 's best to store the glue indoors.With its cap on , Gorilla Glue stores well for months . Getting the cap off may require a gentle twist with pliers , but the spout and cap are a durable plastic and they can take it . The dried sheet of glue on them comes off cleanly . ( For this reason , I do n't recommend trying to glue such plastic with Gorilla glue . ) The scenario for a good glue job with an old fashioned hide glues is well known . The things to be glued are supposed to fit together `` naturally '' and tightly . There are n't supposed to be cracks . The pieces should have `` clean dry '' surfaces . You apply glue to both surfaces . You spread the glue out o a even film on both surfaces , not simply squirt a squiggly bead of glue . The surfaces are clamped together with the `` appropriate pressure '' . This means they are n't clamped so tightly that it builds up stresses that will spring apart when the clamps are released . You can wipe excess old fashioned glue off when it is wet . Some say it is easier to wait until the glue is leathery but not hard and peel it off with a chisel.Some of the old fashioned scenario does n't apply to urethane glue . It 's best that pieces fit together naturally and tightly . Gorilla glue tolerates moisture and , in fact , the directions say that the surfaces should not be too dry . Ideally one would spread the glue evenly on the surfaces , but this is a messy job . Since Gorilla glue foams as it dries , it somewhat spreads itself out . It does n't spread to a miraculous extent . If you pull apart surfaces that were glued with squiggly beads of glue , you will find patches that are bare.After you clamp pieces together you can wipe off excess Gorilla glue and this somewhat helps in the final cleanup . However , more glue will ooze out as you wait for the glue to harden and that takes overnight.As well as flowing for a long time , urethane glues foam . Gorilla glue foams slightly more than Elmer 's `` Ultimate '' urethane glue . ( Urethane glues do n't foam to the extent of urethane foam sealants that you buy in spray cans . ) You have to clamp things together securely or the foaming action will push them apart.You can not wait till Gorilla Glue is leathery hard and peel the excess off because after a blob gets a hard surface the inside remains tacky for a long time.The hardened foam of excess glue is dense . It 's tougher than styrofoam . A belt sander makes quick work of sanding it off if you sand it all off . ( If you only sand the top off the foam , you 'll just expose the insides of thousands of glue bubbles . ) In places you ca n't reach with a sander , excess glue can be chiseled off. , but it leaves a fuzzy reside that must be sanded off by hand . You can leave the excess glue if you are n't concerned about appearance , but direct sunlight darkens it and makes it deteriorate.I often use Gorilla in simple carpentry projects that are held together with both screws and glue . I trust the screws to hold things together . The Gorilla Glue mainly serves the purpose of filling the gaps in joints that are too small to fill with wood filler . I find it a good product for this purpose.Gorilla Glue sticks to itself unlike glues like Titebond . Theoretically , you can touch up a Gorilla Glue job by adding more glue . I never do this since I 'm not relying on Gorilla Glue to hold things together.I rate Gorilla Glue 4 stars out of 5 as a filler of small cracks .	1
Gorilla Glue is a synthetic polymer ( polyurethane in fact ) glue that has some very useful characteristics including the ability to squeeze itself into small material pores . I 've used it for well over 10 years for outside construction in the desert SW heat and it has never failed . I tend to glue external 2-by construction as well as screwing because the screws loosen with aging/degradation of the wood . The addition of GG adds years of useful life to the wood . In several cases , I 've found that even treated wood starts to degrade while the GG joint remains sound . In wet applications , I 've found that the GG joint is the only part of the construction that stood up to the elements.That said , this is not a substitute for aliphatic resin glues ( i.e. , yellow glues ) which are much better for cabinets , fine woodworking , etc . Even though aliphatic glues like Titebond are rated for external use , they do n't seem to provide the purchase of the original GG for construction applications.GG is slippery stuff and has very little `` tack '' until setup , so mechanical fastening or clamping is required for tight joints . The squeeze out is considerable and will stain , so tape off surfaces that you want to finish . Frankly , it 's a mess to use . But when it sticks , it really sticks . I 've found it ideal for a variety of construction projects where high-strength is required . Recommended	1
1 ) Elmers `` Ultimate High Performance '' is a Polyurethane ( PU ) glue and it 's as good as Gorilla ( another PU Glue ) ( As far as I can tell ) but cheaper . also used the PL brand glue and ca n't tell any notable difference between the three . Have not used Sumo and from what I understand it sets up faster and as a result apparently has a much more limited shelf life ( this is generally not a good thing - see item # 2 ) 2 ) This has a limited shelf life and you probably do n't need as much as you think . PU glue foams up and you use a LOT less than other types of glue . 4 oz should be more than enough for most people , 8 oz is a BIG bottle - I ca n't even imagine buying the 16 oz bottle . PU Glues suck moisture out of the air so unless you plan on using it up within a year or two , a LOT is going to go to waste . Do n't ask me how I know this.3 ) PU Glue is FANTASTIC for lots of things but woodworking glues are still better for woodworking . They are stronger and you ca n't clean PU glues up with water the way you can even with the waterproof Titebond products . Also if you use biscuits you will have to moisten them separately to get them to swell.4 ) KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN AND ANIMALS ! PU glue is waterproof and will swell and harden inside the digestive tract creating a blockage . There is NO antidote and surgery is typically the only solution . There have been MANY cases - just search Google `` Dog Gorilla Glue '' Wear gloves ( rubber or vinyl ) and use lots of wax paper.5 ) Aliphatic wood glues ( Like Titebond II ) are still better for wood to wood bonding . Fine Woodworking did a test ( Issue # 192 ) and found Polyurethane glues to be about half as strong. [ ... ] If you 've found this review helpful , please let me know !	1
This insert fitted the opening in the table and sat about 10 thou below the surface of the table . A piece of adhesive tape as a shim and the fit was perfect . Clamped a stout board over the insert , raised the blade a couple of times and instalation was done . Something that previously took me a lot of time and messing around is complete in less than 5 mins and the final result is far better than I could have made from MDF or solid hardwood , making this one of the most cost and time effective saw upgrades you could make..Some reviews have made a big deal about the insert sitting below the table surface when first dropped in the opening . I belive this is better than having to try and remove material from the insert when it sits high , and is almost certianly a result of the variation in the manufacture of the saw tables and the makers of the insert have taken this variation in depth of shoulder in the saw table into account in their design . If they are really unhappy with the product , let them make something better , I know I could n't do better .	1
I have looked long and hard for a zero-clearance insert for my table saw . All the higher priced table saws seemed to have one available for their model but I could never find one for mine . I was prepared to try and make my own . Then I stumbled across this insert by Leecraft . It matched my stock metal insert to a & # 34 ; T. & # 34 ; Installation was easy , took no more than 10 minutes . I suggest you wear a mask when you raise the blade to make the initial cut with your saw blade to establish the channel -- the burned composite material of this insert stinks to high heaven . I used a dremel tool to smooth out some high spots on the support ridge that sorrounds the insert . But everything else lined up -- height was perfect , screws holes matched , and the insert fit precisely from edge-to-edge in the saw table 's blade opening cut-out . Now I ca n't wait to use it.If you have a TS-300 , this is the insert to buy .	1
This Leecreaft fits like a glove into my old TS300 Table Saw . Very little shimming required and easy to level . Very pleased . Recommend for anyone with a Delta TS300 or TS350 table saw .	1
A zero clearance insert is the difference between a ragged and a perfect cut on any table saw . I have a TS350 Delta table saw and this is the insert that works . Recommend it highly .	1
fit my dewalt table saw perfectly , its a portable one . leveled out in a second , blade cut , bang was ready to roll with no tear out.it isnt rocket science , its wood working ooooohhhhhh	1
I bought two of these inserts and have already put one to use . They are well built and appear to be a quality product .	1
I have a DW745 ; this insert is advertised for other models but the manufacturer includes the DW745 on the instruction sheet.. Another reviewer explained why - when the DW745 blade is extended to its highest point the trunion hits the insert and pushes it out . The remedy is to route out a cavity matching the one on the original metal insert . Leecraft does n't mention this but should for safety reasons or it should route the cavity in the manufacturing process . .My insert was damaged ; it appeared to have been dropped . One of the tabs on the end was mashed and partially broken off . I did n't see it before I opened the package and the broken tab was n't in the sealed package . I presume it happened before it was placed in the package.Neither of these issues will impact my use of the insert . I have no reason to run the saw with the blade at its highest point with a zero clearance insert for anything I do . I can easily route out the cavity if I ever do . The insert fits well and is otherwise of high quality and should suit my needs for a long time .	1
It is a great product . FIts perfectly , including allowances for height adjustment , and works just like it should . I wish I had done this years earlier . I suggest also buying the RIPPER for grip , and between the two of them , you can do 1/8 of inch strips easily and safely .	1
Nice product overall . One little issue with it is that it has the fit adjustment screws only on one end and one side . ( not to be confused with the height adjustment screws - which are fine ) This means when you adjust it for a tight fit it pushes the insert against just one side and one end . I have a DW744 ( Dewalt ) table saw and the cutout for the insert is a little rough on the sides . The insert rides up a little as you push it sideways with the one screw . I had to grind off some of the rough casting areas on my table top with a Dremel tool to get a snug fit . It just irks me when manufacturers settle for & # 34 ; good enough & # 34 ; when they could approach perfection so easily . It would be a simple fix to put a screw on both sides and both ends for fit adjustment ( for us who live in a less then perfect world ) .	1
UPDATE : I have cut a slot on the back of this plate so that the riving knife will slide in . It still works just fine with no flexing . **********************ORIGINAL : I bought this for the DW745 table saw . The unit IS compatible with the DW745 , it says so right on the packaging . BUT it requires some router work for proper safe use with the DW745 type 3 . Maybe it worked without modification for the DW745 type 1 or type 2 , I have no idea.On my DW745 type 3 , when the blade is raised to the top height the motor housing comes up very high , just about 1/4 from the table top surface . This insert is about 1/2 thick so it interferes with the motor housing when the blade is raised . The motor housing will push this throat plate UP , causing a potentially dangerous situation of blade binding or worse ! The DW745 's factory throat plate ( insert ) has a cutout/notch on the underside so that the motor housing comes up and into the notched-out portion of the insert . This Leecraft insert does not have that same notch/cutout , so I used my router to make a cutout , using the the factory insert as my measurement reference.Since the insert is extremely sturdy to begin with , this additional notch did not compromise the plate at all . It is just as stiff and flat after the modification.Now , it works beautifully . It deserves 5 stars on performance BUT I would have liked to know that such a modification was necessary so I 'm giving it a four . I could have easily ruined my blade , insert and/or workpieces ! Also , the color is not red . Mine is a tan color with a speckle pattern , it looks just like it was cut out of a kitchen counter.As a sidenote : you can easily slot the back of this plate so that the riving knife will slide in . There 's nothing in this design that will prevent you from doing that . The plate is so thick that such a slot will probably not cause ANY flexing anyway . However I am not going to bother .	1
I purchased several of these a couple years ago , they fit well , but as noted by other reviewers you ca n't use your splitter and gaurd when using these inserts . Plus if you cut a lot of dadoes , you need one for each size . About 6-8 months ago I discovered Betterly Tru Cut inserts . These are made from high quality machined aluminum , made to fit your saw . The blade section has a removable phenolic insert . While the main insert cost 's twice what the Leecraft does , you only buy it once . The phenolic inserts come two to a pkg and cost half what the Leecraft does , so if you need a lot of inserts , I do , then you come out money ahead with this system . The winning part of this system for me , was that you can still use your blade gaurd and splitter , as the insert is milled to fit your specific saw . Therefor it is grooved to accept the factory guard and splitter . It has enough adjustments on it to keep even the most [ ... ] level nut happy and locks into the saw table with compression . It is very solid . The fit and finish are excellent . Changing inserts is a breeze and you do n't have to go thru the leveling routine every time you change an insert . If you only need one insert then the Leecraft is probably a good deal , but if ya need more go with the Tru Cut .	1
Most quality products rate at something around 4.5 stars - IMO this is a 5 Star product . For years I have used shop made wooden inserts , but when I bought a new table saw I decided to try ready made inserts . These Leecraft inserts have made a believer out of me . With the two adjustment screws and tabs , they fit my Dewalt DW 744 precisely and snugly . Add to that the nice finger size hole in the insert , and you have an insert that fits right and is easy to swap in and out . True , you ca n't use them with the rive knife , but I do n't use it anyway . I bought 2 to begin with , one for a thin kerf blade and one for dado use . Now that I see how well they work , I 'll buy more for all the common dado widths I use . On most products I find myself thinking `` if only they would have ... '' Ca n't think of anything I wish they had done on these inserts - simply put , `` Buy it , you 'll like it ! '' Makes me wonder why Dewalt does n't offer a comparable , but if they did that , then they would have to offer a decent miter - not going to happen !	1
I bought this insert to use in my DeWalt 746 tablesaw and have found it to be a very high quality accessory . When my insert plate arrived I was pleased to note that it was dead flat ! Installation was very easy - using the four leveling screws I was able to bring this insert perfectly level with my saw table all the way around . Once adjusted , the side-to-side and front-to-back adjustment screws took all of the play out of this insert . I also appreciate the smooth surface which allows my stock to glide across it with little effort . The finger hole allows easy and quick removal for blade changes , etc . My only complaint is that I wish it were yellow . Mine is bright orange , but I can live with that ! Several people have complained about losing the ability to use their splitter with this insert . I noted in the instructions that if you are installing this on a DW746 saw , all you need to do is bandsaw a small kerf in the rear edge of the plate ( in line with the table saw blade kerf ) and you will have a slot to mount your splitter through . This should not be too difficult to accomplish for a woodworker ... All in all I was thrilled with the performance and level of quality found in this design and I would highly recommend it to anyone with the DeWalt 746 saw .	1
Just what I needed , and easy to use . Strong quality , fit is perfect . My brothers make their own inserts for their saws , I do n't have the time . This was perfect for me .	1
You might wonder why people just do n't make their own from wood until you use these . They are nice heavy duty inserts are easy to level with grub screws and are solid heavy plastic laminate with a low friction surface . These are much better than the standard metal inserts that come with the Unisaw and better than and less hassle than you can make yourself . I have several for regular blades and dado cutters .	1
Adding a zero cleareance substantially increased the quality of my cuts . I was cross-cutting plywood with my old Delta blade . The tear-out was surprisingly bad considering that the blade was sharpened recently . I dropped this insert in place and the tear-out was nearly gone . In other words , this thing really works.I love tools that work . Couple of other notes : The set screws work really well but they are really tight . I had to use my cordless drill to adjust them . Second , the bright yellow color is nice because it is a stark reminder of the danger zone.By the way , if you experience a lot of noise , the directions state that it is probably the blade rubbing on the insert . The solution is to widen the kerf slighty with a bit of sandpaper . I have n't experienced any noise .	1
No matter what I did to try to flatten my stock metal Delta table inserts I just could not get them perfect . Close , but not perfect . These Leecraft inserts are , in fact , dead flat . So it took only about two minutes to adjust them to the table height and snug fit them with the side screws . Now I can go back to measuring mortise side cut blade height off the insert rather than my jig to get the height gauge base over to the cast iron top . Sweet .	1
Just as described , fits perfectly on either of my Unisaws , one from the 70 's and the other twenty years newer .	1
Fits well into the delta contractor saw . Has 4 leveling screws . I bought 2 of them and may buy a 3rd for resawing	1
Having made several of these myself for about a 1/4 of the price , I was extremely skeptical at paying the price and getting something better . However , the adjustments to bring this consistently level with the table top are almost worth the extra . Having a small piece of wood jam against the lip where this meets the table because it is not perfectly aligned is at best frustrating and potentially dangerous . This aligns quickly and easily and lasts . It could be cheaper !	1
Had to grind a little off to fit my Jet Saw . But after I did that , it layed great in the saw . The directions are clear how to cut through the plate and it 's a nice tight hole when I use my dado blade . I recommend this product .	1
I bought one to try it ; I will be buying more . All I had to do was adjust the screws for a tight fit . Some have criticized the noise level ; remember that blades designed for exceptionally smooth cuts will contribute to the noise level because of their inherent design characteristics . If this is a problem for you , cut the initial slot using a blade with a strong alternating angle on the teeth and a wide kerf.When installing , you might have to increase the relief on the bottom ; my blade was all the way down and made contact after only 1/4 turn but I did n't have to increase the relief.Personally , I 'm going to buy at least 2 more ; one for 45 degree angles and one for my dado blade . Exceptional quality and price .	1
The original insert that came with my Delta Unisaw suddenly became stuck after roughly 10 years of use . I could not get it out of the saw without bending it . So , it was time to order a new one . I looked at a couple of options - straight from Delta ( expensive ) , the white plastic ones that are a little cheaper , and then this one . I 'm so glad I went with this one . They are flat , made out of some wood-type material , and topped with a very smooth coating . There are 4 leveling screws on top , one in the back , and another on the side , so I was able to get it to fit perfectly with no slop . Another great thing about this is there are two pre-made grooves on the bottom , so when you go to raise the blade on your first use , you do n't have to use a small dado blade first then your normal blade . I 've had to do that on a homemade one a few years back and it 's not fun.I bought 2 - one for a normal kerf blade and a second for thin kerf . All said it probably took about 15 minutes per insert to get them ready to go . I 'll probably end up getting a third for angle cuts . I seriously wish I had purchased these years ago ! Side note - the ones I received were white , not red as the picture indicates ( they call that out that color may vary ) . I did n't mind at all .	1
I bought two of these for my Unisaw . I 've seen guys fiddle around and make their own inserts , but I do n't want to waste my shop time ( limited ) making saw parts , so I plopped down the cash for these boys , and I 'm really glad I did . I made one into a zero-clearance insert , which has greatly decreased the already unlikely probability that my Forrest Woodworker II blade is going to produce tearout on the back side of whatever I 'm cutting . I made the other one into a dado insert , which is also zero-clearance for 3/4 & quot ; dadoes ... It makes your dadoes clean and crisp on the edges . Plus , if you cut a narrower dado , you can use the same insert , it 'll just have a little clearance.Overall , I 'd recommend these LeeCraft inserts -- get a couple of them and you wo n't be sorry ! Be safe !	1
I was going to buy an insert from Delta for my left-tilt unisaw for my dado stack . Then I got the idea to make one with this insert . It took a few minutes to plow through the material and to ajust the set screws but now it works perfectly and saved me [ ... ] !	1
I just purchased another one of these ... very good insert ... reduces tear out , wobble , and vibration of the blade . Highly recommend if you 're working with sheet good .	1
Absolutely great . I have two of these now . I used one for a zero clearance insert and one for a dado insert . They both were very easy to mount and stay very flush . No adjustments have been needed when switching between inserts .	1
I have two of these , one for zero clearance of my Forrest WW II blade , the other for my stacked dado set . It takes just a couple of minutes to adjust the screws to get a perfect fit . Then it 's a simple matter of clamping a scrap 2X4 or something onto the top of your table saw , covering the insert , and run the blade up through the insert to your desired height . On my zero clearance insert for the Forrest I went up as high as the saw would go , on the dado insert I went up a full two inches . It was easy to drill out the insert to allow for my splitter.These inserts make it safer and cleaner when operating your saw . Being that mine are bright yellow , they also act as a reminder to me when I 'm entering the DANGER ZONE ... . You wo n't regret getting one , or more , of these for your shop .	1
If having a red insert is important to you you might have to look elsewhere- the two I received are both a powder/cornflower-y blue . Made no difference to me ; the inserts themselves fit my unisaw perfectly , the leveling screws easily brought it to dead level and I get zero tearout . Bought one for my dado stack and one for my thin kerf , but might shell out for a couple more . Much better than a shopmade insert and cheap enough to forgo the effort . But ... not red .	1
this does the trick when I need it ... ... .can easily switch out with other inserts so that is a part of why I like it .	1
This fits my unisaw perfectly and works like a champ . The instructions are very clear and it is easy to cut the blade slot . Mine is used for a dado blade . Great addition to my saw .	1
The picture is missing small fins that could be mounted to both sides of the body of the unit and act as horizontal featherboards . The magnet is remarkably strong but the same trait also makes it hard to fine tune the position of the featherboard once it is stuck on the saw table . Otherwise , it is a fine accessory to have for your table saw or router tables .	1
The product being shipped now differs from the illustration above ; the base is heavy plastic instead of wood . There are also two small & quot ; wings & quot ; that screw in the notches on the side to hold side pressure . This holds on two axis when the & quot ; L & quot ; piece shown is installed.It sticks firmly to any iron tool table and a release cam is mounted on the rear to help lift the strong magnet through leverage . The magnet is embedded in the bottom in resin and I ca n't imagine it ever failing . They are really easy to reposition when holding the cam in the release position ; get it where you want and let the cam loose - it will snap down on the table and stay put.I bought one to start but could see that two will do a better job , especially on the jointer when surfacing . They also recommend using two on the table saw for dadoing and other non through-cut operations I 'm wishing I had an iron router table to stick these on ! I 'll have to stick to my track mounted feather boards there.You 'll have to assemble this when you get it . They provide a one-page instruction sheet with some helpful hints on use . I think you 'll find one very useful and two even more so .	1
Use this thing on my tablesaw and jointer . Easy to use and effective . I do n't ask for much more out of my tools or jigs . Id rather spend the money on one of these and have nice safe cuts in wood than cuts in my fingers . I bought one , but I will probably buy another soon . Having two could definitely be useful .	1
If you 've got a lot of wood that 's the same width to rip , this featherboard is a great help ! It locks onto an iron table like a suction cup , and is hard to move without using the built-in cam . The built-in cam makes it easy to move when you 're ready to reposition it.Here are the only things I do n't like about the product:1 ) If you 're not doing a lot of repetitive cuts , it 's sometimes more trouble than it 's worth to set it up.2 ) If there 's ANY dust on your table , the effectiveness is immediately reduced.3 ) The plastic holddown makes a loud SLAP sound when you push the wood past it . You get used to it , but it does cause one 's attention to be diverted sometimes , and that 's not great.Having said all those negative things , however , I 'd rate the tool 4 stars out of 5 , and I use mine on my table saw at least 2 times a week .	1
I received this feather board for Christmas 2005 and have already used it on one project . Because I already own the Bench Dog feather board , and liked it pretty well , I used that as a benchmark to compare this model.First the good:1 . The magnetic base is very strong yet releases easily with the tilting lever.2 . The flexible strip that puts sideways pressure on the board you are cutting is stiff enough to do its job , yet flexible enough to bend easily when adjusting the unit.3 . The price is fair for what you get.As for bad marks ... 1 . I am disappointed in the flexible strip that holds the workpiece down to the table . It is not adjustable for height and seems to be pushed to its limit while cutting anything that is a full 3/4 '' thick . If you have thicker stock you will have to remove this for the cut.2 . When using on the table saw as I near the end of a cut , when the end of the board slides out from under the hold down there is a startling `` SNAP '' noise made as the plasic hold down slaps onto the saw table . Of course you never see that coming because your eyes are on the blade where they should be.Overall , I like this tool and have found it to be great for jointing the edge of panels that are usually a challenge on the jointer . As for table saw use , its not a terrible design by any stretch of the word but I much prefer the Bench Dog feather board for that application .	1
I purchased two of these about 2 years ago and am very happy with them . They have held up well and are very easy to use .	1
This is easy to adjust , put on and take off . The magnetic mount is a lot quicker and more versatile than the type that need to fit into the table saw slot . Prior to using this , I 've had several items thrown from the table saw .	1
I purchased an inexpensive table saw which I was very disappointed in until I purchased the Tite-Grips ( 2 ) - I was able to use the grips by installing a metal plate to my aluminum fence - the grips now add stability to my ripping and allow me to repeat cut narrow pieces without moving the fence.I believe that the value of my fingers far exceeds the cost of the grips .	1
I am just amazed at how well it works on my table saw . It works for jointing too . I want to buy one more .	1
Board Buddies [ BBs ] is a unique product and come in various configurations allowing clockwise , counter-clockwise , and free spin versions . First , I confess I 've only seen these in action as I own a now defunct version by Leichtung Workshops ( sp ? ) that uses flat rollers that are toe 'd in rather than BB 's cambered rollers . When mine become unserviceable , Board Buddies will be on my short list of things to buy . Why ? SAFETY FIRST orThings can happen very fast with shop tools . . .According to many data sources , the two most notorious tools for severe injuries are radial arm and table saws . Speed is part of the reason for these data . So fast in fact that in most cases , you will not have the time to react and remove yourself from harm 's way until AFTER the fact [ much like ducking after hearing a rifle shot as sound travels a rough average of 1170 ft/sec but many rifle rounds travel an average far above that ] . WHAT reaction time ? ? With table and radial arm saws , there is a loud noise [ thud , twang , clunk , etc . ] , THEN you check to see if any body parts , especially extremities , are missing . Now I ca n't speak for ALL woodworkers , but my fingers , eyes , arms , major arteries , etc , are worth more than a mere $ 40usd and the few minutes it takes to install these . One common example when using a table saw , your blade comes to a hidden knot then . . . thud , twang , clunk , or a chorus of all three ! ! Board Buddies help to keep the board on the table where it belongs rather than sliding off the table at high speed and directly at YOU.Again , I ca n't speak for all woodworkers , pro or amateur , but the thought of a board or a piece thereof traveling well in excess of a hundred miles an hour through my shop is not comforting , ESPECIALLY when I 'm in the direct line of fire ! The BBs with restricted rotation REDUCES the likelihood [ there are few guaranties in life ] of becoming a human dartboard or `` that one-eyed , armed , legged , woodworker in Bay 16 '' . It 's hard enough getting around in a three-dimensional world , even harder when you can only see in two.PRECISIONPro or amateur [ those that simply do something for the love of it , none-the-lesser ] , many woodworkers take pride in their work ; precision is a good part of this sense . Here again , `` Board Buddies '' helps achieve that level of precision by gently keeping the board against the fence and tracking true . They do this with ease , without complication , and RELIABLY , often exceeding a shifty feather board.Durable , reliable , safe , uncomplicated and inexpensive , Board Buddies should be either installed in your shop or on your short list.AX~ Master WoodButcher and Seasoned Termite	1
I had the experience of cutting a piece of stock , and it got trapped between the fence and the blade . It would n't matter except that the wood lifted slightly , and that caused an off angle into the blade . Consequently it binded , and sent a piece of wood flying into my stomach at about 50 mph . Okay maybe it was 40 , but the speed was irrelevant . What did matter is that it was painful , and forceful enough to leave a welt and scraped the skin . If it was n't a square ended board , but rather a sharp pointed one , it would be of even greater concern.After that experience , I broke out the hold down that originally came with the saw . Since it is a circa 1950 's Sears , the hold down was n't in the best of shape . It was the kind that sits at the back of the table . I did n't like the arm sticking up , and having to pass through the thin slit of the freshly cut wood . What if I was using a thin kerf blade ? I decided instead to take the advice of a professional , and concentrate on not letting the back side of the piece of wood lift up on the fence . With a push stick that has a long tail I was able to do that . I recognize that this is just one more angle priority I have to remember when pushing stock through . Then I got the board buddies.At first I hesitated because Incra who makes my TSIII-32 table saw fence said that board buddies are not compatible with the Incra fence . Knowing the engineering principles involved with the board buddies , and Amazon 's generous return policy , I decided to go ahead and order them . I 'm glad I did.The reason why Incra stated that the fence did not work was because the center plate that mounts the adjusting arm to the fence , sat above the upper surface of the fence . That is easily solved by using a 1/4 & quot ; shim made of wood , or Masonite etc and simply kerfing out the section where the adjusting arm center plate edge sits proud . That makes a completely flat surface area all across the top of the fence for the board buddy to sit on . I also ordered the Woodstock mounting bracket-plate made for these board buddies . That enables me to be able to remove and reinstall the board buddies with the least amount of effort.The universal advantages of the board buddies , is that they are built a lot more substantially than the pictures show . They are large . That is great because they can handle the type of rigor required for a 4x8 sheet of 3/4 & quot ; plywood.I could n't figure out how they mounted from the pictures , but they attach across the top of your fence . The yellow plastic-rubber like bumpers extend out and press down on your work and are adjustable thanks to the spring loaded tensioner . So you can fine tune them for different size stock thicknesses.Another nice feature is that the cylindrical drums roll in only one direction . That allows you to freely feed the work in , but if the work piece wants to start to back up it instantly stops it . That back roll is nipped in the bud , and that is the movement , that leads to the binding that I was telling you about . Combined with the hold down effect , that stops it altogether . So it actually performs a double protection effort.In terms of creating perfect cuts , the board buddies help to maintain an even surface angle . Beneficial when your shooting for smooth finish grade cuts.One more thing to note is that these mount freely anywhere along the top surface of your fence . The best position is one immediately before your blade , and the other immediately after it . For some reason I was imagining that they projected directly over the blade , and therefore were only good for stock that was wide enough to meet with the buddy . NOT . By placing them in front and behind the blade , you can adjust them for anything from small to large stock.If I had to be critical of the buddies , I would be concerned for certain fence types that can not accept the challenge of the buddies creating lift on the fence . With the buddies set to press down on the work piece , when it enters the buddy it will press them up , and that creates a lifting . A less than substantial fence with a tie down only on the side , closest to you , may create a lifting concern . If your fence , when fastened holds on the rear and front , then the lift is of no concern . If your fence only holds down on one end , an easy way to determine the buddies usability is to simply fasten it , then use something to pry on it to test the level of resistance . The buddies are spring loaded and adjustable . To get the maximum usability without more frequent adjusting , a front and rear hold down fence is preferred.Overall I highly recommend the buddies . They add to the safety and precision of making table saw cuts , and could be used on router tables with a compatible fence . The heavy castings , and industrial grade rubber should give you years of use .	1
Well if you are n't using a serious saw then I would n't bother with these but if you are then they offer a little bit of added control and a little more safety .	1
I used to swear by these and had them on my saw at all times , even used them on just about every cut I made.That said , when placed in front of the cut , they will always get in the way of you pushing the material ... When mounting in the back of the cut , it always got in the way of the riving knife , blade guard , or pawls ... And if attempting to install anywhere in between , then beware of the blade itself ... This is becuase 99 % of my cuts are thinner rips , these are less problematic when use cutting large sheet products.Ive finally compromised in removing my pawls , and only installing one wheel in the back of the blade.And feather boards on the front where they wont be in the way as much as these tend to be.It took a new saw upgrade to even bother to make the change , but im very patient.They do a great job of pushing the stock down to the table and pulling it in to the fence.Probably saved my behind without me even knowing it , but you have to negotiate your particular set up.Still , Im glad I got them way back when .	1
Before getting this , I experienced a kick-back with a 2.5 & # 34 ; x 2.5 & # 34 ; x 10 & # 34 ; block of wood that knocked the wind out of me . If these had been on my saw that would not have happened . Between these and the Gripper hand feeder I feel a lot safer with my table saw . I highly recommend these ! But read the instructions ... . using these incorrectly ( like not having the rollers on the correct side on small stuff ) can make them more dangerous . So again , these provide excellent safety _when setup and used correctly_ .	1
After carefully reading reviews and watching videos , I gave these a try . Glad I did ! With the T-Nuts ( sold separately ) they attach directly to Ridgid fences or any similar fence that has slots in the top . That 's nice since I 'm impatient and do not like products that require building a jig to use the device.Installation is fast and easy . The instructions could be a little better , but the diagram is adequate so putting these together is intuitive . Each part has only ONE obvious connection , so you ca n't put it together wrong . It took about three minutes for each one including adjustment . You just screw on the rollers and tighten their nuts , screw in the adjustment knob , attach the base to your fence with T-nuts , slide in the body and lock in place.ADJUSTMENT ... If you look at the photo , you can see TWO adjustment screws ; one with a butterfly-nut ( on the upper arm ) and another with a loop ( on the lower body . ) The UPPER nut adjusts spring tension . The LOWER screw adjusts the height of the rollers.Although the instructions do not state this clearly , as soon as you play with them for a few minutes you quickly learn that these two adjustments interact . You have to balance the spring pressure with the roller height for the best results . Once you get the hang of it , it takes only a few seconds.Having explained that , I think that is why some people do not like these as much as I do . I understand that pro carpenters are necessarily rushed since time = money , so they loathe anything that interrupts their workflow . Although I find these intuitive to adjust in seconds , anyone unfamiliar with them might find adjustments to be `` fussy '' or complicated.Another thing I 've noticed in some reviews is that those who do not like these have the T-bar ( Biesemeyer ) style fences . Those fences do not lock at both the front AND back like fences on contractor saws.Having noted that , I find that these work especially well on my Ridgid 2410 and 2412 saws . These saws ( and most modern saws like them ) have extruded aluminum fences that lock in both the front AND back . That not only provides a more stable and rigid fence , it prevents these from pushing the rear of Beisemeyer fences up.Now , I read some reviews here and elsewhere that claim Board Buddies `` get in the way '' of push sticks . That 's true to an extent , but for rip-cuts on long or wide boards , that is a non issue . In fact , the way I use these , push sticks are unnecessary . I put the front roller well in front of the blade , and the back roller one inch behind the blade . I view that area between the rollers as a `` no hand zone ! '' I NEVER put my finger beyond the first roller . That gives me a HUGE margin of safety while maintaining positive downward pressure on boards . When I get to the last few inches of a board , I walk around the back of the saw and PULL the board through to finish the cut . That means I do not need an extravagantly large out-feed table to work alone safely.I know ... some people will tell me that is dangerous . I disagree . The board buddy rollers hold material down and perfectly stationary . Assuming they are adjusted adequately , the board will NOT budge . I 've been working with large wide boards and long thin boards like this for decades using much weaker hold downs and never had a problem . But do not let me convince you otherwise if YOU think that is a dangerous practice . If a method does not seem safe to YOU , the YOU should not try it.As a musician who absolutely can not risk any injury to my hands , I find this method with these devices gives me a HUGE margin of safety , and a greater sense of confidence for rip-cuts.Now here is the fun fact that refutes some negative reviews . When the rollers are positioned as I described ( front roller well in front of the blade and back roller an inch or two behind the blade ) you can move the fence to within a 16th inch of the blade and rip VERY narrow pieces . The rollers are actually to the LEFT of the blade while the fence is close to the RIGHT of the blade . This is VERY handy for making narrow strips such as those we use for edge-banding or long strips for boat building.With any new tool like this , I spend some time learning how it works , learning how to set it up and adjust it . That 's a good practice anyway with any tool , but it paid off especially well with these . To test an extreme example , I cut multiple thin strips from a 10-foot 2 X 12 . The board buddies allowed me to rip dozens of very narrow strips ( about 1/16th inch ) with only ONE set up ! I did not have to use those `` thin-strip jigs '' which are often inaccurate and a nuisance since you must move the fence for each strip.So , if you build Kayaks or need many perfectly uniform strips for edge-banding , these things are GREAT ! Having said that , I must point out that you can not use the entire board with this method . The board must always be wide enough that some portion of it is under the rollers . You will end up not using the entire board , and that might be considered 'waste '' if you do not have other uses for the leftovers . Therefore , this is not a perfect solution to everyone 's needs , but it certainly is great for those types of rips.Also , I can not say these are the perfect solution for small parts . For certain applications , Grr-rippers are a better solution . For others , standard hold-downs and or feather boards are better.Overall , I feel these are an excellent addition to an arsenal of safety devices . It is up to each woodworker to know what is best for his needs and select the right option for each task . I do not mind wasting a little material to protect my hands , get perfect multiple thin strips with only one set up . I consider that cheap insurance against tragedy and assurance of accuracy . When making many multiple cuts the same size , it is a real time saver too ! One set-up ( which take less than twnety seconds ) yields perfectly consistent rips of thin strips.That does not mean these are the one-and-only solution for all rip cuts . There is no such thing . Instead , I suggest we view these as an addition to a collection of jigs . Considering their robust design and manufacture , the ease of set-up , and how quickly you can make multiple thin rips , these are actually a time-saver for that task . They are a bargain too since they are only $ 25 bucks a piece for real metal that is Made in the USA . I do n't know of any one-time insurance premiums that low ! So , please do not think these will solve every hold-down problem . They will not help you extract every last inch of material from thin boards . They are not as good as Grr-rippers for small parts . But when properly adjusted for rip cuts , they are a wonderful addition to other safety devices . They save time when making multiple rips and they cooperate with a well-adjusted fence to make perfect accurate thin strips.Seeing how repetitive rips of thin strips is one of the most dangerous cuts we can make of a table saw , i consider these a valuable addition . And because the designers understand that these are not perfect for every cut , they made them a snap to remove quickly . You do n't need tools to loosen the two screws that hold these in place . They come of the fence in five seconds each.Bottom line ? If you value your fingers and must cuts many thin strips for edge-banding or boat building ... these are worth the money many times over ! If you are looking for a more versatile system , especially one for small parts , you should also look at Grr-Rippers . If you have a table saw with an iron top , look at Mag jigs too . They are also very good , but they only work on magnetic surfaces , so you either need an iron table-top or must add-on a metal top and fence to make them work.As an experienced and VERY cautious musician / woodworker I recommend these , but only as an addition to other devices.Use them for their intended purposes , and they will give you great results , super easy .	1
I just added these to my 10 & quot ; Jet cabinet saw . I had a real problem trying to rip plywood sheets while keeping them aligned to the fence . Even with a buddy helping me we would tend to get some wander in the ends of the cuts while cross cutting.After installing the board buddies I cut some 4 ' x 8 ' oak plywood sheets by myself and got prefectly straight cuts . I used them for both 3/4 & quot ; and 1/4 & quot ; . They did work better on the 3/4 & quot ; than the 14 & quot ; as the 1/4 & quot ; 4/8 tends to flex all over . The board buddies held the sheets down tight and snug against the fence . I now rip to size instead of slightly oversize and only make one pass.Although I put a rail on top of my Exacta fence to install these , I do n't picture ever removing them and could have just bolted them directly to the fence.I have n't tried them , yet , on my router table as I have a Panel-Loc there . I think these would great for rails and stiles which the Panel-Loc wo n't handle well . I 'll edit this review in the future and let you know how they worked .	1
This makes all the difference in the world for using a table saw . If you do n't have these and are using a table saw , you are totally missing out .	1
Great little addition for any table saw ( I purchased the green wheels for my shaper as well ) - you 'll probably need the track for it . Holds down , pulls towards the fence , and prevents kick-back all in one ! Well worth it !	1
I have a Powermatic table saw and was having a hell of a time with the fence and spreader that came with it . I could never properly align the blade guard and spreader . It was constantly binding . It was especially bad when I tried to cut an angle . I ultimately removed the guard . Like many others I had wood bullets shoot back at me . Board Buddies seem to be the answer . The stock is pressed firmly to the table and I have had no kickback.I recommend getting the 24 & quot ; track also . It 's long enough to cover most of the fence and you only have to install it once . If you need a different position you loosen two screws . If you did n't have the track you would have to install the buddies each time you needed a new position . It 's just more efficient with the track.I did have some misgivings recently when I noticed that there is a set of Board Buddies you can get from Amazon ( Tool Crib ? ) directly and not pay shipping . For some reason I did not notice the W1104 's . I ordered the G2370 's on Amazon but through Grizzly . I had to pay for shipping ( like you I do n't like paying shipping ) , but these Board Buddies are aluminum and are very sturdy . If you look at the reviews for the W1104 's you 'll see a review that sorta laments the fact that the W1104 's are cast iron . He states that cast iron is more prone to cracks . I noticed one other difference from the photo of the W1104 's . They do n't have a long ( 4 & quot ; ) eyelet screw . The G2370 have this screw and it allows more height adjustment for the rollers . Maybe the W1104 's have this but I did not see it in the photo.In any event , I highly recommend Board Buddies .	1
These are a great safety device and they help make sure that cuts on the table saw are straight . I have recommended these to several others in the trades and they also really like them . Highly recommended .	1
A must accessory for any table saw	1
Yes , anyone who might need this device could build it ! I build one out scrap 2x4 a few years back for a specific project . This one is more compact , easier to use , much lighter , and in a well thought-out configuration . I , far-and-away , prefer to use jigs to make things then to build jigs .	1
I did n't give this item a bad review , because it is well made , and seems very rugged . Unfortunately once I had the item in hand I realized that the way it is designed to work you can not use it on a small homeowners saw , or to cut very long pieces . Just keep this in mind . Mine is useless to me , with a bench top saw I could only cut a 12 '' piece using this tool .	1
I bought this tapering jig prior to tapering my first table leg . It was inexpensive , I was inexperienced , 'nuff said . The surprise came with its performance . Although I am confident that I could bend this thing in half if I was in the right mind , it does a really good job of guiding my workpiece through the saw . The adjustment feature is simple and easy to use , but the & quot ; graduated scale & quot ; is a bit hard to use accurately . To set it up , I simply adjust it by eye and then measure from the blade to the trailing edge of the guide . This trial and error usually takes no more than a minute or two , and the jig stays locked on my final setting for as many cuts as I need to make . Although there are nicer , more expensive versions out there , you can not beat the value for the money with this tool .	1
Very useful tool and make well enough to withstand use . This model is intended for shorter materials up to 24 & # 34 ; .	1
These are pretty nice to have around the shop . The angled handle vectors your push forward and against a fence more easily . I use one in each hand , especially on the jointer . The heavy plastic ought to last for quite a while if you do n't run them over with a pickup . The rubber base leaves no marks on your work and grips well with a minimum of downforce . I like these better than the metal stick type as they are less likely to damage a cutter if you inadvertantly contact one . The only application these really do n't work well for is running narrow stock , less that 3 & quot ; in width . In that case use the plastic stick model from Big Horn with a feather board .	1
These push blocks are one of the best tools for saving those fingers and hands from spinning sharp objects . Plastic wo n't hurt your expensive blades and cutters , and the soft rubber foot wo n't mark your workpiece . They fit the hand very well and are comfortable to use . As one of the other reviewers noted , they do n't fit on narrow pieces . So I bought 8 of em , left 4 of em stock size , trimmed 2 of em to 1 '' wide and two of em to 2 '' wide . Now I have a set for pretty much any application . You do have to be a little more cautious on the narrow widths , they want to rock , but with a little care they work very well . I use push sticks also and featherboards , but like being able to put downward pressure on the piece , especially on the small joiner.Highly recommend these ... cheap insurance and they work very well .	1
The angled handles allow you to push effectively from any angle , they 're beefy and strong . You ca n't miss 'em cause they 're yellow . Neoprene holds wood really well so materials wo n't slip . The plastic is kind to blades and knives and if you ruin a few , the price is n't bad . I stock up on a few at a time , so that I have back-ups . Highly recommended .	1
I recommend this item for the retention of your own fingers . It makes good sense to stay as far away from a spinning saw blade as possible . It 's fairly small , ergomontically friendly and has a really good gripping pad .	1
For the money it is pretty tough to argue with these push blocks . They do exactly what they are supposed to - hold wood & amp ; protect digits . I have larger hands , so a larger grip would be nice , yet that may complicate things for others with smaller hands . The molded thumb indentations are helpful for applying pressure , the foam bottom cuts down on vibration and helps prevent slipping ( particularly when they are clean ) and the bright yellow color - actually helps to keep me alert beacuse of the contrast between the saw and router table surfaces . These push blocks should also work well with a jointer , although I have not purchased or tried that to date . Probably not absolutely perfect - but for the money , I do not believe you can go wrong .	1
This push stick is especially useful when running narrow stock through your table saw or jointer . I prefer the larger pad type push blocks for most applications , but they just do n't work on narrow pieces . The plastic cuts easily without damaging your blade or knives , just in case you goof . For that reason , I 'd keep a spare or two around.You can always buy another pushstick , but fingers ... ...	1
It 's cheap , it 's soft enough to not damage blade , it 's bright so you wo n't lose it . AND IT KEEPS YOUR FINGERS FROM BEING CUT OFF ! ! !	1
Great item for saving your fingers when cutting close to the blade . I only wish it was a bit thinner to get cuts closer between the blade and fence .	1
I bought one of these a few months ago to get my order total high enough for free shipping . It 's a push stick . It works . It 's yellow . Let me see ... yep..that about covers it .	1
It 's a solid plastic pushstick designed for one job and that 's keeping your fingers from getting cut off . It indeed performs that task well .	1
I recommend this item for the retention of your own fingers . It makes good sense to stay as far away from a spinning saw blade as possible . It 's feels good in the hand and is made of high quality material . Get a couple ... a friend can always use one .	1
A push stick will help keep your fingers away from table saw blade.The handle on this one has a nice shape and the notch makes gripping thick wood easy . If you do a lot of thin or long material you may want to look at a Stots push stick ( Amazon sells those too ) .	1
The feather board is supposed to lock down in the miter T-slots with these flimsy square stamped 'nuts ' . I could n't get those to work , but the standard ( non T-slot ) method pulls a cone headed screw up that pushes the plastic out and this holds very well . The featherboard is not as strong as a wood one but it seems to hold pretty well , how much force do you need to hold the wood against the fence ? ( I 'm responding to the negative reviews here ) . The push stick is a necessity for a table saw , the push block would be more useful for a jointer ( which I do n't have ) than for a table saw , but I 've used mine when dadoing small stock . Overall - happy with this starter set .	1
Works good , even though they look cheap , they perform well , and save your fingers , and prevent kickbacks . Cheaper than having a visit to local ER .	1
If you do n't have any of these , buy this set , and buy it now . Do n't risk your fingers or health.I use the push block on the tablesaw and jointer . The featherboard I use on the tablesaw , bandsaw and router table . The pushstick is used on the tablesaw and the router table . These tools will get used a lot.The only draw back is the push stick is not great for thin material . For thick material it works fine . I like something more like the Stots push stick for thin material .	1
I could have bought this blade at hundreds of outlets but Amazon had a good price and I got free shipping . But even at full price this blade is worth every penny . I 've had mine on my Delta saw for about 6 months . Do n't try to run this blade on a low power saw . It really needs full sized power to cut well and not burn . It will cut glue-line smooth in many hardwoods , especially closed-grained woods like maple and cherry . But in soft wood I still had to plane the edge smooth for gluing so keep your jointer plugged in . In oily wood it has a tendencey to want to burn but it 's not too bad . A fellow woodworker has used his for five years and it still does not need sharpening . A good product . One addition , this blade as good as it is , is made even better with the addition of stabilizers .	1
Forrest blades are fantastic . The blade is sharp and cuts well . I would recommend any forrest blade to a woodworker .	1
I use this in my 5hp Jet Table Saw and it is absolutely super ! I do have the Forrest 5 & quot ; dampener that I use with it which limits the depth of cut to 2 1/2 & quot ; . Without the damper , it will cut almost 3 & quot ; in my saw . The cuts are so clean that you can literally go to the 220 grit sandpaper as the first grade ! I figure I 'll save the difference in cost on sandpaper alone ( maybe ) ! Forrest offers resharpening service for these blades that restores them to factory specs . They do require a special grind that most & quot ; locals & quot ; ca n't do . Buy this blade and you wo n't be sorry - buy once , cut twice as long !	1
... .HO-O-O-LY COW ! I had a Freud blade on my Jet table saw that made cross cuts that were ready for gluing right off the table . But when it came to rips , the Freud burned everything . I tried everything - adjusted , trued , cleaned , cussed , but to no avail . What time I saved on cross cuts , I lost on sanding rip cuts . So , I read and I read about saw blades and despite the price tag , I finally covered my eyes and pushed the one-click button for the Forrest Woodworker II . Well , I got the blade the next day , installed it and tried it out . Wowsers ! It makes a satisfying whistle as it gets up to speed and then hardly a sound as it cuts hardwood like a knife through hot butter . The blade is heavy and rigid and polished and balanced and sharp as a razor . They send the blade in a box with a return address so when you need to resharpen , you stick it into the box and poof , it 's on its way . ( BTW , right now it 's $ 22.50 to resharpen this particular blade . ) You know how when you watch Norm or those other woodworking gurus their saws just whisk through lumber like it 's trick photography ? Well , it 's not the camera , it 's the way a Forrest blade really cuts . Ca n't say enough good things about it .	1
There are many reviews of this blade out there . Most ( all ? ) praise the quality of the cuts produced and I must agree . I tried a few other blades on the same block of wood and this one produced cleaner cuts . No blowout where others had blowout . Cleaner cuts . So , yeah , thumbs up .	1
I have been using Freud thin kerf blades on my tablesaw the last 6 years , but wanted to see what all the rave was about on these handmade American blades . You cant believe the quality that goes into these once you see them in person . I usually rip wood and bought the Woodworker I and II standard blades kind of as a comparison , but found online they also have this thin kerf Woodworker II for ripping afterwards . This really works great in comparison to my other blades including a brand new Craftsman combination blade . Once you try these you will realize each blade has its own purpose and this blade is a dream to use .	1
I 've been having a love affair with Freud blades , but now I am totally impressed with the Forrest Woodworker II . I have been getting glass smooth cuts with the Freud 60 tooth , but when I was ripping some 1 & quot ; thick oak , it started to burn a little . I 'm using an Incra TSIII-32 fence , so alignment is not the problem . Generally 60 tooth blades are made strictly for cross cutting . I have been getting away with using it as a general-purpose blade . The thick oak did n't quite make it . I bought the Freud , and Forrest a year ago , and have had the Forrest Woodworker II in mothballs . I put it on my Sears early ( 1950 's ) cast iron table saw . Wow , it slides through the oak like butter . I thought that being a 40-tooth blade it would do that , at the sacrifice of a smooth surface . Was I surprised ; the surface was glass smooth . I did install it with the Forrest blade stabilizer . A perfectly parallel fence to the blade is essential.Since it does so many things well , there is no need to change it . I was talking to the rep from Incra , and his Powermatic 66 never sees another blade . He mentioned that he put the Forrest on last year , and has n't had another blade on it since.Quite simply , this Forrest Woodworker II will give you full ripping and crosscutting capabilities , in all sorts of material , with zip tear out . ( As stated in major woodworking magazine shootout of blades , it took top honors . ) It must be the pitch of the teeth , the sharpness of the blade , the balance and trueness that all add up to doing what most others do n't do . In the past it was a trade off , use fewer teeth , and get some marks , or use more teeth , and get smoothness for crosscutting , but a lot of resistance for ripping.It may cost twice the money of the other blades , but it 's worth it . Now I understand what everybody was talking about . Highly recommended .	1
This blade will cut any material - including laminates , with a smooth as sanded finish . It will easily handle 8/4 maple , oak or cherry . Just make sure to keep it sharp , and treat it well .	1
Smooth cuts . Little sanding required . Just an outstanding combination blade for your tablesaw .	1
first some background : i got a new ridgid miter saw and used it for a while . i replaced the stock blade with a freud 12 '' crosscut blade and was blown away by how smoothly it cut.after the stock blade on my new bosch table saw got a little dull i decided to upgrade to this one . i used it right away to rip a piece of 2x4 douglas fir . i was n't too impressed . it left a smooth cut , but did n't make the cut any easier on the motor . out of curiousity i went with a freud 24 tooth rip blade . i found it to be an easier cut , but it was n't as smooth on crosscuts ( which makes sense since it was n't designed to crosscut ) . my conclusion in these tests is that the forrest blade is nice if you have the power of a cabinet table saw , but probably wo n't work for those of us who ca n't shell out 1k for a table saw . it 's freud for me from now on .	1
Using this blade in a Jet Contractor 's saw . I expected some improvement due to the great reviews and write-ups I 've seen on this saw but was just plain amazed at the difference right from the first cut . I was using a Freud glueline blade , and still having some burning in hard maple . Tried changing the speed of feed , and continually checked the blade alignment . Finally I decided to spend the extra $ $ and try this blade . I am not sorry and will be hard won to try any other blades . I 'm thinking now of eventually upgrading my chop saw blade , and even the dado set to replace the one I have . Nothing less than superb !	1
I asked for this blade as a wedding present and actually got it . I could not justify spending $ 100 on a table saw blade.Well , now I know that I can never justify buying a $ 50 blade . This is not just a saw blade . It is a piece of equipment . It just happens to mount to another piece of equipment . We all spend lots of money on things that just dont measure up to what we expected . Throwing down the extra money on this bad boy will reward you in ways no other piece of woodworking equipment will . I 've used DeWalt , CMT , and Freud blades and the Forrest is the top of the line . The CMT and Freud burnt up the wood and the Forrest didnt , all with the same setup on the saw.Well worth the money.Update : Now that I 've had this blade for a while , it is even better than I originally thought . It 's been great for cross cuts , ripping , and plywood . I use this blade when I rip boards that will be glued up . Seems to make a better surface than a jointer for glue-ups . So far , no burning with this blade . It 's top notch all the way .	1
This has definitely is the best blade I have ever used . It is a good investment . I am planning to buy the crosscut blade also .	1
The first time I put some wood to this blade I could not believe what happened . It felt almost as if there were no blade . It cuts very smoothly and with little effort . Also , since I can cut boards at a faster feed rate , I have not seen any burn marks on any of my boards , yet . I will buy another one for my miter saw next . It is worth the money .	1
This is the cream of of the crop , top of the heap , A Number 1 , superb blade . It cuts as well as everyone says . This blade is noticeably stiffer than the blade this replaced . UPDATE : I 've now cut 1000+ linear feet of hardwoods with this blade . The cuts are awesome ! ! Not a single machine mark ! Boards are ready for glue up . No need to make a stop at the jointer . I 'd give this 6 stars if I could !	1
My woodworker husband loves these blades ; we buy at least one a year so he has them on hand for projects . Amazon 's service and price ca n't be beaten !	1
THE LOWDOWN : Considered the best combo blade on the market . Worth the price.THINGS TO CONSIDER : -- This blade has an alternating top bevel ( ATB ) tooth pattern . That means that the teeth stick up higher on the sides then in the middle -- which means it 's NOT good for cutting spline slots or kerfs that you 'll want to fit another piece of wood into ( as in boxmaking ) . ( Most rip blades have flat teeth , so buy a cheap ripper from the borg if you are looking to make those sort of kerf cuts . ) -- This blade is thick . If you 've got a larger cabinet saw , you 're in the clear to use it . ( With my 3hp Grizzly 1023 , it 's like butter . ) With a smaller saw ( contractors or benchtop ) you may not have enough power to push this thing through thick hardwood , so it 's worthwhile to ask around and plan ahead. -- Plan for the kerf size when purchasing wood . I know I more than once found that I 'd forgotten to account for such a wide kerf in my material planning . If you rip a board into four sections with this blade , you 're going to lose 3/8ths to the kerf ! So , if you 're conservation minded when it comes to pricey wood , you might want to opt for a thinner kerf blade. -- Heed Forrest 's instructions for using this blade . In thick hardwoods , it 's possible to `` blue '' the blade if you build up too much friction ( which could happen with any blade for a zillion reasons if you 're not careful . ) It 's not likely , but possible , and it will really make you angry to ruin such an expensive blade. -- Keep it clean . It , like most blades , cuts much better when it 's clean . I recommend waxing the sides of it too.REPUTATION OF THE MAKER : -- The Forrest Woodworker II is the `` gold standard '' combination blade ( combo=for both ripping and crosscutting ) on the market for tablesaws. -- Most professionals doing fine woodworking will recommend this blade both for the quality it provides AND the convenience of not having to switch blades . The time it saves is money in your pocket in a production environment. -- The company stands behind their products . I had a warped blade which they replaced promptly ... WAY after the warranty had expired . I 've heard only good things about their sharpening service as well . The best part ? You can actually talk to a human , in America , on the phone .	1
Very high quality blade that cuts like a knife through butter . In making my Oak headboard , this blade cut cleanly through 12/4 x 8 ' boards without chatter or vibration . Smooth cuts with little to no tearout . Best blade I have used yet .	1
This is the best blade you will ever use . Spend the money . When mine arrived , I installed it , made a trial cut , and got burn when the workpiece tailed out of the blade path . I had just aligned my fence , using my Jesada set'n sand disk and visually adjusting until the fence snugged up to the disk . I squared up a piece of 5/4 clear pine and attached a dial indicator to the end of it , pointing at the blade . When I slid this jig along the fence , it was out of alignment by so much I do n't even remember . I reinstalled the Forrest blade , and fussed with the fence alignment until it was about .001 & quot ; ( I 've given up trying to get dead bang ... the picture of the skeleton covered with spider webs sitting in front of the computer terminal waiting for the server to come back up keeps coming to mind ) . Make another trial cut . I could n't feel the stock moving through the blade ... hot knife through butter . No burn . Next some 45 degree miter cuts on some cherry molding ... no tearout . I love this blade . When I can afford it , I 'll buy two more . BTW , my saw is a Grizzly G1023SL with an adapted Delta Unifence .	1
Cuts great . Very sharp . No wood burn on long rips . Blade was off by 4/1000 when measured with a dial indicator . Much better than my previous Freud blade , but expected a little more accuracy at this price .	1
This blade is a standard for fine woodworking . I checked my blade with my TS-Aligner and the runout was within 3 mils which is very good . The blade produces very smooth cuts .	1
I got the Woodworker II about 1 week ago for my Jet contractor table saw . Before I used the blade , I first tunned up my table saw using a micrometer , to make sure my review would be less biased.I set the blade to be within 3 thousandths to the miter guage . Then I tuned up the fence to miter slot to be within 1/1000th with a micrometer . After this the blade cut well , but did n't sound any quieter ( that some people have reported ) I compared the blade vs. my Dewalt 3215 10 '' blade . The Dewalt blade is supposed to be designed to be as good as the Woodworker blade . I choose pine since softwoods are actually harder to cut smoothly than hardwoods ( that 's why woodworker 's like hardwoods - they machine easier ) .To the feel of the hand I found the cuts to be the same . Using a 10x loupe I found the Woodworker II to be a slightly better cut . However , one could definately see the circular blade marks from either blade with the loupe . To the naked older ( 50 's ) eye , you have to look at the cut in strong light holding the wood at a sharp angle to the light to see a hint of the marks.The carbide teeth are slightly larger on the Wodworker II vs Dewalt , so it should last longer ( if you are one to get your blades resharpened ) . The blade comes with a nice 3 page `` how to get the best out of your new blade '' instructions . DeWalt simply has `` how to use '' on the back of their packaging but their printing process is less legible.If you can get the Woodworker II discounted below the normal price , then I think it should be considered . However , the Dewalt Series 40 blades are very good too , and tend to be more reasonably priced .	1
I am a weekend warrior , serious do it yourselfer , hobby woodworker . I owned a Freud combination blade for about two years , and although that was a fine blade , it did have quite a few short comings . I decided to go with the Forrest blade , and it really does live up to the hype . The teeth are ground flush to the plate , that 's how you get nearly jointer quality cuts with little or no need for a 1/32 '' clean up pass on the jointer . The cross cuts are almost splinter free , even on veneer plywood/MDF . The 30 degree ATB will , I imagine , wear at a faster rate than 15 or 20 degree ( despite the extra hard C4 grade carbide ) , but that is the price you pay for such clean cross cuts . I have the blade mounted on a Hitachi contractor/home shop saw ( C10FL model ) and despite the 1.5HP motor , this blade does a pretty darn good job of ripping thick hardwoods ( purpleheart , maple , bloodwood , etc. ) . However , I do use a dedicated 20T rip blade when I have a lot of wood to rip to rough size . I do n't know how long this blade will go before I need to send it to Forrest for sharpening , but if I follow their care instructions and never accidentally hit a piece of metal in the wood ( yes , it happens ) I imagine it will last a couple of years for the amount of use I give the blades . This blade looks so simple and `` unsophisticated '' but it does n't need any `` anti vibration slots '' or `` tension rings '' or `` cooling slots '' . It is a fine piece of American workmanship that really does do what the manufacturer says it will do . Very pleased with my purchase , and I highly recommend this blade to anyone who is even an occasional woodworker .	1
I have been using Forrest blades for 25 years . Every one of them was great AND their sharpening service is excellent ! Though these seem expensive , consider that we get two , three or sometimes even four re-sharpenings out of them.The tooth geometry of the Woodworker II is especially versatile . It does cross-cuts or ripping very well , better than most `` combination-blades . '' Obviously , you need to slow the feed-rate for cross-cuts , especially at the exit . They run smoothly and `` true '' so they have very little tendency to burn ... assuming your saw is set-up squarely ! The blades are always very flat , balanced and evenly-tensioned . The gullet design and expansion slots keep heat down and even throughout the steel . We have never had a problem with thermal distortion , even with big production-runs in plywood.Forrest will custom grind with flat teeth or alternating flats so that they can be used for dados , rabbets and grooves . For small production runs or unique custom pieces , we often do n't bother using dado-stacks . We just use an accurate spacing jig and run dados by cutting through several times . ( Dado Tip ... make the first cuts from behind , like a scoring-blade , to prevent tear-out . Your dados will come out perfect ! Of course , a sliding-table makes that easier , but you can do that with these blades using a shop-built sled too . ) Forrest will also replace missing or damaged teeth using the same high-quality carbide , technicians and machinery that made the blades in the first place . Shipping cost is about $ 8 bucks.In the long run , we have found these to be not only the cleanest-cutting blades , but the best value .	1
This is my second WWII . I prefer the full kerf version . Now I can send back my other one for sharpening and not feel guilty . Great cuts , nice and smooth in all types of wood . My first one needs its first sharpening .. after quite a bit of cutting everyhing . i did recently purchase a Freud rip blade for thicker rips of wood ... 2-3 inches worth . This blade is not meant for thick rips of hardwood , but it suffices while sharp . Great blade , definitely recommended .	1
This blade is all that and more . The best table saw blade I have ever used . If your piece is straight line just glue it . Yes , the cut is that good .	1
Forrest blades are always well-made but I would suggest you purchase their latest blade as this one will leave triangle shaped bottle that you must flatten out with a chisel . Forrest has redesigned their news blade with flat tooth to remove the triangle shaped wood .	1
Excellent saw blade at a fantastic price . Amazingly smooth cuts both ripping and cross-cut . Ca n't say enough good about it .	1
Previous to purchasing this blade I had never paid more than $ 50 for a blade . I was reluctant to purchase it because the price and I thought my blade was fine until I started reading the reviews on Forrest blades having a smooth edged glue line rip potential . I had always cut my stock a little bigger to allow for jointing or planing to get rid of the awful blade marks caused by my old blades . So I gave the Forrest Woodworker II a try and got the 1/8 '' kerf ( .125 ) to match my old blades so I would n't have to tweak my Jet Contractor table saw . When the blade arrived I was very impressed with the quality of it right out of the box , and the ability to send the blade in to get re-sharpened was a big plus . When I first installed the blade and turned the table saw on I was n't very impressed with it as it was about as loud and vibrated just as much as my other blades . I ripped a few boards and was impressed by how it cut with no problem , but there was still blade marks on the wood . I thought I got a dud blade . I checked the table saws calibrations again , but they were pretty much dead on using incra guaranteed squares and a stabila level . I was pretty ticked by this point . Later that night I got online and looked at reviews and tried to investigate why the Forrest blade was n't performing well . I found and purchased the 5 '' blade stabilizer and read about and then purchased the Power Twist V-Belt all in hopes of correcting the problem . When the items arrived I first just installed the Power Twist V-Belt to replace the auto belt on the table saw . I noticed an immediate difference in loudness and vibration . The saw was extremely quiet and very little to no vibration at startup and while running no vibration . I ripped a few boards and finally got a great edge rip , but there were still a few minor scratches here and there . I then installed the Forrest 5 '' blade stabilizer . I ripped a few more boards and finally got a perfect glass like glue line rip . Now I will never use another saw blade for my shop table saw . The Forrest Woodworker II blade works as advertised , but you must have a completely dialed machine for it to perform to that standard .	1
Well ... I never doubted that this blade would be superb ... after all , it 's one of the most [ costly ] blades available . If you read all the reviews available on the web regarding this blade , the only complaint you ever hear about it concerns the price . But ... if you consider that you 're buying ( perhaps for the first time , as in my case ) a blade that is not a `` throw-away , '' then it 's money well-spent . Forrest offers resharpening on this blade that 'll put it back in new condition . More often than not , a resharpened blade does n't stay sharp as long as it did when it was new ... but Forrest uses all this laser-cut technology that yields a blade that 's just as good the second time around.When you consider how long you can use this blade before you have it sharpened the first time , and then double it ( maybe triple it , but I have n't tried that yet ) , then the high price paid for this blade is n't very high.And ... your cuts are going to astound you . No tearout and `` jointer-smooth. '' Recommended ! ! !	1
I use this blade on a Bosch 4000-09 . This Forrest blade is consistantly the best all-around table saw blade I have experienced . It makes great cuts whatever the circumstances ... rips , cross cuts , miters ... whatever . If you want to be really satisfied , this is the blade . I prefer the standard width blade ( this one ) to the narrow ( 3/32 '' )	1
Trust me , spend the extra money and get a good saw blade like this one.I used cheap blades for years and after an accident partially due to a dull blade I got this one.It cuts like butter , stays sharp far longer and it 's worth spending the couple buck to have it sharpened every once in a while .	1
Now I understand what all the fuss is about ... this blade stands completely alone . It produces such a smooth , beautiful edge when mounted in my table saw , that it looks like I sanded the edge . It 's so much better than even the Freud blades that I have been buying forever , that I ca n't imagine using anything else from now on.I should also mention that I am able to feed hardwoods through my 3HP table saw with much less pressure . It feels like I doubled the HP on the saw ... a nice bonus.All I can say is do n't wait , do n't think another second about the few extra coins this will set you back ... .just buy it and I know you will never be sorry . I wish I had done it sooner . My results were so exceptional , that I immediately ordered a 12 '' 80 tooth Chopmaster version for my Dewalt compound miter saw ... .ca n't wait to test that too.P.S . I also use the 5 '' Forrest stiffener with this blade .	1
Truly fine tools speak for themselves . Using them produces results unobtainable with poorly made tools . I am using this blade in a Saw Stop Cabinet Saw . Cuts are true , smooth , and effortless in hardwoods and sheet goods .	1
This blade is so awesome it is hard to describe . It cuts cleanly and easliy in the toughest of woods , leaving a smooth cut . 95 % of the time you could make a cut on the saw and glue it right up - it is that smooth . I could never go back to a & quot ; normal & quot ; table saw blade now . Now I just need to get the forrest dado blade and I will be in heaven .	1
This blade truely is outstanding . For a combination blade , it does everything very well . The resulting cuts are very high quality . Rip cuts and cross cuts in hardwood , softwood and plywood all come out smooth and splinter free.I 've used mine on several projects and it 's still very sharp and yields great cuts . I expect that in the near furure , I 'll have to send it back to Forrest for a quality sharpening . So , I bought another Woodworker II for backup .	1
Who would have thought that a saw blade could make such a huge difference ? Although others had recommended the Forrest blade , I 'm pretty cheap and had trouble justifying the cost . No retailers near me offer the Forrest blades so I had never seen one in action . I finally caved in and bought one for my new cabinet saw after using another blade with disappointing results.I could n't believe the difference . It cuts quietly and smoothly through even 8/4 hardwood . It does n't burn . It leaves a beautiful finish that 's ready for gluing.It 's worth it !	1
I have been using Forrest blades for a long time and heartily recommend them to anyone that does finish woodworking - for rough work an inexpensive blade is fine .	1
There 's little for me to add except I can now see the flaws my jointer leaves on an edge . The saw cut edge is polished , ready to finish . The jointed edge still needs a light hit with sandpaper to reach that point.The measured run-out on mine is less than .002 & quot ; total . At this point , I have to wonder if that 's the arbor , or the blade . Not that it matters much ; just pressing a finger on the end of the arbor shows three- to five-thou ' on the dial indicator . The blade is dead flat for all practical purposes . I believe this is the secret of its phenomenal cut . Freud blades might have better carbide , as I 've heard claimed , and they might even hold an edge longer . What I have n't heard is that they cut better.With a blade this good , I can hold off on buying a better jointer for a good while longer . I only need an edge good enough to get a straight rip ; then I can just rip the other side and get two dead flat parallel edges , ready to glue or finish .	1
The Woodworker II blade replaced a Freud general purpose thin-kerf blade that was just OK . It caused occassional burns when ripped a burn-susceptible wood like cherry . The Forrest WWII ( standard .125 kerf ) does it all -- clean , burn-free rips in cherry , smooth cross cuts on hardwood , and smooth surfaces on both sides of cuts in solid core plywood . It 's unusual to find a product that handles multiple tasks as well they would be handled by several single-purpose tools . This one really does it all . I have a 1-HP Delta contractor 's saw and the WWII blade seems expensive , but it 's worth the cost .	1
I was convinced that this blade was one of the best , if not the best , on the market . Every saw mill or local business I talked to confirmed this . The only real question I had was if it was worth the steep price . The answer is deffinately & quot ; yes & quot ; . I have only been using it for two months , so I can not comment on the durability of the blade . I will say that if you have a decent fence on your saw then a jointer will not be needed . I have been making a solid walnut desk and have such perfect cuts that I have no need for one . And the truly amazing thing is that I ripped two sheets of walnut vaneer to see how it held up . No fraying with the grain and only about a 64 of a inch on the cross grain . This is truly a great blade and well worth the money .	1
Forrest has its reputation for a reason . This blade makes very smooth cuts . There are other blades that do quite well , just depends how much you want to spend.You can probably get something cheaper that does as well as this , but who knows how they hold up . Fueud glue line blades cut just as smooth . But Forrest is the `` best '' .	1
So my father and I have done woodworking for decades individually and joint projects , as hobbyists . I turned him onto Freud blades maybe 15 years ago . After recently buying a new Bosch table saw , I decided to see what all the fuss was about with Forrest blades . After installing , calibrating the blade to the miter slot and cutting the zero clearance insert , we put a sheet of 1/2 '' ply through the first cut . We were blown away , the blade is unbelievably quiet , smooth , and the cut quality is mind blowing . I 've never experienced wood cutting like this in my life . I am a true convert now . This blade has changed my perception of what a cut can be.I use the dampener with this blade and the combination is `` life altering '' for woodworking projects.My father plans to buy one now for his radial arm saw which has always been an ear piercing saw to use . So I think this blade will quiet that saw considerably.9 months later : I am currently building mudroom cabinetry . Using this blade on my Bosch table saw allows cuts which I think are equal to those on far more expensive cabinet saws.The biggest differences I experience with this blade versus Freud are that the Forrest blade is much quieter and has less vibration . The cutting teeth on this blade are huge for a 10 '' blade . I think Forrest makes the ultimate blade here.Thinking of buying a Forrest 7 1/4 '' saw blade . The Freuds are fine for circular saws but I think a Forrest would be better .	1
I 'll note first this works on my Sawstop cabinet saw . This blade may be expensive but wow , it cuts through 1/4 oak veneer like it was butter . The smoothest cut I 've ever seen without one speck of tear out . It 's like I had sanded the edge . This blade cut soother than my dewalt and craftsman finish blades . 60-80 tooth . Highly recommend .	1
I bought this after reading all the positive reviews because I literally have a ton of hard maple to rip and am building lots of cabinets requiring furniture grade ply . I want accurate cuts with no tear out.The carbide tips feel and look of premium quality.The blade is noticeably heavier than my other 4 blades . The heft of blade compared to others probably accounts for half of the ripping power this blade offers do to its rotational mass . It would slice your finger off with no problem . Over all I have used it for 2 days of cutting so far and definitely notice a difference over my other premium blades that I had bought before spending the money on this.I am using a crosscut sled to cut my cabinet bottoms and stretchers to exact length . When using this I am getting tear out on the bottom of the plywood . I did not get this tear out with my other 60 tooth blade . It is noticeable . However , when not using the cross cutting sled and ripping the same plywood it saws flawlessly through the wood.My feed rate has increased with out a doubt . It leaves a good edge on the maple and certainly a better cut than the 24 tooth blade I was using before.Is it the all in one blade ? ? ? I would have to saw no . I am not all that satisfied with the crosscut on ply . It does the job just fine on hardwoods though.So all in all , if you are using this for hardwoods it is exceptional . If you are ripping , this blade is perfect . My only beef is that the crosscut on plywood is not where I need it to be . I will use my 60 tooth for this.Overall I believe it is a great addition to my shop and it will be in the saw 75 percent of the time . I am suprised more people do not have this issue.And yes , it is a zero clearance kerf on the sled .	1
I have had my first Woodworker II since 2001 . They are well worth the money and I do n't consider this blade expensive considering it 's great quality . The companies ability to resharpen it to factory specs makes it last for years . Cuts are glassy smooth and do n't require sanding for a glue up.The only reason I am ordering another one is that I became lax and ran a heavy nail through the last one and damaged it to the point that I was money ahead to just buy a new one . That was my fault . It still cuts halfway decent considering what I did to it and I will use it for questionable wood from now on . I do n't say that I recommend too many things because it is such a matter of opinion with all the choices one has these days ; however , I can easily say that I recommend this blade .	1
My brother introduced me to Forrest Blades . I bought one at a wood show and tried it . I just could not believe the results . Wonderful ! It put new life in my radial 9 & quot ; Sears saw . The cuts were effortless and smooth as glass . With this underpowered saw that used to bog down in simple 2 x 4s , I can cut anything with ease . I was impressed enough to buy two more for my other bench saws . That demonstrates it all when these cost the big bucks . But these blades are worth every penny !	1
Buy it ! This is a sweet blade . The price is scary . The lower tooth count raises questions . The reality is it is the best general purpose blade . The price is in line with the performance it delivers . ( Maybe the price should be higher to indicate the quality ! ) The tooth count , well who care how many teeth it has , it the results that count !	1
A blade is a blade ... .. Then there is Forrest bladesSmooth shiny end grain cuts . Smooth rip cuts as if you sanded with 400 grit paper.I was at the Woodworking show in Milwaukee this weekend and a guy came up and complained that his blade was not what he expected . He got an instant choice to make . `` Did he want a complete refund ? Or a new replacement blade ? '' He picked `` new Blade '' and went away very happy . Instantly the group of people at the demo table bought blades.The price is not cheap but ( as the demo guy said ) `` the quality outperforms the cost . '' He is right ! I have n't done it yet , but adding the stabilizer by Forrest guarantees a babies butt smooth cut .	1
I have really cut alot with this blade , From Paduk to Pine and have always got a clean accurate cuts . I cut almost everything with it , all I have ever done is to clean the pitch off the carbide teeth . If you do n't have a Woodworker II in your blade inventory-Get One ! !	1
Cuts are not glassy smooth , but they 're much better than those from the relatively cheap Oldham blade that I had previously . -has too many teeth for ripping hard maple -- tends to burn . I 'd buy another .	1
I have a 10 & # 34 ; PM2000 table saw that I use in a production environment . On any given day , I 'm cutting hard woods , soft woods and laminates doing lots of cross-cutting and long rips . One draw back to the saw is the clumsy method for adjusting the riving knife . It takes a long time to do correctly losing valuable shop time . If I use specialty blades , I have to reset the riving knife to accommodate the different kerfs so I needed a blade that would cut almost everything all day long with one zero clearance insert and one knife setting . This is the blade that does it . Smooth cuts , even in plywood . Clean rips that almost match that of glue edge blades . Clean bevels and mitres with minimal tearout on the lagging edge . Believe it or not , the blade seemed to actually get a little sharper after about 4 hours of use . This blade is a little pricey but you 'll save those bucks by recovering lost set-up time and a reduced investment in specialty blades .	1
I purchased a Forrest blade because I was experiencing too much run-out in other previously & # 34 ; good quality & # 34 ; blades . This blade was more expensive , but the run-out turned out to be within the 0.002 inch , as advertised . I love this blade !	1
I use this in my Delta Contractor saw for fine woodworking . I do not have the Forrest 5 & quot ; dampeners because I can not believe I a can improve the quality of my cuts . I spent some time with setting up my saw to be sure that it was adjusted perfectly . There are adjusting screws available for this saw that make this very easy and perfect . The cuts are so clean that you can go to the 220 grit sandpaper when you begin sanding . I did not think my saw was capable of the quality of cuts that I now get . I do not see a need to plane an edge after this cut it I push it through correctly . I was considering getting a new saw to get the quality I wanted . I have put several hundred board feet of very hard wood such as hard maple through this blade both ripping and cutting . It is so much better than any blade I have ever seen in my 35 years of woodworking experience . I was surprised that I actually spent this much money on a blade , but I bought a second blade to use when I sent it off to be sharpened because I would not want to be without it for a day . I use my other blades for particleboard , used wood , rough construction and items that do not matter about the fine quality . I am now expecting to add the miter box blade and the dado-set too.I would not trust a local to sharpen this blade . I have never found a local who sharpens my other blades to the same quality of the new blade . Forrest offers re-sharpening service for these blades that restores them to factory specs . Turn-around is fast , send in the original container.I now save sanding time on everything I do . I saved myself from buying a new saw . I save the edge jointing time . This blade more than pays for it 's self in time and money . Buy this blade and you wo n't be sorry , You will not buy other brands of blades again .	1
Title says it all . I was a doubter but after using these on a cheapie underpowered contractors table saw and a cabinet saw I BELIEVE . Give new life to your table saw buy a WWII .	1
I am an amatuer woodworker . I have spent hard earned money on several blades including Freud , Dewalt , and everything in between . There is no comparison when looking at the finished cut with the Forrest Blade vs the others . I will admit that several blades were pretty good initally in quality of cut , but did not stay that way for long . I bought two higher end Rip Blades ( not as expensive as a Forrest Blade ) from other manufacturers thinking that a designated Rip Blade would cut as well or better than the WWII 40 tooth combo blade . I was Wrong ! ! ! The WWII cut was superior by a large margin . I like this blade so well that I bought the Dado blade and the Box Joint Blade . All of the lessor blades but one went to the garage sale . The one lessor blade I kept is for recycled lumber that might contain nails and debris . After I rough cut , I use the WWII for the finish cutting.Buy this blade and never second guess yourself for spending a little more on a quality product.Compare the thickness of the carbide teeth , check the brazing , test cut of the blade . You will be disappointed in using anything else ! If you only cut scrapwood for the fire place or grill buy the cheaper blades.UPDATE ; This blade is still going strong and giving fantastic cuts , even after more than a year of use . I cut a lot of Oak , Cherry , Poplar , Pine , Walnut , Brazilian Cherry , and a few other hardwoods , both exotic and North American . This blade is still giving cuts that look like they were just sanded.I have noticed a slight difference over time . The brand new blade left a glowing surface . The latest cuts look like they have been sanded to 220 grit or better . The still glue up fine and wood edges are sharp.I have since bought a second WWII 40 tooth blade that I save for veneered panels . The chip out is minimal with no prep work and non-exsistent when I place masking tape over the cut line.I still have found nothing better .	1
This blade is simply the finest blade I have ever used in my Unisaw . I 've tried many.Cheapies and expensive ones , Delta Dewalt , Irwin , several Freuds and the list goes on and on . Forrest claims a smooth as sanded surface and they are right . Since I made the switch , I do n't use my jointer as often . I thought 40 teeth might be a little aggressive for veneers , but I was wrong . The woodworker II does a fine job on them also . Do I have any complaints ? Only that I did n't start using them sooner .	1
I have owned a table saw for 20 years and have tried a lot of different blades . The Forrest Woodworker II is simply the best cuting blade I have ever used for cross cutting , ripping or mitering . The only time I take it off my saw is when cutting 2x4 's or other construction grade material that may have sand or hidden nails . I have used it on a Delta Contractor saw and currently use it on a PM model 66 with equal results . The only time I use my jointer is to get a straight edge to place against the fence . The only other blade I use is the Freud LU84M which I would rate # 2 , second to the Forrest . The Forrest makes the smoothest cuts , but the Freud is better for 1/8 & quot ; finger joints due to the flatter bottomed kerf produced by the raker tooth on the Freud which the Forrest does not have . Too bad it does n't have a raker tooth .	1
I have been building up my home shop for years and have purchased a good deal of the tools in it from Amazon . I depend on the reviews left here to determine whether I should buy a certain item or not . I read ALL the reviews before I buy . Sometimes there are radically different reviews on the same product from different people that all sound like they know what they are talking about , though , so you just have to trust the overall rating . Lately , I have noticed that my projects seem less perfect than I think they should so I started looking to nicer tools . Without doubt , those nicer tools have made a difference in my work and I just wanted to tell any other woodworkers out there moving past the novice level that its ok to skimp on certain things , the things you can modify or may not use that often , but on certain tools , you just should n't ... I recently decided that I did n't like the tearout that I always get crosscutting plywood on the table saw and cutting ANYTHING on the compound miter , radial arm , or small circular saw . They were all the original blades that came with the tools and were long in the tooth - besides being junk in the first place . The radial arm blade I replaced with a Freud from Home Depot ( I was there , it was impulse ) . I liked it very much and it was at that point that I decided that I should replace the table saw and miter saw and also my little 6 '' circular saw . Having had such good luck with the Freud , I was happy that I was not going to have to spend $ 100 on every blade . I replaced the 6 '' saw blade next with a Freud . As soon as it arrived , I ran it through a few cuts and although it was better than the stock blade , it was not at all what I was hoping for . That was one of those reviews where some people said they hated it and some loved it . Next I started looking at replacing the compound miter blade , also with a Freud , that again had the same mixed reviews sparking a feeling of unease . I was also looking to replace the table saw blade at the same time so ran across this model . I went back and forth between the WWII and a Freud combination blade , read the reviews , reread the reviews , trying to ken whether I could really justify spending this much more . How could they be that much different ? ? ? Well , I ordered the Freud LU91M010 ( for the chop saw ) and the Forrest WWII and now I understand . The Freud cuts and cuts smoothly . It 's ok . It still does leave some tearout . The WWII , though . That is money well spent . I put it through its paces and it impressed me every time . It does everything that the other reviewers say . It is smooth . It is silent . It left no tearout in anything I ran through it ( birch ply , mahog ply , maple , soft pine , red oak ) . I did not purchase the stabilizer . I am glad I decided to allow myself to spend the extra money . I will not be so quick to look at Freud blades now , as 2 out of 3 that I purchased did not perform as they should and $ 50 is still not nothing .	1
This blade has been touted as the benchmark for all general purpose table saw blade to be compared to . It is worth all the hype . I have had great success ripping and cross-cutting cherry , walnut , oak , pine , MDF , plywood . The quality of the cut surface is truly wonderful . Worth every penny .	1
This blade rips 3 & quot ; stock just as effortlessly as it crosscuts 1/2 & quot ; stock . It is fairly quiet and does leave silky smooth crosscuts . Cuts in formica or delicate veneered plywood are perfectly splinter free . No tendency to kickback . Rip cuts , however , are not always smooth and do often require jointing ; not that I know of a better blade , but for me this is not the miracle blade it is stated to be . I really do n't think the thin kerf is worth all the hassle and would definately buy the 1/8 & quot ; next time as the stabilizers are pricey and interfere with the throat insert ( especially a zero clearance ) . I had to shift my table to allow even the standard insert to fit , then I routed out the bottom of the zero clearance insert for clearance at max depth and now I curse whenever attempting to utilize the kerf for a rabbet or such .	1
Spendy , but nice ... This is a very good saw blade . I 've never had a saw blade that cuts rips of 3/4 plywood so thin you can see light through the pores of the end grain . This one does it without shattering the cut off.Overall the blade runs fairly quietly and cuts cleanly . I do get some light tooth marks in hardwoods but they clean up easily.Take the time to read the information sheet that comes with the blade . There is a good discussion about how to true up your saw to take full advantage of the blade . Well worth the time to do it right ...	1
i have only used 50.00 or so blades in the past.on the reviews only did i decide to go with this blade.i am glad i did its as good as everyone says.now i want another for a spare .	1
I 've tried a wide variety of blades on my table saw , and by far this blade cuts the smoothest and easiest of any other blade I 've used . I 'm going to upgrade all of my shops cutting blades to Forrest as money permits . I paid twice as much for this blade as I my last Freud , but the quality of cut is five times better .	1
I 've been using this blade as well as it 's thin kerf model for about 3 years now . I also have a couple of Tenryu Gold Medal blades that I 've been using for the same amount of time . The Forrest rips a bit faster , while the Tenryu cuts quieter and smoother , especially on cross cuts . Both brands are high quality , but for my most demanding , finest projects , the Tenryu is my go to blade . An added benefit is that it 's a bit cheaper than the Forrest . If you already have a Forrest Woodworker II or are looking for an excellent table saw blade , I 'd seriously consider the Tenryu Gold Medal . It might just make you set aside the Forrest for those less demanding jobs .	1
I have had this blade for a few months now and have used it to cut over 400 bd ft of hardwood ( mostly walnut ) with a Bosch 4000 portable Job-site table saw . I have used many different blades on this saw over the years ( freud thin , Dewalt woodworker , etc etc ) and this is the best blade I have ever used for this type of saw . The thin kerf is perfect for under powered saws . Now for my 3 hp Jet TS I use a full kerf blade ( forrest is great as is the freud fusion ) because the thicker metal is more stable and leaves a cleaner cut . I highly recommend this blade for ALL portable saws and any saw with less then 1 1/2 hp . It makes a very clean cut in both cross cuts and rips . This blade excels at cutting hardwoods and is worth the higher price .	1
I 'm new to woodworking and needed a good blade to help not to tax my contractor saw motor and this one does well . I have a Ridgid 3650 and I 've ripped and crosscut some 2x4 Douglas Fir for a recent project and the cuts were nice and smooth and clean . This is a great combination blade and I look forward to years of use .	1
The WWII 40T TK was a gift and is a very clean cutting versatile blade that 'll do justice to just about any cutting task you 'll encounter with a table saw . On most cuts it 's difficult to detect saw marks if the saw is aligned properly . I literally have to hold the board up to bright light and view it from just the right angle to even notice a trace of saw marks . It 's much easier to detect marks from my Freud LU84R011 , DeWalt DW7646 , Leitz 40T general purpose , Leitz 50T combo , CMT 40 tooth , and Oldham 60T finishing blade.The teeth are large , sharp and stay sharp a long time . It 's available in both full or thin kerfs , and is made in the USA . Highly recommended .	1
I bought this blade in December 2009 . I 've cut everything from MDF , Plywood and solid wood with it . It 's finally time to send it in to Forrest in NJ for sharpening ( curb marks on fence side of the wood ) . It 's going to cost me $ 21.50 for the sharpening and $ 12 to ship it back to me.When I get it back I 'm only going to use it for cutting solid wood . I 'm going to buy a cheaper blade for cutting MDF and plywood . The cuts from this blade have to be seen to be believed .	1
This stays on my Powermatic 66 for about 95 % of the time . It does everything well . It is not the perfect rip blade or perfect cross cut blade and certainly not the perfect plywood blade BUT I strongly believe it to be - BY FAR - the best all around blade I have ever used . It does all of those tasks better than some other brands ' job specific blades . This baby is a workhorse and my advice is to buy iy - do n't even think twice about the price .	1
An excellent blade . I did not believe the claims of & quot ; gluable & quot ; and & quot ; joiner & quot ; quality cuts , but it 's true . I think it 's a combination of the thin curf and the blade quality , but it feels like I 've added another horse or two to my saw motor . I also bought the stabilizer right off . The blade is obviously more expensive , but the quality of the cut is so good it 's hard to even compare the WWII with standard blades.By the way , I use a Uniguard blade guard with the separate splitter . I was a little concerned at first about whether the kerf of the 3/32 blade would be wide enough for the splitter , but it is . I did have to adjust the position of the splitter , and place the stabilizer on the inside of the blade to get the two to line up . But it works very well.I wish I could afford one for my miter saw !	1
My first purchase of real quality blades from Forest . These reviews seem to come to early in my opinion . But so far , I am pleased with the results .	1
What a blade . It does smooth cross-cuts , competent rips , and shows very little tear-out . I still sometimes use a different blade for ripping -- especially with thicker boards -- but the WW2 is on my saw for 90 % of my cuts.The thing I like best about this blade is the way it worked on my old saw . I used to have an ancient Craftsman direct-drive saw ( where the blade attaches to the motor directly , not to an arbor ) . This kind of saw seems to be subject to more vibration and run-out than cabinet and contractor 's saws with an arbor . With this blade and the matching stiffener I even got good results on the old saw . It does even nicer cuts on my new Jet contractor 's saw.Recommended .	1
This is a stunning blade and I could n't find anything better through all of my research . $ 100 for a saw blade may seem like a big investment , but because I plan to send it back to be resharpened many times , the price will be amortized over time , and will end up costing the same or less than other blades , and through lots of cutting already , it 's the BEST ! I read the reviews online extensively , and I 'm a sucker for having the right tool with no compromise . This blade is everything that was promised , and more ! Forget any complaints on here that seem half-baked - this saw blade is the real deal . Try to find a better blade . The next best will save you $ 40 , but resharpening from Forrest so many times , with great attention to craftsmanship , makes this blade a very smart investment . The next best blade would be tossed after one sharpening , if it would maintain any quality that long.This blade is a pleasure to use every time - I would purchase again in a minute , and make sure that the table and fence are accurately aligned . A well-tuned saw is a safe and happy saw . The people who know say , & # 34 ; Ahhh , you got a Forrest ! , & # 34 ; and that 's all they have to say . If you own a saw , you should own this blade . Hands down , the best blade that you can get . Sharp , beautiful , cuts with remarkable ease ! Do n't worry about the cost - it 's a solid investment that will repay itself many times over with great satisfaction . I would purchase again , and likely will grab a second when I send the blade back for its first resharpening . Owning this blade is a badge of honor - enjoy every moment of using it !	1
I bought this blade for my Bosch table saw with gravity rise stand.I took the blade off the saw that came with it and installed this Forrest blade , and what a difference it made in quality . I took a piece of clear white pine as a test , and the edge was as smooth as glass . At the jobsite ripping down 3/4 red oak , the edge was the same.One thing : When ripping down 12 '' or wider solid hardwood , make sure if you are using the Bosch saw that you drop the riving knife down below the table , or it will bind . Even though there was binding , the Bosch saw never stalled as far as blade rotation . The reason there was binding is due to the fact that this Forrest blade has a smaller kerf size/blade thickness than the riving knife of the Bosch saw.I have to say this blade is as good as the good reviews . It cuts very smooth . Make sure you cut your hardwood at a fairly fast pace , and the edges will come out smooth enough that you will not need to sand them.All I can say is I am impressed with the way this blade performs over other blades I have used . It has made my Bosch saw as smooth as silk in ripping hardwoods to make window jambs on a job , and cut my working time down due to not having to sand in order to remove saw marks and/or rough edges.This is a very nice product and shows yet again , you get what you pay for ( after you do your research ) .Also , Amazon did a great job getting this to me , even arriving ahead of schedule . The container was clean and undamaged as well as the tool itself .	1
With the money I saved on my Delta 36-650 table saw , I bought this blade and the matching dampener/stiffener on the recommendation of a friend . I am stunned at the quality of the cuts this blade makes ; the finished work looks sanded , and the blade cuts all the materials I 've tried so well that it 's hard to envision going back to regular carbide-tipped blades . When this blade eventually needs to be sharpened , I will probably buy a second one so I do n't have to do without it while it 's back at Forrest . It 's that good .	1
I have been woodworking for ten years , and for all ten of those years I have been hearing that Forrest blades are the best . Despite this , I found it hard to spend this much on a saw blade when I could get very good performance from a Freud blade costing one third to one half as much . Armed with an Amazon gift certificate ( a birthday present ) I finally convinced myself to buy one of these blades.This Forrest blade is like no other I have ever used . It is the Cadillac of blades for sure , and the differences between Forrest and Freud are like night and day.First of all , I was impressed with the care that Forrest took in packaging this blade for shipment . The box is very sturdy and reusable in case you want to ship the blade back to Forrest for sharpening . The teeth were protected by an easily removable coating that kept them razor sharp.After installing it on my DeWalt 746 saw ( I also use a DeWalt stabilizing disc ) and after recalibrating my fence scale and adjusting the splitter to accommodate the thinner blade , it was time to start cutting.The performance of this blade is phenomenal ! It is noticably quieter before you start cutting , and a lot quieter while you are cutting . I performed test cuts in 3/4 plywood , 4/4 pine , 4/4 white oak , and 8/4 white oak . I was pleased with all of these cuts . The thin kerf design allowed the wood to glide through the blade with little effort for me or the saw . The rip cuts did give a smoother edge than any blade I have ever used , but there were some VERY minor saw marks left . They were so small that I feel nit-picky in mentioning them , but I want give the facts . Where I was most impressed with this blade was in the quality of the cross cuts . After crosscutting the 4/4 and 8/4 white oak I was very impressed with the shiny smoothness of the endgrain and the total lack of splintering . Speaking of splintering , there was none worth mentioning , even in the plywood.Though it still makes me uneasy to think of spending this much on a saw blade - call it Midwestern frugality - I have to admit that this blade is everything that the hype says it is . I will no doubt be happy with this blade for many years . If money is not an object , then by all means buy this blade . If you have a tight budget , put this on your mental wish list like I did and get one eventually ... you wo n't regret it !	1
Seriously . As good . Maybe better.I 'd been using a Freud 40 tooth thin kerf and assumed the Forrest would be better , but HOW MUCH better quality of cut the Forrest gave me absolutely blew my wig back . I 'm a believer ; I 'll use nothing else from here on out .	1
There simply are no better blades on the market today than the Forrest line . Attributes : incredibly well-balanced , quiet , clean cutting , long lasting , excellent packaging , quick and professional resharpening service . I stray to another brand occasionally , lured by some review in some woodworking magazine , only to be disappointed . After trying some new `` whiz bang '' blade that a magazine reviewer touts , I can put even an older Forrest blade back on my equipment and it cuts better than the new `` Johnny-come-lately . '' Sure , the Forrest blades are a little more expensive , but in this instance , you do truly get what you pay for ... and more . By the way , try Forrest 's stabilizer , too . It will even further enhance performance , especially with a thin kerf blade .	1
I have been using Freud thin kerf blades on my tablesaw the last 6 years , but wanted to see what all the rave was about on these handmade American blades . You cant believe the quality that goes into these once you see them in person . I usually rip wood and bought the Woodworker I and II standard blades kind of as a comparison , but found online they have this thin kerf Woodworker II for ripping afterwards . I have not had a chance to try this blade as I have been using my other Forrest blades , but know that I will be as happy with this one as with the others.Update , May 18 . Got to use this one today as I was making trim for my woodshop . This blade is worth the money !	1
If you can afford the price , you will not regret the purchase . The company has a reputation of producing blades of the highest quality . The thin kerf reduces the load on the saw . The special grind on the teeth produces a great cut . I also own the WoodWorker II .	1
I bought this one after I saw a fellow at a local lumber yard with one . He was sold on it . The Amazon price is the best I found , too .	1
so yes its a little pricey , but as I described in a post for the 16 & # 34 ; blade , these are amazing . I bought a couple to try them out on the recommendation of a fellow wood worker and I was blown away with how good a cut they leave . I would recommend it to any one that wants a nice clean straight cut ( straight due to little to no warp , ca n't fix your technique , sry ) . Very good blades !	1
forrest makes a great saw blade , and they stand behind it 100 % ... they also resharpen the blades when they inevitably get dull , and they come back as good as new , you can not find a better product , anywhere ... buy both the ripping and crosscut , and use them appropriately , and you will be glad you did ... .	1
Very nice blade for the radial arm . Initial jump in is lower and more easily controlled than the prior blade ( basic Ryobi blade ) and so far the crosscuts in solid red oak board and birch ply have been very smooth and splinter-free . Ripping in red oak was also smooth although I got just a touch of burning ... probably due to me feeding to conservatively . The blade runs smooth and quiet for the most part ; occasionally I get some high pitch shriek but I have n't pinned down whether it is material or thickness ... whatever the case it is a lot better than my prior blades so I call it tolerable . I may try a blade stiffener in the future if it does n't give up too much depth of cut.As it says in the header I am using this blade on an old but well maintained DeWalt 7779 radial arm saw .	1
This is the highest quality blade I have used in 20 plus years of woodwork .	1
I use this with my Forrest Woodworker II blade in my Jet 5hp table saw . It makes an already great blade work fantastic . The only thing you have to watch is that it does diminish your depth of cut on the table saw . I still have over 2 & quot ; of cut which is satisfactory for most of my applications . If I need to go deeper , I just take it off .	1
I am currently using this on my table saw . It lays up against the side of your blade , and helps to keep it true . Once in awhile I need to make a deeper cut , and it can get in the way for those cuts . I made some passes 2 1/2 & quot ; deep and the edge of the Forrest stiffner stopped the piece . It is the first time I have had a problem with that.Initially I installed this stiffner on a Sears Radial Arm saw because I was getting a good deal of wobble with it . Oddly enough , when I tried mounting a blade , then testing the trueness , only to loosen the nut , spin the blade slightly to a new seat , then retighten , and after a few tries , I hit it right , and the wobble disappeared . So whenever I replace a blade on that saw , I tweak it until it is right . Oddly enough , it runs so true when I do that , that I moved the Forrest over to the table saw.I mated this stiffner up to the Forrest Woodworker II on my table saw , and I am getting cuts so smooth , you do n't even have to sand the edge . It is finish quality perfectly smooth . ( The Incra TSIII-32 table saw fence helps , giving me a true exact paralell line with the blade . ) So get the stiffner , make sure your fence is perfectly true , and you can forget about having to make your cuts a little bit oversized and having to finish up the edge on the jointer.Highly recommended . The Forrest name is synonymous with the best in quality .	1
I bought this stiffener to try to reduce some tear-out that I was having on the bottom side of melamine during cuts on my table saw . Usage of the stiffener did not eliminate the tear-out , but it did reduce it by around a factor of 5 .	1
I use it on my dewalt portable it gives smoother cuts only drawback is you ca n't cut as deep with it .	1
In twenty-plus years of using these things , I 've learned that they definitely DO improve cut-quality and blade endurance while reducing noise , but only on certain types of saws : American style cabinet saws and modern `` hybrid saws . `` As the name implies , it dampens blade-vibration . All saw blades have slight imbalances that produce vibration at high speeds . Anything that reduces that vibration , improves how well your saw cuts.Obviously , if you do n't care about precision , that 's not a big problem . There are legitimate reasons why some users do not need this thing . Construction carpenters must work FAST and do n't need extremely fine tolerances . Some hobbyists are just making decks , lawn furniture or garage shelves . They do not need or care about precision within one-thousandth of an inch.Many hobbyists have inexpensive contractor-style saws . SOME of these saws ARE capable of precision with enough tweaking , but this thing can not fix a two-hundred dollar `` home-center '' table saw . If your saw fits into a car or costs less than $ 300 , then any improvement will be negligible.Some reviewers did n't detect much improvement with this thing . It 's likely they do n't know how to detect the improvement , how to measure for it or that their machines just are n't capable of delivering high precision.NO SINGLE DEVICE like this will fix a cheap machine , bad bearings or sloppy adjustment.EVERY expensive table saw has blade-stiffeners like these as STOCK equipment . Superb saws ( > $ 10,000 ) have stiffeners / dampeners for a reason : Their engineers understand the importance of keeping blade-vibration to a minimum.Cabinet saws are better than contractor saws , but lack the engineering refinement of high-end Euro machines . So the owner / operator is left to improve his cabinet-saw with every available device and trick he knows . Along with accurate adjustment , good blades and the other `` best-case '' elements , this inexpensive add-on is one more weapon in your arsenal that fights imprecision . It 's like a single soldier in the war against slop ... With his comrades , he can help keep the enemy at bay , but he ca n't win all by himself.What it does and HOW it does it ... The `` Stiffener / Dampener '' reduces blade-noise like a drummer gripping a cymbal . It `` chokes '' or dampens those `` singing '' vibrations . Even on a cheap saw , you will HEAR that difference , especially if you stop the machine mid-cut . When machines run smoothly and quietly , they are more likely to work well . When ANY machine is LOUD , it means there is a source of vibration : enemy of precision.It adds mass near the CENTER of the blade so that tiny weight-discrepancies at the edge of the blade produce less wobble . Less wobble = better cuts.It `` spreads '' its grip over a larger area of the blade ( like a big nut-washer ) so the blade is clamped closer to the cutting-edge . That keeps blade-rotation near a theoretical `` ideal '' in a single plane.The larger clamping-surface and precision-machined arbor-hole reduce chance for misalignment on the arbor.Increased mass acts as a `` heat-sink , '' drawing heat away from the cutting-edge . That improves cooling , which reduces pitch-build-up and increases blade-life.When you understand all that you can see ; though incredibly simple , this device functions on several levels , all cooperating with basic principles of physics.The CRUCIAL FACT is : This thing is an inexpensive improvement to any decent American-style table saw . It helps produce cleaner cuts and promote longer blade-wear , thereby saving you money and improving your quality of work.If you have a fancy European-saw , you do n't need this because your saw already has one . If you are a rough-cut construction carpenter or homeowner-hobbyist with a cheap saw , it wo n't improve your saw significantly and you do n't need such high-precision.This is an ideal tool-upgrade for the dedicated woodworker with a 2 to 6 thousand-dollar cabinet saw . ( Powermatic , Saw-Stop , General , Steel-City or top Taiwanese saws . ) It will offer SOME improvement even on decent hybrid or contractor-saws . ( Bosch , Makita , DeWalt . Those saws are made well-enough to notice . ) However , it can not fix a cheap saw , a dull blade , a poor set-up or a careless operator.This is for woodworkers with good American-style saws who wants to protect investment in machinery , wood and blades . It is for woodworkers who care about precision but do n't have the luxury of twenty-thousand dollar European saws.For these woodworkers , it is worth the cost MANY times over .	1
Not much to say on something so simple other than : Do not skip on this product . If you get the Forrest blade , get this . My blade is great , but sometimes would get a little vibration thing going . This helped settle things down greatly .	1
I ca n't complain about this dampener too much , except to say that it will diminish the depth of your cut ... you wo n't be able to raise your blade as high as before ( it 'll hit your throat plate ) . That 's the only complaint.Now ... on the positive side ... well , gee ... if you 're using a Forrest blade and you have n't warped it or something , the blade 's cutting wood like hot butter anyway ... So why use this ? I 've noticed no perceptible difference when the dampener is attached , yet still ... I leave it on . I guess it gives me a little more security knowing that my blade is more rigid than without it . But does it improve the quality of the cut ? Not as far as I can tell , and I cut a lot of hard , white oak.Still , if it protects your blade at all , it 's worth having ... if nothing else , for the extra peace of mind .	1
standard stiffener , less vibration but with the quality of the new saws and blades I dont know how neccesary a stiffener is anymore . Dont forget you loose some blade height with this on ... This is a good idea for a underpowered saw with thin kerf blades .	1
This is a great product , especially for the thin kerf saw blades . The cuts are super smooth . However , it does limit the depth of cut and it must be removed to use the entire available depth of the saw blade for deeper cuts .	1
I 've never used a blade stiffener in all the years of using other blade brands such as Freud . It 's recommended with the WWII blades , so I bought one last year.It boils down to this , a Woodworker II blade along with this stiffener makes the best cuts I ever done in my life . The blade is quieter , vibration free , smooth and slices through sheet goods like butter . I use this combo on my Bosch 4100 table saw and would n't change a thing.Currently building mudroom cabinetry and next office built-in shelves .	1
If you purchase a Forrest blade , you are already voting with your dollars to have the best tool experience out there . Adding this blade dampener/stiffener just guarantees that you will do the most to be sure of having the highest quality tool . Whatever this costs is worth it to know that you are enhancing your blade for the best performance possible . I do n't do that many deep cuts , so have yet to moan about limited depth - has n't been a concern yet.If you 've ponied up for a Forrest blade , you 're in an exclusive 'Best Tool ' club , so do n't even hesitate . I put this one my new saw with the new Forrest blade . My first cut was as good as it gets , and that 's the way I like to work.I am a beekeeper who tweaks my equipment to precision levels so that I can do multiple things with each box . This dampener makes my Forrest blade work at the highest levels of performance , so then everything is based on my own knowledge and skill to get things precise and 'on the money ' - I would buy this again with no hesitation , and would recommend it to anyone who cares about using good tools - it simply provides you with a 'no compromise ' working environment . With a saw , you can do great damage to yourself if you are not working at the highest levels of perfection.Treat yourself to a companion for your Forrest blade . Own it , and feel proud each time you use your saw !	1
I have been using Freud thin kerf blades on my chopsaw the last 6 years , but wanted to see what all the rave was about on these handmade American blades . You cant believe the quality that goes into these once you see them in person . This cuts like a dream !	1
I have come to discover that the quality of the blade is every bit as important as the quality of the saw . This blade is giving me glass smooth cuts with no tear-out . Before getting this blade I used my miter saw strictly for cutting rough lumber . Now I am happy to cut even very expensive wood -- it is a joy to use with woods like padouk and mahogany . The one possible down side is that with all those teeth it does cut a bit slower than my old blade . I ca n't just slap a 2X4 down and drop the blade through it , but that 's a small price to pay for the cut quality .	1
Oak , Hard Maple , Walnut , Mohogany . None can stand up to this blade . Well , those are the only ones I have tried , besides pine . No tearout on the backside , clean cuts . Best blade I have used yet .	1
I have it on my Bosch 10 & quot ; Sliding Miter . The best saw deserves the best blade . Cuts quickly , cleanly and smootly . I thought & quot ; glass like finish & quot ; was just a marketing gimick . It is the truth . Buy one and you will never go back .	1
I have used many blades over the years yet i am still impressed every time I make a cut with this blade . I live by the rule : `` you get what you pay for . '' You certainly get the best here .	1
My old Chopmaster blade was worn and I needed to send it in for sharpening but I had nothing to replace it while it was out . I use the miter saw all the time . So I bought a second Chopmaster . I forgot what an amazing blade this is ! ( and I did n't realize how dull the old one was ! ) I 've put this up against 8/4 African mahogany , 5/4 Jatoba , 5/4 hard maple and 6/4 red oak and it cut through all like butter leaving a satin smooth finish on the ends . I will never consider another blade for my miter saw !	1
This blade IS expensive . However , my old Makita is cutting virtually glass-smooth and clean with it ; I do n't think this blade can be beat ! !	1
Again , Forrest blades are not cheap but they are WORTH what you pay fort hem . This cuts better , faster and cleaner than my 80ATB Freud or Oldham ever did . The steel and carbide is quality and lasts well . I have to send it in for sharpening ( after two years in my compound slider shop unit ) but do n't want to take it off .	1
I love it , I like it , This blade stays sharp & I wo n't some more of them .	1
A little & quot ; pricey & quot ; but well worth it ! No other saw blade on the market can compete with Forrest . It blows Freud away . Quiet , no vibration , flat & amp ; true and your cuts look like they were sanded with 200 grit sandpaper . And that 's just the product . Before buying this blade I had questions about the kerf width so I called Forrest . It was after hours I did n't expect an answer , but Mr. Forrest himself answered the phone . I was blown away that he answers his own phone ; try to get the president of Freud on the phone . He and I spoke for a good 15-20 minutes . Mr. Forrest personally told me if for any reason I did n't like HIS blade he would buy it back from me no questions asked . He also told me in all his years in business he has never had to buy back a blade . It say 's a lot when someone stands behind their product like that . Simply the best ... Bar none !	1
Really cuts great . I installed it on my Porter Cable Sliding compound miter saw and it performs just great . No need to sand after a cut is made with this baby ...	1
I 've been disappointed with the quality and accuracy of my DeWalt 12 '' C-S Miter Saw and blade . So I decided to replace the blade with this heavy duty Forrest Chopmaster . I have to say I am impressed with how smooth and accurate my saw cuts now , no sanding is needed on these miter cuts . I 've compared the fresh cut to a board off my Jointer and find there is virtually no difference .	1
I 've had my Makita miter saw for several years and just started using the Chopmaster -- what a difference ! It cuts like butter -- much better than the DeWalt blade I was using .	1
I have been using the Chopmaster for several years now and consider it to be the finest miter saw blade I 've encountered . My second favorite is the Tenryu Miter Pro Plus which is almost as good as the Forrest . The Freud , Dewalt , and various other brands I 've tried are fine for paint grade trim and framing , but when it comes to any stain grade work , I turn to the Forrest as my blade of choice . The reason why is that it cuts extremely smooth , is quite rigid ( less deflection creates more accurate miters ) , and I 've found that when cutting small returns it has the least tendency to catch and throw the small return piece . Minimizing flying return pieces saves me time , reduces waste , and is safer .	1
I have been using Forrest blades for over 35 years and have always had nothing but the best service from the blades and the company . Last year I replaced one of my old 12 '' Freud 96 tooth black coated chop saw blades with the 12 '' Forrest Chopmaster blade . Could not sharpen it any more . Before I baught the Chopmaster , I tried the new red coated Freud blade and it is not as good as the old black coated Freud blade . Do n't no why , just not as smooth or as clean as the old black blade ? The Chopmaster cuts as clean or cleaner than the old Freud blade with a lot less effort . The only problem is that the Chopmaster will tear out when the blade exits the back edge of red oak . The bottom is chip free , and the cut is polished , just chips the back edge . It will not tear out on maple , cherry , white pine or any other wood that I use . Never had this problem with the old Freud blade . I guess I 'm just picky ! Except for this one little thing , I love this blade and I hate not giving a Forrest blade a 5 rating .	1
I 've used the Forrest Woodworker II on my tablesaw and think that blade is great . Then I tried the Chopmaster . Wow . This blade surpassed all of my expectations and the WWII set those expectations pretty darn high . This blade is expensive but if you want gorgeous , spectacular crosscuts , this is the blade to own .	1
I 've been using a Forrest blade in my cabinet saw for years , and have made so much furniture and cabinets after 12 years , that it still runs with a smooth finish after all that time . It maybe time to send it in to be resharpened finally , but it probably still has several more projects in it before that is due.So when I finally after years of wanting a chopsaw , and finally having the need for doing a house renewal projects ( flooring , moulding , but will also use as a general furniture in future ) , I knew the perfect blade to get , as these blades make any saw better , and was pleased to see that they still have the same great quality after all these years . Smooth as glass , handled hard or soft material with the same glass finish and ease of cut , and never a burn . The blade is so sharp , I got ta believe that it will be easier on the machine in the long run . At the rate of expected usage for this saw , which will be quite a bit more , it really is the only blade that will ever be on there for the rest of my life , they really are that good .	1
I was doing some repair work on some walls in the house . I needed to buy a quality saw blade for my miter saw . I bought the Forrest ChopMaster based on the outstanding professional and user reviews on the internet . I have not been disappointed , all cuts were precise , clean , smooth , and accurate .	1
in a word : AWESOME ! this blade cuts thru wood as if it is slicing thru air . no vibration , no noise or whining , just smooth as butter performance . Its expensive and i was hesitant as well as comparing it to the slightly cheaper freud blade , but i have no regrets at all , only awe , and would buy again and again .	1
I never thought I 'd spend this much on a saw blade , but I did and boy am I happy with my purchase . This blade is AMAZING ! I 've cut oak , as well as MDF molding , so far and the cuts have all been perfect . I did not have to sand even one board after cutting . Always a perfectly smooth cut . Unbelievable .	1
This one cuts great and stays sharp longer than the other blades I 've used . But it is spend'y . Smooth , nearly no splitter , cuts with a polished edge that needs little to no sanding . I ca n't compare it to a Ridge Carbide and Tenryu blades yet , but it has equal or better cut than the Freud sliding miter saw blade , and it holds its edge longer . I 'll compare it with the RC and Tenryu blades when I get them and update .	1
After a decade of buying the best the box stores had to offer I got sick of it and decided to replace everything with Forrest blades . Although it cost me an arm and a leg , it was worth it . The sheer weight of this blade as compared to what the well-known manufacturers offer is when you first notice the difference , and then you make your first hot-knife-through-butter perfectly clean cut through a piece of 8/4 oak and your investment somehow seems worth it .	1
WOW ! ! ! ! Great Forestt Chopmaster 12x80 blade . As all the other reviewers testify this is one fantastic blade that cuts wood like a laser . Perfect balance and no deflection when bevel cutting on the miter saw even with a 12 inch blade at full slide extension . Seems like the harder you have to push the saw through the 12+ inch wood on a sharp bevel the more some blade deflection can occur . No problem with this blade as it slides with ease though the material with resulting accurate bevel and miter angles.I would have purchased this blade here from Amazon.com as I do 95 % of the time but Amazon was out of stock on this item and Rockler was supplying this blade at $ 14 higher than Amazon when they had them in stock . As I really needed the blade so had to order from Slivers Mill . for $ 14 less .	1
Clean cuts every time . The blade barely notices the wood as it passes through it . It was well packaged , amazingly sharp , and straight and balanced . I put it on a DeWalt DW716 and it took an already great saw and made it even better .	1
Having finished framing a room , I wanted a better quality of cut for the trim . I replaced the 60 tooth Bosch OEM blade that came on my 12 sliding compound miter saw with the 80-tooth Forrest Chopmaster . The cuts are glass-smooth , with no tearout . You can see and feel the difference between the Forrest blade 's results and the cuts with the OEM saw , even though Bosch supplies a pretty good blade for framing . The Chopmaster was expensive enough to make me think twice about this vs. a Freud blade , but all the reviews have been very positive . Now I can see why .	1
I have a ton of mileage on mine , almost literally . I 've had mine in my miter saw for years now and it just finished 600 feet of hickory crosscuts when we installed our flooring upstairs and this blade still cuts quick , clean , and leaves a cut so smooth is almost looks polished . I LOVE this blade . Worth every penny .	1
This blade has an extremely smooth cut . It cuts through 140 year old antique oak like butter with minimal tear out . Cuts all wood I 've tried great also . Forest blades are really expensive compared to other blades but you do n't have to sharpen them as much so it saves time and money in the long run . I highly recommend .	1
Forest makes a fantastic saw Blade . They are a little pricey but well worth the money . Anymore when I buy a saw product , I order a Forrest to switch out the supplied blade immediately . I ca n't believe I worked so long without a Forrest Blade . You cant go wrong with this blade .	1
When I first used this blade I expected perfection and was not disappointed . I also have a Forest Woodworker II , and it too is as good as it gets . As the old woodworking axiom states ; always buy the best tool you can afford . I have worked my way up the ladder of being able to afford better and usually more expensive tools to the point where I can now buy the best . That 's not to say that there are not several other very good blades out there , there are . But Forest is in a whole different zip code .	1
I made a cut into a maple crown molding and the only thing I can say is WOW . I have gotten used to the saw blade at the local home store that has some tear-out on the back side . This is the best saw blade I have used to date . This cut is so clean it feels like glass and no tear-out not even a mark on the bottom of the cut . If you are pondering about spending the money on a blade like this . DO IT , you will not regret it . I will not waste money on other blades at other stores .	1
I have owned Forrest blades since 2001 and they are one of the best investments I have ever made . Cuts are so smooth that there is no need for sanding for a glue up . Keep your box as you can use it to mail it back to Forrest to be resharpened.I have used many other blades over the years and many are very good as well however , the consistent high quality that I receive from this company and being made in the USA is hard to beat . In the past they have even taken the time to call me when resharpening my blade to ask questions.I ca n't recommend this enough , I have never been disappointed .	1
until a light saber becomes available , this will have to do . glass smooth cuts in hard maple and oak . Amazon made me type some more words , how rude .	1
I 've been using this blade quite a bit over the past few weeks and I 'm a bit on the fence about it.Mind you , I 'm a new hobbyist , so this is just my opinion from my own experience , comparing it to the Makita blade that came with my slider.Firstly , for some reason I feel like I 'm using a specialty blade for everyday use and that does n't sit well with me . Every time I use it I feel like I 'm dulling it and should be saving it for special occasions . When I use my rip blade on the table saw it feels more appropriate than using the ATB general blade ... unless I 'm doing finer cuts . Maybe I 'm being silly ? I 've noticed a fine tearing on the top of every cut with this blade , which surprises me . I 've experimented with a narrow scoring cut , followed by the final cut , thinking it was from the blade coming up through the piece and cutting on the up stroke . I really do n't remember seeing this with my Makita blade . The cut surface is very smooth , no doubt . Cutting 3 '' maple left a surface that requires no sanding.It does take noticeably longer to cut with this blade.Overall I do like the blade , but it might take me a few more years of experience to become more versed in the differences and suggested uses . i just assumed that buying a really expensive blade would leave no doubt . I do n't know if this review will help you , but I guess if I 'm not blown away you may not be either . Just my opinion.EDIT : I happened to notice in a Forrest ad yesterday a phrase bragging about the lack of splintering on the bottom side . Got me thinking . Remember how I said I 'm still green ? Well , I tried it this morning and noticed that the bottom side is indeed super clean . The splintering does happen ( as suspected ) as the blade is exiting the wood from the top . So now I have to assume that it 's just common sense to cut with the face side down . I was n't aware of that and will try that from now on .	1
Forrest CM12806115 Chopmaster 12-Inch 80-tooth ATB Miter Saw Blade with 1-Inch ArborWith so many reviews of this product already , I 'll just offer my observations on this blade versus a thin kerf 12 '' blade . I 've been a woodworker for over 50 years ( yikes ! ) , have another Chopmaster on my table saw , and have used Hitachi , DeWalt , Ridgid , and Freud blades ... My 12 '' Ridgid sliding compound miter saw came with a thin kerf carbide blade that oscillated while spinning . You could actually see it wander from left to right in slow motion . The Ridgid blade was only .075 thick versus the Chopmaster 's stiff .125 '' . Installing 3.5 '' blade stabilizes on the Ridgid blade helped a little . However , even with the large stabilizer , that thin kerf Ridgid blade could n't shave anything less than 1/8 '' off a piece of wood - as the blade would `` bend '' away from the cut , causing a non-square end . I threw that blade out and replaced it with this 12 '' Chopmaster . I use thin kerf blades on two of my 7 '' circular saws , but would recommend avoiding any 12 '' thin kerf blade - because they flex too easily for decent cuts.I recently finished making some base cabinets using this 12 '' Chopmaster . The cuts were perfect as it was now possible to shave the tiniest amount ( e.g. , 1/100 '' ) from the end grain of face framing maple , with the resulting pieces perfectly square in all directions . The Chopmaster is so stiff , it does n't oscillate or `` bend '' . Using this high quality blade resulted in perfect face frames.Even though the Ridgid saw is capable of perfect cuts , it only performs well when paired with a great blade .	1
Sometimes you do n't get the performance you expect when paying top dollar , but in this case you do . It cuts extremely smooth with no tear out . Worth every penny .	1
Have you ever cut a dado and the parts fit perfectly , just clicking them together ? You will every time with this set . You should make a test cut each time you change stock just to be sure , but this set is easy to setup . There is a chart that comes with it telling the mix of blades and chippers for each common thickness ( I put mine in a sheet protecter to help me find it ) . If it is off just a little , slip in one or more of the supplied plastic shims to acheive perfection ! I have a cheap caliper that I check plywood with and that gets me pretty close on the first try.I was cutting a bunch of dados last night in 3/4 & quot ; birch plywood and there was absolutely no splintering or tearout . I was using a shop made plywood insert in my Jet table saw that was probably 3/64 & quot ; below the cast iron table . In other words , it was a not-quite-zero-clearance insert and still no problems.I have a couple of old wobble blades and a Wards set that between them ca n't hold a trott-line , so I do n't know what I 'll use them for now . The Forrest Dado King is the only one I 'll ever use again !	1
Not a dado expert , but.. I think I know enough to know this is a great dado set..Storage case to protect.. Somewhat cumbersome to load into the case if you have to do that a lot ( but I dont know what to compare this to ) .. Probably the weakest point about this dado ( you have to spread the teeth ( I believe you do ) as you load it into the case to protect all the teeth..The chippers add up to make all dado thickness ' 1/16 inch apart.. From 1/4 to 29/32 ( plus plastic shims to tweak even this ) .. To use the thicker capability though , your saw arbor would need to be long enough..I was disappointed to learn I could not use my 12 '' mitre saw ( my most accurate saw ) for my dado operations ( I could but the capability would be severely limited in depth , etc ) .. Too bad they didnt trick out the mitre saw a little more so I could have used the cast aluminum accuracy and 12 '' blade for ripping..I cant comment on the little wings some people complained about ( not doing fine woodwork , or my equipment is not good enough to show this.The documentation was minimal , but very very good.. And ( from reading the doc ) I got the impression I could call the Forrest company , and get a human who could explain anything about saw blades to me ... if I had to call them ( unlike a lot of manufactures where its made in china or taiwan ( and the instructions were translated from some other language too ) and so then you can find anyone who knows anything about anything when you call ) ..	1
Forrest makes a clean sweep in the awards ceremonies . Their Woodworker II took top honors in Fine Woodworking Magazines run off of blades . Close behind was the Freud at a quarter of the cost . Excellent for both blades on smoothness of cut , but the Forrest earned an excellent on tearout , whereas the Freud earned a very good . Well I bought both , and found the Freud to cut a surface so smooth that it was glass like . If I was going to put a finish on it , I would rough it up with 200 grit to improve the adhesion , it was that smooth . Also the Freud had absolutely no tear out , not even a little bit . Perfect is the word here . So why did I buy the Forrest Woodworker II also ? Because everybody was raving about it . Forrest makes great products.On the Dado set , I noticed the reviewers stating that their was a tiny ridge at the bottom of the dado cut , created with the Forrest . The Freud has similar results . Oddly enough the Freud creates a perfect edge when making finger joints and the like , even though when you look down into the pocket , their are miniscule ridges in the cut . Comments that the end result on the Forrest have me concerned , stating that the edge is not perfect . Is this an example of more expensive must be better syndrome ? I bought the Freud Super Dado set based on my earlier experience with their standard saw blade vs the Forrest . I 'm glad I did . No matter what you buy , a good old fashioned sacrificial piece of scrap sandwiched to your work piece is your best guarantee against tear out when working with expensive woods.If you look at the Amazon sales rank , the Freud outsells the Forrest 4 to 1 . Of course anything that is less money , sells more quantity , but I just ca n't get beyond the `` perfect '' performance of the Freud . How do you improve on that ? This is not a dig on Forrest . They make first class products . Just something to consider . I hope this was helpful .	1
This is typical Forrest quality , but this Dado-King set does not cut a flat-bottomed Dado . At each edge , there is a slight & quot ; ear , & quot ; which is deeper than the rest of the bottom . This is where the teeth of the outside blades cut the edge . That 's the negative side of this blade.On the other hand , it cuts with very little tearout , even on plywood , and is very easy to set up . It also comes with very good instructions that take the guesswork out of how many chippers to add to get the desired width.Overall , a great set ... but with a slightly different grind on the outside blades , you could have a flat-bottomed dado , and that would make this a 5-star set .	1
I am using this dado set on a & # 34 ; Saw Stop & # 34 ; 3 HP cabinet saw . The set was easy to set up . I first made a saw table insert from baltic birch plywood . It made a great insert for this blade set . Then changed the blade break and removed the riving knife . Finally I used blades and all chippers to produce several 1/4 inch tenons in solid cherry . The blade set ran straight and true . No vibration , no burn , and very little & # 34 ; cleaning & # 34 ; ( sanding and chisel work ) on the tenons . I have used a Freud set . It was OK , but left a lot of work on the bottom of the dados.Do n't get me wrong , i 'll use a router and jig for many dado operations . It is hard to beat the easy set up and perfectly smooth dado bottom . However , there are situations where a dado set is ideal ( long dados , tenons , unusual width dados , etc. ) . This makes the additional set up worth it.I also like the plastic holder . Someone had written a review complaining about it . It holds the blades securely , and separate from the chippers . The holder has a handle , and provides for storing the case either vertical or horizontal . I do n't find it to be flimsy . This was the problem with the case design and inserts on the Freud set I used.Finally , this set is not cheap . That may be a problem for a home woodworker . If you ca n't afford it , the Freud set would be a good alternative . If you want a set you will probably never have to replace , from a company who will resharpen it to a like new finish and balance , this is a great tool .	1
I went from a Craftsman wobble blade to this so I wo n't even do a comparison because there is n't any . I 've owned this blade for many years and each time I use it I 'm glad I bought it . The cuts are almost perfectly flat . There are small overcuts on the outside but they are barely noticeable . Once you glue it up with clamps they disappear.It comes with a chart to help you set the proper width but it 's not perfectly accurate . I used it the other day to cut a dado for 3/4 '' plywood , which is less than 3/4 '' in thickness . I used the chart for 3/4 '' and it was a fraction too small . So you have to actually measure before you stack the blades on the arbor . But once you get the width set properly , you 'll be rewarded with very flat bottom cuts and splinter free edges .	1
I own 4 ( now 5 ) Forrest blades . There are NONE finer . High quality , American made . I will never buy another Freud blade or Home Depot/Lowe 's special unless I 'm cutting wet lumber or suspect wood ( with old nails in it ) . Forrest cuts finer , smoother bottoms , and cooler . What 's more , there 's actually enough carbide on the teeth to have them sharpened . These are not disposable blades by any measure . They will turn your $ 200 contractor saw into a true woodworking machine .	1
I 'm a little past being a novice ( not much ) woodworker but still learning . This is my first set of dado blades and the first time I used them it went smooth as it could have . I cut tenons for a mortise joint using oak from a house built in the 1800 's . Needless to say the oak splinters very easy . No tear out what so ever . Smoothest cut I could have imagined . The only other cuts I 've seen that smooth were from a forest ll blade . The blades were easy to figure out . They store on a cheesy plastic holder but as for the blades I ca n't imagine any better . Highly recommend .	1
This item works great for the purpose I had intended it to . It is large enough to collect dust from most of my wood working equipment .	1
Collects a lot of saw dust ! I mounted this on the back of my enclosed router table . this collects a lot of saw dust when the the router is running .	1
The unit seems to be well made and after buying over a hundred dollars in fittings , I had to use duct tape to make it work with myKobalt shop vac . Disappointed to find that none of the vacuum systems have the same fittings .	1
I 've had this for a number of years now . Works quite well AFTER I made some adjustments so it could 'slide ' behind the saw 's exhaust port . But it does a very good job with my 1.5hp Delta dust collector . I wanted something compact to catch the debris . I have it so that no matter what angle the saw is cutting , the Big Gulp will slide right behind the blade and then the dust collector pulls it all away . Very satisfied	1
I USE THIS HOOD IN MY SHOP AT A STATION DEDICATED FOR MISC PORTABLE TOOLS . IT WORKS VERY WELL AND IS CONVENIENT.MOUNTED TO A FLEX-HOSE , I CAN MOVE IT UP AND OUT OF THE WAY WHEN I 'M FINISHED WITH TOOL I 'VE SELECTED.Jet JW1032 4-Inch x 20-Foot Black Dust Collection Hose .	1
I needed to build a dust collection jig for my miter saw . If you have ever tried to collect dust from a miter saw , it is difficult to do well , and you ca n't expect to get it all , however , as part of my jig this helps me collect the majority of the sawdust and fine dust . The plastic is thick and sturdy . I drilled two holes on the bottom to mount this on t-track behind the saw ( to allow me to move it side to side when I make angle cuts ) , and it does about well or better than any other system I have seen . There is n't much to say , other than the quality appears good , it is very big and it fit a specific need for me .	1
I have had used shop vacs for many years for cleaning my shop and job sites . It has always been a hassle due to the hose . It was too short , stiff , and came unhooked . I spent more time dealing with it than doing actual cleaning . NOT ANY MORE ! The Mr Nozzle hose and tool kit has taken care of all of that . The hose is twice as long , very flexable and the couplings `` thread '' on to the hose so no more falling off . Great solution to a frustating problem . As for other reviews stating problems with the size of the couplings I did not experience that . All of the attachments I have worked well with the new hose .	1
I bought one of these for my personal shop vacuum over a decade ago and love it.We bought this one to go on a shop vacuum at work , and I expect the same gtood results with it .	1
I have had my ShopVac for over five years now and I always found it a hassle when vacuuming out my car . I would have to roll it to one side and then pull it all the way around to get to the other side . Occasionally this would be impractical because my wife 's vehicle would be in the garage at the same time and there would be no room . With this new nozzle , the vacuum can remain in one central position in the garage and easily reach both sides of the car , both front and back seats as well . The extra long hose really makes a difference . I have also noticed that this nozzle produces a much more powerful suction than the one that came with the ShopVac . Even with a dirty filter the suction was strong . The only problem I had when I first got it was some difficulty getting the nozzle mounted onto the hose . It was so tight I thought that it might have been the wrong size . After awhile it finally slid on fully and I have no intention of ever taking it off . I highly recommend this product .	1
Now this is a shop vacuum hose ! Well made , durable , effective . The long reach is super ; saves always dragging the vacuum unit , just for an extra foot of reach . Note : The claw attachment works great , and it fits just fine . ( I think I read someone complain about it not fitting . ) This attachment , on first try , feels like it wo n't fit -- but it does . It 's a snug fit , that 's all . This hose replaced a heavily used , taped up with duct tap , falling apart hose on my old Craftsman vac . When my neighbor saw the new hose , she said , & # 34 ; Oh , you got a new vac ? & # 34 ; Actually , I bought the vac in 1976 ! It 's been hiding in the corner , looking like junk , neglected for years . This new hose resurrected it !	1
After using this vehicle tool to remove the fur from the car after my dog 's shedding season , I decided to try it at the source of the problem - the shedder . It turned out she was also looking for a good way to remove that extra fur and cooperated entirely , rotating to all the parts that were shedding . Ten minutes later both dog and owner were happy with the results . When asked to comment , the dog rated it more effective than rubbing on the auto upholstry , which has been her preferred method of hair removal until the Mr. Nozzle .	1
Works really well and is very flexible . Seems to be very well made and should be durable . Does n't clog with saw dust .	1
As a general review , this is exactly as described . Very rigid , does n't kink . It seems expensive ( took me a while to decide to buy ) After 5 seconds of use ... you 'll smile that `` oh good , it 's worth the money , '' smile . I think the vac performance is improved ( more CFMs ) The smooth interior and rigidity of this hose keep air moving with less line friction.I have a Fein vac and have struggled with accessories . I love the vac , but like most things Fein , the tool is a dream , but the accessories seem overpriced . I have purchased several different fittings and kits trying to avoid buying the rather expensive Fein accessories . This fits a Fein perfectly out of the box . Plug and Play . While expensive , it 's much less than the Fein accessories it is replacing .	1
I have this hooked to a Sears Shop Wet/Dry Vacuum . As others have noted , the attachment size is a little `` non-standard '' , probably due to the fact that the hose fits over the tools instead of sliding in them . Nonetheless , the hose and swivel are easy to use and the material makes for very efficient pickup . I also like the claw and crevice nozzle . They are a bit small for small spaces in my small car , but they are great for going over floors , seats , and jobsite pickup . Definitely recommended over the stock hose that comes with most shop & wet/dry vacs .	1
I was increasingly frustrated by the kinks that would form in the original vacuum hose of my rigid 5 gallon shop vac . I put up with the original hose for about 5 years , then bought this . I find it especially useful when vacuuming up high , since that is what would most often kink the original vacuum hose . No kinks with this , and the long length makes cleanup even easier . If you use your vac frequently , this is a very nice upgrade .	1
Very good hose overall . We use it most commonly with an older Sears large wet/dry shop vac . It is a far more practical hose than those provided with most vacuums ; it has a far better combination of flexibility , length and resistance to crush ( including under vacuum load ) than the other OEM or replacement hoses available from Sears and several other manufactures . Be aware though that it has a smaller hose diameter than typical 2-1/2 vac hoses and that it does not come with an adapter to directly fit the female intake ports on 2-1/2 & quot ; hose vacuums . You will probably need at least a male to male adapter .	1
This was just what I expected and pleasnatly surprised ! It is a flexible , long , American made kit comprised of a floor nozzle and a crevice tool in orange color.This smaller diameter hose makes it so that you can reach long distances without pulling the vacuum into the side of your paint job . This is a perfect accesory for your shop vac .	1
I do n't know why Shop-Vacs do n't come with a hose like this in the first place . Longer hose , flexible and tough . Tired of wrestling with those short plastic hoses ? Tired of dragging the vacuum all over the place ? Mr. Nozzle is the answer . Fit my 10 gallon Shop-vac QSP Pro like a glove . And the included attachments may be all you ever need . I plan to purchase more Mr. Nozzle soon !	1
Nice Long hose , inside is smooth so nothing ever gets caught , if it goes in one end it will make it to the other and get stuck in the can against the shield	1
This is a MUCH better vacuum than my Craftsman 6.25 `` Hp '' vacuum . They seem to have about the same amount of suction through a two inch hose . The Fein is MUCH quieter . Using a Radio Shack sound meter , I measured 64 dB from the Fein and a whopping 95 dB from the Craftsman ( both at about 5 feet ) . It is easy to hold a normal conversation when the Fein is running . You definately need hearing protection when the Sears is on . Although the Fein supplied hose is very nice , the small bore greatly reduces the vacuum . I just stuck a 2 '' hose into the Fein inlet which works fine . Dumping the Fein cannister is also no problem . I 'm not sure why the person in an earlier review thought that was difficult .	1
Great power . Long , flexible hose . Good mobility . Much less ear-splitting than my old Ridgid , but certaily not `` whisper quiet . '' This machine just oozes quality from the thickness of the plastic to the fit and finish . I 'm going to enjoy this for a long time ! ******** The more I use this the more I like it . The hose is very long and quite flexible . Snaps in and out of the machine easily . Very easy to empty . Get it and you wo n't regret it .	1
The one tool in my garage shop that I dreaded turning on was my shop vac . I have a larger dust collector for my table saw and planer . But , for fine dust and chip removal from hand held sanders and routers and for general shop cleanup , I like to use a shop vac.After considerable individual research which included many complementary user-reviews , I purchased this vac as a replacement to my existing vac . The Turbo II is much quieter than my other vac . It still make noise , do n't get me wrong . But it is several dB 's lower and does n't have the obnoxious , high-pithed whine . The filtration bag that comes with it really does a superb job . Unless you have a serious medical reason for doing so , I would recommend at least trying the vac with the filter that comes with it , before upgrading.I would however , strongly recommend considering the WET/DRY Clean-up Kit . ( Fein does n't package their vac 's with the assorted attachments that most of their competitors do ) This kit is good quality and worth the investment.Besides the very tolerable noise level , I really like built-in electrical recepticle that starts or stops the vacuum automatically when the power tool is switched on or off . When you turn the power tool off , the vacuum will continue to run for about 4 seconds to continue cleaning the line , then the vac turns off.For my application , this provides all the vacuum suction necessary . Since I 've been using the Turbo II , the garage shop is much cleaner , the house stays cleaner and I 'm not in touble nearly as much . My only regret is that I did n't buy it two years ago .	1
This thing is indestructible . Holds more than it looks to hold . Hose is crunch proof . Very little dust escapes from system . The dust that I do see is probably on the outside of the vac or hose . My old vac would kick out a cloud of crap everytime I turned it on . The auto start feature is nice .	1
As a woodworker , I am constantly searching for ways to reduce dust in the workshop . Besides being messy , woodshop dust is dangerous for your health . Since I have a small shop , I can not set up an elaborate dust-collection system , so I looked at vacuum-style collectors . After much research I decided to go with the Fein , and I 'm very happy about my decision . My shop is now dust-free , which means it is neater and healthier.This vacuum has a sleek design , and carts around the shop smoothly on its wheels . There is a nice-size handle across the top that provides a firm grip when you need to carry the machine , and the machine is not too heavy to move around in this manner . The power switch is sealed , so dust can not clog it up -- a good idea . The machine provides an easy-access 120V outlet to plug a power tool into . This outlet is a terrific feature . Just plug your sander ( or other power tool ) into the vacuum and it goes on while you 're sanding . When you turn the sander off , there is a three-second delay , to collect any remaining dust , and then the vacuum switches off automatically . You can turn off the auto feature for those times when you want to use the system as a typical vacuum . The top of the vacuum comes off very easily with a system of latches , and the dust collects in a tank inside the machine that 's easy to clean.One of the most noticeable features of this vacuum is the noise level . This machine is so quiet that at first you might think something is wrong with it . I 'm used to Shop Vacs , which I have used for years , but I always have to wear ear protection when I run a Shop Vac . With the Fein , there is no need to do this . The noise level of this machine is about equal to a person laughing.Sanding is the task that produces the most dust in the shop , and this machine really shines when used in tandem with a sander . To realize the full effect of this great little machine , you should get a dust-free sander , such as the Fein MSF636-1 or the Festool . The way this machine works with a dust-free sander , it should be called a dust collector and not just a vacuum . I have the Fein MSF636-1 sander , and I get close to 100 % dust-free sanding . I have a bright shop light hanging over my sanding table , and when I 'm done sanding I ca n't see any dust floating around in there . This is an amazing improvement to my working conditions , since I no longer have dust building up on every surface in the shop , including my hair and eyes . With my old sanders , I could never get anywhere close to dust-free conditions . Since the system is portable , you can use it on a project anywhere in your house where you need to sand without dust ( this is an option you would not have with a typical dust-collection system ) .On the downside , I will say that the instructions are a sore point . I understand that this is a pretty simple machine , so I do n't expect a thick manual . However , Fein should at least tell you what part connects to what . There are a few parts included with this vacuum that do n't have obvious uses , and you have to look at them a few times to figure out how to connect them to the machine.Using this vacuum has totally changed my attitude toward sanding . I no longer dread the task , now that I know I wo n't have to deal with dust .	1
I used to have one of those metal wet/dry vacs . It was so loud that I would only use it as a last resort . ( preferring a broom ) It did n't have great suction and fell over whenever you pulled on the little 8 foot hose , because it was top heavy and the wheels were cheap.Then the Fein came into my life . It is relatively quiet , stable , has a nice flexible long fairly soft hose that does n't mind being stepped on ( it just pops back into shape ) . I bought the attachments and they are great too- especially the floor cleaning kit which you can use on bare floors or carpet , which is designed to lay down by flexing at different places so you can get under things easily . My wife uses it in the house and likes it so much I am thinking about buying the mini Fein to keep there . It works great on louvered doors , ceiling fans , hardwood floors , miniblinds , carpet , you name it . The automatic tool switch is a nice feature , if you have it attached to a tool it will come on automatically when you turn on the tool.I can not rate this product high enough , it should be six stars .	1
I have utilized many shop vacs and home vacs over the years , just like most people , I 'm sure . And I have come to the conclusion that buying a home vacuum is foolish when a shop vac will work much better and is more versatile . I bought this vacuum in conjunction with a Fein Multimaster but I also use it to vacuum my home . It is very quite with none of the typical high-pitched whining we 've all come to love about shop vacs . This vac has very strong suction and , for home use , works better than a dedicated $ 600 vacuum I once owned . For the shop , in dry work I use the HEPA filter with great results . Yes , the attachments cost extra but they work well . If I had a complaint it would be that the european version can be registered for the 3 year warranty but not the U.S. version .	1
I bought the Fein to replace an old Craftsman shop-vac that was as loud as the deck of an aircraft carrier . Instant improvement , with the first discovery being that you will actually use a vac all the time if it 's not too loud ! The Fein has several endearing features : it 's light , it 's quiet , it 's relatively hard to tip over , it has a long cord , and the cord stores on the body ( by wrapping it around the top groove ) . I do n't understand some reviewers ' comments on the strength of the suction . These vacs do not have anything close to the level of suction developed by the cheaper and louder vacs . In fact , if they did , they would be a lot harder to use attached to tools like sanders . There is plenty of suction for any reasonable use , though.I 've never bought the wet-vac parts for the Fein and never used the vac with a bag . I just dump out the contents into a trash bag . Moreover , I 've never replaced the filter and am careful when cleaning it - I do n't over-clean the filter , and I 'm careful not to damage it . A well-used filter with a reasonable amount of filter cake built up on it is very efficient , typically yielding much better filtration than the nominal micron rating listed . Among other things , I find I can use mine for drywall and for cleaning out my pellet stove without dust or soot escaping from the vac , though I 'd buy a purpose-built vac if those were my primary uses . ( Do n't try this with a new filter ! ) I agree with other reviewers ' comments on the hose and attachment parts . They are lightweight and should n't be abused.The bottom line on my review goes back to the starting comment . I found that quiet overwhelms every other consideration . Having a quiet vac turns it into something you use as you work instead of an end-of-day chore.Do n't be oversold on the hyped superiority of Festool vacs for their tools . While they are excellent vacs ( I own one in addition to a Fein Turbo II ) with tons of features , strictly from a vacuuming standpoint they do n't offer any better performance than the Fein - and that includes any supposed advantage of the Festool vac 's variable speed.The one use for which I prefer the Festool vac is for sanding . But that 's because I have a Festool vac with a HEPA filter , and I do not have the HEPA filter for my Fein . There is also one really good reason to prefer the Fein vac over Festool , and that 's the exorbitant cost of Festool bags ! Unlike sanding dust , chips from a tool like the Festool Domino will fill a bag in a hurry . Do yourself a favor and attach the Domino to your Fein instead ! The Fein stepped rubber adapter can be trimmed to fit any Festool power tool and will store nicely in the Systainer . It is as flexible as the end of the Festool hose , so will adapt to either the round or oval dust outlets on Festool tools . You can get the adapter from Amazon or from Woodcraft .	1
There is no compliment I can give that has n't already been said . The vac is awesome.I can however save you some $ $ $ .If you do n't feel like spending over $ 100 for the accessory kit , buy the Ridgid VT2575 Heavy Duty Cleaning Kit . It fits and that 's what I use on my Turbo II.You will have to take the original reducer off the hose supplied by Fein , and use the adapter supplied in the Ridgid kit.Also , if you 're in a pinch , you can retro the Gore or Ridgid shop vac filters to fit the Fein , you just need to get a little creative with the mounting screw , but if you have this vac , you 're most likely a handy/creative person .	1
I 've had this tool for about a year . I use it primarily to control dust from other tools . I 've hooked it up to sanders , routers , and a miter saw . It wo n't totally eliminate the dust , which is mostly the fault of the tool it 's attached to , but it does a great job of cutting down on the amount not captured . I 've used it for drywall ( with 5 & quot ; random orbit sander ) and think it caught over 80 % of the dust . I would say it 's even more efficient at controlling sawdust ( sanding ) .I really like the & quot ; tool operated & quot ; feature : just plug your power tool into the vac ; when you run the tool , the vac comes on automatically . The hose is very durable ; I 've stepped on it a couple times inadvertently with no damage ) . It 's also very flexible and easy to move around and store without kinking or binding . Rest of the tool is also high quality : easy to open/close canister , logical switches , convenient handle .	1
Allot of internal discussion went on inside before I a made this purchase . I was replacing a old craftsman . Frankly I could not bring myself to spend this much on a simple shop vac . I bought a cheeper unit - high sound levels - not much suction despite a 3 HP motor . You have got it . I sold the $ 139.00 vac for $ 70.00 and bought a Fien Turbo II.This vac is smaller but has much more power . The sound level is very low . The best feature is the auto on switch . When on the compound miter it removes 80 % of the dust . On the router about 60 % of the dust . The vac comes on with the tool in use and shuts down after the tool shuts off , it is a wonderful vac . It is a good addition to my dust control process . Well worth $ 219.00 ( or in my case $ 219 PLUS $ 60 lost on the vac I did not like ) . If you do not think a vac is worth $ 219 YOUR WRONG .	1
I purchased this shop vaccuum at a woodworking show last year and it has served me well in the time since . This tool is extremely powerful . I have used it on everything from wood shavings to drywall dust and it performs well no matter what . Besides great suction power , it is quiet , and has a built in automatic power-on feture for use with other power tools . The extra long cord and hose are nice features as well .	1
If you are doing any dust collection , particularly from stationary machines , you 've got to get one of these . It lets the large chips from planers , jointers , lathes , table saws and floor sweeps drop into a 30 gallon galvanized trash can ( that you supply ) . This is so much easier than endlessly dumping the bag on a dust collector.Another great reason to have one of these ; how many times have you accidentally sucked up an important piece of hardware and spent hours sifting through a dust bag trying to find it ? Metal parts will drop to the bottom of the barrel where they are easily found . This also saves the impeller blades of your dust collector from damaging impacts . I always empty it before sweeping the floor , just in case I encounter a stray chunk I want to recover.You should keep the barrel dumped fairly often , as this will increase efficency . The only thing better would be a cyclone system , but they are more costly and take up more space . This unit is also quite portable , which is handy in a one-hose shop.I do n't think you 'll be disappointed if you put one of these to work in your shop . You 'll wonder how you ever worked without it .	1
If your starting out or a seasoned fully equipped woodworker , this is one piece of equipment , that you will wonder how you ever did without . At first I was disappointed like so many others that their was n't even a tube mount on the head to hook up your hoses to . It is really nothing more than a stamped out piece of plastic that will accept your 4 '' hoses . After going through the duct tape , and band clamps , with less than stellar results , I came to the conclusion ( duh ) that the coiling action of a 4 '' hose is the right size to wind it into the opening . Thereby creating a screw the hose in , effect . I also used the 4 '' Jet wire clamps on the inside , just to make sure it would not gradually slip out . The fit is rather tight , and leaks very little air . No tape or anything else is neccessary . Makes for a clean professional looking fit . Wish they had put that in the instructions to begin with . It seems so obvious now , but who would know then ? The real benefit to this unit , is that it takes a nightmare problem , and makes it a piece of cake . It works great with a standard 4 '' dust collection system . Myself personally , I already had a 6HP Sears 16 gallon shop vac . To the shop vac which has a 2 1/2 '' hose , I hook up the Jet adapter bringing it up to 4 '' . I also use a Y adapter , and gates , to enable me to hook it up to two pieces of equipment at a time . I have a lot of equipment in a small shop , with everything mounted on universal bases . So I roll out what I need , hook it up to the dust collection . Cramped for space , my shop vac sits under my lathe table.The nightmare before getting the Woodstock unit , is that with a 16 gallon shop vac , and using the planer , it loads up with chips after one good size board . Then I have to remove the lid , and dump , and comb the filter and start over . Makes planing boards a hassle . With the Woodstock unit . I plane several boards , before it is even half full . My friends are amazed when I show them the half full Woodstock unit , and the shop vac has less than a cup , of material in it . The filter does collect the fine airborne powder.The ease of dumping the 32 gallon galvanized trash can ( not included but super cheap available locally ) ca n't be overstated . A quick flip , into a larger plastic trash can , lined with a large trash bag , and right back on the unit.Another thing worth mentioning , is that this Woodstock W1049 is so light , that it is a good idea to weigh the top down . I use a 10 pound lifting weight . It is round and fits neatly into the center , is easy to grab when unloading the chips , and more than adequately secures the top down to the can without lifting , or allowing any leaks.I tried lining the can with a trash bag , but it does not work . The vacuum brings the trash bag/liner up to the vac hole and clogs it . Without the trash bag , the smooth sides of the galvanized can allow the large chips to slide easily out and into the bag lined , larger can.This unit could be built with more sophisticated methods for securing it to the can , and outlet tubes for securing the pipe , but then the price of the unit would rise . I like it just the way it is . After using it , if for any reason you lost it , you would climb mountains to obtain another one . Ca n't live without it , it is just that beneficial .	1
I thought the dust collection system was the best thing a ever got , but after adding this to the system , the Woodstock Dust Collection Separator is the best thing I got . The bag in the DC machine is not the easiest thing to change , not impossible to change , just not easy . The Woodstock DC Separator lets you collect and empty in a 30 gallon garbage can , very easy to remove the lid and empty the can.The Separator will collect the large particles and some dust , allowing the smaller dust to be collected in the DC bag . But do n't wait for the garbage can to fill up before emptying it . The fuller the can gets , the less area for the particles to drop , so empty the can about at half full . When running my lathe or planer , that could be quite often . BUT , it is easier than emptying the bag , OR sweeping them off the floor without a DC system.No Dust Collection System is complete without this product .	1
I got this about a month ago and took it with me to HD and L 's to find a matching trash can . The jet unit seems to be better made and more rigid then other dust separator units I had looked at . It has 2 foam gaskets , one on the outer edge and one about 2 1/2 to 3 inches from the edge . I found that the inner gasket fit the 30 gallon Rubbermaid Brute plastic container with about 3 inches of overhang all around . I tried the 44 gallon Brute container and voila ! It fit perfectly on the outer gasket with no overhang . I bought the 44 gallon container with the optional wheeled dolly , connected it to my Delta 50-760 1 micron collector and now have what I think is the perfect 2-stage home-shop dust collection system.A couple of other things : - You need to use a good quality 4 '' hose to thread into this to get an airtight seal . The thinner collapsable hose will leak . No clamps are needed with good hose and you 'll get a good airtight fit.- It 's easy to bump this off of the trash container when the system is off . I used a cheap c-clamp to hold it in place on the trash container , hence the 4 stars . Jet should include something to keep this centered on the trash container.- It 's amazing how well this thing works ! I had to open it up a couple times to look because there was no dust in my collectors bag ! - Much easier to empty ( especially with the wheeled dolly ) than the usual fight with the dust collector bag .	1
This has to be the best value in my shop . I used two spiral 4 & quot ; connectors on the inside of the lid to connect to hoses outside . These spiral connectors let the hoses pivot . I do n't disconnect the hoses but use 4 & quot ; adaptors to hook to hoses from each machine.I 've filled up a 33 gallon trash can three times and have n't had to empty the dust bags on my Jet vacuum yet.But , even better , I can vacuum up all those little scrap pieces of wood and stuff and not wince everytime they hit my blades .	1
I got this separator for my Jet DC-1100 . First let me say that it does n't look exactly like the picture . The holes look more like Lee Valley 's 'Veritas ' lid . The intake into the dust collector is dead center while the intake into the can is on a drastic angle to form a `` cyclone '' effect . Mine was $ 41 from Amazon with free shipping ... I see it 's $ 28 from some other vendors now . I think it 's really worth about $ 28 in materials . It 's worth more than $ 41 in value . I looked at the other lids that are basically a 90 deg . PVC elbow imbedded in the lid . This one is a lot more aerodynamic . It is a large lid . The largest diameter can it fits is about 23.5-24.5 '' , while there is a second internal ring that fits cans around 21.25-22.25 '' . Even the 30 gallon galvanized steel trash cans I found are closer to 20.5 '' . I did find that Rubermaid Brute 44 galon trash cans are a perfect size ( although I have n't tested their implosion resistance so I ca n't say anything about that ) . And with horse country all around me , my local Tractor Supply has very thick ( nearly 1/2 '' ) plastic feed barrels that are 24 '' diameter , tall and very durable . About $ 20-25 will get you a nice can . That 's what I chose . I figured it 'd be quieter than steel anyway . Back to the lid ... it 's got a foam gasket that has qualities of memory foam ( slow to bounce back but shape conforming ) . I have high quality ( a.k.a . expensive ) 4 '' clear flexible tubing and it does `` screw '' into the holes . It could be a little more snug in my opinion . I will probably rig something to make the fit a little more air tight . All-in-all I would still buy this again ... or the Veritas because there 's not much else out there without dropin some $ $ $ on a real cyclone . If you have a dust collector and ca n't fit or afford a cyclone this is a relatively cheap upgrade .	1
THERE IS NOTHING THAT WILL GIVE YOU PAUSE , CAUSE YOU TO CRINGE , OR HOLD YOUR BREATH MORE THAN HAVING A LARGE `` CHUNK '' OF MATERIAL GET SUCKED INTO YOUR DUST COLLECTION SYSTEM.NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO SHUT DOWN THE BLOWER INSTANTLY , ONE TENDS TO CRINGE UNTIL THE INEVITABLE SOUND OF DESTRUCTION IS HEARD EMANATING FROM THE BLOWER HOUSING . `` DO I HAVE 'ANY ' BLADES LEFT ON MY IMPELLER ? `` THIS PRODUCT IS A GREAT IDEA AND A `` MUST-HAVE '' IF YOU WANT TO HAVE PEACE OF MIND AND NEVER WANT TO CRINGE AGAIN ( AT LEAST IN THE SHOP )	1
I 've got ta weigh-in on this item because it seems to be unfairly downgraded by some reviewers . If you read the description for this item , and realize that it is as basic and simple as described , then you should n't be disappointed by what you receive.I purchased this item because I really needed to make my dust collector two-stage . It was getting immediately clogged by both my planer and jointer 's large chips . I was n't willing or able to shell out money for a larger unit , and material costs and time to build my own would 've added up to more than this item . So I decided to give it a gamble knowing that Amazon would have my back if this did n't work.The item was shipped immediately and I received it within 3 days . It truly is just a large piece of molded plastic/composite that is designed to fit 20 & # 34 ; diameter trash cans . Even though I had 3 different style trash cans laying out behind my house , I fully expected to have to go purchase a trash can to fit this unit , based on a lot of the other reviews . But I I tried it on all three cans and it actually fit somewhat on two of the three styles . It was loose , but I decided to bungy it down and give it a shot anyways and see if I could save $ 20-40 on a new can.Here 's my setup : I do n't have a professional shop by any means . I have an older style Jet & # 34 ; lunch box & # 34 ; planer , and a newer Grizzly 6 & # 34 ; jointer . They do the jobs I need them to do , but both machines have been a huge headache when it comes to chip/dust collection . I have some 4 & # 34 ; dust collection hose from Grizzly as well as some of their hose clamps . The planer did not come with any kind of built-in collection port , so I retrofit one of my own from plywood . The jointer has a built-in port . My collector is an inexpensive 1hp shop fox dust collector.My first test was to hook this system up to my planer . I was very surprised to find that it not only worked , but I was shocked and thrilled at how well it functioned . 99 % of the chips were in the trash can while only the very fine dust made it through to the collecor 's bag . And that was with a loose fit on the trash can , a homemade dust hood on the planer and a 1hp dust collector ! When I hooked it up to the jointer it performed equally impressive.I could 've continued to use the system like that but I had some extra foam weather stripping laying around so I ran that between the seam of the lid and the can to help fill any gaps . That made the fit pretty snug . I do n't know if that improved the performance at all , but I felt better knowing that the lid fit more snuggly.I 've run probably around 100 boardfeet of poplar , oak , pine and mahogany through my planer and jointer with this set up . I could not have asked for anything better out of a $ 38 setup . I have not had a single clog on my dust collector since purchasing this separator and I 've not yet had to empty the bag on the collector either ( I 've had to empty the trash can many times however ) . Emptying the can is as easy as undoing the bungy cords , lifting the lid off and then dumping the can and reattaching the lid . Good luck to anyone looking for a better , less expensive way to create a two-stage dust collection system.Now , I had a few things already in my possession that made my experience smoother including : a collection of pre-owned trash cans , weather stripping , bungy cords , and dust collection hose/clamps . Without already owning these items , I could 've potentially spent another $ 100+ to get this setup working properly . You 'll need to keep that in mind before purchasing this item . It is definitely not a standalone piece.In the end , I 'm thrilled with what I got with this separator . Is woodstock charging $ 30 for a $ 3 piece of plastic ? Probably , but until someone else comes out with something to compete , they can ask what we 'll pay , and it 's still far cheaper than buying a brand new two-stage system.I 'm very happy with this item and would gladly purchase it again .	1
I wanted to add some important advice to my previous review . Make sure you empty out the can when it 's half full or the chips start making their way into your dust bags ! This separator is a must if you do planing - I just emptied mine twice while running four boards through my planer !	1
This thing works great . I had seen some complaints that the hoses did not fit snugly , but mine are tight and do n't need any tape , etc . The only difficulty I have had , is that the hoses make the bucket a bit top heavy so it is easily tipped over , but watching how you set it up solves that quickly . On another note , I first used a bucket from Lowes . Although it is a good bucket , the handle did not lock down the lid . The HD bucket handle is of a slightly different design and locks this down easily . Nothing really wrong with either bucket handle , one just fits this devise better than the other . This is money well spent .	1
I like it , received as Xmas present three years ago . Fits the top of all my 5gal plastic buckets . Ports fit all my misc collection of 2-1/2inch hoses and adaptors . Eliminates the heavy clean-up mess from my saw . Much easier to dump and clean than my wet-dry vac . Vac filters and dust bags last longer . A great start towards a more complete dust collection system.It is a loose fit attachment , not a 'snap in place ' gadget . It is easier to use with a short bungee stretched across the top to hold it on the top of the bucket . Hose ends go in about an inch . If I 'm concerned about them pulling out , I use a band clamp on the end.It also fits and works well with a small , 10gal shipping barrel . `` It 's a shiny thing , and I like it . ''	1
After reading the reviews on this hose , I closed my eyes and hit the one-click purchase button . I had to have something , I gave it a shot.I am not disappointed with it . It is not very rigid , but it is substantial enough to pull dust through to a portable collector . Trying to get the rigid 4-inch hoses everybody else makes to move around to my different machines was akin to wrestling an alligator in a phone booth . This one you just snatch up , walk over to the machine of you choice , and stick it on . Bends around corners , stretches , all easy . I adapted a 2 1/2 inch hose and tools from the shopvac and I use it for all of the vacuum chores in the shop . Floors included . To get it out of the way , just put the opening against your chest and choke the airflow . It will draw up like a turtle pulling its head in a shell.The rigid hoses are substantial , and if you were going to put a permanent system in , they would be the correct choice . But for a utility system that needs portability , this hose will work fine.By the way , I have already stepped on it and to my surprise it did n't hurt it a bit.UPDATE : three months and still working fine with no problems . HOWEVER , I suggest that you get a 4 inch keyed hose clamp . Keyed means it has a little flat tab where the screwdriver usually goes . You can tighten or loosen with your fingers . Then just slip the hose over the exhaust outlet of a machine , turn the key a time or two and it hangs on like a bad reputation . No more shaking loose in the middle of a cut . Amazon has these clamps , so does Woodcraft .	1
Like so many other reviewers have said , this is a good value . The hose does have a tendency to collapse on its self , but this is not a problem when hooked up to a machine . I also took the advice of one of the other reviewers to let it air out before hooking it up . I have 5 '' metal ducting and it turns out that a 4 '' S & D ( sewer and drain ) pipe fits just inside the metal blast gate and this hose will stretch enough to go over this same piece of PVC . The less flexible clear hose wo n't do this , so this turned out to be an extra bonus for buying this hose . I 've got enough hose to pretty much hook up my whole shop and use the 4 '' clear hose for moving between portable tools and hand vacuuming . Overall , I 'm very happy with the purchase .	1
I have a 600 CFM vacuum ( JET ) , a garbage can separator , and then 50 ' of this . I move it from router to planer to jointer . It works very well . My only caution is : Open it in a well ventelated area - the plastic odor from mine was VERY strong for about 48 hours . ( Now there is no odor . ) Update : 11 months later : After frequent `` hobby '' level use all year , I 'm still very pleased with this product . It shows no sign of collapse or holes from being dragged around my garage shop.Update : March 2007 - 3 years later : Still going strong ! Update : July 2008 - 4 years and counting - still working great after being dragged around for countless hours .	1
I considered for my small shop adding a permanent system with grounded PVC ductwork , but decided to go with the quick disconnect on the end of a flexible hose instead ( much much cheeper with less planning required ) .So far so good.I recommend grounding the wire that is in the the hose , the hose can and will build up static electricity which at the least is a little jarring when it discahrges on you ( or worse causes a fire ) .	1
I had a choice in hose selection when planning out my DC system . I figured I needed about 50 feet in connection my 6 pieces of equipment . I could either purchase this hose or 5 ten foot lengths of the & quot ; other & quot ; black hose . I bought this 50 foot hose and one ten foot section for comparision . I 'm glad I got this hose.Granted , the 50 foot hose is not as thick , but it is thick enough and sturdy enough for all my applications . It is much easier to work with , more flexible . For the price , this hose is the way to go . Even in cutting the hose , I had to poke a hole thru the hose with a pointed pair of scissors . The semi-blunted end of the wire cutters would not poke a hole in the hose ! ! The ten foot hose has to be cut in the exact length needed , it will not collapse if cut too long . If cut too short ... ... The 50 foot hose will collapse , and if you have a machine on coasters , then when properly planned , will expand when the machine is used . The 50 foot hose arrives in a box that is only about 4 feet long , the ten foot hose arrived in a box much larger and is not compacted ( it ca n't be ) .This hose gives more options , the only negative thing in comparsion to the 10 foot hose is , it is not as rigid , or stiff . Which can be a positive thing .	1
For the price , you ca n't complain about this hose . However , you should know that this hose will not hold up under a lot of suction . When I put a 4 '' to 2 1/2 '' adapter on it want 's to pull together . Like I said though , you ca n't complain for the price .	1
This is a fairly light duty hose . I would not recommend it for any sort of a permanent installation ( use something more substantial ) . For temporary hook-ups it 's PERFECT ! . I bought some `` FazLok '' connectors from Woodworker 's Supply to temporarly connect my dust collector to my mobile table saw , band saw , and drill press . I 'm using a 15 ' length of hose which fits into a 3 foot length of 6 '' plastic drain pipe for storage ( including the FazLok connectors ) . I 've attached a short piece of copper wire to the the wire in the hose and connected the wire to a magnet ( to attach to the metal part of my table saw ) . It takes only a second or two to attache the FazLok connector and ground my system . Highly recommended !	1
I have used it , abused it , and it keeps on going . I have a long rigid pipe for my main line on my dust collector , and use the hose for `` drops '' to tools . I also use a long section of the hose for a `` shop vac type '' application , dragging the hose around the shop and vacuuming in corners , tight spots , etc ... This hose is very flexible , and tough . I recently purchased a second hose for use in my shop , and if I need it later down the road , I will buy a third .	1
I love this hose . It is easy to work with , super flexible , and when you are using the collection system , it collapses to take up the slack in the system . I have 100 ' of this in my collections system . Some of it I have in long extra lengths so I can move the tools around for larger cuts . This stuff collapses right up on itself in the parts I am not using , its kind of neat to see it all raise up and get out of the way on the parts I am not using . Easy to work with , I have 4 & quot ; pipe holders attaching it to the wall in several places and it is definitely tough enough for years of use . the wire is strong and keeps the shape up well . IT is neat to see 50 ' of hose ship in a 4 ' box - THE hose to use in your collection needs .	1
this is excellent dust collector hose , there is not much you can write about 4 & # 34 ; flexible hose . I have been using the same piece of hose for the past 8 years .	1
I was concerned when I read a review saying this hose is flimsy . The hose is great for flexible needs . Any stronger and it would not be flexible . And I got a ton of it . I strung a short wire with an S hook on the end into the tube at the overhead dust collector fitting . When I 'm done with the tubing , I put my arm into it , the tubing shrinks from 10 feet to 1 foot , I grab the s-hook and hook it to the end of the tubing and the tubing is out of the way.Now if only they made an adapter to fit the tubing to my shop vac accessories !	1
This is not a hose that you would even think about for running permanent duct work but if you have mobile tools , are trying different placements for you tools or need a collector line to run around the shop for clean up , then this works great . I use short lengths of this to run from my blast gates to the tool inlets simply because I have a new shop and have found that I need to adjust placement of my tools fairly often . If I had used inflexible or expensive hose , I would be reluctant to move them and just made do , but since I bought a box of this , I can leave some extra on each gate and reposition my tools with ease . I roll out my planer and do n't have to connect and disconnect the hose since it simply expands and contracts as needed . I also have found it works well when you have to run it across the floor ( no other way to get it to my table saw ) and accidentally step on it . It collapses and springs back much better than my old ankles do .	1
Work well for me since I have it , hope it last another year or so since material not tough enough for moving the hose around .	1
Its not as flexible as the clear stuff and does not have an embedded wire . But as a permanent attachment to machines you want to have a bit mobile on your shop floor , they are inexpensive and I think rugged enough to survive without getting punctured easily .	1
Inexpensive vacuum hose that works well in many applications . Not quite as stiff and strong as the more expensive hose , but I needed some short lengths to connect to some tools , and this worked out just fine . It does not collapse under a strong vacuum pressure . The thin vinyl covering over a spiral wire makes the hose very flexible . Just pull the length you need out of the 4 ' long box and cut it off . It will require a hose clamp to attach tightly to a hose coupling or tool coupling .	1
Light weight and cheap . It will work and all but will not hold up to rigorous use . Saw dust only do n't try planer chips , it will eat it up .	1
I was a little hesitant in ordering this after reading the initial user reviews here , but went ahead and bought a couple anyway . After attaching the two quick disconnects to a 10 ' flexible clear hose ( made by Jet ) , I have been using it on various woodworking machines and my dust collector . So far , I have not experienced any of the disconnect problems expressed earlier . Perhaps the problem would occur if a shorter and less flexible hose is used . But these quick disconnects are a godsend for my small garage shop with most of my woodworking machines on mobile bases .	1
I have been using the Faz Lock fittings for a few years and have had no trouble with them . Of course I used some short sheet metal screws to attach one part to my machines . The other half attached to my hose can be adjusted to keep slight tension on the connection . VERY simple ! !	1
this 4 & # 34 ; hose quick disconnect works just like it is supposed to . it seems to hold very well , it is a lot quicker than having to loosen/ tighten a hose clamp every time you remove/install the hose on your saw .	1
Its an elbow..what can you say ... but really its clean no stray platic ... was slightly undersized so i had to wrap a bit of duct tape around it to tighten the seal so I knocked a star off for that	1
I have been stranded on a desert island for some time now and have been attempting to build a submarine to get back home made mostly from coconuts and palm trees . My biggest problem was the periscope and this elbow will allow me to complete the top by adding a small mirror and lens . As usual , Amazon came through with a prompt delivery by sea plane ! Ca n't wait to get home !	1
bought this to make a Thien baffle in a metal trash can , and it works awesome . I only had to clean out a little burr in the middle of the elbow to make it perfect .	1
Like others , I 'm not certain what you can say about something like this , so I 'll mention what I do know : -It has no holes in it , except on the ends , so does n't leak air , other than where it should.-It 's smooth on both ends , so I can fit it inside of black sewer pipe I 've cut into couplers , or into flex hose.-It bends air , which , I believe , most straight pipes ca n't do.-It does n't glare under intense shop lighting.-It 's ends are not over-sized , so I did n't have to grind anything off to get it to fit in couplers and hoses . I should note that I , like another reviewer , I had to gasket it with WD-40 's companion ( duct tape ) to insure an air tight connection between it and other four star air handling components.-It does n't need batteries.Now for the cons : -It did n't come with a free , three horse power dust collector , with a one micron canister filter [ and a cyclone extractor ] .-It did n't come with batteries ( but see the last note in the positives above ) .-It 's not clear if this one starts low and bends up to the left , or starts high and bends down to the right.-I had to turn my monitor until I got one that went in the same direction I needed.-The one I got was much bigger than the one in the picture ( which turned out to work in my favor ) .If you can get past the cons , noted above , this will , probably , be just fine for your needs .	1
Does what it is supposed to do .	1
I use this as an extension to my Incra router fence . It works perfectly as a connection between the fence dust outlet and my overhead dust hose .	1
In all fairness , there is nothing & # 34 ; wrong & # 34 ; with this item . I use it as part of a dust collection system in my shop . It 's just that there is nothing to make it warrant five stars .	1
ALTHOUGH THIS IS A NICE PRODUCT , I FOUND THE `` Y '' FITTING TO BE MORE EFFICIENT THAN A 90 DEGREE INTERSECTION.THIS PRODUCT IS PRICED BETTER THAN TH E JETJet JW1017 4-Inch Elbow	1
Great price and works well . Easy to remove and fit hose nicely . I used the product on my tablesaw . highly recommend .	1
As with every T , Y , or any other piece it directly abuts . I found that 4 '' PVC has a bit greater diameter and I have a mitre saw , so I cut off a LOT of 2 1/2 '' lengths and used gorrila tape ( great stuff ! ! ) on each of the fittings or Gates to fit . Ca n't tell you how many rounds to make , as every piece of PVC pipe seems to be a little different , but at least it is consistant for each piece of PVC . For me it was somewhere between a round and a half , to half a round , to get a secure tight fit . These take the abuse well that it takes to get everything tight .	1
Connects 4 & # 34 ; dust hoses and fits well enough that I usually do n't use a clamp unless the hose is getting pulled on	1
These splice sections fit the 4 & quot ; Woodstock International hose perfectly . The hose will not lose much vacuum if they are just slipped on , but affixing the hoses with wire clamps will make it more permanent.There are two schools of thought for that proposition : if you just slip your hoses on the fittings , it will slip appart if you stumble over the hose while bumbling about your shop ; if your hose is out of the lanes of traffic , clamp them to avoid having to crawl behind that stack of plywood to reattach them . If your tightly clamped hose is strung accross the floor , it will trip you , especially if you ca n't see the floor because you 're proudly hauling that newly completed vanity cabinet in for your adoring wife 's inspection.Work Safely and Happy Dust Collecting ! Alex	1
So I buy these for a slightly different reason than they are supposed to be intended for.I cut these down the middle then smooth the cut ends to hook up to blast gates using a union fitting.It 's plastic , it 's round . I do n't know what more to say . They work .	1
I must admit that the only reason I 'm reviewing this product is because I can use the Title `` Well connected '' . And that is what it does and it does it as advertised 4 '' to 4 '' connection . What more can I say than I am better connected to my dust collection system than I was before and that is a good thing .	1
It does just what it was designed to do , connect 4 & # 34 ; flexible vacuum hose together . The wall thickness is plenty strong and does the job . I have nothing negative to say about it .	1
Woodstock carries a lot of dustcollector system devices . It 's like putting together tinkertoys . This piece is especially usefull and flexible	1
This splice is normally used to connect two hose sections . But I used it to connect to a dust filter . I cut it in half , glued the two pieces in place , connected up a hose to each place and clamped them.. The dust filter connections are are set up to have the hose pushed in and are held in place by the ribs in the host . This works fine for normal hose , but not for extra-flexible hose . So this was how I fixed it when I changed hose types.I am sure it works fine for its intended use , but this is what I wanted it for . Just remember that you need clamps to connect the hoses .	1
RATHER THAN BUY A LARGE BOX OF FLEX-TUBE TO FINISH THAT `` LAST LEG '' OF YOUR DUST-COLLECTION SYSTEM ( AND THEN HAVE A TON OF TUBING LEFT OVER ) THIS ALLOWS YOU TO SPLICE TOGETHER ALL OF YOUR HOSE SCRAPS THAT ARE TOO SMALL TO FINISH THE JOB , ENDING UP WITH A PIECE THAT WORKS.SAVES MONEY AND ELIMINATES THE NEED TO STORE THE LEFT OVER TUBING.THIS IS A MUCH BETTER VALUE THAN THE JET PRODUCTJet JW1019 4-Inch Splice	1
I used 4 & # 34 ; DWV ( PVC Sewer Pipe ) for my central dust collection branch lines . I do n't use blast gates . Instead , I just slip fit a 4 & # 34 ; cap over a short piece of pipe extending from a 45 elbow . These splices slip inside the 4 & # 34 ; DWV perfectly for a friction fit . I leave one of these splices clamped in the end of a flex hose and just plug into the system whenever and wherever I need . These are too small for the DWV fittings , but they are perfect for the DWV pipe . Cheap , Simple , and Works like a charm ! ( Yes , I 'm excited over a hose splice , take your victories when you can ! )	1
This is a well-made product that does what it 's supposed to do . Connected two shorter pieces of d/c hose to make one piece . No issues with fit and snugged up the clamps . Beats the heck out of buying a whole nother piece .	1
This product works great for the purpose I had intended it to . Both the 4 '' hose and the 2 1/2 '' hoses fit on it perfectly .	1
It works great and does what it is supposed to . It works great and does what it is supposed to .	1
I had been using my screaming , ear-killing ShopVac for dust collection on my router table until I bought this adapter . Now I use my quiet , absolutely wonderful JET 1100 cfm dust collector ( see that review ) , connected to the hose from my ShopVac through this adapter . I can actually hear my router now ! This will adapt your 2 1/2 & quot ; vacuum hose to your 4 & quot ; dust collection hose . I can even vacuum the floor without going deaf now ! Such a cheap improvement ; your ears will thank you !	1
As others have noted , this adapts a 4 '' hose to a 2.5 '' hose . Such a step-down is useful if you run larger hose throughout most of your shop then drop down to the smaller house where required . This simple adaptor does that task properly . No problems .	1
If your worried about this thing fitting STOP ! ! This fitting fits inside the standard 4 & quot ; collection hose no problem.As for the reduction end it 's also true and mated with my shop vac hose just fine . Here 's a little helpful hint.If your having problems with fittings or your dust collection hose has a weird tweek in it and wont fit up under your machine like you want.Use a heat gun or a hair drier to slowely heat up the hose and then position it however you need to . Now get out there and collect some dust .	1
A long fexible 2-1/2 inch hose makes vacuuming a car so much easier . This adapter fit my shop vacs inlet snugly making the vac more useful . The smaller hose was n't cheap , but it 's worth having & using .	1
I accidentally ordered the wrong size adapter , but did not realize it until after it was shipped . I figure oh well it is only $ 5 , write it off . Then I checked into how easy would it be to return it , being I never had to return anything back to Amazon before , I figured this would be a good trial run . But Amazon was having none of that , they told me to keep the part and they will refund my card anyway . Now thats is customer service.. Thanks Amazon for fixing my mistake for me , so easily .	1
this reducer was easy to attach to my flexible hoses , and fit my need perfectly.. A good buy for the price .	1
Fits great ! Helped me reduce a fitting on my saw dust collection system that I built in my shop . I use it for multiple saws with that size fitting .	1
Actually , the fit between the bandsaw 4 & # 34 ; port and my Shop Vac 2-1/2 & # 34 ; hose is really very good.Could n't beat the price , either . : )	1
Ok like that others have said this is meant to be used inside a 4 inch hose - but you could do as I did and used an old 4 inch rubber plumbing collar I cut it down down to size then used the clamps to hold it on to this and the dust port on my ridgid table saw and it works like a charm .	1
Yay my vac hose fits my planer now . In case you ca n't tell , this has a female connector on the small end and male connector on the large end . In my case I had to put a short 4 & # 34 ; section of hose between it and my planer .	1
Hooks up my Rigid hybrid table saw to my Craftsman shop vacuum . All hoses connect well to this reducer . Very pleased with the result .	1
I purchased the Woodstock W1044 4 to 2 1/2 '' reducer to help me to hook up several peices of equipment in my woodworking shop to the central vacuum system that I had purchased . They work great !	1
Bought this to have my vacume fit my ridgid sander device . Works fine and would recommend to others . . .	1
Well does what it suppose to do ... reduce a 4 '' vacuum hose to a 2 1/2 hose.If you are looking to reduce I would highly recommend .	1
A little plastic adapter that does what it should . Buy it if you need it . Be aware the measurements are the outside diameter of the adapter , so you ca n't slip a 2-1/2 or 4 '' OD fitting onto it .	1
This device is designed to work with your 2 1/2 '' shop vac hose . The large end is for attaching a piece of flexible tubing , and the small end is for attaching your shop vac . I have it attached to my Rigid 4512 tablesaw : flex tube from the saw port to the large end of the reducer , then attach the shop vac to the small end . Secured with worm clamps . Works like it 's supposed to for me .	1
Well if you are putting together a dust collection system then you likely already know how difficult and frustrating it can be to match sizes of connectors . This is well made and true to size as advertised .	1
This ended up doing what I wanted but not as slickly as I hoped for . The description did n't give me a complete picture of how this would work . I had hoped it would slip over or into the 4 & # 34 ; exhaust on my bandsaw , it did n't . It also is 4 & # 34 ; so I cut it down to about 3/4 & # 34 ; lenghth and duct taped it to the bandsaw . My 2 1/2 & # 34 ; shopvac hose fits perfectly on the other end . I 'm happy with this arrangment since it kept the price down for the modification .	1
Well made , heavy , and easy to install . Better than the square ones since this taper allows a smoother transition for the dust , etc..	1
I bought this to make a connection from my 4 inch hose and reduce down to 2 1/2 shop vac hose it works good tight fit does not come loose made of good material I am very pleased with my purchase .	1
Combined with a `` plumbing-dept '' rubber pipe connector , these work well for all my shop tools . The plumber connectors are the key as they are available for every standard size port you might need . They come as 2:2 or 2.5:2 or 2:3.0 etc . They use a clamp on each end so the ports are tight and right . Order several at once or you pay more for freight than the tool ! !	1
I actually have a couple of these . The do a good job of reducing hose size well maintaining good air flow . I use it to hook my bench top band saw and table saw to my dust collector . I also use one to connect my contractor saw to my shop vac when I have to move it away from the dust collector . I have a small shop in the basement and a larger one in the garage , and sometimes tools end up being used in the other shop , or outside . So I need to be able to change between 2-1/2 & # 34 ; and 4 & # 34 ; dust collection .	1
STOP LOOKING FOR A 4 '' CONNECTOR . THIS ONE ACTUALLY FITS A WOODSTOCK 4 '' HOSE & GENERIC 2 1/2 '' HOSE . I HAVE SPENT $ $ ORDERING 4 '' CONNECTORS ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY DO N'T FIT LIKE YOU WOULD EXPECT IT TO . WILL NOT FIT 4 '' MACHINE OUTPUT CONNECTIONS , BUT FITS THE HOSE LIKE IT 'S SUPPOSED TO . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .	1
It gets five stars for being what it is supposed to be without any negatives . It 's just plastic , and I would n't expect better quality.With this , I can change from standard 4 '' duct to the hose that came with my Rigid ShopVac . This can , in turn , collect dust from a mitre saw or router dust attachment .	1
I am using this to be able to connect my shop vac to the dust collection port on the table saw . I fits into the shop vac just fine , but like others have said , the 4 inch side is the same size as the dust port on the tool . Obviously this is meant to to the reverse of what I am trying to do here : getting a dust collection system into a 2 1/2 inch port.I just grabbed a little PVC and epoxy from the store and made it work .	1
I needed a few of these to convert my bigger tools to be able to work with my shop vac . This was the perfect fit . Although this did n't fit snuggly into the woodstock dust port , i was able to duct tape them together and it now works fine .	1
This item was a recommended `` ... people also buy ... '' when buying the Delta 50-359 12-inch Planer Connect . They do not connect together . Each have the same OD & ID . Searched everywhere for an adapter or PVC pipe with the right dimensions ; no luck . Used Gorilla Tape . Works great .	1
This adapter worked perfectly . It connected to my planer 's port , which then connected to the 4 inch hose . I was pleased with it and ended up buying another .	1
If you have tried to purchase hose fittings for shop vacs and the like , you have come to realize that there are slight differences in the various items such that some do n't fit as they are intended , or as you wish them to . That is what duct tape is for . Otherwise , it is a perfectly fine , plastic molding . Not a lot to say .	1
Originally , I had rated this lower but now that the ad clearly states it requires a short length of 4 '' hose to connect it [ to a dust hood in my case , which I finally discovered ] , there should n't be any misunderstanding . It does an excellent job of adapting my 2 1/2 '' vacuum hose to the 4 '' hood inlet .	1
Needed to go from 4 & # 34 ; d/c hose to typical shop-vac hose . This did the trick . Clamp 4 & # 34 ; on , and the 2 1/2 & # 34 ; port allows for the shop-vac end to make a tight fit and onto my tool ports .	1
works as advertised . just get the gorilla tape out and seal the connection and its good to go . It will do the job if you need a step down .	1
I use this to reduce my jointer and planer down to the 2.5 hose i use in my shop . Please note that you must use a piece of 4 & # 34 ; hose to couple your machine 's port to the 4 inch port on this reducer . Likewise , the 2.5 & # 34 ; side is intended to have a hose fitted to it . Neither side will directly slide onto or inside of another hard port .	1
When you look at the plastic `` stuff '' that is available for a little bit less money , it is a poor exchange . These are VERY well made , strong , easy to use and install ... . could not be better . I bought 6 and then ordered two more because they were even better than I had hoped for . You will NOT be disappointed . Yep , I would buy more if I needed them .	1
Not much to say . Excellent , well-built , hefty fitting . Works perfectly ! I liked the first one so much , I ordered 2 more for my woodshop . Nice !	1
I have several of these on my dust collection system and they work well and does not seem to leak much . They are solidly built and should last for a long time . The only minus would be the lip that you put the hose on , it could be a little longer .	1
These are exactly what I was looking for . They are very heavy duty , open and close securely , and should last a lifetime . They look like the picture and function exactly as expected . No surprises , and highly recommended .	1
Make a reasonably good seal when closed . I have 2 for my portable dust collector . I is kind of a pain having to open and close them but thats my own fault .	1
A blast to use open the gate air goes through close the gate and it does n't . It could be slightly tighter so the door stays fully open in the upright position , Lay it on its side and it works better .	1
I was a bit worried about a plastic blast gate but these worked great . They were not very heavy so it could be placed on flex hose without much worry . The flange will connect to 4 & # 34 ; white PVC pipe without any issue at all . It 's durable and cheap , get as many of these as you have tools that need dust collection .	1
I purchased four of the gates to use on my collection system . They are very easy to use and install . The only thing that I wish that they had was a stop built into them to keep them open when in use in the vertical position . I had purchased a competitor 's gate to finish the system that had this stop in them and it really helps to be able to mount the gate vertically and not horizontally to help keep it open . All in all , it is a great item and recommend it 's use to anyone .	1
for the price these work great they were easy to install and operate , i am able to control the airflow to the different machines in my shop , these are great for a home shop	1
These work great on the & quot ; ribbed & quot ; hose that most shops use for dust collection . The solid strap clamps tend to slip and skew when tightened and allow tiny leaks where these wire clamps seat on the hose solidly . You can also use a nut driver or socket wrench to get them REALLY tight , tighter than just using a screwdriver . If you are using Woodstock International hose , use these clamps .	1
These are high quality and far better than the band type.These are clean looking and fit over the ridges on the pipe instead of crushing them . They tighten up with a screwdriver or wrench and really sinch down tight.Because the dust collection hose is made with a continuous ridge and not seperate sections . You will have to cross over some ridges on the collection hose but , it still comes out clean.Forget the old rubber hose type clamps and go with these you wont be sorry . Now get out there and clamp some hose .	1
i mean , what can you say about wire clamps ? these are well built , bit 4 '' flexible hose without problems , and are at a good price .	1
I PREFER THESE CLAMPS TO THE OLD-SCHOOL HOSE CLAMPS WE HAVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO . THIS CLAMP IS THE `` BEST PRICE '' OF ALL THAT ARE OFFERED AT 55 CENTS EACH ( EVEN COMPARED TO THE GRIZZLY [ 10 ] PACK AT $ 5.90 [ 59 CENTS EACH ] ) Grizzly H5357 10 Pack 4 '' Wire Hose Clamps	1
Its an inexpensive clamp . I use a wrap of half width duct tape on the duct to give the flex hose and band clamp a bit of bite to help keep them attached . Its not a 5 star clamp but it is decent .	1
Great design and works really well . I wish it had come with some double sided tape to attach it to the floor , but easy to do myself .	1
Bought this item to increase the efficiency in my shop and garage and it functions very well for the purpose intended .	1
The product does the job ; no complaints . Mounting tip : Mine is mounted with tape onto a smooth ( not polished ) concrete floor . To get a great tape seal I first cleaned the floor with a solvent , let it dry , then used shiny aluminum heating duct tape , the kind with a paper backing . That tape has amazing sticking power , and is much better than regular duct tape .	1
I consider this a `` must have '' for any shop . It lets you sweep the floor without needing a dust pan to pick up the dirt . Between this , and a 4 '' to 2-1/2 '' adapter so I can connect the hose from my shop vac to the dust collector , I manage to keep my workshop almost clean . Now if only the dust collector had a port in my kitchen ... ( High capacity central vacuum anyone ? )	1
I REVIEWED THE JET FLOOR-SWEEPJet JW1003 4 '' x 21 '' Dust Collection Floor SweepAND RAVED ABOUT IT.THIS IS JUST AS NICE , BUT AT A BETTER PRICE	1
This works really well . You do n't have to worry about a dust pan . I have it hooked up to my powermatic dust collector	1
My first impression was that it was too thin and flexible but I 've had no issues with durability . Installed with 3M double-sided auto body tape for a strong tight mounting to a smooth concrete floor ( suggest cleaning floor with lacquer thinner , MEK or something like & # 34 ; Goof-Off & # 34 ; first for good adhesion ) . Makes shop clean-up a breeze .	1
I was n't sure what I was going to get for the 3 or 4 bucks I spent on this item , but I am very happy with what I have . I connected this to my 4 '' dust collection hose , turned the dust collector on , and started sweeping stuff towards it . Just like that it was all sucked up inside without any issues . I ca n't think of any downsides to this product .	1
I have a small dust-collection system in my garage-shop . This sweep is mounted against the floor ; dirt and debris are swept into it . These parts are not super-easy to find -- thank goodness for Amazon !	1
In addition to the other comments ( which I found to be right on the money ) , I would add the following . I have been using this tool for about a year mainly to sharpen kitchen knives . I do a lot more eating than woodworking so I thought I would add my experiences with this tool when used specifically for kitchen knives . My knives are both the modern stainless steel and the vintage carbon steel . I use almost every shape and size of kitchen knife , so I 've tried this tool on a broad spectrum of knives . When I first started , I used the guide for knives and followed the manual to a `` T '' . This produced good results , however the edge of the knife often had slight changes in angle resulting from trying to maneuver the knife guide up and back to follow the contour of the knife tip . After some experimentation I found that doing the knives by hand and using the angle guide to make sure I 'm starting at the correct angle produced the best results . It also allowed the precise control to grind just right so you create a little lip on the opposite edge ( just as it is explained in the manual ) , which is hard to do consistently on any curved surface when using the jig . It is also much quicker than having to put each knife in the jig and re-adjust the depth for proper angle . Additionally , when sharpening long knives with the jig , the buffing wheel often gets in the way when grinding and vice versa . When you have mastered doing knives by hand I think you 'll find that it is much quicker and produces better results than almost any other kind of sharpening . Speed is important when you have 30-40 knives to sharpen and you 'd like to do something else with your weekend.This machine does make a mess with water and buffing dust just as others have noted , but if that 's the price of cool sharpening with the added quality of leather edge buffing I 'd rather deal with it than dry grind .	1
I picked up a Tormek 2006 from a local woodworking store a couple months ago . Bought the complete fixture kit from amazon.com a couple days later.This sharpening system really lives up to the hype . I used to spend about 2 hours on a single chisel using the sandpaper and glass method to get what I thought was a sharp edge . With the Tormek , I spend about 5 minutes to get the initial profile on the chisel and about 30 seconds to resharpen using the Tormek . The Tormek produced a much sharper egde than I was able to get in 2 hours messing with a bunch of different grits of sandpaper.The Tormek instructions were very straight forward and easy to understand . Great pictures too . Nice thing about Tormek is you can download the entire user manual before you buy and look it over.After playing around sharpening my chisels and plane irons with great result , I ordered the complete kit to sharpen my planer blades , jointer blades , turning tools , knifes , and scissors . Everything came out perfect . Note that I have not been using this thing for years . I just got this machine a couple months ago and I can turn out tools that are sharp as can be . But more important than having sharp edges is how this machine has increased the quality of the end product . Thats the true test in anything we buy . Is it a gadget or will it make a difference in the end product . This machine will make a difference.Hope this helps . Is an expensive piece of equipment but well worth the investment if are in it for the long run .	1
I resisted for years , always using water stones to sparpen my chisels . I still think the price is way too high for the Tormek , but now that I own it I consider it a must have . Too bad all the accessories are overpriced too , but Torkek does have great products . It is easy to get a great edge on anything with this tool with the proper accessory . When I think of all that time I spent sharpening chisels on my waterstones ... ... ... Suddenly the price does n't look so bad .	1
I have been using this system for about 9 months and I am very satisfied . This machine works wonders on straight edge blades such as chisels . But beware , sharpening curved blades , such as knives and plane blades , requires practice to acquire a certain finese.For example , I sharpen my hand plane blades so that they have a slight to substantial curve on them . My scrub plane has a substanial curve while my smoothing planes have a very subtle curve . The curve eliminates the `` edge bite '' that results when a straight plane blade is used . I use the multi-purpose jig for plane blades and it requires a bit of practice to get a really nice edge . Still , using the Tormek for curved blades is probably easier than water stomes but not much.I bought a lot of the accessories and boy , are they expensive . One of these days Delta will make a knock-off Tormek that sells for half the price . Some of the accessories are great , such as the scissor sharpening jig and the knife sharpening jig . But who in their right mind would need to sharpen an axe to a razor sharp edge ? ? Just use your regular grinder.Certain accessories shold be included in the basic package , such as the diamond truing tool , because the wheel WILL become out of round .	1
I am a professional handyman . I 've owned my Tormek now for two weeks and I have sharpened ( or tried to sharpen ) every blade tool I own ( and there are lots ) .Overall , I like this unit . Compared to the bench grinder / occasional hand sharpen I used to do , this thing is so much better . It can be accurate enough I 'm convinced you could resharpen razor blades ! Neither + nor - , here are a few things I learned after opening the box:1 . The unit is now shipping with a DVD video , not a VCR tape.2 . The 100+ page book which comes with the unit does a good job explaining what the attachments are for and how to use them . You can download this book for free from [ ... ] . Wish I 'd seen it before my purchase ... 3 . If you are used to a `` fixed '' support similar to a bench grinder , you 'll need to get SVD-110 . Most ( all ? ) the other attachments pivot about the Universal Support which makes them useless as a `` just plain '' support . I found the SVD-110 a much more useful attachment for me than the SVA-170.4 . If heavy axes , masonary tools , concrete chipping tools are your concern , the bench grinder gets a `` good enough '' edge -- and is a lot faster to use.5 . If you are not cash short , a second Universal Support will pay for itself in convience . Then you leave one set up for grinding , one for honing.Now the `` but '' parts ... I thought some design features would have been better handled in such a high-end system . Specifically:1 . The power cord is a short 6 ' . It should be 2 ( or more ) feet longer.2 . There is no flange along the top right edge of the green motor housing ( next to the grinding wheel ) to catch stray water which spills onto it when you run the blade you are sharpening right-to-left over the stone . There *should* be a 3/4 '' flange there to redirect that water back into the plastic reservoir cup . As it is , you have to sop up the puddle every few minutes.3 . The SVH-60 ( chisel attachment ) has two problems . First , the screws which hold down the clamping plate are too short by at least 1/2 '' . They open wide enough for wood chisels ( ~1/4 '' ) but not enough for a cold chisel or masonary hammer . Second , while two flanges along one edge are there to assist you in getting the tool perpendicular to the stone , these are often unusable due to the particular configuration of your tool . There should also be engraved on the clamping plate a series of `` sight lines '' parallel to the stone to help you to visually align your tool.4 . The Universal Support bar is too short by 1 or 2 inches . It is easy to inadvertantly run your jig right off the open end . The bar should be longer and , perhaps , a hole should be drilled in it near the end so a T-shaped `` stop pin '' could be used as needed.5 . The SVA-170 ( axe attachment ) is too small for most axes , though it works great for hatchets . Using 2 wing-nuts and steel slots , the unit should be made to allow both longer and thicker axes . As it is , I decided the unit is pretty much worthless for axes -- and I 'm back to the bench grinder for these.I ca n't comment on attachments other than SVH-60 , SVD-110 , and SVA-170 as I have n't used them .	1
I have found this sharpener and system to produce a rapid , accurate and beautiful edge on knives and woodworking equipment . Once you read the book for each jig you plan on using ( I recommend highly ) , it is very likely you will produce professional results on the first or second try . The consistent angle of grind , slow water cooled stone and honing wheel produce an edge that quite often blows away the `` new out of box '' edge I 've found on many of my new knives and especially chisels.The video was more of a marketing tool than educational device so do n't worry if you are unable to get to a VCR right away . The honing compound is pretty messy and you will wind up with water on your work surface if you sharpen long items such as chef knives or planer blades.Compared to other systems , I rate this one as tops !	1
I originally purchased this system because I was having trouble getting good symetrical , sharp fingernail grinds on my turning gouges . The way the system 's jigs are set up , its very difficult not to get great results . All of my turning tools have never been more sharp ! Since then I have purchased other jigs and find they work just as well as the turning tool jig.The only negative thing I can say about it is the price . Very expensive initially because you 'll probably want to get a jig or two along with the machine for your specific needs .	1
My friend has owned a Tormek for a couple of years and I wanted to know what he liked and did n't like about it . He really would n't elaborate but strongly recommended that I come over , use it , and decide for myself.When I arrived he showed me the basic 's and handed me a beat up knife and said that if I could sharpen it , I could have it.No kidding , in about 2-3 minutes , it would shave effortlessly.I have always prided myself on being able to put a serious shaving edge on blades by hand . As a result , over the years I have invested a lot of money in stones . When you read the other reviews and they say things like `` scalpel '' sharp , it is No exaggeration . You can create edges as sharp as medical instruments . I have never seen or used anything that will as reliably , quickly , and as easily , create such a sharp edge as the Tormek . I sharpened several items with various bevel angles , a short knife ( that I now own ) , a long kitchen knife , chisels , and scissors . They All shaved effortlessly.My friend has the entire package with all the accessories and he did n't want to sell it to me . Knowing his investment , I asked the probing question . If somehow he lost his , would he go out and spend that much money on it again ? He said , `` yeah , it 's a lot of money , but I 'd do it again '' .It is a considerable investment . It seems as though you should be able to get it for about half the price . But judging from the competition , several manufactures continue to try and continue to fall short.I 'm living proof that Tormek can sell these at the current price because I just ordered the entire package .	1
If you have to sharpen your hand tools as often as I do , you will appreciate the Tormek to no end . I bring it to the job site and my crew loves it . Our work involves high end restoration and reproduction work and sharp tools are an absolute necessity . The Tormek will sharpen a nail dinged chisel in five minutes . I still like using an Arkansas oilstone to put the keen edge on the bevel , but you really do n't need it with the stropping wheel included on the machine . My only disagreement with Tormek is the use of the stropping wheel to remove the wire edge from the back of the cutting edge . If you are not careful , the edge of your plane or chisel will no longer be flat meaning you have to relap the back . Stick to the oil or water stone for that .	1
I 'm a long-time doubter here . My primary hand tools are a set of Japanese chisels , some Pfeil carving tools , and a number of Lie-Nielsen plances of which I 'm inordinateld proud . I have an entire library of sharpening stones and have been completely egotistical about hand sharpening and honing . In other words , I was an edge snob . That it could take me two days to sharpen everything after a sizeable project was besides the point.Age , and the addition of another set of exotic chisels , finally did me in . After all that time sharpening it took another two days to work the cramps out of my fingers . suddenly the Tormek , despite its price tag , began to look good . So I attended a demo and watched someone sharpen a very fine chisel in about 15 minutes , including the traditionional hair shaving flourish . the finish of the edge was mirror perfect . I started saving my pennies.The Tormek works by using a sharpening wheel that can be surfaced easily for either fast cutting or fine finishing . It rotates through a water bath at about 90 RPM . The tool being sharpened actual stays cold so you never lose temper . On the other side is a honing wheel with a leather surface on which you put a bit of rubbing compound , and that finishes the job . Because of the way you use the wheel , the edges are hollow ground . So if you are a perfectionist , you should grind at a slightly greater angle , but I know of no one who has ever had a problem.I bought the Tormek with a host of accessories , but this model , out of the box with just the basic jig , will do 90 % of your sharpening . It took me 6 hours to go through every edged tool except my joiner blades , and every one is perfect . Including the iron on an old , ugly Record T5 that had literally become a paperweight . If you want a way to consistenty get great edges on a host of tools ( you can even get an axe sharpening jig ) there really is n't another option . And it actually does what it says it does .	1
This is a great tool for joinery . Makes really strong joints and is fast and easy . The bit is good quality . I bought the tool after seeing it used in projects in the Handyman Magazine and reading the good reviews here at Amazon . After using it extensively to build cabinets , I agree with the reviews.The couple of areas for improvment:1 . The end attachment is hard to screw into the body . I leave it out entirely now , since I mostly work with 3/4 '' material and line the edge of the jig to the wood edge.2 . The clamp barely works for 1 1/2 '' material . Some pieces were 1/8 '' bigger , and I could n't clamp it . They should have provided a slightly bigger clamp.3 . After extensive use , the plastic body at the holes is reamed out . A metal body would be nicer .	1
I bought the Kreg Pocket Hole Pro Pack , which has all of the components on this set , plus the workpiece holder . You could make your own using a toggle clamp . What I wanted to share with you is that the Kreg Pocket Hole offerings made the number one spot across the board in the November 2003 issue of Better Homes and Gardens & quot ; Wood & quot ; magazine . Everything from the mini on through to the automated production machine were given the top ratings . It was a clean sweep for Kreg . They tested a lot of machines too . Some of the advantages are the flush edge joining to the workpiece prevented tearout . The case hardened steel guides did n't show wear or metal shavings . Easy to make or buy the premade plug holes out of wood . ( Some were an odd shape , and would n't accept plugs very well ) Even though the body is made out of plastic , which is substantial and well done , the steel guides are the only thing the drill bit touches.Pocket hole joinery is a nice addition to your arsenal . You will find yourself incorporating it more and more into your projects , and the Kreg system is the best . Highly recommended .	1
I swore by biscuits for everything , now I use a lot of pocket screws for smaller jobs . The screws pull the wood together and do n't require clamping .	1
I bought one of these little jigs to see if pocket screw construction really was as great as the advertisements say- and I 'm here to tell you it 's even better . I 'd used biscuits in the past to build cabinets , but pocket screws can be set up faster and require no clamping when gluing . The only downside is that pocket screws , unlike biscuits , are n't totally hidden from view- but the holes can be hidden in a lot of built in construction or filled with oak or maple plugs available from Kreg.This little Kreg jig has a plastic body , but it 's a very high density synthetic and should last a long time . The kit has everything you need to get started , including screws , but you 'll probably want to get a bag of another 1000 if you plan on doing more than a few boxes.If you 're planning on gearing up for even limited production , or building an entire kitchen , consider getting the all-metal Kreg with built in clamp . For about twice the cost ( once you buy the accesories already included with this jig ) you 'll have a unit than can be bench mounted and sets up in a couple of seconds .	1
I build cabinetry and prior to getting my Kreg I used a mix of T & amp ; G , dowels , and biscuits to join boards and frames together . For your basic furniture construction this device is simply amazing . Attach the jig to one face to be joined , run the special drill bit ( included ) down one or both fixed metal ferules , unclamp and use the Kreg screws to attach the two parts . I can now build furniture , test for fit in the shop , take it apart , apply finish and rebuild on site.On the downside it leaves a rather gaping hole on one side of the joint so it is not the preferred method for joining boards that are visible on both sides . They sell wooden plugs ( in different wood species ) , but I am not impressed with them as they take a lot of fiddling to get them in and flush . I also have not used it for joining boards into panels ( table tops or cabinet sides ) because I prefer an old school biscuit joint with good clamping technique for a flush surface.However like I said earlier . This is a heck of a tool . It makes for speedy face frame joints and handles my inch plywood joints very easily . Plus I can literally build the cabinet piece by piece and take it apart to finish or move it . For the price , the rocket pockethole kit is a very good value . If you build cabinets or furniture , than this is a nice tool to have it your shop . ( BTW : order extra screws - personally I find I use the 1 coarse thread screws on just about everything ) .	1
The whole Kreg system is one that I use often and with great success . I am a novice woodworker , but the system makes joints look quite professional .	1
Replacement bit is just that . If you have the system you probably love it like I do . I also use a PC pocket hole machine and like the versatility of this system , especially the fact that you can plug the hole . The only complaint I have is that I dropped my original bit on the concrete floor and it broke in half , luckily I had purchased this one prior and I was able to continue on my project .	1
I purchased the Kreg Pro Pack unit , that comes with this bit . My feeling is that since it is the only one , if for any reason I am in the middle of a project and the tip breaks , or I have any other problem with it , I do n't want to be left standing while I wait for another one . So I bought it as a backup.This bit does a great job , and the Kreg pocket hole systems won top of class award in every category in a recent run off by one of the top woodworking magazines . They won in every size , and every model from the mini on through to the professional bench top.I do n't really anticipate having a problem with the drill bit , but when doing this for a living , you need a parachute , in the event the unusual happens . This bit is built strong , and is rather large , so breakage is not likely , but the tip that protrudes on the end is a lot smaller , and that could possibly break . Additionally , if you are pocket holing all day , the bit could dull , and that would requires a replacement.Overall highly recommended .	1
I broke the tip off the original drill bit after about a year of use . I do n't remember exactly what I did wrong but they should be used in an electric drill not a rechargeable one . Anyway , I 'm glad I was able to get a quick , inexpensive replacement and I will be more careful in the future . Now I keep one extra in the box , just in case .	1
I use this tool a lot . I had one break and their customer serve was perfect . I decided to buy a back up .	1
These are tailor-made for drilling pocket holes - not just because of the stepped design , but because of their high-polish , sharpness , and temper . Drilling a lot of pocket holes in a row generates a lot of heat , and these bits hold up to the heat and keep their edge.If you are replacing a lost bit , be aware that this bit does not include the depth collar , which may be found here : Kreg H9474 Depth Collar w/ Allen WrenchKreg also makes a square shank version , for quick-change bit holders : Kreg Hex Shank Pocket-Hole Drill Bitand a quick change set including the quick-change driving bit : Kreg Quick-Change Pocket-Hole Kit.Finally , Kreg also makes cobalt steel bits that can be used either in their pocket hole machines or in a hand-held drill . These are exceptionally hard and will hold up to extreme use and high heat . They are expensive , though , and if you are going to use one in a hand-held drill , make sure you buy the right-hand twist version : Kreg DKDB 3/8-Inch Step Twist Drill Bit for Pocket Hole Machines .	1
good and sharp . I have drilled alot of holes with mine . In fact I have 3 in my kreg box setup for 1/2 & # 34 ; , 3/4 & # 34 ; , 1-1/2 & # 34 ; so that I do n't have to keep changing the stop collar , just the bits .	1
Works well . They just simply break every now and then . That 's to be expected . Sure would be nice if they were cheaper though !	1
Only one dollar cheaper than the big box stores but shipped free with other items . This was a easy to way to pick up a spare bit while I was ordering screws .	1
I am a firm believer in having back up items required for my tools . Upon receiving my Kreg R3 Jr jig , I decided that it may be wise to have a back up drill bit should for some reason , the original bit becomes damaged . How I do n't know , but better safe than sorry . A good quality item from Kreg . Extremely satisfied with all of the their products that I have purchased . Highly reccommend .	1
Tried other manufacturers but recommend using only this Kreg step drill bit . The metal seems to be harder and the pilot hole a better length than other step drill bits .	1
Quick delivery . Keep a spare so it is always there when you need it . Better price than the local hardware .	1
I have one of the 'generic ' pocket hole jigs you can get at most big box home improvement stores . when my original bit broke , I was in the middle of a project on a rare day off , so I had to buy a whole other jig set ( $ 30 ) in order to keep going . So I decided a spare would be a good idea . This is the best price on a spare bit I could find . The Kreg bit seems to be a little sharper than the generic one that came with my jig , so the generic bit is now my backup.It 's a good idea to keep one extra around . They are good bits , but the tip is definitely the weak point of the entire system . hopefully the kreg bit is a little better made .	1
I had a bit tip break off on a job , which was frustrating . So , I decided to buy two new bits and keep one as a back-up bit . So far , the first bit is still sharp and still performing well .	1
I purchased this bit along an additional Kreg depth stop collar so I could have two drill bits set up to make two different depth pocket holes quickly without having to readjust each time . This bit was a little pricey , but identical to the one that came with my K3 jig kit and works just as well .	1
Anyone who has the standard Kreg Pocket hole jig will find this the replacement they need.I got it on sale as a back-up even as the original is good quality and I probably will not need it soon .	1
Well made , Highly durable . I ; ve made hundreds of pocket holes in a kitchen 's full of face framed oak cabinets and the bit still makes clean accurate pocket holes .	1
This is a powerhouse drill bit , it is so strong and sharp I can not believer the way it just tears into the wood while making my pocket holes . I bought an extra one so I would not be stranded in case it gets dull or it breaks , I do not think it will ever break and as far as getting dull this thing is so sharp and ahs such a strong edge I do n't think it will get dull anytime soon.Great part of the Kreg pocket hole system .	1
It is 3/8 & quot ; in diameter and works very well with Kreg 's or similiar make self-boaring screws . You can use with any drill driver . Simple !	1
When I bought my Kreg Jig I never thought I would be buying screws in such bulk . But two years later here we are . I am a dedicated Kreg Jigger . Based on some of my projects people mistake my for an actual carpenter . Some even pay me to do what I love doing , ( the wood working stuff I mean ) I 'm already Thanks Kreg .	1
These are exactly as described . I used these to build two shelving units for our basement , and they are strong , hold wood very well , and if you are using the Kreg system as directed , they are perfect ! They 're a little on the expensive side but to be able to do pocket holes and not have any screws show , it 's worth it ! I love the Kreg system !	1
Not much to it . Do n't try and save a buck with the off-brand screws . Kreg screws gets the job done . This 1000 pack was cheaper than the stores ... and with Amazon Prime shipping , I got them the next day . That 's a win .	1
I had read a review that stated they were using the fine screws for everything . I found that when using soft pine , and more importantly into plywood , the fine screws were on the edge of getting the job done . All you had to do was remove one of the screws and reinsert it , to see what I mean . In my opinion getting the coarse screws , and the fine screws is essential.These screws have a very sharp tip on them , and the shaft thickness is thin as well . Consequently you do not need to pre-drill unless you are using them close to an edge of a soft wood . In that condition the thin edge can bulge a little.The great thing about pocket hole screws is their convenience , and strength especially when used in pairs . You will find your self using these more and more often . I even use them on straight joinery by drilling with a forstner bit to create a straight pocket , then go right in with the pocket hole screws . Admittedly by using the kreg jig , and getting an angled installation is stronger than going in straight . The angle prevents tugging on just the threads , but rather creates strength by having to pull the angled shaft through the wood . That is a lot stronger except in the rare condition of pressure being exerted at the direct angle of insertion-not likely.Their is some difference of opinion as to whether it is advisable to use glue in conjunction with pocket hole screws . One camp states that since the screws hold so well when done in pairs , that you do not need to use glue . Additionally , that gives you the option of being able to remove the joint , in the event you need to resize for example , or disassemble for shipping . Additionally their argument states that since the pocket hole screw system holds so tight , any glue that is put in the seam will be squeezed out.The other camp feels that for security purposes , gluing and screwing is the way to go . In the book , & quot ; Building Kitchen Cabinets & quot ; by Udo Schmidt ( an excellent book by the way ) the author states , & quot ; The expense of a pocket hole-drilling jig will easily be repaid in the time you save assembling face frames.So if you are contemplating getting the Kreg jig assembly , it comes highly recommended . If you are thinking about buying the screws , I recommend you getting the coarse and fine screws in the 1 1/4 & quot ; format , since they are useful for joining 3/4 & quot ; wood . Additionally you should get the screw kit with a variety of different length screws for those times when you are dealing with different stock thickness.In a recent magazine doing a run off of different manufacturers pocket hole jigs , Kreg took first place in every size jig-first place across the board . Hope this helps .	1
I 've found that the fine threads are more versatile than the coarse . These screws can only be used in softer lumber and plywoods . By contrast , if you 're careful to use lower torque settings , the fine threaded ones work in all wood types.This screw length is the recommended size for all Kreg joints involving 3/4 & # 34 ; to 3/4 & # 34 ; workpieces . An unbeatable price at this volume .	1
I got these screws because I anticipate using them for some pocket hole joinery in some pine I have . But I 've been using them left and right since they arrived , so I 'm sure glad I got the 1000 pack.I have historically used the `` wood screws '' sold at home centers , etc , which generally have a Phillips head and a fairly thick shank . The problem is you have to drill the right sized pilot hole or the head strips fairly easily when the going gets tough.These `` pocket hole '' screws seem to have a much thinner shank and deeper threads ( at least on the coarse ones ) so they screw in much easier . Plus the square ( Robertson ? ) drive is much better that Phillips for holding on and not stripping.I suppose they are weaker in some dimension than the wood screws , but how much strength do you need ?	1
The Kreg system is very good and their brand of screws is part of their system . I have driven hundreds of them now and not one has stripped out or broken . This despite using an impact driver.Kreg offers lots of lengths , different threads , specialty coatings and in various quantities . Obviously , it would be costly to buy a box of every variety to cover every possible use , so you do have to research and order appropriately . I got the box of a thousand and used an amazing number of them , so get a bigger box than you think you will need and you will have a nice collection of spares for those unplanned projects in the future.The screws are good for other tasks and so do n't necessarily have to sit around waiting for the next Kreg project.My order was Prime , so the cost for a a big heavy box of quality screws was very reasonable . It was cheaper than other leading brand and its shipping costs .	1
I ca n't get any projects done without these . My Kreg jig is one of my most used tools . I would love to upgrade to the newest model but the old one still works great .	1
Love all the Kreg product line , This was a good price for the pocket hole screws . Figure out your cost per screw and it is a decent value ...	1
Work great and ca n't beat the price anywhere locally . I previously bought the 1000 pk of 1 1/2 & # 34 ; . I wish the 2 1/2 & # 34 ; came in the 1000 pk too .	1
Great for pocket hole joints in 2x stock . All my work benches and tables are joined this way . Quick and inexpensive joinery when appearance is n't everything . They just work !	1
I buy these to use with my kreg jig . Work as good as a screw should i guess.It 's so easy to buy and free shipping with prime . I very busy during the day , so it 's nice to be able to sit back and order when it 's convenient .	1
Just got the kreg system not long ago and I do n't know how I did without them . I have used it several times and the whole set up is great quality.These screws are such good quality I would never consider using anythingelse .	1
This is the only way to buy these excellent but pricey screws . They are not only super for pocket holes but for other assembly when you need that washer to draw material together . Great buy , great product .	1
Theses screws are very good to draw joints together . Very quick for joinery and makes the job easy and fast .	1
Kreg may have the best screws for pocket jigs . While other may suffice , these are very good based upon the depth of the wood material you are using . Hope this helps .	1
A little more expensive that the the normal screws from Home Depot , but better quality . For some reason they even seem to grip better.They are the screws that come with the Kreg fastening system ( a must for anyone doing woodwork ) and are a first class product that works well for the system as well as general use .	1
Great pockets screws . Work great in soft wood which I use a lot . Stick with the fine ones for hard wood .	1
You can go through a lot of these in a hurry ! I originally bought a selection of screws ( different sizes in coarse and fine thread ) . The 1.25 inch pan head , coarse thread are the most commonly used . 1000 may seem like a lot , but I went through a significant number building base cabinets for my workshop . This is a great value .	1
These are great screws in their own right . I love them for pocket hole joinery but I also am using them to hang new windows . The self tapping is terrific , the pan head does not go through the plastic flashing , the the square drive holds the screw securely while I am one handed drilling them while hanging onto the ladder ! I do not think they are weatherproof but after flashing and the trim , they will be protected enough . High quality screws , never have had one strip one me and the self tapping has NEVER caused the board to split even right near the edge .	1
Of course these screws are designed and intended for pocket hole joints . And they perform that task perfectly ( do n't ever forget to glue the joints for the best strength and result . ) But I am finding these large headed screws are tremendously useful for other tasks too . They are now a staple in my shop .	1
These screws work great with the jig and were very well priced compared to other places . I will buy these again when I run out .	1
I have YET to break a KREG screw off doing something . They just work . What more can a person want in woodworking ? I would n't use anyone else 's screw for pocket hole joinery.Best to buy in bulk if you find yourself using one particular size . The more you buy of them the more you save . It 's a nice way to join wood and hide the joinery as well .	1
No real review needed , just the pocket hole screws that are needed for pocket hole construction . They work like they should .	1
Kreg is simply the best , use coarse threads for plywood , the pocket hole system is fast and simple and works great .	1
I had been using the same screws with fine threads . After reading the Kreg suggestions , I ordered the coarse threads to use putting soft wood together . They are much better on the pine boards than the fine threads . I can pull the wood together without pulling the screw out of the wood with the coarse threads . Very pleased with the difference .	1
Kreg screws work for anything you want to hold together very tightly.I used to use drywall screws with cup washers to do this sort of job , but these round head screws never split the work even without washers.However the chief benefit to these screws is that you do n't need pilot holes , since the self drilling point does that job perfectly.Also the reduced shank after the threads allows the top piece to be pulled up extremely tightly without drilling a clearance hole through it.All in all , a lot of good things for such a small package.Amazingly for such a great product the cost is just about the same as drywall screws . I am totally blown away .	1
Fair price , quick ship . Nice finish on screws . Pocket hole screws and jig make for a quick and hidden assembly of assorted frame assemblies and more . Be sure to use coarse for soft wood and fine thread for hardwood .	1
I 've reviewed these Kreg screws in different sizes with the same results.I 've used these screws with my Kreg jig with good results . I 've had no breakage , although I have experienced stripping out of the wood when driving them carelessly at top speed . I 've used them primarily in pine , poplar , and birch , so I ca n't comment about other wood types like oak , ect . The cost of these screws decrease significantly when purchased in larger quantities . For my needs , they work perfectly ... I would recommend them .	1
Save yourself the headache : purchase this bigger pack of screws because you do n't want to be in the middle of a project to find out you have no more screws ! Ask me how I know ! & # 60 ; duoh & # 62 ;	1
The kreg jig and screws are a must for anyone doing any wood work . They are expensive but trust me they are worth it .	1
I have built several cabinets using pocket hole screw technology . If you have n't tried pocket hole technology yet , make the switch , it works really well , but you need the special clamps . If you do a fair amount of woodworking it 's well worth the investment.Note : when joining two pieces of wood with pocket hole screws , it pulls them in really tight , so you need to make sure the ends are SQUARE , else the screws will pull the joint crooked . You may want to investigate the technology before purchasing screws . There are several different screw types depending on the types of wood being joined . Soft , hard , or ply woods . I love the technology , since I have purchased the full kit and several added clamps .	1
Ran out of this size first from the selection pack , so decided to go large with the 1000 pack - I do n't ever want to run out of these in the middle of a cabinet .	1
What can I say . These screws are hard to find . Lowes is the only place in my area where I 've seen them , but only in 25 or 50 count packs . Plus they do n't have a great selection of sizes . These are great because you save money buying in larger quantities . Why shop anywhere else ?	1
I wanted to build kitchen shelves to renovate my home . The coarse screws were used in conjunction withthe Kreg jig system . This was was perfect for the task . I highly recommend this product for woodworking renovation work .	1
I now only use Kreg products ever since I found the Kreg Jig a few years ago.Amazon is the just about only place I can find to buy these screws , they are becoming scarce anywhere else . the washer head is perfect , the bit that comes with the jig fits in the washer-head just right and it never slips for me . I have yet to have a screw strip on me . These screws make a=every project quick and simple .	1
These screws work really good with Kreg 's drill bit with pilot hole tip ( 3/8 & quot ; diameter ) . It is self boaring so it does n't split the wood . The coarse one works for soft wood like pine and plywood . Use fine screws for hard wood . Wish these screws were a little cheaper .	1
Just wish I had ordered all of the different woods the first time , oh well , more shipping and such cost . Neat plugs you WILL need sometime if you use your Kreg .	1
These plugs are red oak , and they matched all of my recent oak projects perfectly . However , the moisture content varies considerably between plugs , meaning that some fit and others are too snug to go in . The Kreg website suggests microwaving the plugs as a workaround to this common problem , but in my experience that did not work . As a result , I had to sand some of the plugs , and discard another 5-10 % that were simply unusable.Also note that the Micro and HD jigs are not compatible with these plugs . Kreg used to manufacture micro plugs , but I have n't been able to find those in any stores ( including Amazon ) .	1
I made a solid oak armoire using the Kreg jointing technique which had some 130 pocket holes . This was my first experience with the plugs and the Kreg jig for that matter . The plugs worked great , but I was initially unware that the fat end of the plug would need to be cut down slightly for them to fit . Since the same plug is used for all thickness of wood it made sense after I thought about it . My band saw quickly chopped off about 1/4 & # 34 ; off each of the plugs and they worked really well . It would have been nice if you could choose a grain direction , but that option is n't available .	1
One thing we can say for Kreg is that & # 34 ; If it is Kreg it will be highest qulity and dependable function. & # 34 ; Such is true for these simple plugs ... ... it sure does beat making your own ! The price is quite reasonable to . Enjoy !	1
These plugs work great . I do n't think I 'd have the patience to cut my own when I need to either hide pocket holes or , use them as part of the design . As good as they are I 've given 4 stars because of price , otherwise they are a 5 star product .	1
Perfect for covering the holes made by using the Kreg joining system - I do n't use them often because I try to hide the screw holes , however there are times when you just ca n't hide and these plugs are the perfect cover-up	1
tight enough that they will hold in the hold without glue , not so tight that you will loose the gap around them and the stock they are put in.they come long with the idea of sanding them flush .	1
When you use the kreg pocket hole system on finnished furniture you need to make sure you plug all the holes and there is nothing better to use than the Kreg Pocket Plugs .	1
No , Kreg did not invent the pocket hole jig , but they sure made it easily availble to the masses.A pocket hole jig is a great addition to any shop and to make it even better Kreg has these little plugs to easily fill your holes when you 're done.I recall that the last time I was reading the reviews there were those who were crying that the plugs were too long ; said that they had to speng forever sanding them down after they were glued in place.The kind folks at Kreg did that on purpose fellas - one size fits all . Most home handy man types are probrobly using basic 3/4 inch stock but the pocket hole jig is great for a variety of thickness materials and thes plugs are made to use with thick and thin stock.For 3/4 inch material I either set my small chop saw to about 30 degrees ( putting a piece of scrapwood against the backing to hold the plug steady against ) and lop off about a quarter of an inch off the fat end of the plug . If I am lazy or only need one or 2 plugs I just zip off a hunk quickly with my little band saw or scroll saw.Put a little glue in the whole and slide the plug down till it is almost flush.It dont get much easier than that .	1
They fit well , take stain or paint , and are consistant . What more could you ask for ?	1
I 'm ambivalent about exposed , finished ( plugged ) pocket holes . Face it , they just are n't as attractive or decorative as , say , exposed dovetails . The fancied-up project you see in ads with contrasting color plugs does n't improve things much , either.Plugs DO work ... mostly . The basic problem is that the edge of a pocket hole is typically not very clean , so while the plug can be seated and glued in quite firmly , the effect at the edges still is n't pristine enough to my eyes to for finish quality . Other reviewers have commented on the large amount of protruding plug that has to be trimmed & sanded , which I wholeheartedly second.I personally think the best use for pocket hole plugs is for painted work , where the plug can be made completely invisible .	1
Kreg is the big name in pocket screw-related products . They have great stuff and these oak plugs are no different . Just more good stuff from Kreg !	1
Yes , they work , and as Kreg warns you , they are cut a little long . But then , maybe that gives you an excuse to buy that nifty Japanese flush cut saw you keep fondling at the local wood working store ?	1
Big upgrade for me and it was worth it . Probably less expensive , similarly equipped tables out there , but this one I find exceptional.From an avid wood worker guy .	1
Very nice table when assembled ... however when you put this thing together you will notice that all the little screws , etc are in different bags ... they could make it easier by putting all the stuff for each assembly step in one ( 1 ) dedicated bag ... that way you are n't looking through and opening different bags at different assembly steps . This is my only gripe and its not a big one ... I really like the accuracy of this table so far ... have n't used it much yet . I paired mine with the Triton 3-1/4 HP router and a Freud 1/2 & # 34 ; nine piece bit set ... set me back about $ 1000 for the package but its well worth the money ...	1
Over all I am well pleased with my purchase.Stand- very well made . Simple to put together.Top-Well made and easy to attach.Fence- Well made , not as easy to put together . The fence is not very difficult but not the easiest part for sure.8 inch ruler that measures depth of fence does n't say which side to stick it on the metal side , make sure you do the right side . Plastic insert screws with metal nut for holding the sliding part of the fence . Metal nuts do n't fit on plastic screw inserts best in the world.Kreg says that there are two metal plates ( supports ) to keep the top from dropping . This is true but they are not attached to the stand but attached to the top . Seems it would be better attached to the stand.Overall I am well pleased and would buy again .	1
This is a very nice router table . The fence is a singe piece fence like a table saw . Very accurate . Do yourself a favor and purchase the micro-adjuster for the fence . This really lets you dial the fence in . I had a problem with the support screws vibrating out and allowing the insert to drop down . I cinched the hold down screws a little tighter and it has n't done it again . If it does , I 'll apply some loctite to the screws .	1
Let me get the zero stars for Amazon out of the way first . To be fair , I have bought a bunch of stuff from Amazon - my first stop for shopping . I 've only had to return one other item , and that return was handled perfectly , since I just dealt with their computer system . But this time , I had to deal with their customer service people.I ordered this item , using the Amazon Prime free shipping program . It arrived right on time . There were three boxes in the shipment , one for the stand , one for the table top , and one for the fence . All three had obviously been dropped , presumably by UPS , on a corner . During assembly , it came to light that the table top was smashed on the corner where it was dropped . I contacted Amazon to return it , and the past 2-1/2 weeks has been a nightmare of really bad customer service . First of all , they sent me a UPS paid return label . For one box , not three . I sent an email and asked for them to fix that . They sent me another one , same deal . I then called customer service . Fast forwarding to today , of the five times i have spoken to the Amazon customer service , on only two of those times have I been able to understand the person on the other end of the phone . The rest of the time , it has been someone with a very heavy accent who mumbled.On the first call , they told me to put the whole thing into one box and send it in a single shipment . I reminded them that it was unlikely that UPS would pick up a box that weighed in excess of 200 pounds . So they said that they would have UPS pick it up at my office . Except that they did n't tell UPS to do so . Call # 3 got them to actually tell UPS to pick it up . At the wrong address , and only one box . Call # 4 got cut off after waiting for 15 minutes to get transferred to a supervisor . Finally , on call # 5 , I talked to a very delightful lady who seemed to understand what needed to be done . We 'll see -- they are supposed to pick it up tomorrow.When the return process first began , they entered a new order for a replacement . It was scheduled to be shipped in June . I ca n't wait that long , so I told them to give me a refund . Sure hope I get it . In the meantime , I bought this router table at the local Woodcraft store . Paid more , but I have the table in my shop now.Now about the Five stars rating for the product itself . This is a really great router table . I gave this review four stars , because Kreg was partly at fault for the damage mine received . If they had designed their packaging better , the damage probably would n't have happened . The padding in the box was a piece of styrofoam 1/4 '' thick and some corrugated cardboard . MDF is not that sturdy . It needs at least 2 '' of foam padding.But the table itself is wonderful . The stand is built like an Abrams tank , and the table is a nice size . The fence works exactly like they say it does . Square and easy to use . So the product gets five starts , Kreg gets four stars , and Amazon gets zero stars for bad customer service.Update 5/7/08 : I 've used the router table quite a bit now . It is still as great as I noted above . I 've started to build cabinets and drawers in the stand below the table top , but find there 's not a lot of room for that . The sawdust collection is pretty good above the table , but the floor quickly gets several inches deep in the stuff that falls through the opening in the top . Part of my cabinet plans below the table include a fix for that.It is now about two weeks after I wrote the above review . Five additional contacts with Amazon just resulted in UPS going to the wrong address again to pick it up . But a conversation with the UPS guy at my office may have broken the stalemate . He said he 'd be back this afternoon to pick it up . Grand total contacts with Amazon customer service are now in excess of ten , and the latest advice of the pickup says I may be charged for the return shipping costs . For a damaged item.Update on 6/25/10 : Now that I 've used this router table for a couple years , I still love it . But , I managed to misplace the two plastic rods that are used to move the left side of the router fence out for special work . I contacted Kreg to buy some new ones . Maybe I am cynical , but I was surprised to have them tell me that they would be happy to send me a new set at no charge . We talked for a few additional minutes and I got some tips on using my router table . Friends , if you do n't have a jointer but find you need one , this table 's for you ! Use those plastic rods to move the left fence forward , put in a long straight-cutting bit , align the left fence with the bit , and you 've got a jointer . Works great . I jointed about 150 linear feet of 8/4 oak and edge-glued it with perfect results . I may still buy a jointer , but that purchase has gone down in priority . Thank you , Kreg , for wonderful customer service and product support.And let me add one more item : Woodpeckers ( [ .. ] , many items sold on Amazon ) sells an aluminum plate to install a Porter Cable 121 portable oscillating spindle sander into a router table . I bought one of the plates and the sander . I now have a table-mounted oscillating spindle sander that is the rival of anything Delta or others sell , without taking up nearly as much of my shop space . Fantastic setup .	1
I was looking for a high quality , well built router table . I searched for quite a while , comparing the various brands , and types . I finally settled on the Kreg Router Table mainly because of the fence system , and the fact that I already own several Kreg tools . This table did not disappoint me at all.Assembly was straightforward , with easy to understand instructions . All of the holes were lined up perfectly , and all of the fasteners were there ( and then some - they included some extras just in case ) .When my table arrived in 3 boxes , the boxes were slightly scuffed up , but everything was in great shape . I was , however , missing the phenolic table insert . All of the fasteners , and adjusters were in the package , but the insert was missing . I had to go through Kreg to get a replacement insert sent to me , and it took about 8 days to get it . They were very good about it , and I am pleased with their response.When assembling the table system , take great care to prevent stripping out the screw holes in the MDF table . Two rules to remember , and the assembly should go without a hitch . Rule # 1 - do not use a power tool to tighten down the screws . Use a hand held screwdriver , and get each screw just snug ( SNUG means the screw head has made contact with the surface , and you use your thumb and index finger to tighten as much as you can . Do NOT try to tighten these screws too tight - they WILL strip if you do ) . Once snug , turn the screw 1/4 turn more , and you 're done . Rule # 2 - this table assembly is heavy once it has been partially assembled . Have a second person to help you lift , and move the table around as you assemble it . Lay the table upside down when attaching the top , and bracing to the stand . This will give you a much better view , and better control . And again - Have someone help you move it around as you assemble it . This thing gets heavy quick ! Once assembled , I did some modifications to mine to better suit my needs , and provide for better storage . I , in essence , created a cabinet with mine ( see photos ) . This helps with the dust collection , and helps keep everything close at hand , while keeping the dust off of everything better.I have a Delta Dust Collection System , and use it for the dust collection . I have found that most shop vacs will be hard pressed to offer very good dust collection on a router . They may work well for the fence port in some instances , but they do not work at all for the main body collection ( all of the saw dust and debris that falls UNDER the router when using a table ) . This part takes some volume , and suction power to work well.This fence system has a hollow cavity , and the dust port is offset from the center of the fence . This takes some pretty strong suction to remove sawdust and debris from the fence area . Most fence systems have a hole that goes straight to the router bit area , and provides very little area to remove dust from . Shop vacs work well for those systems . Not so much on this one .	1
Just purchased this table combo and love it . The stand is super heavy duty . The table is flat and true . The insert plate is easy to get flush on all 4 corners . The fence is exactly 90 degrees to the table top . Micro-dot surface has low friction for easy travel over the router bit . Every thing went together with precision quality . I had a cheaper router table and had to fuss with it to get accuracy , decided to make the old one a work table and get a real router table . This is the trick . Kreg customer service is also very good . I bought this from my local Wood Craft store and the insert plate is the older style ( non-quick turn ) I contacted Kreg and they are sending the most latest version in the mail . Could not ask for more . This router table exceeds my expectations in quality . I was a little disappointed the stand had `` Made in Taiwan '' on it ( even though it is very high quality stand ) , but the rest of the table is made in USA , I believe ? In the end this may be a little more than you want to spend but I ca n't stress the importance of true flat table top that has a 90 degree fence and how hard it is to get that in the low budget models . Get a Kreg you wo n't be disappointed , and you will be helping the US economy .	1
I bought this table along with a milwaukee 3 1/2 hp router and a woodpecker lift . The table is terrific . It is top quality from top to bottom . The assembly was a breeze and the fit and finish are the best . This unit may cost more than some of it 's competitors but it is money well spent . If you are looking for a table this is the way to go .	1
The phenolic plate I screwed up a bit , but other than that , it does everything it 's supposed to and it 's made my routing jobs tons easier . Definitely worth the price , just wish I had a few more lessons to really get the full use out of this beauty ... but in time , I can see myself working it to it 's full potential . Definitely recommended !	1
Once we finally got this table assembled , it 's great . Really love the Kreg products . My only complaint is the assembly instructions . They could have been better and plan on spending about 90 minutes to put this table together , goes faster with two people . Overall , very happy with the table .	1
Very nice table , instructions are good , table itself is extremely solid . Do n't buy the casters , I feel they are overpriced . I just went to Lowes and got some nice casters for $ 5 a piece . The table is set up so that you can actually build an enclosure around it . I made one out of plywood and it came out pretty well . I also purchased the Kreg router table switch and I feel as if you could just use any old switch or power strip in it 's place . The fence comes in very many pieces as stated in a previous review and it is not overly difficult to put together , however you really must fine tune it for accuracy and to your liking once installed . I do n't really buy into the fact that it is being compared to a table saw fence . It is a nice fence but it is n't really one side adjustable . I still use a tape measure when adjusting it.I do think the table is pricey but it is an absolute delight to use and is very heavy duty . I was going to build my own custom table at first until I saw the potential to build 'around ' this table . My whole table is enclosed with doors in the front and a mini dust collector vacuum installed inside all connected to the switch , which I mounted on the right side in the plywood . I paint matched the plywood to the blue , for aesthetics . With casters on the bottom making it easy to move around , I had room underneath the bottom horizontal braces to build a small shelf out of plywood to hold scrap wood , bits , etc.I am using a 1 3/4 Milwaukee router without the base plate and it fit quite well to the mounting plate , with a few adjustments . I have since purchased a Jessem router lift to make changing collets/bits a cinch.By itself , the table is great and simple . The potential to be even better is the reason I bought it . The table really shines and is extremely functional with the different modifications I have made and I am extremely satisfied .	1
I have been using mine for over 2 years now . This was a major upgrade over my Craftsman table top model . If you are reading this you are like me , and use the router as much ( or possibly more ) than the table saw . Absolutely a must have if you are a serious woodworker . If you can swing the cost , I recommend the router lift ( I will rate that seperately ) . I bought mine at a local tool show with all the bells and whistles ( table , casters , lift , on/off switch , and a few other free-bees ) . I also added a dedicated router to it so I do n't have to swap it out ( hey , it was a Christmas present to myself ! ) . Real easy to enclose the stand as there are holes every inch or two . The fence is great , there is nothing that I would change . I compared this side by side with the similar WoodPecker router table , and this one won out . Great investment . I can not believe I waited as long as I did to buy this . Two thumbs up on this one .	1
Ca n't say enough good about this well designed system . I got it with the table and built my own cabinet into it . The top is slick ( literally , the stock slides right over it w/o resistance ) . The fence works very well and the fence slide has a great mm/SAE ruler that is adjustable so you can set the fence with a variety of bit diameters . The table steel is plenty stable , not that cheap angle stuff you get at the hardware store . Not cheap , but I got it to keep my fingers . Do n't get it without the feather board ( get two for the horizontal table top and two for the fence . Oddly , the dust collector seems to work quite well . If you ca n't let it sit in one place then get the wheels , it 's pretty heavy and ungainly ( one of the reasons it 's so stable , I suppose ) .	1
Comes in three boxes . This kit is pretty heavy . Requires assembly but I 'm sure you have tools . For mounting router base you will need a quality counter sinking bit . A 1/2 & # 34 ; deep socket and 6 & # 34 ; # 2 driver bit will be very helpful . Quality is outstanding , It comes with feet but have glue ready as the soles fell off the shoe on every one . I ordered wheels so they will be put aside . I will use a 3 1/4hp router and based on the mass and stability of this unit can expect to do shaper like tasks ! Real asset to the shop . Got it in 2 days with free shipping ! !	1
I love this table . Had a craftsman before so it 's not a fair comparison . Using a dewalt router in a Jessem insert to raise and lower the router by crank . I assembled it by myself ( paralyzed in a wheelchair from the chest down ) . Very easy . I did cut about 4 in . off the legs to make it shorter and built it in to make a cabinet with doors . I recommend the Kreg casters and the Kreg on and off switch . I do n't use the micro adjuster . The table is very sturdy and well made . High quality . I highly recommend .	1
I received this Kreg table as a gift from my Son and have to say it is the nicest and most useful tool I now own . The Quality , Fit and Finish , Precision , Ruggedness and Intuitive Assembly all make this a great addition to the shop . The first thing that I noticed was the weight of the box containing the stand parts . When assembled the heft of the table cries out for the optional locking casters kit . I have a bad back and a small shop ( garage ) and I ca n't have all of my tools in the most useful place all the time , so I have to move things around . Do not worry about the Kreg Casters making the table shaky ; they lock the rollers movement and the swivel firmly in place with one action . I may order more Kreg casters for some of my other tools . This replaces my old DIY table which I have struggled with for years .	1
I 've gone through so many router tables that I 've filled up our local metal disposal plant . However , I finally got a keeper . The main thing about a router table is not the table or the fancy box under it , it 's the TOP OF THE TABLE ! And this one 's really good . Easy to adjust , good grooves for hold downs , nice surface ... what 's there not to like ? I even like the color ! I put a plywood shelf about half way down . I 'm also thinking about boxing it in on the sides and back to catch any saw dust that the vacuum does n't get.I ordered all the bells and whistles with it and glad I did.Oh , one thing . This package is almost 100 pounds . The first time they delivered it via Amazon , it must have come apart in shipping . I only got one of the three pieces . Returned everything and a new supplier via Amazon got it all right . Thanks Amazon for the easy way you solved the problem .	1
This is my first router table , and for the last two weeks I 've been making cabinet doors and wainscoting like a professional . While the fence is not quite like that of a saw table as suggested in Kreg 's video , the point is that both sides move in unison even though you must lock the fence on two sides . ( No big deal . ) I ca n't imagine trying to square both sides independently . That brings up the microadjuster , which unfortunately is sold separately instead of being bundled . With the fence and the microadjuster , you really can make precise cuts that are accurate beyond 64ths . In making the transition from rough carpentry to cabinet making , I 've found that you have to at least double your precision . This is a game of 64ths , not 16ths , and the Kreg table allows for this without taking up valuable time . Attaching the router to the plate is daunting , and you really should use a drill press to make holes for your router screws , though I succeeded without one by using a portable drill with a level and proceeding with care . I have made coping cuts primarily by using a coping sled , but I have made square cuts using the miter slot . This is easy because the fence squares in unison and is parallel to the miter slot . Moreover , because you can precisely level the router plate with the four levelers , everything -- sleds , wood , jigs -- slide across the table top . ( I test for level by running a business card across the top until it catches on nothing . ) Thanks to the metal stand and the table top , my 3.5hp router from Milwaukee does not shake the system when it runs at max . speed . I wish Kreg would do more of the fence assembly , but anyone seeking to move away from IKEA furniture and beadboard wainscoting should be willing to invest the time . If you do n't try to assemble the system with power tools/speed ratchets or pretend that plastic is steel , you wo n't break anything . And the power to create precise , raised paneled cabinets and wainscoting DYI will not only prevent your kitchen and library remodeling from resembling a bad episode of Renovation Realities , it will allow you to make real hardwood stuff that will put the plywood/mdf professionals to shame .	1
I put this on my 5 year old Jet contractor saw . It promptly noticibly improved the smoothness of the saw . Especially as the saw starts up and shuts down , but also when at speed.I bought the 4 foot version and had to remove two segments to get a fit . It was very easy to install . I also noted that the old belt was in visually perfect condition when I removed it.I think this is a nice/useful improvement for any belt drive saw .	1
With thirty-five nearly all positive reviews I was wondering what I could say that would add to them . Well , this is what I came up with : The biggest most positive thing I can think of ( that no one else has yet mentioned ) is that this belt will not `` flat spot '' if allowed to sit unused for a period of time . Add to that the other attributes that other reviewers HAVE mentioned and you have one really neat little piece of engineering here.My neighbor has a Delta table saw and the first time I helped him use it the weather was cold . Add to that , his saw sits more often than not . When he turned it on after weeks of not being used it vibrated terribly . He said that it would settle down `` after a while , after it warmed up . '' Well it did ... and it didn't.To make a long story short , after assembling my Jet I put the factory belt on and ran the saw a few times . It had a vibration too with it 's brand NEW belt ! After it sat for a few days unused ( hey , it was Christmas time ) the vibration got worse . Since I had always intended to try the Power Twist on it it seemed as if there were no time like the present , so I ordered one before I 'd had to do ANY important cuts with the saw.First of all it was cold when I tried to size the belt and so it was n't that easy . On the other hand it was n't that difficult either , but I did need to use pliers . And , you have to get your bearings straight . This is a different animal than your standard v-belt ... I liken it to those link belts we all made at summer camp or in some craft class somewhere . Mine came with no intructions at all . 'A disappointment for sure , but I was able to download them.My other complaint is that the directional arrows printed on the links are very hard to see . A `` Sharpie '' helped out a lot . Anyway , after some trial and error I was able to size the belt correctly and install it . As others have said , my saw will EASILY pass the nickel test , and my neighbor ca n't figure out why my cheap Jet runs so much smoother than his much more expensive Delta . Do n't worry , he 's a Buddy and I 'll clue him in soon enough . But for now , I just want to enjoy his frustration and confusion . I know , I 'm bad , but it feels so good to know that just 30 bucks can make such a difference ! ! If they offered these in the narrower , `` O/3L '' cross section , I would have one on my cheapy , Made in China drill press too . Do n't judge me too harshly about this one . I 'm on a budget ! ! ( edit : They do ! ! After much time spent researching I found out from the manufacturer , Fenner Drives that McMaster Carr carries them , though the price a bit higher than Amazon , but worth it . ) As I said in another review ( of my saw ) Do n't ASK , just BUY ONE ! ! You WO N'T be sorry ... unless of course you put in on backward or something dumb like that . It IS a `` directional '' belt.As usual , I hope you find this review helpful , and Good Luck with your own dreams .	1
I have been sold on this product for several years . I installed one on my contractor style table saw and it truly reduced the vibration to a minimal amount because of the lack of set in the belt . It truly does work . I was initially disappointed because it was noiser at first , however , after running the belt for a couple of minutes it broke in and was as quiet as the OEM belt . Now I have a saw that is quiet and has minimal vibration . I have showed this belt to several of my buddies and they have ALL purchased one for their saws .	1
The extent to which this V-belt improved my table saw 's performance is significant , and much higher than expected . When people say that the vibration is reduced with this belt - they mean it is eliminated ! At least in my case with a Jet 10 '' contractor 's table saw . The blade seems to get up to speed much faster , has ZERO vibration while running , cuts smoother , is MUCH quieter , and shuts down much faster than it ever did with the OEM belt . This is by far the 2nd best upgrade I have made to my table saw , next to the blade - A Forrest Woodworker II .	1
are you buying or do you own a contractors saw ? ok , then , here is your first accessory . probably the cheapest upgrade you will ever find . looks kinda hookie , but i dont argue with performance .	1
This V-Belt works exceptionally well , contrary to my common sense . I still do n't understand why a V-belt with a bunch of links produces less vibration than a standard smooth V-Belt , but it does.While I did n't notice much of a reduction in vibration at operating speed , the reduction in vibration as the speed of the motor moved through the 'harmonic ' frequencies was substantial.I use a 10 '' Delta Contractor 's saw . I was considering upgrading to a cabinet saw but there is no reason to . I am using a Woodworker II blade with stiffener and this V-belt . I can do the penny test -- stand a penny ( not a nickel , but a penny ! ) on it 's side and then start the saw . The penny remains standing on its side through complete on/off cycles . Impressive .	1
I installed this belt after it was recommended to me . I assumed there would be some difference but I thought it would be more of something that happend in the background so I did n't have any real expectation of noticing a big difference on the face of it all . I actually did n't know what to expect.I was so surprized at the difference this made in my Jet contractors saw that I was hypnotized by it . I bought one for my bandsaw at the time of purchase as well as my jointer.Eliminates pulley/motor vibration . Quiets my machines . I actually think it either creates a pleasant whirring sound or eliminates the slapping stiff belt sound and what I 'm hearing is really the whir of the blades.I think steel pulleys would be a good idea as well , but i was told that this belt usually can make the bigger difference as long as the aluminum pulleys are ok to begin with .	1
When I bought my cheap Harbor Freight table saw ( these used to be sold by Craftsman for almost twice the price ) I knew better than to expect to do a nickel test . When I finished tuning it , finally getting the blade square and pulley 's aligned , it was still a 'nickel launcher ' rather than anything you could consider smooth . I took off the drive belt and took a closer look and found that it was about 30 % thicker at the splice.So I KNEW the PTP would help ... KNEW it would solve much of the problem . And it did ... beautifully . I doubt it would start and stop with a nickel standing on it ( at 3hp it snaps to life ) but there 's no vibration now while it 's running.BUT BEWARE : I bought my PTP in spring , but in Texas , without air conditioning , it 's not very enticing to work in my shop during the hottest part of the summer , so I tend to only rush in and out to do small jobs . I walked in the other day and found I 'd left the blade all the way up , which leaves full tension on the belt , and since the motor is heavy and spring loaded , it had stretched the belt and was sitting at the bottom of the range . I lowered the blade height and oops ... no blade spin.Soooo , I took the belt off and removed a link and she 's good as new , but I 'll have to remember to run the blade all the way down each time so it does n't happen again ! I 'm horrible at remembering to detension my bandsaw as well , so I 'm predicting it will happen again.Do n't get me wrong , I 'm still happy as can be with the little marvel of a belt and will buy them anytime I have a v-belt causing trouble . I just wanted to pass on this one caution to the other users down in the hot hot summerlands . Good luck and happy woodworking ! Ed	1
I have a bandsaw which has allways had some serious vibration . Finally tried this belt on it , and was shocked what a difference it made . Definitely worth every penny . I was sceptical at first , but am a believer now .	1
I purchased this belt in hopes of removing the wobble on my table saw , after research pointed me in this direction . Well I 'm a true believer now . The table saw passes the 'nickel on edge ' test with flying colors . I would recommend this product to anyone who has a table saw that has a slight annoying wobble .	1
I bought the Powertwist Plus V-Belt to replace the auto belt that came with my Jet Contractor Saw . I have owned the saw for a year , but had just seen this product a few weeks ago . I had just upgraded to a Forrest blade and was disappointed in the blades performance as far as getting a smooth glue line rip that all the reviewers were raving about . I though my saw was a bit loud and vibrated a lot and it was recommended to me to try this V-Belt . I thought $ 6 a foot was a bit high for a V-Belt , but if it worked it would be worth it . It took me less than five minutes to take the old auto belt off , adjust the Powertwist V-Belt to length and install it . When I first turned on the machine I just started laughing with joy . Literally NO VIBRATION ! ! ! I could not believe it ( Now , keep in mind my tablesaw in all other aspects is leveled just under perfection using Incra guaranteed squares and Stabila levels ) . I ran some wood through and now I have a smooth glue line rip . I now understand why people rave about Forrest blades and the PowerTwist V-Belt so much . They really do work ! ! ! !	1
I had a new 8 '' jointer that was relatively smooth . However , at times , and only while pushing wood across the jointer , I 'd feel a little rocking motion . I 'd tried these belts before , on a drill press , and knew they 'd made a big difference there . So , I bought a set of these from Amazon and put them on my jointer , and voila ! The vibration is gone.They 're easy to put on and resize , too.It 's truly hard to conceive that some of the vibrations felt on certain pieces of equipment are coming from the belts . In the case of my drill press , for instance , it was a last resort ... I 'd tried everything else first ( measuring for runout , etc. ) . Yet , the problem what apparently the joint in my old black nylon belts . Do yourself a favor and try these belts BEFORE you spend a lot of time looking for the problem elsewhere . They 're an upgrade in almost every case ! They 're not cheap , but if they solve your problem and improve your machine , they 're worth it ! Be safe !	1
The guy who thought these things up should be given the Nobel Prize in wood in engineering . Incredibly practical . User friendly . Adaptability is almost limitless . Love 'm .	1
After reading about these belts in a bunch of woodworking magazine articles , I decided to add one to my JET table saw . I was already pretty pleased with the low vibration in my saw , but this belt still gave me noticable improvement ! With this belt installed and a couple of cast iron wings mounted , I can easily pass the standing nickel test.Another plus was that I have quite a few `` links '' left over after I sized the belt to fit my saw . Since I plan to add these belts to all my machines eventually , the extra links will come in handy down the road ... Overall , this is a great product at a fair price .	1
Eliminated the vibration from the cheap Chinese belt . A snap to size and install . Well worth the expense and the extra links are saved for possible repair .	1
These belts are great when you have a shaft that precludes belt removal without dismantling the whole machine . Solves vibration problems too .	1
It may seem silly that a stupid little v-belt could make a difference in your machine use , but brother , it does ! I have an older 10-inch Craftsman table saw that I was upgrading . In addition to installing a real fence system ( as opposed to that which came with the saw ) I upgraded the motor to 2hp.After putting the motor on and running it , it cut much better , but there was still a good bit of noise and vibration . Going a step further , I replaced the cheap cast pulleys with machined , cast iron pulleys and installed the Power Twist v-belt . What a world of difference ! Not only were the vibrations reduced to where the old `` stand a nickel on its edge on the table '' test worked , I could actually stand being in the same room as the saw without hearing protection ( yes , I always wear it anyways ) .I thought that the price seemed high when I bought it , but it is a better value than I ever imagined . Buy one , you will never go back .	1
Thought this book would be chock full of great projects for use with my Kreg Jig , instead , it 's chock full of ugly projects . On the other hand , for someone with little or no experience in building , this book is well written with some right to the point info to get a beginner started .	-1
This light is useless for reading in bed next to someone . Even the one bulb lights up the entire room and blinds you with the reflective light from the book/kindle . It 's going to be great for camping , ghost hunting and the like , but you have to put a cover over it to read by . Maybe I should have read the `` MIGHTY '' part of the Mighty Bright .	-1
These seem abnormally sized for the type of fixture they 're supposed to be mounted in . I had to manually clip the prongs to fit all the fixtures I tried them in . Seeing as how they 're branded for a G8 base you 'd think they 'd fit in G8 bulb sockets ... But , they were fixable with some elbow grease .	-1
These burn out really fast . I buy them because they 're cheap and it 's more cost effective to change the bulbs all the time , but some of them last like 3-4 weeks .	-1
Two bulb legs broke off two of them , as I was soldering them into the board . Ridiculous . Other than that , the remainder worked fine .	-1
I have two of these lights . One works better than the other . Neither is a good asNewhouse Lighting NHCLP-LED-BLK 3-watt Energy-efficient Clamp LED Lamp , Black , which is also available at Amazon for a few dollars more . The problems with this lamp : The clamps do n't hold well . I had to try several different locations before I got the lamp to stay where I wanted it.The gooseneck is too flimsy . It is hard to keep the light where you want it.The LED light is a bit harsh in a dark room where this is the only light and you are reading . ( Is n't that what this is for ? ) The lamp also shares a common problem with many devices like this . The transformer that converts household current into the low voltage used by the LEDs is at the very end of the power cord . When you plug it into the power outlet , it blocks not only the one you plug it into , but the one next to it . I had to use a power strip to plug in two lamps , and lost four spaces instead of two . There is an alternative design , putting the transformer in the middle of the cord , that avoids this problem . Maybe that costs more , and price seems to be the major differentiation between different products like this.Do yourself a favor and get the Newhouse Lamp instead of this one .	-1
I purchased this for my son to use while hes doing his school work and reading in bed . The good thing is that he can use it on his desk and his bed via the headboard . The arch neck sometimes just falls so it doesnt hold that arch for long periods of time could be cheaply made . Another issue that we noticed was that the light would get hot , equivalent to an incandescent . I purchased this because it was LED and it seemed like it was durable . I think it should be in the 15 dollar range or less , not worth over that ... .	-1
I really liked this until it failed.If it had lasted more than a few weeks , I would have bought a carton of them .	-1
My desk lamp was a bust . Imagine my surprise when shopping Amazon for a new one to find the same IKEA lamp that went bust for me with a lot of reviewers experiencing the same problem I had . I thought I had a bad lamp and waited too long to return it but evidently , the problem with the cord is an IKEA design issue.I loved this lamp -- as long as it worked . It has a weighted base , very flexible neck and nice bright LED light on a small head . But it was n't too long after using it that the bulb started to dim . Initially , if you toggled the switch , it would brighten back up.But eventually , there was nothing that could be done to find that sweet spot . I tried taking the switch apart to see if it was wired badly but the switch is glued together and could n't be taken apart.So now I have a lamp that I love in style and functionality , that does n't work , and I 'm having trouble finding a reasonably priced replacement that matches up to the size/style . Bummer . I agree , IKEA should be recalling this since so many are having the same trouble .	-1
Porter Cable has a design flaw with the trigger locking switch . To use this in a router table , your must lock the trigger on and use a switch located on top of the router to turn it on . The problem is the switch lock breaks easily and the router will not function properly . I found this out the first time I used it in my table and sent it away to be fixed . After the fix , the repair lasted 20 minutes . I am now looking for another router to use in my table . I will only use the 7529 for hand held applications where I constantly hold down the trigger myself . Porter Cable should have a recall on this . I am not the only person with this problem . I posted my problem on a tool chat room and other woodworkers shared the same story . If you want to use this router for a router table , get another router . Save yourself the trouble .	-1
I bought this router shortly after it was introduced thinking it was the next best thing since sliced bread . Man was I wrong ! For handheld use , it is stiff , cumbersome , and unbalanced . It 's worse in a router table , which was the main reason I bought it . I thought the second power switch would be handy for table use , except you have to lock the handle switch in the on position . And in order to do that , I had to tape mine just so the switch would lock into place . The height adjustment is a pain to work with . Overall , this is one of the worse routers I have used . If you want a router for a router table , spend the extra money and step up to a 3 HP router	-1
I could not believe that the PC teck said that plunge routers all have play in the shaft . The right side has such play that you can tilt the router base by applying pressure to one side even when locked and he said this is normal ! I have a RE600 Ryobi that is solid in all positions . I tested the DeWalt621 and with one post it was solid . The depth adjustment is also very hard to set , you have to turn it many revolutions to get it to adjust . The dust shield falls off easily . I returned it after one day .	-1
I was very disappointed with Porter Cable . The plunge mechanism sticks , the on button is hard to lock on for router table use , the depth gauge is extremely hard to use , and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories . Mine is sitting on a shelf . In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router . It is lighter , has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around . I love my DeWalt 621 . I wish I had bought it first .	-1
I prefer brass . The Porter Cable guides are fine , they install easily , center easily , and perform flawlessly , , Most of the time . Just once in a while though , they fail completely . Steel , no matter how you protect it , will eventually corrode . Mine turned white and rusted , not all over , but on one side or the other . My guides often get removed from the case and hauled out to the job-sites while attached to the router . Early , foggy mornings and those sudden summer-time cloud bursts , expose my tools to far more of the elements than I like . So maybe , , it 's my fault . But brass just has n't let me down yet.Search `` brass template guide set '' and be amazed at the difference in price and the fact of the quality of these `` no-brand '' guides . Occasionally you may need to shine them up a little , but being solid brass , that 's not a big problem . I 've used both steel and brass on door hinge templates , dovetail templates , stair tread templates and strike plate templates . Brass just slides easier , smoother . On dovetail templates , especially plastic and soft aluminum the brass guides show less wear on the surfaces that the guides contact.I 'm sorry P.C . , , , I ca n't recommend these guides.I saw a review with a problem , the steel guides were too long and reached past the bottom of the dovetail template . With brass you can simply file the guide down to size to get the right length . Simple .	-1
Porter Cable 42000 Template Guide KitI 've had a 42000 template guide kit since the mid 1990 's . The set works OK , but my advice is to buy another brand . The P/C kit comes in a cheap & fragile hard plastic case that must have cost all of ten cents to make and the components are held in place with inexpensive cardboard separators . In addition , after a dozen years or so , every component in my set had corroded terribly -- the metal looked similar to very old aluminum storm windows , pits and all . It 's not clear why this happened , since they 've never been outside the basement workshop , and no other tools corroded . The corrosion caused significant resistance when screwing on the lock-nuts . Steel wool reduced the roughness of the corrosion , but the pieces still look dreadful.The three largest guides in the P/C set are too long for numerous dovetail jigs , such as the Leigh jig . It 's possible to modify them to work with these jigs , by hack-sawing the excess length off the offending guides , flatten the cut end on a grinder and sanding the edge smooth . A no-cost approach.If you want steel guides , the Milwaukee 's 49-54-0700 set comes with a nice case , and the steel finish looks a whole lot better than P/C 's . Unfortunately , the three largest guides in the Milwaukee set are also too long for many dovetail jigsIn any case , brass is a better material for guides than steel , because brass is easier on a rotating router bit if it ever touches a guide . Once , near a day 's end of routing doors for hinges , my template 's locking ring came loose , allowing the guide to touch the spinning bit , and the locking ring to rub against the router-bit lock nut . Since the guide and ring were brass , no noticeable damage to the bit or router occurred . Had I been using any steel template with a steel locking ring , the bit or router could have been damaged . Try `` brass router template '' via Goggle - and buy a kit made of solid brass , in a decent case , for less money than this set .

I have other Porter Cable products that work well . The quality & design of this edge guide shocked me . It could have easily had more than an additional 2 '' of travel with a simple design change . Or you could shorten the beam by 2 '' and have the same usable travel with a design change . The pins that adapt it to the router are .014 '' under size and the spread between the mounting holes on the router are .025 '' more on the base than on the pin location on the edge guide . Now when you tighten the screws to fasten the router to the edge guide , they will cant the pins so they are not clamped parallel to the holes . This is shoddy quality control . Even the screws are an obsolete size which has n't been used much for more than 25 years . The screw size by the way is # 12-24 . Most think it is a 5mm , but it is not . I make the assumption they got an extremely good price on these obsolete screws . These damned screws if you can find them are over $ 2 per screw at a place that sells parts for this edge guide online . That does n't even consider the cost of shipping and handling . My qualifications are : I have worked in the tool and die trade for 46 years . I have been a supervisor for more than 25 of those years . I have been involved with the design and fabrication of many things that have complexity far beyond this simple edge guide.I would n't be so irritated if the company had the courtesy to respond to my Email , but I have waited since 1/7/2008 and seen nothing except a automatic reply on 1/7/2008 telling me I would get an answer within a few days . This has never arrived . I rate it as a 1-star only because I have the skills to make it more usable.I have but one way to deal with complacent companies such as this who seem to have a screw you attitude with customers . I will simply never purchase another of their products.The following is the Email I sent to them : Where do I contact someone to talk about problems with quality control and design flaws concerning my Porter Cable Router , Bases and Edge Guide ? I was a practicing machinist , toolmaker , shop supervisor and was involved with design engineering in a research facility for over 46 years until I retired a year ago.I would like to talk to someone who is willing to listen seriously with an open mind and correct some problems . I also have a few questions I 'd like to ask from someone involved with design.I just spent the last hour making precision measurements and find it hard to believe what I discovered.12/21/2009Since I wrote this review , I have never received a response from this company . I 've concluded I have no use for a company that does n't respond to a customer 's legitimate request . I wo n't be purchasing any of their products in the future.S Schultz	-1
I bought this sander and tried it on a group of pine butt jointed boards . It is too unstable . It tends to tip at the slightest opportunity towards the motor side . Even a slight pressure on the back causes a gash in your work . I spent more time removing scrapes and gashes than smoothing my work . Very frustrating . I am going to try a different brand as the others seemed to be more stable in the store and did n't tip so easily .	-1
Received it for a Christmas gift and it sat in my shop for a year . Recently I needed it to sand a counter top I was building , so out it came from the tool cabinet . I cut the plastic bands from the box , hooked up the dust bag , adjusted the tracking and started sanding . In about 15 minutes the sander began to slow down and sparks were shooting from the brushes . I also was getting an electrical shock from the trigger . I check the Internet for solutions and decided to change the brushes . It destroyed 2 sets of brushes and sparks were still shooting out of the motor . This sander is a piece of crap and I think the dust collection is garbage . The entire motor housing was filled with saw dust when I was sanding . I 'm really starting to doubt the quality of porter cable tools . For $ 200 dollars , I think their quality control should be a lot better . I think I might try a makita next time . Always try a new power tool when you get it before you put it away . Lesson learned .	-1
I have a lot of Porter Cable tools , and I 'm one of the company 's biggest fans . I love their routers , their circular saws , their biscuit joiner , and I have them all . But this is without a doubt the worst value in a tool ever.Here 's what 's good about the kit:1 ) The profiles are handy when not attached to the sanderHere are the problems:1 ) First of all , the profiles never REALLY fit what you 're sanding , so there 's always a point early-on during the sanding where the aggressive action of the sander wears right through the sandpaper and you start leaving black rubber streaks on your material ( the profile is now rubbing the wood directly ) .2 ) The machine is not smooth.3 ) It 's noisy.4 ) The profiles wo n't stay in the holder . They fall out.5 ) PSA paper ( uses adhesive ) . Not much fun.So ... there 's my opinion . I consistently rate this as the worst purchase I ever made as far as tools go . Save yourself some money and buy the profiles separately . All by themselves , they 're usable . Attached to the aggressive sander , they last about 3 minutes before you 're burning rubber.Sorry , PC ... I would have loved to have said something more positive !	-1
This thing is too big to work with and awkward to hold . The profile holders come off the machine during use and the adhesive paper does n't hold to them well . The H & amp ; L paper work well on the triangle foot , but you can get something easier to user for a lot less money . All in all you need something smaller , lighter and with ( wire or other ) clambs to hold the paper .	-1
This is a very heavy constructed piece of equipment . It feels good in your hand , although it feels twice as heavy as my Bosch , which means that you do n't have to apply any pressure to sand as the weight of the machine does a good job of that . The vibration is substantially less than my Bosch , but it gets so hot that you can only use it a few minutes before you have to let it cool down for 20 minutes . I tried to use it longer , thinking that it would reach a peak and I could bear that , but that is not the case , it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter . It would be good for frying eggs , and making coffee .	-1
Works nice when it works , which is not very often.I 've had 3 separate failures in 3 years of occasionalhobbyist use . I have now spent more on ordering partsfor this POS than I spent on the original sander .	-1
I am very disappointed with this sander . I thought it would work great for sanding large table tops . Instead I have found that a large belt sander ( 4x24 ) followed by a finishing sander does a much better and quicker job . I have the Porter Cable 4x24 sander and the Porter Cable 330 finishing sander .	-1
This sander is great in the beginning . It works like a well built machine , and then , it happens . For some reason , this thing gets out of balance and ceases to do a good job . It wobbles all over the place . My shop owns 6 of these that were all bought at the same time , now after one year of daily use , 4 of them are unusable because of the counter-balance.PROS** Can apply alot of pressure** Very strongCONS** Gets out of balance** Brushes hard to change** 2 hand sander	-1
PC 97366 has so much vibrations that I had to give it gift to my enemy.. Horrible ... then within a week , I got a Xmas Gift of Home Depot Card and I used it to buy Rigit Sander from Home Depot for $ 139 ... ( I SAID , I CAN RETURN IT IF I DO N'T LIKE IT ) WHAT A SURPIRISE THEN ... THE RIGID IS SUPREME SANDER WITH ZERO PAIN IN HAND AND AWESOME GERMAN BUILT ... GREAT BUILD QUALITY AND 3 YEAR WARRANTY ... YOU CA N'T MISS THAT ... I CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD RIGID SANDERS ARE ... BYE PORTER CABLE ...	-1
To make something out of what appears to be a hard plastic type of material , then mount it on something that does random orbits and except it to last is like mixing oil and water.Got tired of replacing these pads , the cost adds up quick , figured there had to be a better way . Came up with a method that works very good so thought I would share the idea.What I did was to get a small piece of metal , for me I used what is called a Simpson Strong Tie . This is a piece of rectangular metal with many holes in it . Is used in construction to hold boards together by nailing the plate across the joint . Found these to be both cheap and tough enough to last and thin enough not to cause problems.Simply cut it to fit the circular base , small enough not to block the vacuum holes . Marked and drilled holes just large enough for the mounting screws . Using JB Weld , attached this cut out to the hook and loop base . When the epoxy was set up good enough , mounted the pad back onto the sander letting it sit 24 hours before using.The metal will make the pad last a long time and will not egg shape like the plastic does.Works very well ! !	-1
While this trimmer might be fine for quick roundovers and the like , it lacks the refinement and precision necessary for fine woodworking and production work . Careful observers will notice that the base and motor are not perfectly perpendicular to one another . There is too much slop in the height adjustment mechanism and set knob . Too , the base itself is not perfectly flat ( place a sheet of 400 grit sandpaper on a flat table and run the base plate over it a few times . High and low spots will quickly become apparent . ) All in all , the 7310 is very underwhelming in its quality and precision . As far as the & quot ; Rotozip & quot ; style trimmers go , the DeWalt and Bosch models offer better quality and refinement then this PC , though they , too , suffer from some of the same problems.By far the better alternative is the tried-and-true Porter Cable 310 production router . This model has long been a favorite of professional cabinetmakers ( the guys in my shop own two or three each ) , but it is somewhat unknown to the woodworking public at large . It is not made for mass market consumers ( Home Depot/Lowes do n't carry it ) , and PC has instead promoted the 7310 trimmer as its mainstay trim router . The 7310 trimmer , however , is but a shadow of the 310 . Read some of the reviews on the 310 and you 'll see what I mean . The 310 is truly a fine machine . At $ 100 , the 7310 is not a great value . At $ 159 , the 310 is worth every penny . Spend more now and you 'll be very satisfied with the knowledge that you own the very best . More importantly , your work will show the wisdom of your choice.Sadly , Porter Cable no longer sells the excellent offset , angle , and other optional bases for the 310 . If you need these you can acquire them used or new-old-stock , but they are getting harder to find . The premium prices of these trimmers and optional bases found on Ebay attest to the loyal following the 310 has . These bases are available for the 7310 , but you will still have to deal with the inferior design and quality of that trimmer . Again , go with the DeWalt or Bosch if you need a complete trim kit with all the bases . If you do n't need them , get the 310 and you 'll be set for life . You 'll be glad you did .	-1
The bulbs that came with our flashlites lasted for 2 years , these bulbs lasted for 2 weeks . I was shocked to see HD getting $ 9.99 for 1 bulb so i tried these . I do n't know what is different , but the $ 9.99 bulb is still working .	-1
My local big box store sold me this bulb for my Porter Cable 18v Lithium Flashlight ( model PCL-180FL ) . After about one half hour of continuous use the flashlight stopped working . Upon opening up the lens holder I discovered the bulb had melted through the bulb holder . Fortunately , the Porter Cable service rep took pity on me and is mailing me replacement parts so I can fix my flashlight . None the less , before buying this bulb , make sure it is truly compatible with your flashlight or you may end up destroying your flashlight . The correct bulb for the Porter Cable 18v series of flashlights ( e.g . PCL-180FL and PCL-18FL ) is a KPR 18v 0.3amp krypton bulb ( Porter Cable part number # 90534275 ) .Ultimately what Porter Cable/Dewalt ( they are the same company ) need to do is release an LED conversion kit for their flashlights .	-1
These were thrown in the bottom of a much larger box of other items . They were shattered . Completely worthless and not worth my time to mess around with returning them . Pain in the but . Should have just bought them at lowes or HD . Do n't but these from amazon . They have n't figured out how to package delicate products yet .	-1
Normally I love Dewalt tools but this thing is worthless . Imagine the light produced by a $ 2 flashlight you buy at a grocery store , and from an 18 volt lithum battery ? I ended up just throwing it in the garbage .	-1
bought to work on my car in a dark garage . The battery base hardly gets the lamp on it 's feet unless you have a long irregular surface . there 's one spot on my engine ( over the fuse box ) where it can stand.even then , the wire that holds the light up does NOT support the weight . i 'm always having to leave the cable in a weird position so it does not succumb . it 's very frustrating . the reach of the arm is practically zero as i always have to leave the lamp dropped somewhere . it can never be raised on the metal arm.Look at the pictures . see that the ONLY pic with the lamp raised it 's almost vertical ? that 's the ONLY position the arm will hold . deviate one degree and it falls to the floor in slow motion.i 'm now using it as an expensive lantern around the house for when the lights goes out .	-1
march 23rd this scroll saw will be 1 year old , machine is making knocking sound . have to bring it in to service center . this machine for the price should last years under mild use . this machine lasted under a year with only about 2 months of total use . Not happy .	-1
It had it for 5 weeks before it just quit completely . I brought to the local Dewalt repair center per Dewalts service center recommendation . After waiting 2 weeks for it to be repaired , I called them and they said they had to send it off to the factory and it would be another week . After another week they said it would be another week so I called Dewalt to ask how long it should take and they said it was between me and the service center . I asked if they would call and find out what was going on and they said no . I asked what a resonable time frame for repair was and they said 2 to 3 weeks but it was up to the service center if they would issue a new one to me . I got the number to the factory and they said another week . I notice on the box it says made in Tawian and not Canada , so I am guessing even if I do n't get it for another few weeks I mightg as well wait since they will all have problems because of low production quality in Tawian . Every tool I have ever bought from them in the last two years except my router has quit working , I think I will quit buying thier products.My problem has been resolved by Dewalt they are sending me a new unit .	-1
This DeWalt light came with a scroll saw/light/stand package deal at another website . The light looks great and mounts quickly , but that is where the excitement ends . The gooseneck is far too weak to support its own heavy head weight given the mounting location on the saw , and how horizontal the light needs to be to reach the work area.We ended up supporting the light halfway down the gooseneck by using two zip ties to secure the gooseneck to the upper saw arm . We used a piece of foam between the gooseneck and the saw arm to prevent vibration and paint damage . Taking this weight off helped , but is tacky looking . Considered mounting it to the saw stand for a more vertical mount , but then it would be in the way of large work pieces.The on/off switch has a nice snap and weight to it , so it feels like it will last . We are using this saw/light in a room with poor lighting . The bulb is plenty bright . The head/bulb gets pretty hot . In the right position to prevent shadows , your forehead is pretty darn close to the light , but its fine.If you bought your DeWalt scroll saw without a light , and you 're looking for a light now , look elsewhere until DeWalt finds a better Chinese supplier . The current light is not up to snuff for this application.UPDATE : 1/27/2010 HEY DEWALT - LISTEN UP ! I did this review without looking at the other reviews . Just ran across the review and decided to read the others . To my astonishment the reviews have not changed in 10 years . DeWalt , that is just pathetic . How many more of these lights do you need to sell to get rid of the batch you had made in China 10 years ago ? Enough already , do your customers a favor and throw the whole lot away and find a better light . Is this why I got the light 'free ' in a package deal with the stand ( nice stand ) , so I ca n't complain because I got it free ? Well , this product number still has your name attached does n't it ? It is obviously a problem , you know about it , manage the issue.Shoppers - until you hear from someone that DeWalt has replaced this light , steer clear unless you get it 'free ' . If free , then you can do the zip tie thing or figure something else out to make it work ok .	-1
I 'm dumbfounded that after all of these years , DeWalt still has n't corrected the ongoing problem with the flexible neck being too wimpy to hold up the light for very long . I thought , jeez the most recent review looks to be 2011 , there should be an improvement by now ... lol , nope . I finally removed the thing , got one of those magnetic base work lights with a stiffer goose neck , stuck it to the DeWalt metal stand , problem solved for now . I may try mounting the Dewalt light directly to the stand by drilling two holes , bolt it down and orient the goose neck vertical instead of horizontal ... it might possilbly bear the weight of the lamp better and not sag .	-1
I guess its my fault , I bought a new DeWalt scroll saw and figured since the saw got 4 and 5 star reviews the light was safe to buy . I was wrong . I attached this light to my saw and it will not hold its position . There are reviews going back all the way to 2006 with this issue and DeWalt still has not corrected the problem , I am losing faith in the company named DeWalt , it 's bad enough they are being ran by the same people who run Black and Recker , but DeWalt had always seemed to build a quality product , but since they made Porter Cable a second or third tier tool company it seems DeWalt may be on the same path as PC is on . It 's a shame , too few real companies own too many tool company names . They have eliminated their competition by buying them up and keeping their name , so today you have 5 or 6 tool lines being built in the same factory coming down the same Chinese assembly line . They seem to have sacrificed quality and workmanship to save a buck or two so they can sell their tools in the Big Box stores . DeWalt and Porter Cable use to be top of the line tool companies , a tool you could buy for a little extra cash but would last forever , not anymore .	-1
My last Dewalt scroll saw work light was everything I could ask for and had no problem ordering another one 3 years later . This one looks exactly the same but the flexible neck does not want to stay in any position but straight for more than a few seconds . Somehow they must have changed materials or specifications and got it way wrong . I will have to make modifications to the saw to try and improve the function of the light . Needless ot say I was disappointed based on the performance of the one from 3 years ago .	-1
Overall , this is an `` ok '' light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this . The light 's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the `` up and over '' position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work . That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in ( why does it have to be so tight fitting ? ) ; I like a lot of light around my projects , and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project .	-1
Just sent this light back . Did n't even get to the plug it in and turn it on part . The flex neck is so weak it ca n't even hold the fixture up . Might as well use a table light . Searching for a new fixture now .	-1
I own multiple DeWalt products ( Drills , Table Saws , etc . ) and have had great experiences with them all ... .that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw . Love the saw , hate the lamp . The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration . Further , unless you are working in pitch black , the provided light bulb does n't provide ample work light , that is if you can screw it in . The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight , it is almost impossible to change . What a let down . I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher ... ..	-1
I bought two of these but Dewalt designed them and the saw poorly.Holes on both sides of the saw are in the exact same place so when you put in both , they can only be pushed in half way , so they stick out.They also fit sloppy , not something I would expect from Dewalt.What they should have done is offset the holes so they could be pushed in for storage . Other saws do this , its not hard.Other than that , they work fine .	-1
Ok I admit it , I misread the advertisement and thought I was buying a pair ( set ) of extensions . For the price , I feel one extension set is a rip-off and DeWalt should consider selling a set at a price somewhere between $ 32 for 1 set but certainly not $ 64 for 2 sets ( list price is $ 88 for 2 sets ) .One set is useless when , for example , sawing crown moldings or similar instances . Nobody wants to keep switching the extension back and forth .	-1
These extension wings will be fine if you want them permanently mounted on your saw . I returned them because they are not easily removeable for saw storage . My Hitachi saw has similar wings that slide in and out with one top mounted set screw , the Dewalt requires mounting from beneath the saw and are not made to install and remove readily , so I returned the items.I decided on the Porter-Cable PC136MS Universal Mobile Miter Stand for my DW716 miter saw . The Porter-Cable stand is well worth the money and Amazon has is for less than I paid and shipping is free . The stand is excellent . I also used separate roller stands for support for my 20-foot long 2x8 's I was cutting .	-1
If you think that you actually need these things then you probably need more skills not more tools . I found them to be awkward to work with ( especially when working with several moldings at once ) and completely unnecessary .	-1
For every pound of sawdust created , this maybe captures an ounce . What 's up with that ? My DeWalt 705 still rocks though !	-1
I really like my DeWalt sliding compound miter saw , and got this bag for it when I started using the saw in my garage shop ( as opposed to outdoors projects ) for dust control . It is only a little bit better than using the saw without it . I would say the dust capture is 20 % at best.I found that I am a lot better off for dust capture if I attach my shop vacuum to the port where this bag is supposed to attach and have active suction to pick up the dust . This captures about half or more of the dust . Overall , though , it seems that there is a reason there are dust hood systems with large hoods to capture miter saw dust into a collector : a lot of the dust does not exit through the blade guard , but spews right off the top of the cut.Conclusion : do n't bother with this , it 's not good value and it gets in the way .	-1
Despite the hefty price tag and prestigious name , this saw wo n't hold a blade ! My first one would n't ... and neither would the replacement Home Depot gave me . Nothing I did would make a blade stay in . Call to the factory elicited this comment : & quot ; Yeah , we get a lot of complaints about that. & quot ; Duh ! Tried it one last time and -- the motor went out ! I finallly bought the top-of-the-line Craftsman ( made by Bosch ) and no such problems -- it 's a honey .	-1
I must own about 20 DeWALT tools and this is a frustrating tool . For the most part I really like DeWALT tools but this one needs to be redesigned . The blade will not track straight . The problem seems to be in the blade mounting system . I have never had a problem with the blade coming loose , however as you screw the cap to tighten the blade you can see the plunger start to turn as you crank down on this thing . Since you tighten to the right , the blade will end up pointed to the right . Now I have found that if you back off slightly you can line it up , but that 's not the way a jig saw should work . I think that in this case you would be better served with a Bosch .	-1
This is the second Dewalt model I tried . I can not recommend it . The most important feature of a jigsaw in my opinion is to be able to make a square cut while following a line , curved or straight . This saw can not do either . The plunger that moves the blade up and down has a very large `` play '' sideways . You can move it with your finger side to side by more than 1/16th of an inch . That kind of movement translates into a larger movement at the cutting area of the blade . So no matter what kind of cut you are making , curved or straight , the blade wants to wander . Once it moves 1/16th away from your line , you apply force on the saw to move it back . That makes it worse . As you make a curve , the blade deflects more and more as you get into the curve , making the cut not square . You end up with a very rough cut even with finest blades . You have to cut proud of your line and waste time sanding . You can do this test at Home Depot or somewhere you can see different models . Take this saw and push the plunger sideways , then take a Bosch and do the same . You will see that Bosch is rock solid , does not move visibly , whereas Dewalt is lose as if they forgot a bolt or two . I bought a barrel grip Bosch and I am happy..	-1
Could not get the blade to track stright . The saws shaft is lose and will shift while using . I have many other DeWalt tools I have been very happy with , but this saw stinks . I sold mine at a loss and bought a Bosch ***** stars for the Bosch .	-1
The Dewalt looked good in the store but I 've been a little disappointed . The machine needs a soft start on the motor to keep it from jumping when you pull the trigger . Once I learned to maintain an iron grip , I realized that the mark that is supposed to indicate the height of the cut from the fence ( or sole plate ) is much too far off to be useful at all . Most of the time you do n't need to use the mark - if you just maintain reference surfaces carefully , all will align ok - but sometimes one has to use the marks and on this machine the marks are n't accurate at all . Having to make complicated setups and test cuts sort of overcomes the purpose of the machine - which is to increase speed . Finally , on my machine , I notice that when using the sole plate as the reference , actually the aluminum casting extends below the sole plate , so that the sole plate does n't sit flat on the reference table . Yes , it can be fixed with a ( substantial ) bit of filing ... . but having to go to this extreme on a new tool , which may not be the most expensive but even so certainly is n't cheap , does n't seem reasonable to me.I know that some claim that the biscuits are n't for alignment but that 's nonsense ... . since the initially-compressed biscuits expand to fill the slot , then by definition they WILL align the parts . Or , misalign them if the slots are a little off . Plate joining seems like a faster alternative to mortise and tenons when the full goodness is n't needed , but this Dewalt is n't a precision instrument .	-1
Everything about this was awesome , except that the unit I bought , the blade was slightly out of parallel with the fence ; about 1/32 '' higher on one side of the cut.If I could guarantee a parallel cut , I 'd buy this again ; until then , going with a PC or Makita .	-1
Here is my story ... after two attempts to purchase this joiner , I went with the PC 557 . Both of the Dewalt models I bought had their fences racked which caused the biscuit slots to be cut on an angle . Cutting a # 20 slot was off about 1/8 '' from left to right . Plus , reports of the chute clogging are true . It was worth $ 30.00 more to get the PC .	-1
I read the reviews and had it narrowed down to two jointers ; DeWalt and Porter Cable . I decided that the price was right on the DeWalt and figured it would do the job . I tested a few joints with it and noticed that the wood was a little off . I figured that it was user error and continued on with my project . Then I decided to check for sqareness off the adjustable fence . The pointer lined up just past the & quot ; 0 & quot ; mark and sure enough it was off . No problem , I thought , since it had an adjustment screw , I could not adjust it to where I needed it to go . I had to file the stop block to get it at & quot ; 90 & quot ; . This failed to fix the problem with the line up of the wood . I finally measured the cut and found that it was a 32nd higher on the right side of the cut . No matter how I hold the tool to the surface it was off . A visual look at the blade and you can see the blade comes out at an angle . Bottom line , the mechanics of the tool are strong , but the machining of everything else hooked to the motor needs more attention . It is going back tomorrow . A 32nd sounds picky , but it sure racks your project when you put all the biscuits in place . Not a good tool for fine woodworking projects.Update : Fine Woodworking magazine did a review in their September/October 2001 issue and out of 12 jointers , DeWalt had the worst score for biscuits out of parallel . Exact quote was , & quot ; although I can live with 0.017 in . out of parallel , biscuit joints assemble with less fuss when the number is 0.007 in . or lower. & quot ; Lamello Top 20 came in at 0.000 and Makita came in at 0.001 . The Porter came in at 0.005 . They liked Lamello , Porter , Makita , and the DeWalt even after what they found . Being a casual user , I think I will consider the Makita because of the cost savings .	-1
The cast aluminum base had a hump in the casting 90 degrees to the plunge travel . Do n't expect to get good results with a tool that references the base to a flat surface when the tool rocks back and forth on its base . Yes the issue can be resolved with enough elbow grease . Just apply spray contact adhesive to the back side of coarse grit sandpaper , and stick it to the flat surface of a cast iron jointer table . Then rub it flat , and reattach the somewhat less than sturdy aluminum base plate . I just do n't like having to do makeshift finishing work on a poorly manufactured tool . And no , I did n't send it back for an exchange ( not purchased from Amazon ) . It only took the better part of one day to flatten the base . It would have taken two weeks for an exchange , which may or may not have been from the same production run with the same exact issue . Who knows ? In summary I have been duped by advertizing to expect that tools with DeWalts name on them should perform reasonably well out of the box . This one did not . Being gullible is my own fault so I am only deducting three stars . Not because the tool did not eventually work well , but because although I paid DeWalt ; they did n't pay me to do their work for them .	-1
The face of the edge guide that touches the workpiece is a problem on the unit I got.It has two pieces , basically split vertically in half if the router is also vertical . One of my pieces is bent slightly towards the workpiece , or perhaps one piece is bent slightly away . It still works , but honestly is my most disappointing purchase as far as quality goes ; not good for very accurate cutting .	-1
DeWalt tools are not great , to reveal my bias up-front . This one , however , is especially bad . The fence is a piece of stamped steel that is not very precise . Two plastic ( ABS , I think , not even nylon ) rectangles cover the fence and then a shoddily cast alignment mechanism sits off the back end . The alignment mechanism can rotate about 10 degrees in either direction along the stamped steel fence ( not intentionally , either , it just sucks and is imprecise ) and there is a lot of slop in the whole design.One of the worst attributes of this guy is that because it 's so loose and sloppy , you ca n't get repeatable measurements - even if you align a clamp on a workpiece and then expect the fence to act as a & # 34 ; stop & # 34 ; , the distance from the router bit to each end of the fence can shift slightly as you use the tool , so your results end up being slightly off at all times . Really pretty horrible , considering that routers are precision tools.The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that the steel rods were fairly straight . I know it sounds trivial , but that 's apparently a lot to ask for with DeWalt . Seriously , buy a different router/edge guide if you can .	-1
I purchased the Dewalt because their tools are historically of good quality . This sander does not seem to take too much off even if you use 80 grit paper ( my little mouse sander does better job ) and as for other features , I agree with the others that the dust port keeps falling off and the switch is suspect . But my variable speed option still works though . After using it on a project for about 20 hours , the bearings went and I had to get it fixed . Once this sander quits on me , I think I 'll opt for the Porter Cable .	-1
I own this sander because it came as a freebie promotional perk with my DeWalt planer ( check out my DW733 planer review if you 're interested ) .The sander has problems . First , I 'm not a big fan of forced-air dustbags in the first place , but this one is particularly annoying because it always falls off from the sander 's own vibration . I ended up having to put a self-tapping screw in it , which I then have to undo before emptying the bag . Lame.Second , the bigger problem is that the random-orbit mechanism appears to have failed after only about four hours of use . The pad is no longer rigid -- it wobbles off-axis and it 's all I can do to hold it flat on the workpiece while sanding . It tries to dance around all over the stock -- I literally can not move it in a straight line while it 's running . I 've been a journeyman architectural woodworker for nearly ten years , so I think I 'm qualified to say that the unit is not functioning as it should.I 'm going to try to get some resolution from DeWalt , which I should say has been pretty good in the past with other issues . However , since it was a gim me along with the planer , I 'm not holding my breath.I 'll post an update when I can get in touch with DeWalt .	-1
I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration , like using a hole saw in plywood . I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others . The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners . Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $ 40 . Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I do n't know why DeWalt does not do the same .	-1
I bought one of these for my father , a retired electrician who occasionally still takes jobs . At first , he loved this little drill . The only shortcomings he noticed in the beginning were the lack of a keyless chuck and the fact that the paddle-switch could be dangerous if you were n't paying close attention to what you were doing . In the end though , what became this drills downfall was the cheap construction inside the housing . After only a few jobs , a plastic component around the motor cracked , allowing the teeth to slip under strain . A DeWalt service shop charged ... to fix this problem . The second hole it drilled after that caused the gears to give out . It was a great idea , but DeWalt needs to send this one back to the design board for more work ... I wish now that I had spent the extra money on the bigger DeWalt right angle drill .	-1
Horrible little drill ! ! ! ! No variable speed , no reverse ! ! ! You better be perfect because god forbid you must back a screw out , no reverse . Hard to start screws w/o variable speed . I replaced this drill w/ bosch 's 1132vsr rt . angle drill . I am happy with the bosch , it is head and shoulders above the dewalt . I gave the Dewalt to my father in-law .	-1
I bought this because of the deal and dewalt name . Turns out the item does not operate at a consistent level as far as screw depth . You may get one or two perfect then a bunch that are not sunk in the dimple . Bad product.If you buy one of these , try it ! Do n't let it set around like I did and get past the return date . Fairly obvious that whoever had it before me realized it would not work consistantly , and returned it.My bad ! Found out after asking on a DIY forum that the dewalts are know for this inconsistency !	-1
I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said `` Drywall and Deck '' Drill . Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4 's with 2 1/2 screws . I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation . I ended up pre-drilling each hole . Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping . Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go . I finished the job . My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly . I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck . I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed . Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem . This is not a deck screw drill .	-1
The first unit would not allow the spreader to snap/lock into it 's frame , so I returned it and just received another one which the spreader locked into OK. After installing and straightening the item to the table , the spreader was offset from the blade by more than 1/8th of an inch , ... ..top and bottom ! Due to the resctictive lower bolt hole , in this device , there is no lateral adjustment available to line the spreader up with the blade . I have a 2006 left tilt 36-L31X Unisaw and according to the information for this item , it should have worked on my saw . I contacted Delta for advise ... they had no answer , and said to return the item . I noticed that the spreader metal is quite soft as it was not straight right out of the box . I suppose this may be for minor adjustments . The anti kick back units are also quite soft as one of those was bent and laying against the spreader . Definitely not the quality of Delta of yesteryear !	-1
This is one item I would recommend people purchase from a local dealer not Amazon . Like another reviewer mentioned the packaging is terrible . I received mine and the small stationary wooden top of the table was broken into three parts even though the external packaging showed no real damage . This part breaks where it has grooves routed into it across its width , it is so badly supported I would expect it to get broken in shipment more often than not . The movable part of the table top also had some cosmetic damage . Amazon has been helpful but a replacement top arrived damaged as well . I just ended up making my own parts to fix it . The table is actually pretty good and I needed a fold down table given lack of space in my garage .	-1
I 've seen some off-shore poor-quality product sold by Delta in the past - I know it 's what you need to do to compete in this market , but this out-feed table is the worst . Besides the enormous amount of time that it takes to install , adjust , re-adjust etc , the quality of the table and laminate is garbage . The shipping from Amazon left minor damage around the edges . Laminate peeling , cracked , etc - but parts missing is no excuse . I knew that my options were to return it or exchange from Amazon , so I decided to call Delta directly who told me it would be several months until the new part was released and on top of all that - I had to pay for it . When they sent me to the warranty call center , they simply sent me back to the general info number . I can now see that Delta is no different than any of the off-shore clone woodworking products that are out there . You are for sure better off building your own in this case . It 's not close to the quality of the machine that it couples up with , in my case an older Unisaw . Sorry Delta !	-1
Well ... After 5 FAILED attempts to get an UNDAMAGED outfeed table delivered , i 'm going for number 6 . I should give up , up this item is handy and i cut a lot of plywood . ( i should just give up and build one myself . ) It seems that no one can get the largest table part delivered in one piece . All 5 have arrived damaged in one way or another . The last attempt , direct from Delta , was the worst . The part was shattered in several places , almost beyond recognition.Needless to say , I 'm VERY disappointed .	-1
I bought this to complete my Unisaw workstation - I have a small shop and it seemed like the perfect solution for long rip cuts . If I had the space to spare I 'd build large island around the saw and have support at all sides . Alas , I do not.SO : Like I said , this appeared to be the perfect solution . And in theory it is . But my actual experience was miles away from perfect.I have a Delta Unisaw 3 HP right tilt 36-815 . It is configured with the dust port on the R hand side and the back has the keyhole slots and holes predrilled to accept this accessory . I assumed this would be a simple matter of carefully following the instructions and I 'd be up and running in a few hours tops.FIRST PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED : When I went to bolt on the horizontal supports to the back of the saw cabinet the immovable cast-iron trunnion blocked my access to the predrilled hole . I called Delta where a laconic staffer lazily informed me that he had not heard of that issue before bu I should go ahead and insert the bolt from the outside of the cabinet , counter to the provided instructions . OK , I thought- no big deal . What difference could it make ? SECOND PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED : And this is a biggie . The diagonal support brackets that ( again ) fit into the predrilled keyhole slots on the saw cabinet were TOO LONG . Even when adjusted at their minimum height they forced the horizontal brackets 3/5 & # 34 ; out of line ! Another call to Delta brought me no joy as they had no record of this issue . Their suggestion was to cut the supports down . I am fortunate to have a good friend who is a welder . He shortened the diagonal support brackets by 3/5 & # 34 ; .Finally I get down to bolting the outfeed table on . It goes together nicely , but when I get to the swing-down leg I come to myTHIRD PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED : The spring pin that locks the leg in position does not fit in the predrilled hole . I ca n't explain this much better and a step-drill bit will make short work of the issue , but it seems like the fitment issues are FAR too plentiful for such a seemingly simple accessory.LASTLY- the two pieces of laminated MDF ( or is it particle board ? ) fit together with a piano hinge . The hinge does not extend the entire width of the board . My outfeed table was slightly bent up at the corner- barely noticeable but enough that a large board would catch on it and bind against the fence . Dangerous ! I went and bought some 3 & # 34 ; low-profile hinges at the hardware store and used them to join the outfeed table to the other piece of MDF and it brought the two of them in line.All told , this was a miserable experience that cost me time and ( had my welder friend not been so generous ) money . One would think that a Delta-made product that claims to fit a Delta-made saw ( the Unisaw in particular ) would be an obvious choice . As it stands this nearly drove me to drink and made me sad and if I knew the name and address of the individual in charge of Delta Quality Control I would TP his lawn .	-1
I 'm in the market for a new drill press -- and thought I 'd toss in this mortising attachment for good measure . The product description lists five Delta drill presses that work with the Delta 17-924 mortising attachment . None of those models is currently available for sale through Amazon . The reviews indicate that the product works with other drill presses too , but how is one to know ? Looks like Delta needs to do a little updating here . ( One star for `` nice try . '' )	-1
I 've been using this attachment for a couple of years now . I recommend it only if you can not afford a bench top mortiser.First , attaching the fence to my 16 1/2 '' Delta drill press is not easy at all . In fact , it 's a real pain in the keester . You would think this would be easy because it is a Delta drill press but it isn't.Second , the workpiece holddowns are cheap and difficult to work with . No matter what you do , the workpiece moves when you do n't want it to move , or it stays put when you want it to move . It 's not a good design.Third , the chisels do not drill perfectly square holes . The auger bits are just a hair bigger than the chisels . So , you end up with a circle with square corners . This effect is more pronounced the bigger the chisel/bit.I finally ditched the table accessories and built my own table jig ( which works surprisingly well and looks cool too ) . This solved the first two issues . If it is really important to have perfectly square mortises , I cut them by hand . This solves the final issue . ( Note : the mortises are OK for most joinery because you have a shoulder on the tenon to hide the slightly out of square mortise . ) UPDATE I was hanging out at Woodcraft last Saturday and this guy walks in ... to return an auger bit . The pointy tip on the bit was not on the same axis as the drill bit . He rotated the bit and I looked at the pointy thing , and it was tracking a circle 3/32 '' in diameter . That explains why the drll wo n't drill a square hole .	-1
This item worked as advertised -- converting my benchtop drillpress into a mortiser in about 10 minutes . Though it 's tough to get square and set , once you do it does n't move much . The parts are all solidly made and the fit and finish is just fine . Comes with a nice assortment of bits too . I will say that the chisels `` cooked '' ( turned blue ) pretty quick , but that may have been my own mistake.The only problem is that the whole thing is a bad idea . There are lots of reviews out there that talk about the convenience of this type of unit , but there are a few GREAT discussions about what a dupe it is . Notably , [ ... ] covered this device with an accurate review.This item is no substitute for a benchtop mortiser , but a good plunge router or a drill/chisel is ! A benchtop mortiser is supposed to save you time and give you better quality . I 'd argue that the time spent setting this thing up ( and taking it back down ) , could be better spent either building a jig for router cut mortises or cutting them `` manually '' using a drill and chisel . The quality of the cuts it makes is so-so , meaning you have to tune them by hand anyway . So , on both the convenience and quality front it falls short.When you consider the cost , it 's a no brainer . For what you 'd spent on this tool , you 're half way to a SUPER plunge router -- or a `` real '' benchtop mortiser -- and all the way to a good used or refurbished one . The router 's more versatile , so the money you spend gets you a lot more . I 'd definitely recommend a harbor freight mortiser over this unit.So ... it does what it 's supposed to do -- pretty well in fact . To me though , the whole idea is a bad one , and your money is better spent on another tool that will give you better quality mortises and a lot more capability .	-1
Overall , I wish that I had applied the purchase price of this drill press attachment to the purchase of a stand-alone mortising machine.When mine arrived I was disappointed with the fit and finish . The unit that holds the work piece is made from cast iron . Unfortunately , only one face had been machined smooth . The supplied bolts would not slide the length of the slots in the cast iron work piece holder . I took the unit to my local machine shop to have work piece holder re-machined . That added almost $ 50.00 to the purchase price . The photo of the product shows a nicely painted assembly - mine was unpainted cast iron.In use I needed almost every C-clamp I owned to hold it firmly to my drill press - in addition to the supplied hold down hardware . Aligning the cutter to be square with the edge of the work piece is almost impossible .	-1
The build quality of this unit is very good , however the design leaves a bit to be desired . There are a number of negatives and annoyances which leave me wishing I had bought one of the other brands.There 's no dust collection port . That seems silly , and I kick myself for not having noticed that before buying it . I thought something this expensive should have that basic feature.You ca n't open the saw cabinet once this is installed . Being that this is made by Delta , you 'd think they would have noticed that problem and prevented it.No provision for the switch cabling . They give you a place to mount the switch in a convenient location , but no good way to route the wires . I drilled the tube myself and ran them through.The add-on `` kit '' to use this with a Biesemeyer fence is just a flat piece of metal , and it 's too soft/thin so it flexes and fails to support everything properly . The price is ludicrous for what you get . You 're much better off buying a piece of angle iron and drilling it yourself.Overall , for the expensive price of this , I expected much more . The Biesemeyer guard is much better designed and has dust collection . It may not have the remote switch , but I 'd rather have DC and be able to open my saw cabinet . I 'd take any of the others instead of this one .	-1
I purchased this for my jointer , but after setting all the pieces together on my bench , I realized the smallest width it could be was 16 '' . My jointer measures 12 '' . I had to put a plywood base into the finished framework to set the jointer on . I have the HTC mobil base and for now on thats what I will purchace . As with the other reviewers , It 's sloppy with the 1 1/2 '' boards . The back roller run on the outside edges because of the slop . They tell you to drill 7/16 '' holes and that is way to big . For those of you that do n't have a drill press , you need to mark both sides of the boards and drill from both sides . This will give you a more accurate hole . I am verry dissapointed with this mobil base .	-1
I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base . I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard . I 've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools . The foot actuated operation is nice ( although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical ) but in my small shop , I need all the real estate I can get . I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it . The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use . It 's less convenient than a foot lever , but it works well .	-1
I think these would be great for lighter homeowner type tools or tools that are somewhat light to start with such as drill presses and band saws . I actually purchased it for a Rockwell cabinet saw . The saw is simply to heavy for the light weight metal these are made out of . However , I like the concept so well that one of these days I might just go to the metal yard and get some steel tubing and weld up something a bit more stout for the saw . I will probably take this and use it on some other machine . So my recommendation would be it is OK for a contractor type table saw but not a light industrial iron table saw , jointer , or planer .	-1
I have urgently replaced this base ( suppose to be mobile base ) by HTC2000 . Absolutely no contest . Wheels are too small to keep equipment parallel to the floor surface . In addition , it is not as sturdy as HTC2000 ; is more expensive and is more cumbersome .	-1
My friend bought this from Amazon and loved the saw ... Only thing he complained about was Amazon charged him Shipping cost.. which used to be free.I would recommend buying at local stores instead of Amazon as beauty of Buying from Amazon is Gone ! ! ! .. they now charge a Shipping fee ... Checkout local stores and compare how much you will save before buying from Amazon .	-1
I have owned and have regularly used this saw for over three years . As others have pointed out it is almost impossible to get 100 percent accurate cuts from this saw . Tightening the lock down knob does push the blade out of alignment . The only thing you can do to improve this is to not over tighten the knob , but keeping the blade from shifting is still problematic . There is also some play in the blade which allows it to deflect slightly from the work piece , no matter how expensive or stiff a blade you use ( worse when cutting hardwoods ) . But I 've discovered that miter saws by their nature are n't accurate enough for fine work . To get extremely accurate crosscuts you need to use an accurately tuned table saw .	-1
I did get this thing to work , but barely.1 ) The centering pin is too short , so that only the tip reaches the workpiece . This means that if you drill the recommended size pilot hole , you get a very sloppy fit . Even with a smaller hole , you have to hold down the point quite firmly , bending the metal arm . I 'll be using a 3/32 or smaller hole , rather than the recommended 13/64.2 ) The scale does n't make sense . Cutting a 140mm hole , the 170mm mark was centered on the blade . The 140mm mark was n't aligned with anything in particular.3 ) It just does n't have the solid quality of the Bosch power tools I have bought recently.Tip : Cut very slowly , and you can get a good circle . The manual mentions cutting slowly , but the required speed is slower than I would have guessed . It works fine once you find the right pace , but practice on a scrap !	-1
It 's not really all that bad -- as far as it goes -- a piece of plastic with a metal rod that will let you cut along a reasonably parallel edge -- and if I had paid a few dollars for it at a discount store I 'd say that 's fine . But it 's got Bosch 's name on it and cost more than a few dollars . Very unclear instructions written on the packaging cardboard . All in all , a disappointemnt . I really should 've heeded the other reviewers -- when half the reviews are three stars or less that 's usually not a good sign . Doh ! ! The description also does n't specify the maximum width of the cut -- I was looking for something around a 1 foot offset -- only works to about 8 inches .	-1
I brought the new 1618EVS to the job and after routing D pine for all togeather maybe 3 hrs . ( NOT continuous running time ) I smoked the motor . After a long conversation with the authorized tool service center I sent it in for a complete motor rebuild . They assured me it would come back assembled to tighter specs . than what it was manufactured at . I was skeptical that it would be returned to me in any decent workable condition yet two years later I 'm still milling trim with it . However I 'm still waiting for that day , in the middle of some job , where it will start spewing smoke out of the motor housing again.I do like the soft start and constant RPM features.The D-handle is very comfortable , and I find it helps to keep me accurate.I have to agree with the other reviewers that it 's too difficult to remove the motor from the base . I do the router dance - I clamp the router between my knees and twist the motor away from the base with all I got to seperate the two pieces . Ugghh ! ! Wayyy too cavemanish.There is a plunge base available for this motor yet I 'm hesitant to buy it because the power cord coming out of the motor is only 5-6 inches long ( it plugs into the top of the D-handle ) . That means the power cord will connect to the extension cord right at the router base . That ca n't be practical.I do n't really know what else is out there for the same price . This router maybe an OK value for the $ .	-1
While it is pretty light , this model just has too many design issues to be worth the premium lifestyle brand price.For starters , the dust bag is awful and the sander would be better off without it . There is absolutely nothing on either the dust port or the bag itself that is capable of creating a seal , so you invariably end up with a steady stream of dust shooting right into your face no matter how much you tighten that little screw . Odds are good that port 's going to clog up on you in a big hurry , too.Next up is the tension release lever -- it 's plastic . Not that ultra sturdy kind of plastic they make milk crates and flight cases out of that lasts forever , but the cheap kind that goes brittle as it outgasses . In this price range , I expect to get a tool that 's going to last several years , but this is one part that is very obviously going to break much sooner than that . Frankly , it feels like it 's going to snap off every time you use it.Then there 's the little graphite pad they put over the platen . This wears down very , very quickly and you 're going to have to special order replacements . What 's worse is that 3 '' belts do n't quite cover the entire thing , so after about 10 minutes worth of usage you 'll have worn a groove into it that leaves you with a 1/8 '' strip on the side sitting flush with the belt itself . Can you say ugly black streaks everywhere ? I knew that you could.Lastly , the handle bugged me . There 's no good way to pick this thing up ( or set it down ) without accidentally bumping the trigger . I have no doubt that this would have eventually resulted in something very bad happening had I decided to keep it.If it were maybe half the current price , I 'd consider it a viable contender as I do like the weight , the flat platen , and the flat top , but I 'm going to have to go with the Makita on this one . If plastic and `` good enough '' performance are your cup of tea , Ryobi 's even cheaper .	-1
This product is almost exactly the same as the Ryobi BE231 it replaced , Externally the primary difference is a carbon pad to reduce frction on the Bosch . The Bosch cost twice as much , and became nonfunctioinal after little use , while the Ryobi model withstood heavy use for years . There was so much friction on the carbon pad , that it heated up painfully . The sander started breaking belts for no apparent reason . The dust collection on the Ryobi was not good , but it was totally nonfunctional on the Bosch.I have been satisfied with the Bosch routers ( 1613,1617 ) , but their sanders , both belt and ROS , have not worked well for me .	-1
Sure , Swiss sourced , German design , Bosch Name ... ... ALL FAILThe world of tool use is a jungle , and this sander dies quick.The belt release lever is of molded PLASTIC that weakens with stress cycles and breaks off ... ..no matter how you baby it ... .The thing is not fit for it 's intended useAn expensive shadow of a sander	-1
I 've had some problems with my unit . First , though , the good side ... I 've been using this since July , 2006 , which has given me enough experience with the machine to write a credible review . The unit is powerful , without being unmanageable . It 's light enough to be able to use on vertical surfaces and runs relatively cool and quietly ... although I found that a set of noise canceling headphones helps tremendously to reduce the racket . It also was designed with a nice flat top , so the sander can be turned upside down and used to ( carefully ! ) hand sand small parts and sharpen some tools.Now , the not so good stuff ... The tracking control on my unit has to be adjusted all the way over to one side to prevent the belt from working it 's way off the two pulleys . Even at that point , where the knob ca n't turn any more , the belt runs at a ~5 degree angle to the chassis.The graphite wear pad does indeed wear . Quickly . I go through one for every five or six belts . This may be normal or due to the mistracking ... I 'd be in a better position to evaluate if I had one that tracked correctly for comparison.I 've had problems with sanding dust plugging the insides of the sander ; once to the point that I had to completely dissemble it to clean it out . The optional Bosch exhaust hose ( VAC001 ) that connects the sander to a Shop-Vac is made out of very thin ridged plastic and does n't pass enough air through it to keep the Shop-Vac 's motor from revving up and whining . Active exhaust certainly helps clear the sanding dust , but , without sufficient cooling air , I 'm concerned about the impact on my Shop-Vac 's motor life.All in all , I 'm rating this sander as three stars . I 'd be happier if the local Bosch repair shop told me that the tracking was abnormal , but they said that it was ok ...	-1
This drill 's trigger takes up 3/4 of the handle and when the drill binds up while drilling , your first reaction is to take your finger off the trigger . Too bad you got ta take three fingers off of the trigger on this particular model ! This means that your trying to fight the torque with only your pinky and thumb gripping the handle ! Great power but not worth a jammed wrist . I 'm staying with Milwaukee brand , just not this model .	-1
Made Communist ChinaThis tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer . However , if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar . In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle can not be used without the extension . this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality . Unfortunately they have gone the cheap route , and have succeeded .	-1
I 'm a contractor who demands a lot from my tools . I 've owned the Makita LS1013 for 3+ years and am in the market for a new saw . I really liked the saw 's features when I first purchased it , but I had to bring it in to a Makita repair shop within the first year . Ever since it has been on the road to ruin . I 've had it worked on five times having had the miter locking mechanism replaced twice , the safety switch replaced twice ( it falls out and gets lost - I now have a screw in its place ) , the fence replaced once ( now needing its second replacement ) , switch replaced ; miter bearing track under the table replaced twice ( again the aluminum against steel thing ) ; etc ... .Positives of the saw : Tilted Motor ( convenient & amp ; powerful ) , self cleaning sliders , wide base.Negatives : Miter locking mechanism is a threaded steel rod going into aluminum housing which quickly strips ( I 'm on # 3 ) ; aluminum fence warps ( I 'm on # 2 and now need # 3 - I think this is due to seasonal temperature changes it experiences in the back of my pick-up truck ) ; rear bevel lock requires clearance deeper than the table ; slop in the miter angle detents ( they wear out ) .I would recommend this saw to cabinetmakers , picture framers and those who have a shop set-up . For people like me who need a saw to hold up from job-site to job-site , this is n't your saw . Beware of too many features and too much aluminum , it just means there is more to go wrong . I 'd gladly trade in the weight of a cast iron base and fence saw like they used to make because they hold up . For now , I 'm going back to the Hitachi ( not the version with the laser ) .Keep in mind , power tools made today are priced low because they are considered disposable . I suppose 3 years of everyday use might be considered a decent life span against the money it has allowed me to make . Still , I 'd prefer fewer features for longevity and toughness .	-1
I may have got a lemon . This saw burns wood on any type of cut . Replaced the blade with a Forrest Chopmaster but had same results . Something is terribly wrong with this saw .	-1
I have a number of other Makita tools , and have always held Makita in pretty high regard . My 7 1/4 '' circular saw works great , as does my motorized hand planer , Reciprocating saw , and my plunge router is awsome . This machine seems more like a toy that a quality piece of machinery . I was surprised to see a little bit of play when the saw was moved into one of the 45 notches . I could pretty easily move it one degrees side to side , unless it was absolutely locked down , and then it was not consistent about being locked down in the same place . When I got the left-hand miter perfect at 45 I could not get the right hand side at 45 , and this is a real problem as they share the same fence . I 'm not sure if the notch was machined in the wrong spot or what , but it 's impossible to cut perfect mitered corners this way.On the positive note , the dust collection work much better than some other saws I 've owned , and I like the supplied hold-down clamp . I also own an inexpensive Ryobi 10 inch miter saw , and at $ 89 it 's twice to machine this is . Heavier metal , and locks down positive -- perfect miters . I 'm going to go buy another after my experience with this.Makita really disappointed me with this one . I 'm packing it up today and sending it back . I 'm actually really puzzled how this saw got such great reviews , as I am normally in agreement with the majority of people . Maybe I just got lemon ?	-1
This saw used to be the end-all in portable table saws . It 's still as tough as they come , but Makita has done little to improve it 's features in the twenty years I 've been working . It is lightweight , but the fence and sliding angle guide are highly inaccurate . If you buy this saw , I recommend purchasing the Rousseau table with it to ensure an accurate fence , outfeed and extension tables . Unfortunately , the cost of both table and saw exceed that of buying a truly good job-site table saw such as the Bosch , DeWalt or Porter Cable . I 'm really surprised , too , because Makita offers ( in my opinion ) the best 10 & quot ; sliding compound miter saw on the market . If all you 're doing is framing , buy the Makita .	-1
I got this saw as a gift when I moved into my new house . I did n't know much about table saws then . I noticed that I was getting some binding and burning - even after squaring the stock fence . I read some reviews and , unfortunately , plunked down another $ 300 for the Rosseau table.So it 's true - the stock fence is poor . After getting the Rosseau I had the same problems with inaccuracy , although it had improved . Getting a better fence and squaring it properly resolved the burnout and binding . Then I bought the Masterplate and Mastergauge to try to figure out where the inaccuracy was . I found out that there was runout at the arbor . There was enough runout on the arbor alone to make fine woodowrking an impossibility on this saw . The blade guard and splitter are low quality -and laborious to change out.Another problem - the positive stops ( detents ) at 90 and 45 degrees are inaccurate and , as far as I can tell , impossible to adjust . At the 90 degree positive stop on the handwheel my blade was about 5 degrees off . You can get 90 degrees by manually turning the wheel to get there ( past the set detent ) and then locking it there . The manual directs you to adjust a screw to adjust the positive detent settings at 90 and 45 degrees . Well that 's a laugh . You turn the screw counterclockwise ( which is supposed to adjust the blade angle ) and it just ... unscrews . It does nothing to the blade angle . Then if you try to manually position the blade and screw it back in to lock the blade in place it forces it back out of square . I did n't even bother trying to adjust the 45 degree stop after that fiasco . With this saw you just have to set your bevels manually.As others have said this may be quite good for rough carpentry . It is light and powerful . You can cut 4x4 ( 3.5 '' ) on it without a problem . But if you have any aspirations to do woodworking or cabinetry , forget it . You will not be able to get square cuts on long boards with any precision . I am replacing this with a Unisaw . I 'll probably sell this saw and the 2700xl for a loss.This is the first Makita tool I am giving a mediocre review to . I own the compressor , 2 routers , lithium ion set , circular saw , sliding miter saw and plate joiner . I thought they were all very well made . Perhaps this is a better tool than I am giving it credit for , but it just did n't meet my needs .	-1
I had this for my first table saw when I started woodworking . No matter how long I spent adjusting it , I could n't get the rear of the fence to lock solid , or to lock in the same place every time . VERY frustrating when you 're trying to make pieces of plywood with square corners.This is not the same caliber tool as Makita 's hand tools.It may work OK for carpenters , but compared to woodworking , they do n't need any kind of precision . For that , a good contractor saw like a Jet would be good . But do spend the money for the upgraded fence . The stock fences on those are garbage too . If you really need a lightweight , compact saw , look at the DeWalt and the Bosch .	-1
I got this sander to have the addition of a dust collection system that my made in france B & D ; had a dust collection system but I went for the $ 12 less same model without it , huge mistake .I did look at and plug in a porter cable and dewalt that were close to the same price range with much the same features and I will admit the dewalt was pretty quite .This is not how I would describe the makita with any stretch of the imagination .The sole reason I chose the makita was it was the ONLY one that sported a flat base , the others where all bowed down in the center and I did not want to sand same cups shapes into the surface of any wood project I had in process .i got mine before they added the case and I used it for the very first time after it sat in the box for two years .This has to be the loudest sander ever produced , I you want to draw everyones attention and have a small crowd of onlooker develope they will surely do so and have no trouble locating the source of the sounds produced .It also vibrates much more than the older B & D ; which was very quiet and smooth .Horrible thing really , the addition of a speed control may be the only thing that saves this sander form being banned to life stored in the box set of the back of a shelf , you could not retain a friendship if you loaned it out or gave it away .I use the old B & B ; and follow it 's movement with a vacuum hose to pick up most dust , at least you can hold onto it with one hand .I have a makita random orbital with speed control and it is a great tool but there are times where you need something to get into corners but retain your hearing at the same time .This is not a sander you would want to use to sand inside of a open ended wood box , here what you have is a vitual organic noise amplifier just to add to the roar of this makita .	-1
Review said low noise , low vibes ... .maybe they did not pack the padded gloves and ear muffs in the case . It is horrible . besides down time to load is a joke unless in the last 2 years makita come up with a better solution to the spring tabs . I shutter every time I need to sand an inside corner to something . I do not like it , never have liked it , and never will like it . If you need one go to a store or trade show and buy one that is quieter with less vibration . TRY IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT . I do not use it unless I absolutely have no choice . As for dust collection anything is better than nothing . My suggestion to avoiding the dust ... .do n't use it .	-1
This finish sander just is n't up to Makita 's standards . It works well when new , but lacks durability . Even in a non-professional setting , it just does n't last . The clamps that hold the paper can work loose and are a major pain to get back in place . The level of vibration will also increase in fairly short order . It does sand well , I just wish it was more solidly built . If you need a solid finish sander , you 're better off looking at the Porter-Cable or Dewalt models .	-1
I bought this sander two years ago . This Makita sander does a good job with final sanding chores , as long as you are outdoors or do n't care about noise and dust . The sander is loud , has poor dust collection , and comes with no vacuum port . The plastic interior frame on the dust bag broke causing the bag to occasionally fall off . For the money spent , this sander has been a disappointment .	-1
I looked at this router and bought a Makita . The Hitachi is made in Malasyia , and looked cheap compared with the Makita , which is made in the USA . I have hade such poor luck with other tools ( a Bosch drill ) made in Malasyia , that I could not see getting it . If you think you are saving $ 40 getting the Hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth $ 40 less than a Makita .	-1
I boight this router after reading and hearinf some good reviews on it . I 've pwned it for a few months now but only took it out to use in the the last couple of days . I ran some roman ogee bits with 1/2 '' shanks through it and it was perfect . It chewed though the wood flawlwss without loosing speed . It is definitely a good value for money machine if you do n't mind it 's flaws which I describe below.I also like it 's hefty feel and it 's weight makes it stable when I use the router for freehand routing . The soft start feature is also great . I intend to build a router station in the future to house this green beast , but I am holding off until I find an easier way to master the art of changing bits with this time consuming system.I have 2 complaints about it.Firstly , the bit system involves holding a spring loaded sleeve ( which locks the shaft for bit change ) down and tightening the collet with a wrench using your other hand which should be free . I found it so difficult to hold the bit to the correct height ( for some specialty bit ) as well as hold the spring sleeve tightly locked so that the collet can be tightened with another hand.I also own a craftsman router witn 1 3/4 hp and it has a switch lock which frees one hand to hold down thr router or to adjust router bit height while tightening the collet . I find the craftsman so much easier to change bits.Secondly , the 1/4 '' reducer collet will NOT hold 1/4 '' shank bits down . No matter how hard I tighten the collet , my bits keep slipping out after monor cuts . I was using a dovetail bit with a dovetail jig and the bit just kept sliding further down as I cut ! I had no problems with 1/2 '' shank bits , only 1/4 '' shank bits . Hitachi should do something about redesigning it 's collet reducer to grip better .	-1
I 've waited about six months before I wrote this review and I 've put the saw through some work . The adage `` you get what pay for '' is remarkably true for this product . I purchased this at when Hitachi had a special for under three hundred . I also got a router . At the time I thought it was a good deal . Now I realize this will not be my final shop mitre saw . That says alot does n't it.The problem-this saw can not cut a 4x4 without flipping . Without modification this saw can not cut a 4x4 at all . In order to cut a 4x4 I had to permanantly take off the blade guard and bend the blade guard holder back ( it is held to the body of the saw by a small easily stripped phillips screw . If this saw could cut a 4x4 in one pass I would give it five stars because in others respects it really is solid .	-1
Setting up the rails was easy then it came to assembling the fence . That was also easy . Getting it straight and true was another issue . Not my idea of a good fence . Having to tighten down then check then redo the assembly screws to get it straight is not what i consider quality . Very good saw though . Maybe Jet should stick to that .	-1
I have a Jet band saw and I too have been dreaming about owning a fence , but aftr reading the reviews her all 36 of them I would not ever consider purchasing this attachment , You would think jet customer service would anser these customer complaints . Evidently they could care less about us customers , , so MR Jet customer surface person thatk theis and stick it where the sun do n't shine . Yes I was a John deere salesman , partsman , if I treated my customer this way we would have had to lock doors soon .	-1
This product is really a problem for both the seller and the manufacturer.I received this fence today only to find out that it does not fit my 14 '' Jet bandsaw , which was a surprise because on the side of the box it claims boldly that `` This fence fits ALL Jet 14 '' bandsaws . `` The problem is that the fence itself is about 1-1/4 '' too long for the spacing between the rails . I measured my table and it is just shy of 14 '' ( 13-3/4 '' ) . The fence , therefore , is built for a table that is 15 '' .I fixed the problem using 1 '' wooden shims on the back rail and a couple of longer 1/4 '' 20 screws that were long enough to compensate for the extra depth created by the shims.The locking system was also not working at all , but then I discovered a plastic shim in the box that had fallen off the locking tongue . I glued it on with CA glue and it 's now working as it should.In the end , after significant modifications , the fence is square , true , calibrated , functional and locks to the rail , so I 'm not going to return it because it would likely be too much bother for too little gain.But buyer beware - especially if you own a Jet bandsaw .	-1
I have this exact machine and it is up to Jet 's standards for being solid and decent quality ( I also have a Jet 14 '' Bandsaw ) . It is square , sharp , and quiet out of the box and very easy to set up.Unfortunately , in the past 3-4 years , Jet has not changed the design or features on this machine . My pet peeves are that the fence is too low ( although it has holes for attaching your own wood fence ) the hold down can not come below the fence since it is attached to the top of the fence , and finally the bottom surface of the hold down is not machined so it wo n't hold your material down flat.Delta , on the other hand , has completely upgraded their benchtop mortiser and priced it aggressively ( it was cheaper than the Jet , as is also the case here on Amazon as of this review ) . I saw them side by side over the weekend at a local retailer and spent some time comparing.Access to change bits on the Jet is adequate while it is much easier on the Delta ( one large access door vs 2 smaller doors on the Jet ) The Delta has a rack and pinion on their taller fence while the hold down goes much lower since the fence is cleared out for it . Wider heavier base . Two separate locking knobs for the fence . Nicer handle . On tool storage of extra bits . Nicer quick-knob for hold down adjustment ( long lever with adjustable stops for easier , faster locking ) If the Jet were priced a good third lower than the Delta , I might be inclined to give it three or *maybe* even four stars since I have had good experience with mine.If this review helps or if you have any questions or comments , please let me know .	-1
I recently purchased this saw , and spent the next two weeks in the most frustrating situation I have ever experienced with a power tool . I brought the saw home , carried all the very heavy components into my basement . I assembled the legs and attached the saw body and cast-iron extensions.Then , I opened the box for the rails , and found that ( 1 ) there was no hardware ; ( 2 ) no directions ; and ( 3 ) the tape was fastened on the rail crooked . I went back to the store where I bought it , and the owner told me that Jet has some problems with hardware . In fact , it seems that other customers have been returning Jet saws for this very reason . I had to wait a week for another rail set . Finally , it came in , and I took the new rail set home . But this time , I found that the hardware WAS THE WRONG SIZE ! ! ! ! Back to the store again for another rail set . I get home , and this time , I decided to take a look at the fence , just to check it out , and I find a gaping crack right along one of the solder areas . Irate , I open the rails again , just to check , and again , NO HARDWARE ! ! ! ! ! Given this kind of horrible quality control , I can not be sure that the rest of the saw is made properly . The guide rails and the fence are two things I can visually inspect . But how about the motor , the trunnions , and the gear assemblies inside ? Two smaller problems : ( 1 ) Jet only has one set of instructions for three different saws . This means that you are constantly trying to figure out how your saw is different from the pictures and the directions . Jet should spend the money to write a separate manuals ; ( 2 ) Jet advertises that their saws are & quot ; made in USA & quot ; when in fact they are assembled in Taiwan.This is all very unfortunate , since Jet has a great reputation in with its other tools . I am very surprised and disappointed in Jet for all of the above reasons.I have no faith that the saw was made correctly . As a result , I returned it to the store for a refund.Jet had better fix this problem , fast , or they will see their customer base shrink down to zero .	-1
I 've had this saw for about a year . This is the first band saw I have owned . Everything fit together nicely and have it mounted on mobile base . I also ordered the fence and 6 '' riser block . One thing important to remember on any band saw is to use the right kind of blade for the type of sawing you are doing . For example , if you are cutting curves you will probably want to use a narrower blade ( 1/4 '' or 3/8 '' ) with 12 tpi . For resawing , I use a timberwolf 1/2 '' 3 tpi blade . This blade is about $ 30 but makes resawing a pleasure . It 's gon na be a little slower cutting then a machine with a 2hp motor but then again the bandsaw is a lot less $ then a lot of the bandsaws out there . If you are a full time professional woodworker you are probably going to want something more robust , if you can afford it . However , for the basement shop ( me ) or garage shop woodworker it will work just fine . Note : I gave this saw a 5 star rating even though it only shows 2 stars .	-1
I bought this blade to upgrade the standard blade that came with my 7 1/2 '' miter saw that I bought to carry around to smaller jobs . BIG mistake.Do n't know why but this blade will not cut anything without kicking back . It will even take chunks out of 2x pine . Do n't even try it on hardwood or cabinet moulding unless you 've got a suit of armor on.It 's not the saw alignment . It 's dead on . And the saw works fine with the original blade and it even works better than this with some of my worn out framing blades from my circular saws.Saw in another review where another user had this same problem with another Freud blade . This is only the second Freud I 've purchased . I bought one for my 10 '' Radial Arm Saw thinking it might make it safer to rip with with the anti-kickback feature . WRONG ! ! ! The kickback I got with this blade dang near destroyed my guards and probably would have killed me if the guards had n't been up to snuff.I 'm beginning to think that the Freud anti-kickback `` feature '' is nothing but a dangerous sales gimmick . And I definitely wo n't be buying any more Freud blades in the near future . This one 's going back to where I got it , too .	-1
I agree with the review that you should stabilize your saw and not your blade , but at some point you are going to want a blade stabilizer . If you do a lot of crosscuts/miters on your table saw it really helps out to give you that `` shinny '' crosscut . This stabilizer is the worst that could ever have been invented . Who wants to have their blade offset approx 1/4 '' ? There are two stabilizers in the kit and I have yet to see a table saw that you can remove the original flange mounted to the arbor so you do n't warp your blade with only one stabilizer . ( The stabilizer is larger than most arbor flanges ) Freud really should have thought out this design . They make wonderful blades , but this product makes them look like idiots . You have to adjust your fence to compensate . Homemade box cutting jigs are shot . The only nice thing is that they are not as large as other blade stabilizers . I threw this one in the trash and bought the forest 5 '' blade stabilizer . Does everything I want . I can use it with my dado . Which is a Freud . DO NOT USE ONLY ONE OF THESE . That can cause serious injury or death .	-1
I 've used one of these with two blades . One is a thin kerf Freud available at HD and the other is a thick kerf DeWalt . With the thin kerf Freud I tighten the arbor nut , turn the saw on , turn the saw off , and the blade spins on the arbor . This is dangerous . With the thick kerf the arbor nut stays tight but the stabilizer is n't needed with a thick kerf blade . I 'm returning this item .	-1
Received in a perfectly clean , brand new package . Three shims had rust spots the size of dimes . Both .020 shims were cupped as if they just came off a roller . This is Freud quality ?	-1
The two outer cutters were fine , but the inner ones , the chippers , were of smaller diameter - by 0.036 inches - not even close to acceptable . I have purchased many Freud products - and have been pleased . Somehow they dropped the ball here .	-1
I have owned this dado set for 8 or 9 years . It has never cut very well , leaving rough bottoms with a lot of chip out . It got to the point that I used my router or router table for most dado operations , avoiding the Freud dado set altogether . I have owned other Freud blades for my table , miter , and skil saw . These blades have done a good job at a reasonable price , but this dado set has been very disappointing . I would not buy recommend it .	-1
I bought this a year ago , and have just recently been putting it to a lot of use . After having done several projects now , I am not all that happy with it . I bought it based on the Freud name and the price . Does it work , yes . I ca n't get flat bottom dado 's ... Every single time , my dado 's have grooving from the outer blades . This has been true with the 5 different dado widths I have cut . Bummer.. The holes in the blades are not all the same diameter , this is a minimal difference but some do n't even fit on my arbor ... Some are a bit loose ... This would probably explain the grooves left in my dado 's , and why some people have flat dado 's and some do n't ... As far as the setup chart with shims and chippers goes ... The width configurations are confusing.. This has led to a lot of time testing out shim and chipper configurations ... An example of confusing shim/stack setup is 13/32 '' and 15/32 '' have the exact same configuration , with no further explanation ... So what is the real measurement of stack A+B+C+D+S1+S2 if two measurements are given ? It would have been a lot better to get an actual cut width and ply width designation . It can be figured out , but wastes time . I have the Forrest WWII as my main blade , which has now set my standard for blades ... even with it 's high cost , it ends up being well worth it in the long run.. I would not recommend this Freud dado setup for a profesional result , and look forward to buying the Forrest dado set . The best solution to this Freud dado stack setup is to take an hour or two and cut all the dado combinations on to one piece of wood . That way you have this stick to test all of your pieces and quickly the proper stack setup for your project . It is cheap though , so if that gets you cutting dado 's , get it ! I did find much more correct dado stack setups at the Freud site . The chart I recieved with my purchase did not have the same information , so they must have figured this out and revised it online . I hope this one IS correct . [ ... ] Happy wood working !	-1
I bought this Dado set on line from a woodworking supply outlet and when i recieved it i went to install it in my Dewalt DW744 contractor table saw . My saw has a 5/8 `` arbour but European blades have a 30mm or 1-1/4 `` bore , Dewalt overcomes this by supplying an outside blade washer with a 30mm protrusion which locks into the blade bore . I had two options when i bought this Dado set , i could have bought one with a 5/8 '' bore or a 30mm bore . As all my table saw blades have a 30mm bore i assumed the Dado with the 30mm bore would fit my saw . Sadly it didn ` t , the two outside blades went on fine but when i tried to install some chippers between them they just sat down on the blade arbour . The outside blade washer ` s protrusion isn ` t long enough to support the chippers , obviously i didn ` t try to turn on the saw with this configuration . In my own defence this was my first Dado set so my knowledge of them is limited . Freud makes some assumptions with the instructions on this set , i just do n't understand how a saw with a 5/8 '' arbour can be fitted with a Dado set with a 30mm bore . I ca n't speak for other saws that are manufactured for the European market but i 'm fairly sure that they all have 5/8 '' arbours with outside blade washers with 30mm protrusions . Unless Freud are selling adaptors with a 5/8 '' bore with a 30mm outside diameter , i do n't understand why they are selling the 30mm bore Dado sets . This problem wo n't be an issue for Americans or Canadians as 5/8 '' bore tablesaw blades and Dado sets are standard in those countries.I had read the reviews of this product on Amazon and noticed that a lot of people have problems with fitting this set to their saws . I tried to install the inside blade , all the chippers and the outside blade . There just is n't enough room on the arbour , the only way i could get them to fit was to remove the inside blade washer . The inside blade washer is big , it takes up about 3/8 '' on the arbour . Dewalt might have a slimmer inside blade washer on the market . With the entire Dado set on the arbour i tried turning the set by hand and noticed that the inside blade was rubbing against the blade shield . Obviously the inside washer should not be removed , a fairly slim inside washer is a must for this Dado set on a Dewalt DW744 . I 'll have to spend money on returning the Dado set and swapping it for the set with the 5/8 '' bore . I 'm sure this is a fine Dado set once it 's compatible with your saw , Freud should include a list of compatible saws with the instructions . Colour coding the shims and chippers would be a great idea as well.I 'm updating the above , i went to my local Dewalt service centre and the technican told me that i 'd have to buy seven 30mm to 15mm reducers or send the Dado set back which would cost me nearly as much in postage as the seven reducers . I bought the reducers , this still leaves the issue of the shims being unsupported on the arbour shaft because of their 30mm bores . I 'll probably have to buy a set of shims with 15mm bores which will cost me more money . He said that Dewalt do n't have a slim inside blade washer so i 'll have to get it reduced in thickness in a machine shop if i want to get the full stack on the arbour . I 'll have to turn the outside blade washer around so that the 30mm protrusion is on the outside against the lock nut . Sounds simple enough does n't it ! I ended up sending back the dado set and had it replaced with one with a 15mm bore , i also got a refund for the seven reducers i bought . I tried to fit the entire stack on the arbour and it fitted . I had to remove the inside washer and replace it with the outside washer , the nut goes on the outside of the stack . I have yet to use the stack as i have had some problems with my table saw , i would n't be surprised if there was some wobble given that the stack is unsupported on the outside apart from the blade nut . A blade stabalizer might be a good buy , i think i might also purchase a set of Veritas slotted shims which are colour coded .	-1
The Freud JS-100A is my first biscuit joiner . I picked it because it looked well made and inexpensive . After two years , I now use biscuits for everything and am putting the Freud to heavy use . It is an increasingly annoying resident of my shop ; as of today I am in the market for a better-designed joiner.The Freud continues to work OK -- I have become used to the motor noise , which sounds like a handful of ball bearings rattling around in a coffee can . The dust collection system is its worst failing -- the chintzy plastic manifold does n't make a good seal and dust blows out the joint into your face . And when you have to remove the manifold to get the tool into a corner , you find access to the screw is blocked by the biscuit size selection dial . Oh , and dust goes right through the bag too , again right in your face if you 're bending over to see what you 're doing.The crude fence adjustment mechanism is a real pain . When you are trying to center the cut in a board , it 's just a trial and error game . Some kind of screw adjustment would be most helpful ( as in the Porter-Cable 557 I bought to replace the Freud ) .In production use , the tool seems heavy and poorly balanced . The on/off switch is awkwardly located , at least for me -- I have to turn it on and then position it for a cut ( instead of lining it up and just switching it on briefly for a quick cut . Then I have to set the tool down and turn it off . You have to wonder what they were thinking when they built this thing .	-1
I 've never panned a tool before but after receiving and using this router I have no choice but to put it down . First off I own 26 routers in a commercial woodworking business so I know a lot about routers . I believe I own one of every router available for sale in the United States except for the Bosch plunge models since I do n't like the way their plunge lock works . Bosch 's 1617 is a great fixed base router by the way . Here is what I find objectionable about the Freud 2000E.1 ) The tool has a [ bad ] base plate . It 's not flat and it 's way too thin.2 ) Removing the springs for router table use is a hassle . It can be done but it 's a lot more of an effort than taking them out of most other plunge routers . Also the screw that controls the router height ca n't be captured and locked between two nuts as it 's enclosed . When spinning a panel raising bit this is a desirable feature as both posts are locked by using this technique . The post that has the plunge lock and the post with the height adjustment screw . The ability to do this is available on both the Hitachi M12V ( a great bargain ) and the DW625 ( smoothest router on the planet ) 3 ) The router is not smooth with large bits . I believe due to excessive run out of the arbor . If you ca n't turn large bits without excessive vibration why buy a router of this size ? ... I could n't send it back to Amazon.com since I had removed the shaft lock and ground off the tabs on the bottom of the router that had previously held the shaft lock . Shaft locks incidentally [ stink ] on plunge routers because with only one wrench when a progressive collet ( like the one on the Freud ) breaks loose you 'll end up banging a plunge post with the wrench and nicking it . Once this happens no more smooth plunges for you . Using two opposing wrenches this never happens.Here 's the real deal.For the buck the M12V simply ca n't be beat if you need variable speed so that you can turn panel raising bits . If you do n't the Hitachi TR-12 is the best plunge router deal on planet earth [ and is available ] here at Amazon.com . I own four of them and beat them to death every day and they never complain . The DeWalt ( Elu ) 625 is the best plunge router period with absolutely the smoothest plunging mechanism ( critical for mortising ) but has an issue with not projecting the router bit high enough in a router table . I do n't like the Bosch plungers since I feel that the router should free float until locked not the reverse which is how Bosch does it . Makita 's plunger is way too loud ( their new fixed base is quiet so I do n't know why their plungers are so loud ) . This is the opinion of a man who uses routers every single day and I offer it without any ax to grind .	-1
Do n't use this blade in cold temperatures . I had it shatter around the arbor the first time that I used it . I have not had this experience with their other blades .	-1
This blade shattered as I was installing it the first time . I replaced it , at about three times what it 's worth , and found that it dulled quickly when cutting wood .	-1
DOES NOT FIT HARBOR FREIGHT TOOLS	-1
I bought this blade to replace the one that came with the kit . When I tried to install it the blade must have been just a little off center . As soon as I put pressure on it , the blade shattered into a dozen pieces . I have n't used the new one yet , I am afraid of breaking it too .	-1
This blade came with the FMM 250Q Multimaster I purchased . It lasted for about 2 months and then crack while I was using it to cut a thin sheet of fiberglass . Prior to that it had been primarily used to cut small pieces of wood . When I went to replace it I ended up with sticker shock . From my perspective , all of Fein 's accessories are WAY over priced . More and more I have been able to source these accessory items from third party manufacturers at more than half of Fein 's price and have found the quality to be as good , if not better than Fein 's . Even Fein distributors have started to complain about their pricing and have `` covertly '' started carrying and offering non OEM replacement options to their customers . The FMM 250Q is by far the best tool in its category . But from an accessory replacement perspective , its low priced competitors are starting and will continue to errod its market share .	-1
I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept , and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws , the cost , life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim . I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive , they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades , and improves the quality of the blades , that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight .	-1
This did not fit my Chicago electric ( Harbor Freight ) oscillating tool . It probably would have worked well if it did .	-1
This blade shattered around the hub after two uses . I liked the design but will not purchase it again .	-1
I expected a lot more from the Fein tool , it would be one of the best tools I own but the blades are junk and expensive .	-1
As others have said , this block plane is not shipped in a form that is usable . Mine came with a very rough concave sole ( as though someone without much skill flattened it with a 10-inch 20-grit drum sander ) , the mouth was so poorly made that the blade would not descend beyond the sole , and the movable gate needed some work.Here is what I did to get a descent plane:1 ) Using a plate glass & sandpaper lap , I flattened the sole . 100 and 150 grit did the trick . Took 3 hours.2 ) With a mill file I worked the mouth so that the blade would sit down properly and protrude below the sole . This meant removing a bump and some material where the blade rests just back of the opening . The blade , because it is thin , still flexes a bit when clamped and rises up , so there is still a little work I need to do . About 30 minutes of effort ... so far . I think this is the most important modification I 've had to do.3 ) The sliding gate fore of the mouth needed some file work to smooth its trailing edge ; it appears to have been sheared . Five minutes was enough here.4 ) Honed the blade , but that is a requirement for all planes.The plane seems pretty good now . I 'm still working to find the right tension on the clamp ; too little and it moves during use , shifting the blade laterally and altering the cut ; too much and the vertical adjustment screw turns only with much force.So , as a kit for a plane , 4 stars . As a ready-to-use plane , 0 stars . I gave it the average of the two .	-1
The reviews were mixed on this item , there were more positives than negatives so I decided to give it a try . The first thing I discovered was than the plane was made in Mexico . Just like other brand name tools , Stanley has taken their manufacturing of what used to be quality tools to foreign countries . No OHSA , no EPA , no vacation , no overtime pay , no employee benefits of any kind , just long hours until you drop dead and there is always someone waiting to take your place . SHAME ON YOU STANLEY ! There are just as many Mexicans in the U.S. as there are in Mexico so they did n't have to move there . Now for the tool , ... like others who expected a little quality in the tool , I found none . I fully expected to have to lap the sole of the plane , you have to do that with any new or vintage plane . It took a good hour of lapping to get the sole reasonably flat . The blade of course had to be honed as well . Upon reassembly I discovered that the blade does NOT extent below the mouth of the tool unless the mouth adjustment is set so the mouth is fully extended . Close it up just half way and the cutter jams against the mouth . So my question to Stanley is why is there an adjustable mouth when it is totally useless ? With the mouth fully opened up you can extend the blade to take a fine shaving , provided you have flattened the sole and honed the blade . The lateral adjustment is a joke as well . I had already flattened the soul and honed the blade before discovering the flaw with the mouth so I ca n't return it . My advise is buy a good vintage plane or one of the higher end planes unless you wanted to drop $ 40.00 bucks for a paper weight .	-1
Bought it to throw into my helper 's tool bag . Definetly not for precision work . Lock is flimsy , blade is thin , takes a lot of effort to set the blade depth to just where you want it . If you want a real block plane , go Veritas or Lie Nielsen !	-1
I should have probably sent it back but thought I could turn it into something useful . It it is definately not the plane I expected , even for this price which was $ 30 when I bought it . This plane is beyond rough - there is a tremendous amount of work to do to get it even usable . The blade is misshapen , skewed , dull , and the body is rough . I 'll flatten the blade and sharpen it and flatten the sole but for the work it will take , I should have bought a Lee Valley for this one.Sept 07 - I finally got around to working on this plane . Took a little more than an hour to flatten the back of the blade ( ca n't get it completely flat ) and hone the bevel . I also lapped the sole of the body . It works slightly better now , but it 's a very crude adjustment . With more work , I could probably improve a little more , but I felt it was more work than it should have been . Patrick Leach who is arguably the authority on planes really dislikes this model too . This one works now , but definately nothing to write home about . Ca n't say I would ever reach for it other than scraping glue and frankly , I have a # 80 cabinet scraper that does a better job at that . I 'd give it away , but there is no sense frustrating someone else.June 2010 - Gave it away , with a disclaimer to the new owner .	-1
This plane is an absolute piece of junk . It came with the blade looking like it had been sharpened on a brick . I spent a half-hour honing it to a clean edge , put it back in the plane , spent ten minutes setting the gap and adjusting the blade ( it has no in-out adjustment screw , and the gap ca n't be adjusted with the blade in the plane ) , and after four passes over a maple board , the blade had nicks in it . The city of Sheffield should sue Stanley to make them take the city 's name off the package . In addition to the difficulty of setting the plane up , the blade is over a 32nd of an inch wider than the body of the plane , so you must either grind or file the blade down to match the width of the plane body , or spend ten minutes resetting the blade every time you change directions .	-1
I bought a roll of this a few years , not 100 % sure it is the same brand , but I had no issues with my previous rolls . I ordered this 80 and 220 grit rolls and both are tearing up the pad to my dewalt vibration sander . The glue seems to be a bit much .	-1

It seems as though these discs do n't last as long as the editorial sais . You 'll need to buy twice as many to get the job done . I might of got a batch from a bad lot , but I think I will stick with Norton from this point on . I am very disappointed in these discs .	-1
I bought three different grits and have used two of them . I feel the abrasive on the disk wears off to soon . They 're cheap enough but you 'll use twice as many . I expected more from a product made in Finland . The ones from Home Depot ( Norton brand I think ) last longer .	-1
This sand paper leaves a lot to be desired . If you have a lot of sanding to do you had better purchase a lot of these sanding discs . In no time it seems they are all used up and are n't doing the job . I might have got these from a bad lot , but I think I will stick with Norton .	-1
I now use exclusively 3M sandpaper after receiving a sample at a trade show , you have to use three Mirka sandpaper disc for every one 3M sandpaper disc . I used to think sandpaper was sandpaper did n't make a bit of difference who manufactured it , I was wrong .	-1
I tried out the 80 grit pad for a couple of minutes and the disk was almost used up in this time spent on my DA . The dust collection holes are placed properly and allow most of the dust to be collected in my filter bag . They work almost as well as my cheap ones from Harbor Freight , but that is n't saying really . I would not buy these again as they have such a short lifespan and the fact that I have picked up 100 sanding pads from HF recently for just $ 4 plus tax . I will update as I use more sanding disks over time .	-1
They just did n't hold up . The first time i ordered them they were fine , but the second batch just fell apart . I would recommend buying a brand name from a store like Coastal tool in West Hartford , ct. You can buy them on-line and i do n't think you will get them at a better price . In sandpaper , you get what you pay for .	-1
They fell apart . The backing separated from the sandpaper . I would n't buy them again . You should go to a good woodworking store . I recommend going on-line to Coastal Tool in West Hartford , CT. Great store , great prices and you can buy these in bulk and save a lot of money .	-1
I have been using Top-Cote for years and it works very well and produces a slippery surface that inhibits rust . Does not prevent rust if your tools get wet , but its not supposed to . I ordered a can after not being able to find it at any of my usual suppliers . Although I ordered Top-Cote and the Amazon.com order confirmation I received said I ordered Top-Cote , I was sent Glide-Cote for the same price even though Glide-Cote sold for $ 8 less per can . I was never told there was a substitution in the product being deliver and never asked if the substitution was okay . When I questioned it , I was given the run around by Hartville Tool and was eventually give a refund of $ 1.95 . I will not be ordering any product from Hartville Tool again nor any anything from Amazon that is fulfilled by Hartville Tool . While I have had good experiences when ordering from Amazon , I think Hartville Tool has a lot to learn about customer service and honesty .	-1
Fine woodworking rated this glue as the poorest woodworking glue by far . Has less than HALF the strength of Titebond 3 glue ( the best ) . I also found that it quickly dries up in the bottle .	-1
Gorilla glue might be very strong but it is not user friendly for woodworking . It has some major drawbacks . It is not water soluble so you can not wipe the excess with a wet rag ( I had to use lacquer thinner ) . It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially , you are still going to have it coming out of the joint . Do n't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps , as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move . The bottle cap is cheap and it broke at the bottle when I tried to pull off the cap ( which of course glued itself to the nozzle ) .I 've gone back to conventional woodworking glues and the new ones ( tite-bond ) are very strong so there is no real advantage to Gorilla glue .	-1
... you get a piece of plastic laminate covered fiber board that does not even sit flush with the top of the table saw ( it sticks up about 1/32 '' ) . Supposedly this device is supposed to help stabilize the saw blade ( especially a thin-kerf blade ) , reduce chipping and noise . This may be true , but then it should be a standard feature that comes with the saw rather than the regular insert . I would skip this and build one yourself for a fraction of the cost .	-1
VERY LIGHT WEIGHT , almost flimsey . Save over half , buy from Harbor Freight if you must . Most all products , `` BIG HORN '' , are available from Harbor Freight at half price or less ! ! !	-1
For birthdays and other holidays my Sweetheart , kids and grandkids usually buy me woodworking tools . Even though I usually provide them with a list , occasionally things go bad.This jig is one of them . One of the legs was bent out of the box , took some creative straitening methods to get it to work at all . Finally got it assembled and working , sort of . This thing is too flimsy to be of any serious use . Does n't have enough mass to use it on large leg sections . I 'm afraid the push tab will bend . Adjusting it by eye is not a big deal , but the flimsy lock mechnism does not instill confidence in a repeatable cut . The whole thing flex 's when you push the piece thru the saw . After wasting a couple hours and a few pieces of scrap wood , I decided this jig should go back . Unfortutely it was purchased at HD , who would n't take it back , since it had been assembled and used . So on my way out the store , I tossed it in their dumpster . I 'm going to make my own out of some hardwood and brass fittings . I know I can make something a lot more useful than this . Ca n't recommend this jig , except as a model of what not to do .	-1
This is garbage ! I should have listened to the reviews on here.. It 's cheap . The build quality is bad , and it 's just not big enough for larger pieces of work . Typical crappy quality that we are seeing more and more of from guess where ... .I can not recommend this at all.-Nigel	-1
I rate this half-a-star simply because it was a 'set ' as advertised . That is the only thing the manufacturer/distributor got right . The push block and the stick can be made at home for cents . The featherboard mounting system is a total failure . There is no way you can lock the featherboard to the table slot and have it be a reliable , working accessory . I 'm amazed this set is still offered for sale . In my opinion , the loose and unreliable featherboard is quite possiblly an accident waiting to happen . Not mine . It is at the landfill .	-1
Do n't buy this set unless you ca n't get the stick and block separately . The featherboard is complete trash and should be thrown away immediately . I have n't used the stick , though it looks like you could make a longer and nicer one in a few minutes . I do , however , use the push block all the time and have found it to be very useful . There are certainly applications were it does n't work that a custom one would , but that 's always the case . I can recommend the push block , could go either way on the stick and just put the featherboard in the trash and back away . Buy the other two separetly if you want them and save [ $ $ $ ] .	-1
I knew as soon as got this that the only things that would be useful would be the push stick and block . Buy it seperately . Bench Dog makes a great featherboard that is well worth every penny . It 's what I ended up getting and have been using for three months know with absolutely no problems .	-1
I bought this blade as general purpose blade due to great reviews . To my surprise this blade was the biggest disappointment . After I installed it I noticed that a few teeth were hitting my zero clearance insert . Spinning it by hand confirmed that it had a wobble . Anyway , I made some test cuts and the quality of the cuts were average at best . So I got the measuring equipment out and found a run out of .008 & # 34 ; . No wonder it cuts rough , should through this thing away . My old Freud 50 teeth combination blade which has seen several thousand feet of hardwood has less than .002 & # 34 ; run out.Amazon offered to send another one , but I chose not to go this route because it seems Forrest has a quality control issue . I have a whole collection of saw blades , but never had one with such run out . I do n't think it was damaged in shipping , because Forrest packages well and the packaging was pristine.I am going to order a Freud Fusion as replacement . We 'll see how that one performs .	-1
I purchased this blade about 12 months back and was thrilled with it for about one month . It cut through maple and cherry ( up to 2 '' thick ) `` like butter . '' And then it was dull and prone to all the trials and tribulations of dull blades ( kick-back , etc. ) . When it was brand new it cut better than any blade I have owned but at the price it should ! At the price , it should also have retained its edge for a lot longer ( I 've had really cheap ( Skil 10 '' ) and mid-priced ( Hitachi , et al ) blades last MUCH longer and some even started off almost as sharp ) .Again , for one month of 6 day a week use it was GREAT but it dulled much too quickly - regardless of the price ( and yes , I did clean and treat the blade at the end of each day ) . So , whyh pay the price unless it comes with free sharpening and a loner blade for the time it spends `` away '' every four or five weeks.If the blade cost $ 50.00 I would rate it 3 to 3.5 stars .	-1
I used this blade for cutting pine but It did not impressed me at all . I found my Freud industrial blade ( combination ) giving more clean cuts on pine.I guess most of the reviews were for cutting pine , but most woodworkers do n't use pine as it is weak / soft wood.After using this blade for one project with pine and Redwood , I did not felt the price was worth it . Nothing impressive at all..Save your money and get Freud combination at less than half the price or go for Oldham combination blade .	-1
Spent too much for this . Had Rockler 's stiffener which is 2 - two inch discs instead of one large one . Liked it better . As noted in other reviews , this product reduces the max saw height by about 3/4 & # 34 ; to 1 & # 34 ;	-1
I see no benefit whatever . It does reduce the depth of cut from whatever your saw allows ( 3 '' + ) to 2.5 inches . For cutting hardwood with minimal burning , Forrest recommends setting the blade as high as possible . The stiffener limits it to 2.5 '' cut .	-1
I tried this for serveral applications with work stations and also for my primary purpose when i bought it originally behind my miter saw . It really is not big enough to be effective in any application ... and really thats my fault for buying it thinking 13x16 was a good size ... so think about your application before taking the plunge or end up owning it like i do and be looking for a good use ...	-1
Seems awful simple to use , but I am finding more challenges than desired . The biggest challenge is finding the right size hose to attach . Does the outlet pipe adapter have to be so large ? The hood does n't come with any hose and the outlet will swallow two or three shop vac hoses . That means buying expensive really hose from a woodshop supplier or trying to find the right adapters at the local hardware store . Why not design the hood to work with a shop-vac , the most commonly available piece of dust control equipment in the majority of home workshops ? Second , finding out how to place the hood so that it will actually collect wood dust is a constant struggle . There are no attachment points anywhere on the hood , so you have to drill your own . Trying to balance the weight of the hose and get the hood to remain close enough to the machine 's discharge stream is quite the challenge . I am sure I will eventually figure the Big Gulp out , but until then , I have to say it is not one of the favorites in my shop .	-1
This is a good quality hose and it will replace the worn out hose that came with your shop vac but there is something else to consider . Although this hose will fit into a standard shop vac the accessories that came with your shop vac such as the extension tube , crevice tool , etc . MAY NOT FIT THE OTHER END OF THIS NEW HOSE ! only Mr. Nozzles accessories or accessories that use a 1 1/2 & quot ; I.D . hose end will fit this hose , and Mr. Nozzle does not have alot of accessories to go with this hose so you may end up with a great hose but a poor nozzle etc . at the end of it .	-1
HOSE FLEXIBILITY IS GREAT . THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS WITH THE 2 NOZZLES . THEY ARE CHEAPLY MADE . THE THICKNESS OF THE MATERIAL IS JUST OVER 2 LITER PLASTIC SODA BOTTLE THICKNESS . THEY ALSO DO NOT FIT WELL ONTO HOSE END . DIFFICULT TO SEAT . THEY DO NOT STAY FIXED EHH	-1
I gave away my Ridgid shop vac as soon as the Fein box arrived from Amazon.com . That was a mistake ! ! ! ! ... this vac is too delicate to use `` hard '' during my kitchen demo/remodel - and I got so frustrated with the filter and small 1-1/4 '' hose constantly clogging , I gave up and bought another Ridgid vac . I think this vac would work great for woodworking , but general construction site conditions far out tax this machine , and it 's difficult to get filters/bags ... ..	-1
I 've had this model of vacuum for 8 or 9 years , and when I decided to purchase another for my business I ordered it through amazon.It arrived in a box with ZERO protective packing . Not a bit of foam or cardboard . Not a single bubble of bubble wrap.Guess what ? It was damaged . The hose intake plastic flange was shattered . I 'm sure the return policy is great -- blah blah blah . But it 's a hassle and I really needed the product when it arrived.So great vacuum , BUT I strongly advise against using Amazon to purchase it.-Steve	-1
I purchased this design over a year ago . You have to push the hose through the opening and clamp it into place from the inside . You can fix this with sealant and pipe or like I did with duct tape which will leak . I recently found another one at Woodcraft that is made much better and has fittings that you clamp the hoses onto . Brilliant ! Save yourself a major headache and disappointment and buy the one from Woodcraft .	-1
I have used this item for over a year and I am not all that happy with it.I have a Jet 1.75hp conected to a metal trash can ( ~30 gallon ) with the separator on top.Pros : The lids does n't fit the metal can all that tight but I used some form pipe covers to wrap around the top of the can secured with heavy duty double stick tape and it fits perfect . suction wo n't let go of this top so you do n't have to worry . Once you turn the dc off , the top is easily removed to empty the can.No dust on the floorTwist intake really not an issue I have found as a problemCons : My biggest problem is that the dust fills the DC bag more than the trash can ! ! ! The whole point of this exercise is to have the reverse be true . I have adjusted the length of tubing for both the intake from the machine and the tubing connected to the dc without any difference . I do n't know if the angles are such that the dust shoots in an out at such a rate of speed that it does n't allow the larger items to drop ? If you pickup a wayward screw you are ok because that will fall , but chips from planer go right into the dc without dropping to the can . Again , it does catch some of the chips , but my dc bag is filled with chips at a faster rate than the can.My next fix is to attach an elbow on the intake side to for the chips down , but I have n't read anyone else having this problem ... FYI	-1
I wish I had seen previous reviewer 's post about Woodcraft before I bought this one . After spending an afternoon trying to rig various fittings to this thing I finally decided , no , I 'm not going to have another duct tape covered Rube Goldberg eyesore in my shop . And so now , after paying $ 9.00 shipping to get it here and $ 17.00 to send it back , I purchased the Woodcraft product and paid whatever it is they charge for shipping only to discover that the same item is now offered on Amazon with free shipping . Color me pissed .	-1
I give it a star for price as I purchased on sale at a local Woodcraft store for $ 16 . However , I will be returning it . Woodcraft 's website says this fits 2-1/2 '' shop vac hoses . Wrong . A standard 2-1/2 '' vacuum hose is too small to fit over the connector and too large to fit inside it . In fact , they are similar diameters . ONly the fact that the cyclone 's connectors are a thicker plastic than the vacuum hose , make them somewhat different diameters both inside and out . I do not want to take time to force fit or search out adapters to make the connections work . It is also true the lid fits loosely on 5-gallon buckets and you would also need to rig a way to strengthen the fit so dust did not escape and so the lid did not fall off when hoses are moved or the bucket bumped . A total dud in my opinion .	-1
The material of this hose is slightly thicker than my garbage bags . Such flimsy hose does n't belong in a wood shop . Period.You either smash it mechanically or wood chips will do that . Again , this should not be sold for dust collection , maybe it works for laundry dryers .	-1
I do n't know why I bought this , even after reading the other reviews . The logic of the quick disconnect to move from machine to machine seemed cost justified . However , the product will disconnect while in use , and even disconnect if not perfectly flat.Rather than use this product , avoid , avoid , avoid . Set your dust collection system up with & quot ; Y & quot ; or & quot ; T & quot ; fittings to each machine with blast gates to control the air flow . This hard wired system , even though it cost more , will be much better system to operate and use without hassles .	-1
I generously gave this 2 stars.I bought 1 of these because quick disconnect is a great idea , especially with my little portable dust collector and I wanted to see if this could work.I put it on my hose and tried to connect it to my Jet jointer and it just fell right off ! I pushed and twisted and it slid off again and again . Tried it on my table saw which has the dust port upside down which will actually help something fall off given the weight of the hose and gravity and it did fall off.I marched down to a local retailer that sells these and they all did the same thing on their equipment.Where these did seem to work better was connecting them to blast gates where the seemed matched to each other . They would not reasonably connect to any jointer or tablesaw outlet . I tried a half dozen different combinations.I wondered how a company can produce something that was a great idea but would n't connect to the equipment it was supposed to connect too . I thought I was using the wrong pieces or missing something . The sales people told me that some machines are different and sometimes things just work by trial and errror . That was hardly a reasonable explanation for me . I thought that all the parts from a given brand come from the same mold . I tried cross brands and they were all identical . 2 brands I worked with , Jet and Delta.So I thought that maybe I should make a pig tail to lay on the ground to plug into . That way gravity wo n't work against me in either situation.Before I wanted to waste money making pig-tail 4 & quot ; hoses I tried one idea . DUCT TAPE.I hate the idea of duct taping anything other than ducts but i did n't have anything too lose at this point.Here goes ... I wrapped one revolution of silver duct tape around the dust collection outlet of my jointer . This quick disconnect went on beautifully . I was shocked ! I think it does 2 things , It obviously increases the friction area to help make a tighter fit and it also is a different material and texture that seems to provide a better grip.2 hard . slippery plastic surfaces , the dust collector outlets from the machines are slick and tapered naturally making the attaching quick disconnect fitting want to slip slide away from each other . Seems that research and developement should have researched a bit better.I duct taped the outlet of my tablesaw as well and the fit seems fine . I believe I can enjoy quick disconnect ability now .	-1
These do n't work properly for me . After much frustration , I bought a system that has a positive locking mechanism ( & quot ; FazLok & quot ; quick disconnect fittings available from Wordworker 's Supply ) . The FazLock connectors work just fine with the PSI 4 & quot ; hose .	-1
This does not fit a standard four inch pipe you buy at your hardware store or in fact any store . Only flexable tubing . That can be really pricey getting a decent quality to hold up for an entire shop . I 'd recommend getting regular elbows locally if you do n't want to use boatload of duck tape	-1
None of this plastic fits anything I have bought in excess of $ 100 and I 'm going to go to metal at least it will fit together .	-1
I bought this hoping I could slide it onto the outside of my tablesaw dust port and attach my shop vac hose to it . Both the outside of this adapter and the outside of the tablesaw port are 4 '' . In other words it is a male to male connection . I could not find a female version.The solution I found was to get a 45 degree pvc plumbing joint for about $ 3 . I could not find any other plumbing part that fit snugly , all the others were loose . The elbow holds the reducer snugly as well as the port from the tablesaw . I epoxied the adapter to the pvc elbow . You can then tape or glue the elbow to your tablesaw port as you desire for your purposes . This method worked a lot better than spending another $ 25 on a 4 '' hose that I did not need.Here is a link to the part at home depot : [ ... ]	-1
my dust collection main tubing is 4 '' with a 5 '' hose connecting the 4 '' tube to the 6 '' dust collector inlet through reducers i reviewed before but i did not want those big diameter hoses connected to my machines so i decided to buy many of these 4 '' to 2-1/2 '' reducers so i could use my machines more easily . a must .	-1
I bought this 4 & # 34 ; to 2 1/2 & # 34 ; adapter to be able to attach a shop vac to a new band saw that has a 4 & # 34 ; outlet . This adapter is exactly the same size as the outlet , so it wo n't go inside or outside of the outlet . I will probably keep it and duct tape it in place as it I ca n't seem to find one any different . I know they exist because I got one with the chip collector on my DeWalt planer .	-1
The 4 inch end wo n't fit any of my tools . It is the same size as the tool dust collector . I am going to buy a piece of 4 '' sewer pipe to see if it will work to connect this item to my Dewalt Planer , Jet bandsaw , and delta joiner .	-1

These blast gates clog and are difficult to clean . After trying to get used to them they 're going to be given away . I hate these gates . They suck .	-1
On the positive side these are inexpensive , but on the negative side you get what you pay for . I ordered 3 . They are simply two plastic plates with sliding plastic plate between . Unfortunately on two of the three I think the Chinese were running out of glue the day the made two of the 3 . The two plates which were suppose to be glued together were not and the two plates immediately separated . Looks likes they used a drop of glue the size of a dime . I was able to fix by gluing together with PVC cement . So in the end they work fine , with some assembly required .	-1
The 4 & # 34 ; connection is at right angles to the floor and should be angled . Holding and using the sweep is ackward .	-1
These plugs arrived scattered throughout the box the Kreg jig was shipped in . Their container had been crushed before it was shipped . Many of the plugs were split and the ones that were not split were too rough to use . I put these plugs where they should have been from the beginning ; in the landfill . I like the Kreg jig OK but these plugs were totally unusable . I went to Home Depot and purchased a box of plugs made by a different manufacturer . They are in excellent shape and very usable . I have made many purchases from Amazon over the years with great results almost every time . This item though was literally garbage . I suspect the reader has gathered by now that I do not recommend these plugs .	-1
When I first saw this in a local woodworking store , I thought it was a pretty nice table for the money . Not the ultimate router table , perhaps , but pretty nice . Not cheap , by any means , but not quite as expensive as some , either . Certainly a step up from the `` benchtop wonder '' I had been struggling with these past years . That was in the store . Then I ordered one for myself.Now I know why Kreg has such a fetish about gluing all of their packages shut to the point that you just about ca n't get in them . They are trying to make sure you will not find out what a nasty surprise they have in store for you until you get home , and to make sure you wreck the package ( making returns more difficult ) when you do finally open the box.First was the assembly of the stand , and the attachment of the table top . There were things I felt that they should not have left for the purchaser to do , but that was not a big deal , and it went together readily enough.But then came the `` precision fence '' . When I unpacked that box , I was just plain p*ss*d off . Instead of being assembled , and lacking only attachment to the table and perhaps a little setup , what I found was a box of parts . Not assemblies to bolt together . Just parts . Kreg does not build precision fences . Kreg sells parts kits for people who would like to build their own precision fence . Which might be okay , if they said that loud and clear in their marketing materials . But they do n't . They tell you that you are buying a fence . Not a box of bits and pieces.Then , inspired by what I had found , I opened up the box for the Kreg precision miter I had also purchased . Yes , parts . Not as bad as the fence , mind you , but still , too many un-assembled parts.Keep in mind that like most people who would buy this product , I 'm not shy about putting things together . In addition to woodworking , I do machining and metalwork , welding , carpentry , and a lot of electronics fabrication too . But it really makes me mad to have someone steal my time to increase their profit margins.But more important than the aggravation , and the lost time , is that instead of a `` precision '' device , assembled by someone with a lot of experience putting it together , and a set of jigs available to make sure everything goes together perfectly , I am going to get something put together by a guy who has never built this item before , has no training , no jigs , and no experience with the product , someone likely to make a mistake or two - me . So I am NOT getting what I paid for , not even close . And then I remember that another reviewer mentioned problems with some fragile parts , so I am wondering what that portends for the assembly process.I have n't built out the fence or the miter yet . I was so angry I stopped what I was doing to post this preliminary review . I have a lot of Kreg pocket hole stuff , and while it is a handy product , I never was thrilled with the amount of plastic involved . It was my intention to make some additional purchases from Kreg , their clamping table , and their beaded face frame system , as well as the lift for my new router table . But this has me re-thinking my commitment to Kreg as a solution provider . I ca n't imagine what kind of DIY nightmare assembling the beaded face frame system might be.I suppose I will press on with the table . And I imagine it will be just as nice as it seemed in the store . But my feeling towards Kreg has changed , and I will not be nearly so quick to buy their products in the future . Just know that if you buy this table system , you are expected to be the assembly worker before you can enjoy being the owner of this product.CAVEAT emptor .	-1
... it sure did n't work for me . In spite of having balanced the wheels and having installed and carefully aligned machined cast iron V-belt pulleys , my Delta bandsaw still had an annoying vibration . Since the belt was old and worn and had taken a bit of a set , I figured that had to be the problem . So after reading the gushing reviews here , I bought a Power Twist belt . No dice . If anything , it made the vibration worse . Since it 's still a functional drive belt , I 'll give it two stars , but it certainly fell far short of expectations .	-1
Do n't get these guides if you 're planning on using 1/8 & quot ; blades . These guides are great for resawing and heavy cutting where you 're going to use a wide blade , but you ca n't use thin blades on these guides , so you can forget making really tight turns ( as in cutting a bandsaw box or when doing tight scrolling ) . Plus , the price of these guides will leave a sore spot where your wallet used to be.These are GREAT for specialized purposes where a wide blade can be used , but for general bandsaw work in a small shop where different blade widths are used commonly , I 'd rather have a good set of cool blocks and pocket the difference in the cost !	-1
Thought I was getting a deal when I purchased the 1-1/2 hp P-C plunge router set with table . You get what you pay for . No problem with router but the table is VERY sub-standard . The fence adjustment is LOUSY . One wing nut holds each sliding fence and is almost impossible to get it square to the working surface due to the slop in the design . Too much wasted time is spent both aligning the fences to the table and to each other . The lightweight construction ( cheap ) allows the table to move around quite a bit when running material thru ... be sure to clamp/bolt it down before use . The miter slot is rough and the slide is sticky . The only minor positive is the dust chute works adequately when connected to the shop vac.In hindsight , I should have bought the router alone and looked elsewhere for a quality built piece of equipment . Now I 'm forced to use it until I can build one that is suitable .	-1
Update - 9/28/2012 - A month ago , Amazon had theBosch RA1181 Benchtop Router Tableas a Gold Box special , so I bought one . The difference is amazing . It 's like comparing an Easy-Bake oven to a Thermidor . The Bosch is solid , with absolutely no play . It has a solid , one piece , extruded aluminum fence , versus the two piece one on the Porter Cable . The top is bigger , The power switch has two sockets - one for the router and a second for a shop-vac . It has a cast aluminum router plate that 's adjustable so it 's level with the table surface . Putting it politely , it blows this out of the water in every single dimension . And since they 're roughly the same price , I see absolutely no reason to purchase this instead of the Bosch.. Here 's my original review : *******************************************************************Although usable for some things , this router table has too many flaws to be useful for precision work.- Fence : The two sections are difficult to position accurately . Tightening the knob that holds each side to the table tends to move the fence slightly . Because they are independent , it 's a pain to line them up straight , tighten them down and get the cutting depth set correctly . If the fence halves are not aligned with each other , the out-feed side is ( by definition ) either in front of , or behind the in-feed side . If it 's in front , the work catches . If it 's behind , the router bit carves a bit deeper as the work leaves the in-feed fence and creates a divot in your work.- Table : A bit of roughness in the casting surface was easily fixed with some sandpaper , but should n't have been there in the first place.- Router mounting : The router base is screwed securely to the table , not to a separate plate . The holes are obviously spaced for a Porter-Cable router ... I use an old PC 690 router . There are a number of different inside diameter metal rings ( like overgrown washers ) that fit into the circular hole in the table ... you pick the ring that best fits the bit that you 're using . The top of the rings , though , is slightly below the surface of the table without any way to adjust them . That 's not much of a problem with a long board , but try cutting an accurate tendon when the height of the table changes around the cutter.- Legs : There 's no appreciable front to back wobble , but the legs have little rigidity side-to-side . Feeding a board through the router should n't also move the table sideways by 1/2 inch . ( Each side is bolted to the table top through two posts that project slightly below the strengthening ridges on the bottom of the table top . That provides them an excellent axis for the legs to wiggle . ) Drilling a couple of holes and bolting some bar stock ( a piece of wood would work just as well ) between the bottom of the two legs helped stabilize it . This obviously is n't a problem if you clamp the entire thing down as the manual recommends , but poor design is still poor design ... you 'll notice that competing router tables all have something that connects the right-side legs with the left-side legs.In summary ... I 'm an occasional woodworker and I do n't use this router table very often , but every time I do , I wish I 'd bought something else . There are better ones available in the same price range .	-1
I frequent a woodworking supply store and look at every table they have . I 've never seen a Rousseau setup put together to compare . I just went by the reviews and the claim by the manufacturer . It sounded like a good buy as well as a good idea.Ok , I 've had this base plate for about two years . Actually , it 's my second one . I called Rousseau and told them that I think the crown is too high and I think I 'm going to have trouble . They told me to route the opening a little lower so that the edges are are a little recessed and then the crown would be parallel to the table or a bit above and it 's supposed to work great . They even sent out another plate that less of a crown.Well , it sort-of works but my stock often catches on the lip of the recessed table . You have to carefully feed the stock along the table and watch for the catch . I 've shimmed up the corners , adjusted it every with way and am just completely annoyed with the way the stock rides up the crown and across the other side.Like one of the other reviewers noted , forget precision work . You need to have a completely smooth top without added variables that make a seemingly simple process a little extra complicated.If you 're cutting plain moulding it works fine . I 've cut a ton of bead moulding and coves etc . But forget divided light and anything that has parts that need to be assembled accurately.I 've since purchased an aluminum plate that fits my 9 '' x 12 '' opening and it works wonderfully . It costs twice as much as this Rousseau but more than makes up for the trouble .	-1
I have used this plate for 2 years now and it stinks . The crown in the plate is ok ... I do n't mind that , but the snap in rings are a bear . You have to use a hammer and hit it hard to snap them in and out . Last night I was hammering them out and the whole plate shattered . Now looking at Rousseau 's higher quality router lift I find that it has the exact same plastic top and the exact same snap in rings . Being a weird sized plate means I 'm now going to have to re-build the top of my router table to accept a better quality router plate . Spend the extra cash and get an aluminum plate with quality snap in rings . Also Rousseau 's customer service is a nightmare . This has a lifetime warrantee so I called to get get a free replacement after I broke it . 3 months and numerous phone calls later I FINALLY got a new one from them ... with the same stupid problem .	-1
This plate is a `` deluxe '' piece Junk ! The 1/32 '' + `` crown '' that the brilliant `` engineers '' decided to manufacture into this plate make 's any raised panel , edge , or joint forming work infuriating , and impossible to achieve accurately . It also looks very `` cheap '' , the top surface is very slippery , and it scratches easily . What initially `` caught my eye '' and made this plate appealing were the `` 2in1 '' plastic insert rings , they looked like a nice feature . They fit extremely tight though , and removal without a hammer or pry bar was not really possible unless you modified them . Needless to say , I returned it . I purchased a very nice machined 1/4 '' aluminum plate from Rockler instead that it IS flat , and has an very nice anodized coating . It works excellent ! I highly recommend that you save yourself the time and money I lost and do the same . Keep in mind that the aluminum plates also have different sized inserts you can buy or you can get a solid one that you can drill out for a custom size .	-1
The insert is as advertised but there is no sense paying for the name when the same product ( without the bubble ) can be had at Harbot Freight for 1/2 the cost . I use it but in the future I will opt for the aluminum insert + $ or the generic version - $ . The install was easy once I tossed the instructions . It works , it is well made , the inserts require a dead-blow hammer to remove and I will not purchase another .	-1
I purchased this two years ago . I actually have two of them . Part of my purchase was based on positive feedback from the postings below.Problem : This plate is NOT flat . The slight `` crown '' is enough to mess up any precision work . You can not do any type of miter work with this plate . You can forget about rail and stile doors . Just comes out sloppy and you end up wasting material ! Furthermore , the plate can sag with a `` memory '' effect over time , especially if a heavy router is left on the table.The rings are a bear to get out and do n't leave you with a lot of flexibility for the size of hole you may need.This is a mediocre product . It is relatively inexpensive , but will be wasted money if you buy this and get a flat ( e.g . al aluminum ) plate later on . Probably okay for routing that does not involve joinery or a great deal of precision .	-1
I urge you to either build your own router table or save up and buy a better one . The fence on this thing is a pain . I want precision when I play with my router and this table is anything but precise . The next bulk collection we have , thats where its going . Otherwise it was sturdy , the table face was nice , thou the screws to level the router were a pain because they kept unscrewing .	-1
I purchased this router table after reading many reviews on various products . I imagine most people completed their review prior to using it . The cabinet is beautiful , well constructed , and works well as a contractor unit . However , I needed to purchase the & # 34 ; large plate & # 34 ; in order to fit my router , and am now stuck with a plate that with poor clearance to its optional rings . The rings need to be shimmed every time you change them or your work witl catch on the plate . If I had to do it over , I would have spent the $ $ on an Incra table top/fence .	-1
I got my Bench Dog router table and I was super excited . I 've heard how great BD is and that 's why I decided on their product . First off when assembling I found that the metal piece that was used to support the router plate was manufactured wrong . They forgot to insert the bolts that allowed the leveling screws to go into the metal piece . After calling the company and sending them pictures I finally convinced them to send me a new piece . After getting this new piece I spent 30 minutes leveling the router plate . I COULD NOT level it no matter how many times I tried . I called them after putting a straight edge and I found the plastic ( or acrylic ) router plate was warped . After talking to the phone support they thought it was the plastic router plate . They sent me another one in the mail . This was covered in dirt as if it was used before . I could clean it up but even after installing it and spending at least 1 hour trying to level this darn plate it still wo n't level . I made a youtube video showing them my problem and how it tilts . They blame the screws not being level . Regardless how I adjust the bolts there is no way to get the rock out of my table . They refuse to help me any more which is REALLY disappointing . Stay away . I do n't know how one company can give such horrible support and so many defective parts . I sent them a video even showing them what I did and they still refuse to fix it . BUYER BEWARE ! ! !	-1
It 's a nice bag but no support for the bottom . I used to use it at work but not no more . If they make the bottom ridged it would be a 5 star .	-1
I have n't compared this to a lot of bags but I find it heavy and uncomfortable to want to carry those few things on a daily level ( I end up using a side bag instead ) and it 's a bit small to have a as a go-to bag for projects outside of the shop . The pockets are also too small to be helpful . I have stabbed under my fingernails a few times looking for bits , screws , pens and the like .	-1
The belt is light , padding is nice , but the buckle itself has started constantly coming unbuckled a lot on it 's own while I 'm moving around . I 've not even used it much , and the plastic in the buckle has just become very flexible/weak , and now it just unbuckles itself making the belt unusableMy advice is to get a belt buckle with prongs ( normal style tool belt ) , which would n't have this problem .	-1
Not sure why this product states a gatemouth or ridgid bottom ; the product I received has none of these features . The picture is accurate of what I received ; however , the description , and the majority of the reviews here are describing a previous/alternative version of this bag . A simple web search will reveal a photo of the actual `` gatemouth '' product ( with a hinged top ) , but i ca n't seem to find any venders on line offering that version of the bag . This is still decent bag , but probably not worth the $ 30 price tag . I 'll most likely RMA this product . Bummed ...	-1
I bought this apron and a couple others at Amazon and ended up returning all of them . On this model the neck is somewhat uncomfortable and the snap kind of cheap.I ended up going to Sears where they have either the waist double row apron and bib apron made out of heavy cotton canvas for $ 5.99 . The bib apron at Sears is all white .	-1
I am a handyman / residential contractor / woodworker . I own several Irwin QuickGrip clamps in various lengths from 10 '' to 36 '' . I use them on occasion but , because other clamps I own I perfer , the Irwins get only light use.I have found the 12 '' size is useful as an `` extra hand '' during the temporary positioning and holding of piece work . For example , the short versions are OK for holding boards down for sawing , or checking clearences in a partially constructed assembly.But , as a class , I have found these clamps to have weak clamping power . I do n't believe they can squeese much more than 40 pounds before the head slips on the smooth rail . The result is I ca n't use them for two common tasks I have : gluing , or forcing warped items into alignment prior to fastening . These Irwins are just are not strong or reliable enough for those jobs.Another minor , but troublesome , characteristic of the longer versions of these clamps is this : if you hold the clamp vertically head-down and press the release lever the jaw instantaneously drops open and the head hits the floor -- or your foot . Ouch ! So the short 12 '' size gets my luke-warm endorsement ( 3 stars ) . I would not repurchase any longer QuickQrip as there are much better clamps available for similar money .	-1
This is not an awful clamp . I have a number of them of different sizes . The one handed thing is just so important , these were the first ones I ever had with that kind of design . That said , they do n't work that well . The squeeze handle will not give you much pressure unless you have gorilla hands . They work okay new , but as they age they kind of get sticky sliding along the bar and harder to get pressure . That said , I ca n't say enough good about the Next Generation models . I 've had some of the heavy 600 lb models for a few years now and they are absolutely awesome , best clamps I own , use them daily . The ones with gray plates are the heavy models ( I have many of those ) , while the 300 lb models look to have a similar design but just a lighter bar and plastic build . Just vastly better though a bit more money . I 've not used the 300 lb-ers.These old lousy ones all seem to have big yellow jaw pads . Avoid . The nice newer ones all say Next Generation and have black outer jaw pads I believe . The heavy duty 600 lb series ones have gray covers with blue slogan , with full length parallel jaws . The 300 lb ones have blue covers with yellow print and shorter jaw pads .	-1
Hard to believe that Bessey could make anything less than a 5 star rating , but this one qualifies . It does HOLD the wood parts together , BUT it does NOT pull them together into tight contact . Good ONLY if you are using screws to pull the pieces together . Not good for gluing . Installing dowels does NOT pull the joint together.Wasted my hard earned money .	-1
The Bessey angle clamp requires that you align all edges and provide pressure -- all simultaneously -- while you tighten the one clamping handle . It is less convenient than corner clamps with two separate clamping handles to tighten separately . Their large surface area provides solid alignment , even if it also makes these clamps more appropriate for larger tasks ( e.g. , over one foot per side ) .	-1
I am a former Union construction guy , and I have done some demo in my day . This hammer while easy to use is shall we say gutless , I mean this thing has no power . If you only have a little bit to do , or you 're inside , it is better then nothing but do not even begin to think that this thing packs the same punch as a pneumatic hammer . But it is easier to use and much better inside for light work	-1
I bought this drill after my old Makita was stolen . I thought it would be made in either the U.S. or Germany -- Malaysia is not in Germany . This tool is a piece of JUNK . It is loud , but does not have any power . I have since bought a Milwakee , and the Bosch sits on the shelf gathering dust . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I recently purchased the Bosch 1005VSRK drill . I have a Bosch jig saw and am very happy with it . I figured the drill would be the same quality as the jig saw . Wrong ! When I tested my new drill I found that about 50 % of the time it would start smoothly and slowly as a variable speed drill should . I found that the other 50 % of the time the drill would hesitate then suddenly start up with quite a bit of torque and the speed would be fast . There seemed to be no way of knowing which way the drill would start which is a pain if you 're trying to start a hole in a very precise place . I was very unhappy with it , and returned it right away . I then did what I should have done in the first place . I bought a Milwaukee 3/8 & quot ; Magnum variable speed drill . I am extremely pleased with it.In regard to the Bosch drill I 've learned that this unit is made in Malaysia , and it does n't seem to be up to Bosch standards . When it comes to this tool you better pass this dog up .	-1
It surprised me that my new Milwaukee 6390-21 circular saw did n't come with a rip fence . I mean , every carpenter needs this essential accessory . But I guess this all goes to achieving the right price point to be competitive . So I ordered the only rip fence Milwaukee offers for this saw . The calibration markings are pretty good , it is strong enough , and the range of extension ( how large a rip you can make ) is about average . The annoying thing is that it doens't fit very well . When you tighten the thumb screw to secure it in position for a specific size rip , three things happen . The action of the thumb screw against the calibrated shaft causes the adjustment to change slightly as you tighten it , so you always have to double check visually and do a check-cut before starting the rip . Most carpenters will do this as a matter of course . But the thumb screw also leaves little dimples in the shaft that make repeated adjustments of the same or similar size somewhat difficult because the tip of the thumb screw tries to home in on previous dimples . And third , the calibrated shaft cocks slightly , so the guide ( that short part of the `` T '' that rides against the wood ) is n't level , but at an angle of about ten to fifteen degrees . Depending on how you support the work piece , this angled guide can get caught and trip up your cut . The circular saw itself is such a fine piece of equipment that this misfitting accessory is very disappointing . Milwaukee ought to fix this ; it ai n't rocket science . Nonetheless , with a lot of care , you can make it work .	-1
This is THE recip saw , from the inventors of the tool , look at all the reviews on here . So why have I burnt 2 up in a year , and I 'm just a weekend warrior ? While it was working , it was sweet : cuts well ( a comment about orbital action , I was told by support that it only takes effect with the pressure of being pushed into the cut , but I did n't notice any difference in cutting speed ) , toolless blade change , toolless shoe adjustment , anti-vibrating thingy , detachable power cord ( by the way , this is standard Milwaukee , I have a right angle drill and a grinder from them , makes it easy to replace if you ever cut through it , I wish more tool makers would do this ) and it just feels nice in your hands . What I 've got now is the blade does n't move at all and it makes a loud whirrr sound , I think it 's the clutch ( someone , somewhere told me that it has this to protect the gears , frankly I do n't think you could possibly hurt the gears , but on my dime to ship is a clutch cheaper for their service dept . to replace ? ) . Another possible cuplrit is the orbital action , for this reason you might consider the 10amp from Milwaukee which does n't have this 'feature ' , one less thing to break . Since this has happened to me twice ( the first time it was right out of the box , so I figured I got a lemon ) I came here to shop for a new saw and decided to see if this has happened to anybody else , but I guess not ( how could this be ? I was only making plunge cuts into solid logs ... ) Well I 'm off to shop for a new saw .	-1
Pros : o small size . In it 's minimal configuration - with the thumb rest removed - it is 5-1/2 '' tall , 1 '' wide , and 1-1/4 '' deep . With a bit installed it is still only 1-3/4 '' deep.o all metal construction.o magnetic bit holder grips bits securely.o customer support is responsive ( less than 2 minutes waiting on telephone ) and friendly.Cons : o reliability / build-quality issues . The item I purchased was defective ( see notes below ) .o it takes two hands to use this attachment , one to hold the screwdriver and one to hold the tool . Compare this to a lightweight angle drill/driver which takes just one hand . For the most part , this makes the tool useful only in very tight situations where an angle drill will not fit.Notes : The item I received is defective . The bit spins freely in both directions under no load , but does n't run in reverse ( counter-clockwise ) under even light pressure ( ie attempting to remove a # 8-1 '' wood screw ) . It does work fine running clockwise , driving the same screw into a wood block.The helpful person I spoke with at customer service said he suspected that a tooth was broken . He advised me to return the item and purchase the heavier duty 49-22-8510 . I 'm not sure if I 'll do that since that item is somewhat larger ( 2 '' deep ) making it less useful for tight spaces . Also , I own many tools ( Makita , Bosch , Dewalt , etc ) and it is extremely rare to get one that is broken right out of the box . Since this is my first Milwaukee tool , it makes me leery of the quality of this brand .	-1
I know people want product reviews , but I feel that this customer service issue is valid . The clamp works OK although the rotating handle is too short and manually pulling the strap out is n't as easy as it should be . Overall I give the clamp 4.5 stars because it does everything it should.I got this clamp on Saturday July 23rd . After opening the package I noticed that one of the corner clamps was missing it 's adjustable feet . There are two triangular `` feet '' that are missing from the corner brace . The other three were fine . I called Bessey customer service on Monday ( 25th ) morning when they opened . I asked the woman I talked to if I should send the clamp back to Amazon or if she could ship an extra corner piece to me . She said she had one on her desk and she 'd ship it out to me . I wrote an email to customer service on Monday August 8th stating that I have n't received the piece . The same day I got a reply that it was put in the mail and I should receive it by the end of the week . On Thursday August 18th I wrote back to confirm that the piece was sent to my address . The next day I was told it was sent via regular mail so there was no way to track it but they 'd send another one to my listed address . It is now August 25th , one month after calling Bessey customer service and I have not received the piece . I will ultimately be forced to buy the 6-pack of corner braces just to get the one I want.I 'm glad I bought Jet parallel clamps and Jorgensen bar and pipe clamps . *EDIT* I finally got the piece after several communications with Bessey and several people 's email addresses . More than a month later I was able to use my product . My advise is to ask Amazon to ship you a new one if you have the same problem . Dealing with Amazon 's returns is very easy .	-1
I have used several types of band clamps over the years . They all get the job done but the Bessey clamp does it faster and easier . A little pricy for the occasional user , but worth it if it you have a need often for a band clamp . You will probably want at least two.Joe Seidel	-1
I have tried to use this strap clamp on multiple projects and have not had any success . It 's either I do n't have 8 hands to hold everything and tighten it at the same time or it is beyond my knowledge base to operate . About the only thing it was good for was a miter cut box top or picture frame , something that can rest flat and that the plastic corners can lay on the bench top and tighten evenly . If its even a little off the plastic corners slip off the corner by rolling over the top or under the bottom . It 's like the moon and stars all have to align before I can get it to work as intended . I would not purchase this product again.Pat	-1
It works as intended . It works when you get it on ... . therein lays the core issue . Since i 'm not Octavius from Spider Man , fitting this onto a frame while tightening it is a Major Pain in the Chunk.When its on , its great . You simply wind the handle and you can squeeze that frame like the feared Kraken from Ulysses . It will creak for mercy.BUT there are design issues . The corner thingamabobs have a tendency to slip off . They do n't seem to grab the ribbon tight enough , so adjusting tension while doing the other 3 edges is an exercise in frustration . Getting the corners Just Right , then winding the large retractor a Goldilocks amount , THEN winding the red handle ... . man-o-man.Its an OK tool . It does the job , but if you are going to do this more than once , make yourself a cramping jig . You will lose less hair .	-1
Impossible to use . Need 8 arms or 2 assistants ... so fiddly . Need to ensure its & # 34 ; just tight enough & # 34 ; and then fiddle with the height , angle , etc all on top of managing the glue up itself.A decent idea , but it just does n't work .	-1
They worked fair . They arrived after I had all ready installed four cabinets.Bottom line , I was able to get a better fit with the plain old single clamps	-1
Too small if you have a 3 inch filler and the second set of claw clamps that is suppose to hold the face flat is to offset to be useful unless you are doing the simplest to frame line-ups !	-1
I bought a couple of these but so far I 've only used them for general things like clamping pieces of wood to my bench . I did n't notice any flex in the bars and they seem to hold tight.UPDATE 12/3/2013After using these clamps for a while now I 've changed my review from 5 to 2 stars . The main reason is that the bars now flex a huge amount even with light clamping pressure . The only reason that I 'm giving 2 stars is because technically they do still work but the bar bends quite a bit no matter what.I 've also had a chance to use some much older clamps of the size and model as these and those work perfectly without any flex in the bar at all . The bar is clearly much MUCH stronger on the old version.If you are considering these I would recommend the `` heavy duty '' clamps with the thicker bars .	-1
I generally do a lot of research and digging before I make a tool purchase . This has allowed me to build a collection of tools which I am extremely happy with . This clamp is the exception . I bought a pair of these based on the makers name and price . I should n't have . The & quot ; bar & quot ; on these bar clamps is flimsy . I bent one of mine the very first time I used it . I would never buy another one of these .	-1
I have several kinds of pipe clamps and these fit none of them.Make sure these will fit your clamps or they will be as useless for you as they are for me .	-1
The product description talks about the `` contact probes '' and it is described as `` pinless '' but it has two big pins that you poke into things to measure moisture , leaving holes in your drywall .	-1
Entirely misleading . This unit DOES in fact have pins . Even at that , I could n't get it to register on wood that I know was fairly green . Printing the return labels right now ...	-1
As a technology educator with more than 50 years of shop time , I can not recommend this grinder , unless smooth performance is not a criteria for you.I began by purchasing 2 DEWALT DW756 6-Inch Bench Grinders . The first one shook pronouncedly and made a metal on metal sound as it started up . Amazon customer service was very helpful and sent another the next day . Not as bad as the first , but this machine too vibrated too much..and the wheels visibly wobbled as the machine slowed . Removing the wheels in an attempt to discover the source of the vibration , I noticed that the grinding wheels had rather soft plastic inserts at their center . The Palmgren 's wheels had precisely drilled holes directly into the wheel itself , which is a standard mark of Quality in such things ! Both DeWalt 's went back to Amazon.Checked out Baldor grinders . Had one in our school shop . 30 years of problem free use with middle school kids ... . Superb quality but too costly for my budget ... .So I looked further.Then read reviews on the Palmgren 82061 . Not many reviews ... but the minor issues were asides rather than addressing any `` real '' problems.So I bought a Plamgren 82061 , and thought a small old company which makes only a few product lines , might be a better choice.When I unpacked the Palmgren and plugged it in ... ... . It ran very smoothly and the wheels had almost no wobble . No plastic inserts . Holes were accurately made in the wheel material itself ... .not plastic bushings.It also took an unexpectedly long time to slow to a stop . Good bearings , reasonably accurate machining , and a well a balanced armaturemight have something to do with this.The rest of the difference appears to be the result of better stones and cast aluminum inner wheel flanges which extend for 2 '' or so along the shaft back to the bearing area next to the `` motor '' section.DeWalt 's engineers thought that identical stamped cup washers with the inner ones resting on small shaft shoulders was a sensible approach to making a $ 100.00 class grinder.I disagree , and the folks at Palmgren demonstrate a better way ! In my estimation the Palmgren hits the sweet spot , combining good engineering , decent Chinese quality and a reasonable cost.Spend a few bucks more and experience the benefits of superior engineering.My son , who owns one of these Dewalts , was very impressed , and wished he 'd bought the Palmgren too .	-1
To their credit they sent me a new stone for free ( one extra star for customer service ) , but the unit wants to vibrate itself to death and is a pain to use because it 's hitting the material unevenly . Waste of money , wish I had n't bought it .	-1
Seems DeWalt has taken a hit in the quality control dept . I have some of their older tools that are markedly different from the build quality of their newer tools . Typical import quality here , nothing more than you 'd find at Freight by the Bay . The mounting scheme for the tool rests is comical . The rests themselves are far from square . One of the rests on mine required grinding to even fit the width of the wheel . All the metal and plastic parts are thinner and softer than DeWalt tools of old . Mounting holes in the base do n't line up . Mounting holes in the guards do n't line up . Paying more for Yellow plastic I guess .	-1
Why anybody would design an 8 & # 34 ; grinder with 5/8 & # 34 ; arbor is beyond me . Nobody sells wheels with arbor holes that small in an 8 & # 34 ; dia .	-1
I bought this based on the reviews and have had nothing but trouble . The wobble in the wheels is so overwhelming that it 's almost not usable , even after dressing the wheels . I took it apart and found that spacers on it were not true , so I ordered replacements . They were better , but the thing still has an unaaceptable wobble . I blame the design . This thing is junk .	-1
Only comes with router bit for 1/4 '' radius hinges which are virtually non-existent . Almost all hinges today are 5/8 '' radius . The 5/8 '' bit is impossible to find even on line , and as another reviewer noted , the manufacturer has no intent of making the bit available with 1/4 '' shaft . So , tool is basically useless unless you happen to be installing 1/4 '' radius hinges . Shipping back to Amazon . Guess I 'll revert to hammer and chisel . Makes me wonder what genius at the manufacturer ( DC Precision Tools ) is making the decisions ( so much for buying `` Made in USA '' ) .	-1
This corner chisel is designed well , but unfortunately it is not very well sharpened . It mashes wood fibers instead of cutting them . In the end , I went back to my flat chisel to square out the corners .	-1
It appears to be difficult to find a reasonably sharp corner chisel . The Porter Cable corner chisel is the same generic , Chinese-made corner chisel that everyone sells . Sometimes they 're sharp , sometimes they 're dull . More than likely , you 'll get one somewhere in between.Rather than gamble on getting a sharp Chinese-made corner chisel , why not buy a corner chisel that you can count on to be sharp : the Whiteside 9600 Corner Chisel ( WHITESIDE MACHINE 9600 SQUARE CORNER CHISEL W/ 3/8 SQUARE HARDENED STEEL CUTTING BLADE ) .I went through several Chinese-made corner chisels and butchered many test pieces before I discovered the Whiteside 9600 . Although it looks just like the Chinese version , the 9600 is made in the USA by Whiteside Machine Company . It 's extremely sharp , costs the same as the Chinese version , and is available on Amazon . Seems like a no-brainer .	-1
I had already written a review on this ladder system , but for some reason it was erased.It 's been almost a year since I bought my gorilla ladders ( the generic home depot version of the little giant ) & I could not be happier about it , I use my ladders day in & day out & they really perform in the same way as the little giant , those ppl who say that nothing compares to the little giant do n't know anything about ladders , the gorilla ladder is also rated 1A 300 LB and it makes for a better scaffolding base thanks to the hinges that come included with the ladder , my gorilla ladder ( Extension Height : 11'-19'Stepladder Height : 5'-9 ' ) + my extendable aluminum plank ( 8'-13 ' ) was cheaper than the little giant ! , about $ 340.00 all together , I was so satisfied with my first ladder that I bought a second one ! ( Extension height 9 feet to 15 feet , stepladder height 4 feet to 7 feet ) , I climb a ladder at least 4-5 times a day as I do home remodeling for a living , believe me I use my ladders much more often than many people here , there 's no doubt the little giant is a good ladder system I just would not pay the extra money for the same quality so save yourself some money , the shipping time & go to the home depot & get yourself a gorilla ladder you wo n't be sorry ...	-1
First , I checked littlegiantladder.com prior to ordering this ladder ( http : //www.littlegiantladder.com/little-giant/type-1a.html ) I purchased Model 26 - 10126LGW - which is marked ( Made in the USA of foreign and domestic parts . ) - I only buy `` Made in USA '' because I demand quality . I received 10126LG ( marked on the ladder ) - somewhere we lost the W. Though the part number on the box reads 10126LGW . I do n't know if that makes a difference.In any case the label on the ladder clearly says `` Proudly designed and engineered in the USA . Made in China . `` Had I known this is what I would receive I would never have purchased it . In inspecting the ladder ... .my father was a welding instructor , he worked on nuclear power plants..he trained people to work on nuclear power plants - he is a top notch professional who took pride and responsibility for the quality of his work - he can weld like art . I can see one weld on this ladder that is broken and never should have passed inspection . It 's not worth the money . I would n't even give it to someone I did n't like . I would NOT recommend it . I gave it 1 star because it would n't let me give it zero . I am ashamed of this ladder.Amazon.com however I commend - they scheduled UPS to pick up the ladder for return which they did the very next day.Still I am disappointed with Little Giant . Yes you can make ladders here in the USA with quality materials and workmanship . stokesladders.com , metallicladder.com , duosafety.com	-1
Bought two thinking would use on two ladders on 10:12 new roof . As with the other reviewers found that a pair is needed for each ladder.Good point : the wheel swivels.Otherwise : the radius of the hook is too tight and can not think that this will handle ridge vents ; the bearing material on the end of the hook ( angle iron ) is too sharp and will cut felt ; the adjustment of the bearing material is impractical - thought that if I loosened the bolt ( the nut is of the locking type so presumed this is the designer 's intention ) the angle iron would adjust to the roof , instead one end swiveled into the vertical position and gouged the roof surface ( am using the ZIP system so surface damage has to be repaired ) .What to do ? Looked beyond Amazon and bought the ACRO 11081 Roof Hook . One per ladder . None of the problems with the above . Only possible con is that the wheel does not swivel : so far not a big deal .	-1
Why would anyone spend 80 bucks on something a 2x4 and a couple of screws could handle ? The way I do it is mount a 2x4 ledger to the wall at my level line , set the cabinets on top so the 2x4 holds all the weight AND its pre-leveled so I do n't have to worry about that while lifting . Once its on the 2x4 , you can hold up a several hundred lb . run with one hand . Then a single screw up top of the cabinet run keeps it from falling off while I screw in the rest . Any way you approach it , its still a 2 person job unless its just a single cabinet.Are there any other good uses for this thing that I 'm not seeing ? I mean , I did n't buy it so I would n't know.. just looking for others input on the matter .	-1
I bought this T-jak with the intention of mounting my kitchen wall cabinets without having to get help from someone else . However , after seeing how the T-Jak worked after I received it I ended up returning it to Amazon.The orange quick-release knob that one sees in the diagram works in one of two ways . It can be used to raise or lower something on the pedestal by turning it on the treaded rod & # 8211 ; one screw thread per turn . If you tilt the knob the screw grooves disengage and you can slide the knob ( and the platform ) freely up or down the threaded rod . At the desired height you tilt the knob and reengage the screw grooves and fine-tune the height by turning the knob . ( Although this knob is rather ingenious in design , tilting the knob takes some practice . If you are not mechanically inclined , working this knob could be a problem . ) Although there is no doubt that the T-jak can be used to put up light cabinets ( and it can support up to 400 lbs . ) , I don & # 8217 ; t see how one person can lift a 50 lb cabinet onto the T-jak pedestal and then raise it to the necessary height without help from another person . After getting the cabinet to the proper height you ( or someone else ) still have to hold the cabinet against the wall ( or clamp it to an adjacent cabinet ) .The first T-jak I ordered arrived without the screw rod included . The second T-jak arrived with an extra screw rod included . Both packages were coming apart at the seams when they were delivered.Although I am a proficient do-it-yourselfer , I decided the cost of my wall cabinets justified hiring 2 professionals to put them up . One person pushed and held the cabinet up against the wall while the other person screwed them into the wall and screwed the face frames together .	-1
The handle is too short to use when rolling a 4X8 sheet of plywood . You have to bend over so much to reach it that you ca n't see forward enough to roll it . It is built solid and would be outstanding if the handle was around 7 '' longer . The small wheels limit the tool for use on flat hard surfaces . Will not roll across thick grass . If the handle was extended this would be great !	-1
I purchased these for a select grade Bruce 3/4 '' solid floor install in our home . Initially they worked OK for pulling less than straight boards into line with those already installed . They would not pull too hard , but enough to get a board into place close enough that the pneumatic stapler would do its thing . After less than 200 square feet of installation ( = light use ) , two of the straps started to fray , making use difficult at best . The cams also became less reliable , requiring fiddling around with them to work properly , and the metal portion that hooks on the tongue/groove portion started to pop off with ease , sending them clattering along the floor . In the end I ended up purchasing some no-name flooring clamps that cost much less and lasted longer ( still going , I might add ) . Twice I inquired with Bessey via email , but never heard back . Shame as the Bessey clamps of years back ( the original K-body clamps in particular ) were well made . I do not recommend these clamps and suggest looking elsewhere .	-1
Black and Decker is a vey reputable name . But this product does not live up to the brand name . The clamps are fastened with threaded screws into plastic slides that hardly hold the clamps in place , any pressure and things start falling apart.If I could return it I would , unfortunately I put it together well after the return period had expired.I ca n't imagine how this product is rated at 550-pound capacity.I would not recommend this product as a shop tool .	-1
Shame on B & D for selling a piece of junk mechanical bench . AND shame on me for not looking at all of the reviews to understand the difference from the original workmate . I own an original and expected good quality . Why would a company change from a WINNER to such a POOR LOSER ? Cheap metal , rough cut in places , thin cheap wood compared to the originals , an adjustment system that is based on a PLASTIC belt ( wow ! ) and handles that adjust as one . I have read that if you crank the handle that would tighten on the smaller end of an angled piece of wood , the wider side slips off of the plastic crank and when the board is almost tightened you use both handles to tighten securely . Does n't sound good to me . I would have rather spend a little more for the old original workmate than this piece of junk . I will be buying a `` jawhorse '' and sell this new workmate on craigslist .	-1
My wife got me this for Christmas , which is today . First the instructions were the worst of anything I have ever seen in my life . Once I got it together , the surface is not level , the boards do not align properly . The handle part where you bolt on the last board were not even so I had to take that all apart and due to the tension on the bolts , it was a serious pain in the butt . To top it all off , when I raised the front bench to make it 90 degrees the first time , the whole orange handle mechanism completely fell off and I ca n't figure out to get it back together so anytime I want to use the handles the whole thing lifts up instead of being locked in position . I seriously feel like throwing the whole thing in the garbage !	-1
I purchased mine from Lowes . I was not impressed with it from the start . The boards that make up the top are never level with each other . They are made of some kind of Chinese bamboo plywood and two of them sag in the middle . As for clamping ... terrible . It would n't hold anything still . The metal frame is made fairly well but I found that mine was twisted and parts were not connected properly . After some tinkering I got most of the kinks out except the sagging top . Still , I wish I had returned it based on my first impression . All you are likely to use this for is a work table and it is a bad one at that . I would not recommend this product to anyone .	-1
Like many reviewers , I once owned the original Workmate . I loved it , and eventually gave it to my son . I ordered this one with trepidation , knowing that Black and Decker has not made a quality product for several decades . This bench arrived slightly bent , even though the shipping box did not appear damaged . Several parts fell out of the box when it was opened . These were parts that were supposed to be attached at the factory . The assembly instructions were confusing , and nearly useless . The concept of the Workmate has always appealed to me . The execution of that concept in this current product is pathetic . I can not recommend the WM 425 in any way . Additional observations after a month of use : This workbench is truly a joke . It is so poorly made that I am constantly fiddling with it to get it to work right . As far as I am concerned , it is a disposable item , and that 's exactly how I intend to treat it . As soon as I finish the current auto re-upholstery project that I am using it for , I 'm going to set it out at the curb for pick-up by the local scrap metal hauler . Might as well re-cycle the steel into something more useful .	-1
I needed a workbench in a pinch as I had n't built mine yet and this received adequate reviews . After a couple months of using it , I should 've waited . Putting it together was n't too bad . The only tricky part was the the `` vise '' where it was tough to get the plastic lined up with the gear shaft . It 's hard to clamp things to it because of all the over hanging metal . You ca n't clamp things to two entire sides because something gets in the way . It seems sturdy but at certain angles it 's tippy . For example , on the box cover , there is a picture of a door being held by the table . For kicks , I tried this with a door sitting in my basement and it immediately fell over . I tried it with a 2x2 birch plywood and the same thing while it did n't fall over , a very small bit of pressure on the end ( where , for example , I 'd want to route the edge ) made it tippy . There 's no way I 'd want to do any power tool work on this as I just do n't trust it to stay stable . Nevermind getting a clean cut -- I 'm talking about cutting myself.The bench dogs work well but only for limited size pieces . I guess if you 're a model builder you 'll be OK , but anything bigger than a jewelry box will have issues with it . It 's also too small to use as a sit down bench . It has worked well as a small outfeed table for my table saw but for that I could 've just used a sawhorse . Bottom line is take the $ 90 you 'd spend on this , buy yourself some wood , and build something bigger , better , and more stable than this thing . If you do n't want to do that , buy yourself a small kitchen cabinet and screw a top onto it . You 'll have a much more stable and functional work surface .	-1
First , I got this at a deep discount , so am writing a review in context of the price that most pay . So lets start by saying that the instructions are crap . They have useless drawings and even have errors in the text . ( mislabeled parts-top block vs. front block ) Again , I had to giggle since there are only a dozen parts to put together , so it should be a cinch , right ? Well , my friend and I were laughing at first and then later we were just plain annoyed at why this should be so difficult.My friend is a process engineer and writes complex instruction manuals for a living . he could not believe that any quality control was asserted during the writing of the manual ! On to the nitty gritty : So , After we discovered that the belt-drive that makes the handles turn together was mis-aligned , we set to fixing that first . once that was done , we got all the boards on top . None of them lined up well . The cranks to tighten the work clamps are not going to last because they are cheap plastic `` snap-ons '' . The belt skips constantly , and is cheap plastic . The wood surface has numerous flaws as well . The metal frame is banged up too , despite the box being fine.Grades : Directions- D-Assembly ease- DQuality- c-Stability- BUsability- BValue- D+ ( or a B+ if you got the lightning Deal ) Overall- C-Now that being said , I just bought this to hold my miter saw . It will work fine for that purpose and the price was fine . Otherwise it is just the classic , `` made poorly in china '' junk that once reputable companies are putting out nowadays .	-1
... from what these used to be.Like most products that used to be made in the USA , Black & Decker has seen fit to manufacture the WorkMate in China . And it shows . Those of you unfortunate enough to have bought this piece of junk because you did n't know any better ... I feel your pain.I still have my old original WorkMate table ( a model 300 ) that is fast up on the quarter century mark . And it works better in every respect than the 7 year old model 425 I received as a gift . The steel on the 425 is rough edged and thin , all pivot points are pop-riveted and , after seven years of use , so tight it is still difficult to open the table . The ergonomics of the opening latches are such that you have to push down on them while trying to pull up on the table to release it ... nothing beats third world design . The larger bamboo wood table insert warped within a year . The overall fit , finish and function of this WorkMate is rough and cheap ... such a far remove from the originals . Had this not been a gift it would have been returned . I certainly would n't recommend this waste of steel to anyone.What a shame.B & D ; invented the WorkMate ( or at least brought it to market ) and it was a great tool to have for DIY 's and Pro 's alike . The fact the originals are still around and working is testament to how well they used to be made ... and made here in the USA.My advice if you want a *good* WorkMate ? Find one of the old originals in the aisles of everyone 's favorite auction site or score one from a garage or estate sale . As long as people keep buying the cheap Chinese-made junk U.S. tool manufacturers are footing ... the manufacturers will keep making cheap Chinese-made junk .	-1
I have one of the original aluminum die-cast Workmates ( made in Great Britain in the 70 's ) that had seen its better day . So I went with this `` updated '' model from Black & Decker . What a joke and an extremely poor excuse for `` progress '' . It 's mostly made of cheap stamped metal and plastic parts that make for a very rickety and unstable platform that is a mere wisp of the original Workmate . It came damaged , and I have since had to replace several plastic parts to keep it some form of working order ( such as it is ) . When I finally get some time , I am going to refurbish my old Workmate and junk this POS .	-1
Very poorly constructed . Flimsy sheet metal . Catches on the underside of the jaws do not engage securely into the holes in the frame . Adjusting screws were poorly aligned so that the first attachment of the moveable jaw left it crooked and required some disassembly and adjusting on my part . Reasonably sturdy with all 4 legs on a flat floor , but I suspect it will prove wobbly on an uneven surface . Definitely not for the serious DIYer who works with heavier items . Next time I would look for something much sturdier . Made in China .	-1
The Black & Decker Workmate 425 provides a sturdy durable working/clamping surface , however , there are several design flaws that make it less practical . The first being the instructions . They are poorly written and are in very small print . They are confusing and it took two of us a couple of hours to figure them out . We finally succeeded in putting it together without the instructions.The top working surface is cheap fiber board , not hard wood . The frame is steel but the attachments to the top are very breakable plastic parts . The top clamps are made of cheap plastic also . I do n't think the clamping pressure is suitably strong enough for holding glued surfaces tight.As a whole , considering the money spent , I do n't think that the poor quality of construction is worth the price . It 's like a glorified TV dinner tray . I would n't buy another one .	-1

Here 's a couple of things the pictures wo n't tell you:1 ) The vise handle , track and pin and quite loose and plastic . Once you install the handles on the item you ca n't take them apart again as they are held in with pins you have to hammer in.2 ) The area between the two ends on the vise planks opens only between 4-6 inches so you can only hold something thats between 4-6 inches wide3 ) The alignment on mine was off by about 1/4 '' which is a lot considering it 's supposed to double as a vise4 ) Overall I 'd say this item is not really suitable for any kind of serious work . Might be good as a kid 's play thing	-1
My old Workmate worked easily . This new Workmate being top of the line , WM425 , should be at least as good . It is crap . The top is cheap , thin material , not even cut to square . I could replace the top but the vise is flimsy and so poorly designed and manufactured that I have to crank it with both hands . I took it to a B & D Service Center to ask if I can substitute a top from an old Workmate . They young man there had never seen a Workmate and had no idea what it is for . Do not buy .	-1
Ordered a set of these based on the almost unanimous 5 star reviews . Packages came with the dreaded & # 34 ; Made in China & # 34 ; sticker applied to the box . Sure enough , all 4 were mis-welded so badly that they would not fit a 2x4 into the top . Every single one had the top bracket at all sorts of random angles so they were nowhere near parallel . One had a gap of & # 60 ; 1 & # 34 ; where you insert the 2x4.No quality control . Another quality brand down . If someone knows of a good alternative , please post it .	-1

After reading all of the reviews here I bought the 2700XL for my Makita 2703 . I thought that it would be an improvement with regard to the fence and add some much needed table space . I realize in retrospect that I should have just sold the 2703 and bought a new saw . Here are the issues : Fighting with the nylon mounts - Rather than attach to your table saw in any stable fashion it is designed so that your saw rests on nylon ring mounts . These are extremely frustrating to get set up properly for a tight fit . As you screw in the bolts ( from underneath the table ) the rings invariably move throwing you out of square . Right off the top of my head I can think of a half dozen ways this could have been done better . Poorly done.Even more poorly done - what I would call a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW : there is absolutely no way to level the 2700XL to your table saw . After I was done fighting with the nylon mounts I was horrified to find that the 2700XL table sat a good 1/16 '' below my saw bed . Try moving the fence across and `` clank ! '' Its a `` no go . '' What 's worse - apparently not anticipating this , Rousseau incorporates exactly ZERO ways to adjust the height of the table or saw to correct for it . I was able to get around this eventually by unscrewing the 2700XL table and inserting washers underneath . Again , I can easily think of several ways to prevent this - for example , mounting the table on adjustable thumbscrews . Makes you wonder what they are paying their engineers for ( ? ! ? ) Poor instructions - Although it was not mentioned in the relatively meager instructions , there are hex nuts that you can adjust to square the fence that are hidden on the inside of the fence . It took me a few weeks to figure that one out . Perhaps if I was a table saw pro I would have known that but why not include it in the instructions guys ... why ? One positive thing I can say about this product is that it seems sturdy when the legs are unfolded . Also , once set up correctly the fence seems pretty accurate . This is NOT , I repeat , NOT a portable solution . Heavy and no wheels . Very unwieldy to move around and no wheeled base is available.In the final analysis , I am not sure why anyone would buy this rather than just get a better saw in the first place . The onyl reason I could think of would be to have a bigger table stand at home and be able to pick up the saw and go with it ... I would just have two saws . For me this was throwing good money after bad .	-1
This is an example of a good idea badly implemented . The clip slides up and down the tool belt and the hook bends easily . I stopped using it after having my Panasonic drill fall to the ground twice . Should have used steel , not Aluminum for the hook and come up with away to keep the clip from sliding . Unfortunately , this is useless .	-1
Indeed , this is changing a 5 star review to a two star . I got one of the last Japan-issue versions , and planned on keeping it forever . However , this did n't pan out . The new China version is very poor by comparison . First , the cat 's paw does n't have the close tolerance of the original . It ca n't get small trim nails . In fact , the whole effect seemed dramatically different and I gouged the hell out of some plywood ( did n't happen with original ) . Next , the ultra-thin blade is not so thin at all . I have other prybars by Hyde and Red Devil which win handily now in terms of thin-ness . Finally , the blade was actually ground differently on the inside edge , a clear sign of sloppy craftsmanship , it was maybe 3/32 different on one side . Very disappointed in Shark . If you have the best tool and ca n't cut it as a company , just raise the price , do n't become a lesser thing for the same price . Now this bar is in between what it was and something you can buy at HD , and now I have to shop for a proper one.BTW , if you go to the shark website , and read their PDF on their incredible hand-finished tools , the exact things that are missing are the `` V-blade '' in the cat 's paw they claim grabs the nail . It 's closer to a pinched U now .	-1
I bought this after using the detail saw for a number of projects . The finer side works well , and cuts plenty fast . The other side is completely useless though . The teeth are way to aggressive and just end up binding unless you use the lightest of pressure . Doing it with that tiny of a cut means it takes longer to make the cut than just flipping it over and using the finer teeth .	-1
I have had this hammer one month and use it every weekend on a garage rehab project . I find the leather handle slippery . There is no stickiness to it and when I swing it wearing my leather work gloves the hammer will fly out of my hands . I am worried that I may hit my friend who is helping me on this project.I like the feel and balance of the hammer but the leather wrapped handle is just not working for me . I plan to continue to use the hammer with the hope that in time the leather wrap will soften and become tacky . I purchased another hammer last week with a rubber handle which I use now more than this hammer .	-1
This thing is junk . The orange store cat 's paws take out small and large nails . This misses the small nails.You wo n't look so cool when you ca n't get the job done . This has a real tough name and logo but is no good . Get the shark puller the other reviewer suggested .	-1
it started out really good and i after using it for about 6 months it it pretty much useless b/c it wore so now it will not even grab a nail head anymore .	-1
Why in the hell would a company like DEWALT sell this item without DEWALT DW4706 4-1/2-Inch Backing Flange for the DW402 , DW402G , and DW818 ? I bought the 4 1/2 inch grinder and this blade will not function without the backing flange . The flange is not included with the grinder and no mention of the flange is included in the requirements for this blade or the grinder . Seriously disappointed by DEWALT.Once I bought this flange , the wheel working very well in cutting fire brick and ceramic floor tile . Lost several days of productivity due to the lack of full disclosure .	-1
I looked at this tool in a local store because I 'm installing crown in an older house . It is very well made and deserves more than one star , but while I was in the store I found a simple plastic tool for measuring angles called & quot ; mite-r-gage & quot ; . It gives you an accurage measurement which you then compare with a crown table that gives you the angle and bevel for flat cuts on a compound miter saw.I just wanted people to consider this $ 10 alternative if the Bosch is overkill for how often you 'll use it .	-1
The guiding edge of the tool is tig welded with a big blob of welding bead that was not cleaned up . Hence when using the guide to mark a square , the welding just mis-align the squaring . Totally unusable .	-1
You would think the case for your levels would be made at the same level of quality your levels are . They are NOT.First of all the carrying strap is NOT adjustable like the description says . It is a terrible design and awkward to carry with anything else in your hands.The 24 '' and 59 '' compartments are to small , you have to force them in . In less than a year I have holes in the corners of the pockets since it 's so tight.Unfortunately no one else makes a level case that holds multiple levels , and having 5 or 6 level cases is n't practical for me .	-1
This level is a good level but it is not a 40 dollar level . I guess I 'll have to buy a Swanson level , Swanson 's torpedo is the exact same level that Klein sells ( Klein buys it and slaps their name on it just like they do with most of their other tools ) it costs 25 bucks it has neodymium magnets , bigger vials and it has and is machined from solid aluminum just like the Checkpoint . I 've had many Checkpoints and I like them but they are n't worth the money .	-1
Do not buy this level . It is not accurate . When the bubble is centered in the horizontal position it is actually not level . I returned the first one I received and got a replacement . The second was just as bad as the first . To make matters even worse , the bubble is small and the lines are far apart so the bubble does n't touch the lines . That makes it very hard to tell if the bubble is in the center . I placed it on top of a large contractor 's level just to be sure , and the bubble was way off center on this one when the contractor 's level bubble was centered .	-1
yeah yeah yeah blah blah blah ... .4 stars cuz it looks real pretty ? This thing is junk . The caulk or whatever it is that holds the bubble vials in falls out , you lose the vials and you end up with a piece of pretty aluminumn ... ... Klein makes a level with the SAME rare earth magnets ( not the strip magnets ) and is WAY more durable . BUY THE KLEIN .	-1
I got ta say that this torpedo level is a nice size , has a lot of features and looks great . However , one critical component is lacking ... they filled the vials with too much liquid making the bubble so small it 's nearly impossible to get an accurate measurement . I picked up a 9 '' Swanson torpedo at the same time ( just in case ) and it 's a much easier-to-read level , just like my Stabilas . The Checkpoint is going back .	-1
I bought 2 of these compressors - one for me and one for my son . Each of our compressors has failed in the identical fashion , his multiple times . I think the basic compressor , i.e . the electric motor and vane compressor , is quite solid , but the control circuit which turns the motor on and off is quite cheesy and prone to failure . It is also *very* expensive to replace.Since this has happened to us a total of 3 times now , this is not just a case of random failure , but is a systematic problem . A shame , too , because the rest of the tool seems quite robust . We are shopping for new compressors now . I can tell you one thing - they wo n't be Hitachi .	-1
First , as other reviewers say , this particular compressor is *very* loud . It seems like it could be quieter . Second , I find that in any moderate tool use , it cycles quite frequently ... maybe a higher SCFM would be better.Most importantly , this has to be the least overworked tool in my weekend remodeler 's arsenal , yet it 's the first one I 've ever actually had die . I 've owned it for maybe 4 years , but it only gets used a couple times a year . I took care of the oil , always drained the tank , and never kicked it over or dropped it . Yet recently the pressure control switch has failed . Now whenever it charges up , after the switch cuts off at max pressure , some sort of relief kicks in and bleeds off all the pressure it just built up . Useless . I could fix this for about $ 60 by buying a new one on the Internet , but I 'm not happy with the quality so I 'm going to switch brands.Maybe low quality is why this thing is discounted so much .	-1
This goodyear hose ~ IS NOT GOODYEAR ! I just got off the phone with a goodyear rep who told me there is a knockoff company if FL.. Somehow they use the name goodyear , but the real goodyear will have a TM ( some kind of symbol ) between the good and the year..I own this hose.. I called because my new compressor says rubber will not hold up to synthetic compressor lube.. Unless it is over 36 percent nitrile.. I cant seem to find anything about this hose in tghat respect..Guess I will keep trying.. If it were a goodyear hose I would have had my answer.. The real hoses would probably cost a lot more..But , it would have been nice to know what I was buying in the first place..	-1
Very disappointed , especially with all the great reviews . I bought two . The hose was fine , but the 1/4 inch ends were the problem for me . On the first one , the threads were slightly off and leaked air . On the second one , the threads were also slightly off , plus the crimp area was leaking . Lost 30 pounds of air overnight . Sent the first one back already and will likely send second one back.I 've since gone to local farm supply store and bought two of the red Goodyear 50 foot , 3/8 inch , 1/4 inch ends . Hooked up exact same couplers , zero leaks , zero issues . Sent other one to my Dad with same couplers . He hooked them up , zero leaks , zero issues . Do n't forget to use a little plumbers tape before putting couplers on .	-1
I bought this air hose under the impression it was a genuine goodyear air hose . It 's not ; it 's a knockoff . The hose may or may not work fine , but it 's not a goodyear hose.Thisis a genuine goodyear air hose . This was confirmed by the manufacturer of the real hoses ; see hobbler 's 1 star review and check the comments.I did n't suspect much until I got the hose and noticed a couple of things . Though it seems to be hit or miss , the fittings on mine were mis-threaded as well . I tried to attach this hose to a hose reel and the fitting was very difficult to thread and only went on a few turns before not being able to go any further , even with a wrench . Also , the hose itself did NOT have the Mit diamond trademark signifying a genuine goodyear hose , and the goodyear markings that are there were put on sloppily and were starting to rub off.Like I said , the hose may or may not work fine ; I could n't get mine threaded to even try it so 1 star . Others seem happy with it , and that 's great , but I do n't like to be duped . Do n't sell me a harbor freight hose at goodyear prices . The genuine goodyear hose is only eight bucks more so I bought one of those and this one is en router back to amazon for a refund.Amazon needs to get on the ball with these counterfeit items . I had a similar experience with a belkin USB cable , where it was supposed to be belkin , yet the cable was absolute garbage , extremely generic and anorexicly thin .	-1
I see all the good reviews on this hose , but my experience was not pleasant.I can only assume that mine was defective , with a built-in permanent twist.It was very aggravating because I can not coil this hose up for storage or to hang it on the wall - regardless if it 's under air pressure or not . All my previous air hoses did not have this problem . I can coil them up easily for transport or storage.I really like the bright orange color and the hose seems very tough . Rather than return or trash it , I cut it 's length short and now I 'm using it as a feeder hose from my compressor to an air hose cord reel.Again , maybe my hose was defective , so it might be a good idea for you to check and inspect yours upon delivery.Cheers , Jeff	-1
I found it more trouble then it is worth . I am using it in the winter so that can be part of my problem but I just do not see much significant time or hassle savings using this . It is similar to any garden hose reel ; any tangle or snag still is requires individual attention.A better way to organize , sure . For those who always leave a cord a mess will this help , sure , but it still comes down to the effort of before and after and how you leave the cord out .	-1
Tried 3 different male 1/4 & # 34 ; NPT connections ... Leaked at every one . Does n't seem to fit all the way on . May try to use a thread restorer or tap to see if it can get better ... Otherwise the quick connect portion works great with no leaks .	-1
maybe if u wanted to upholster a seat on a chair ok other wise not good for wood workers sad	-1
The staples rate 5 stars . Amazon shipping gets none . I ordered 5 different sizes of these staples . Each one was shipped separately . After opening each box I had to find coffee cans for the staples . The boxes were are ripped up and the staples were all loose in the shipping boxes . One strap of duct tape around the ends would have saved the whole problem .	-1
** See my review of the N89C as wellI bought a N80 and it would not drive a 3 '' or a 3 1/4 '' galv . spiral nail into Douglas Fir . After sending the gun in to see what was wrong with it . It was send back with nothing wrong . I took the gun , the nails , and the wood to the Bostitch distributor . They could not get it to drive the nails . Even the new one they pulled off the shelf did not do it . They gave me a N89 . The depth adjustment on the N89 is nice and it has never jambed . Changing nail sizes is much easier then the N80.Both the N80 and the N89 double fire easily . I have listen to nails land 50-60ft away on the street.The crew framing my house uses 4 Hitachi NV83 guns . Thees guns are more balanced , drive 3 1/4 '' nails no problem , and I have not had a double fire yet . The Hitachi guns run 3-6 coils of nails a day 6 days a week in the mud and sawdust . If I ever wear my N89 out I 'll be spending the extra $ $ $ on the Hitachi .	-1
This item is made pretty well . Holds securely . Love the feature of pulling outward to release , simply pushing the bit into the holder and it automatically snaps to hold.BUT , this holder is actually very long , it is too long , ... 3 inches long . That longer 3in length means more of a wobble when the chuck spins the drill bit . There is more loss of control in precise situations when the bit starts 3 inches out from the chuck . After it arrived I tried to find out how I made that mistake . But there is no mention of the length in the description beside the picture or directly below . Hmmmm.So I backtracked further to see how I got snookered . Looking at the product picture , it does not appear to be particularly long . But pictures can be deceptive . The reviews were good . Do n't think anyone mentioned or complained about the length . If they did I missed it . How was I supposed to know it was 3 inches long ? ? Finally , I checked the dimensions buried in the description : 5.8 x 2.9 x 1.3 inches . What does that mean to you ? To me , that 's unclear . Nothing about this item is 6in long , 3in wide etc.. 5.8x2.9x1.2inches seems to be the dimension of the shrink wrap cardboard the loader is encased in . That is not a fair description in my book . Reported this to Amazon Customer Support.So I searched Amazon & ordered a Wera K Rapidaptor that 's top quality , same features , 1/3 shorter than the Dewalt , and they did not hide the length of the holder ... 2inches . The line description beside the Wera holder is this : `` Wera 889/4/1 K Rapidaptor Universal Bit Holder for 1/4 '' Hex Drives , 2in Long . '' Everything is right up front . The Wera carries a higher price but you get higher quality , more compact length , more control & LESS wobble vs the Dewalt DW2505 & is well worth the few extra dollars . Can not recommend the 3in Dewalt DW2505 .	-1
After I put it into action did I found what I need . There are actually two types of rapid loader , one looses bits by pushing forwards , one pulling backwards . This is the later , which from time to time prevent a smooth work flow . With pushing forwards action , you push , and remove bits in one move . With backwards moving , you have to do two moves , first to loose the bit , then move again for removal of the bit.Comparing to another brand , I like Rxxxx better ! Only thing good about it might be its slim size . BTW , Dewalt impact driver also have similar backwards loosing mechanism . Need to get used to .	-1
These bits are very well made but once you open the package they will tumble about and stray in your toolbox . Like many of their other items they should have considered some sort of case or containment so they do n't get lost . The 2 stars is only for the lack of package , not the bits which work very well .	-1
Smallest bit spun out of its holder on first use , rendering it useless . I had to get a drill with a chuck to remove it from the guitar neck I was drilling . All I was doing was pre-drilling a hole in a guitar neck for a strap button .	-1
Two of these bits broke on the 1st or 2nd use . I was drilling kitchen cabinets for a screw hole so it was not heavy duty use . The `` break '' did not occur on the drill bit itself , but where the drill bit fits into the hex shaft . The bits are actually two pieces , a regular drill bit which is pressed/inserted into a hex shaft . Since it was exposed , I was able to see that the drill bit shaft had a flattened area that apparently is supposed to be held by another flat area inside the hex shaft . I was able to reinsert the drill bit back into the hex shaft and turn it freely by hand . Whatever was supposed to `` catch '' and keep the bit from spinning was obviously long gone . Hopefully I just had a bad batch . Amazon is replacing them and I 'll see how they do . Knowing what I know now , I 'd probably opt for a one piece hex drill bit , rather than what turned out to be a two piece setup .	-1
These drill bits are the most worthless things ever did n't even start to drill and the first bit twisted out of hex shank and so I tried another and they all did the same I bought a lot cheap one and there all perfectly fine .	-1
Many years ago I had a combination drill and countersink for wood screws . It consisted of a half drill ( flat on one side ) a relief cutter for the shank , and a countersink cutter . It was adjustable from short to long , and worked well . I anticipated the DeWalt version doing as well . I was going to build a redwood potting bench for a friend , and did n't want the inevitable oversized countersinks on holes to spoil the looks.One problem was that the maximum length on the # 6 drill ( including countersink ) was 1 1/2 & # 34 ; . They do make # 6 screws longer than that.But the thing that made the tool almost worthless was the angle on the countersink . I had no way to precisely measure that angle , but I could n't find a single screw that matched it and it was obviously more obtuse than my countersinks.There are two common angles on wood screws : 82 degrees ( US ) and 90 degrees ( Europe ) . Apparently the DeWalt tools use the 90 degree countersink . That means that a 82 degree screw ( more acute angle ) will bottom out before its chamfer is seated if screwed into a 90 degree countersunk hole . Since there 's no stop to keep the countersink from going deeper -- it wo n't get larger in diameter -- one can keep drilling until the head is flush . In other words , drill/try , drill/try . It just wo n't be right even if flush.This meant that I might as well drill a pilot hole , then use another drill motor to carefully countersink ( 82 degrees ) until the head is flush.There is an 82 degree countersink with stop made by Amana , which I 'm going to try next.I 'm giving two stars on behalf of our European woodworking friends .	-1
This was a pretty good bit , but honestly I do n't see them use . I use it for pre-drilling screw holes in cabinets and honestly I think a regular bit works better . Plus this one broke from the chuck .	-1
I figured spending the extra to get a Dewalt product would result in getting a better tool . This turned out to not be true . The magnet of this bit holder is close to worthless . I have a no-name bit holder that has a much better magnet at a lower cost . Look elsewhere if you use this tool professionally .	-1
I remember when Dewalt made quality tools , cheaper brands make better quality shafts . The bit holder magnet is the weak link that makes this tool useless to someone that uses it full time . If you plan on occasionally using the shaft then it may be worth it . Avoid if you are a carpenter you will be pulling your tip out of every screw . I bought 5 of these and they all work the same .	-1
The thing cracked and swallowed a bit . Gar-bahgge . I have a Ryobi cheapo for the last 10 years . I bought this one for a second drill . After 5 days use , using a DeWalt drill , it cracked . As we write on boxes in the office so the cleaning people will pick them up ... `` Basura '' ! I sure wish I could change my stars . Skip this accessory .	-1
Either the design or the quality was very poor . Only lasted through part of one job before the outer sleeve came loose . My previous Makita bit holder lasted years ! Sorry dewalt ... back to Makita !	-1
Wow ... I saw all the good reviews and was expecting an amazing blade ... boy was I wrong . The thing did cut quickly and easily but when I looked at the edge of the board it was TERRIBLE ! I would have to joint the board 1/16 '' to get rid of all the marks it left.I am sure that my table saw is adjusted properly cause I just checked it with a dial indicator . I also look at the results I get from my Ridgid combination blade , which are like glass . The Freud is almost like what you get from a bandsaw blade but with burn marks to boot ! Maybe this blade needs a stabilizer to work properly , but I 'm not going to buy one to find out if I can return this .	-1
Well I must go against the grasin on this one.Ive used prob 75 differant blaeds in my caqrrier on differant saws , this one was a big dissapointment . It vibrates so bad my saw was moving on the stand , no its not bent , it also is very loud . Swithced to the Freud 1050 10 '' combination for ripping on my table saw and it is smooth and quite , cuts smooth and easy , I recomend this one	-1
Granted I 've had this blade for 5 years . But I do n't abuse my tools [ been a woodworker since 1960 ] and this is only one of 30 blades I have on-hand . So as I 'm ripping some sweet gum lumber the other day , and when the blade stops , it just happens to stop with a 'chipped tooth ' at TDC [ top dead center ] .It 's obvious to me that it was a bad tooth to begin with ... 'cause for anyone who has ever horsed junk wood , if you hit a nail [ or similar ] you 're going to take out more than one . But no other tooth is in less-than-perfect condition . The carbide fractured near the base but did n't snap off the base . My experience says & # 34 ; bad carbide & # 34 ; .I used the & # 34 ; contact & # 34 ; page at Freud.com to ask if there 's a lifetime on & # 34 ; workmanship and materials & # 34 ; ... I would think there would be . But , surprisingly , I have n't heard a peep from them.Fortunately , I 'm not noticing a deficiency in this non-critical work ... but I am going to relegate the blade to the minor leagues .	-1
I 've previously ordered Freud blades and had good success with them . They had minimum run-out in a good quality blade . For me , this particular blade had more run-out than previous blades and thankfully , just after I tuned it to minimal run-out on my blade arbor , I noticed that one tooth was bent toward the center of the blade and only soldered at the extreme inside edge . It would have easily flown off if I had turned my saw on . I 'm extremely careful not to bump saw blades against anything and saw no damage to the carbide tip of the blade , so it appears there was a problem in the manufacturing process . I returned this blade and ordered a Forrest blade , which I am very pleased with .	-1
I ordered this to use while my Woodworker II is sharpened , and wow , it is a very very nice blade . I 've been cutting some poplar and cherry today , and the cuts are just as smooth as the Woodworker 's when it 's sharp . I will probably keep using this blade even when my other blade is returned . Highly recommended . **EDIT**Yea so , the teeth started falling apart after only a few days use . I had no choice but to send it back . Very odd . It was really nice while it lasted , but now I 'm scared to try another .	-1
I received this bit , the package was labeled with the correct part number , but the bit had only 2 cutters , not the 4 that were described in the description . Close examination of the picture shows a bit with only 2 cutters.I do n't know how well it works , since I sent it back .	-1
I seemed to have some fitting problems with the bearings as well . After I first purchased the bit and bearing set , I was able to make some picture frames without too much hassle . Yet today I was rabbeting a recess for some stained glass panels in a complicated door I 've been making for a cabinet . I 've invested about 4-5 hours into the door ... cutting , making tenons , making mortises , creating panels , and glue up . I 've been very careful to assemble these doors as they will be accepting some antique leaded glass panels that I 've saved for just this purpose . All of my dimensions were critically planned and it was assembled to fit the antique panels . But today , the bearing on my rabbet bit seized as I was milling the recesses , and then it unscrewed itself and fell off as I was making a pass . As you can imagine , since the bearing suddenly fell off I lost my guide edge and I cut a huge chunk out of my carefully assembled door . Trying to salvage what I had left , I switched to a deeper cut to smooth out the error ( using a smaller bearing ) and the same thing happened again ! The bearings are unusable . I do n't know if I 'm going to be able to salvage my door - I might have to rebuild it.I 've used both bits on picture frames and furniture pieces without problems . But the shims , screw , and bearings are all soft metal and have n't held up at all . I would expect higher quality from Freud.This is probably the 4th or 5th time I 've used this $ 60 bit and bearing kit . I 'm livid and restraining myself from cursing in this review.I have CMT bits that I use for tongue and groove and they 've reliably routed probably 100 ft of boards for me . I will get the CMT rabbet bit and will avoid Freud from now on .	-1
When the humidity shot up in our area recently we discovered that condensation was forming between this cover and our table saw leaving rust streaks that were a lot of work to remove . In contrast , our uncovered cast-iron machines were fine . So I 've reluctantly folded up this very pretty cover and put it back on the shelf .	-1
I have had one of these for years . It had metal lifting levers . The current production has lifting levers that flex and break . They flex when new , but grow brittle and break as they age.And I had nowhere near the stated 500 lbs on the base .	-1
I 've had this installed on my Jet 18 & # 34 ; bandsaw . It went together well . The directions were a little vague . It makes moving the saw easier , obviously.However:1 ) The small wheels get stuck on pretty much everything2 ) It picks up the tool in order to move , or drops it to keep it in place . It 's a heavy saw , and I do n't like this.3 ) Only the wheels by the levers turn . Makes it hard to steer.Currently it 's still on the band saw , but I 've bought a different brand to try . ( Shop Fox ) I have n't installed it yet , but I wo n't buy another one . Maybe the HTC3000 works better , but it costs a lot more too .	-1
My shop rolls on HTC products and I 've always been happy with them.I restored an old Parks planer and the footprint fit none of the dedicated basesso I opted to try one of the universal bases . Big mistake.Unlike the dedicated bases , the fixed wheels have no brake on them . THe machine rests on two small rubber pads and the wheels when `` stationary '' and that does not work out well . The base is prone to movement as there is insufficient locking mechanisms- if this base had brakes it would be a nice option for odd pieces of machinery .	-1
Now I believe I 'm in the minority based on these reviews I see . Let me tell you my experience and use your own judgement , it 's fine to have a differing opinion.I used this for my Jet contractor saw , not that time consuming to put together but more so than the one piece unit I replaced it with.Trying to lock it steady on those rubber feet took more time to do than putting it together . Then , If I move the saw to use my router table I have to readajust it since my cement floor only looks completely smooth . so there 's some back and forth issue with making the thing stable when it 's moved and repositioned.I 'm not talking about cobblestone imperfection , it 's subdle variations in concrete that make 4 wheels rock back and forth ever so slightly if they 're not just right . Those 2 rubber feet have to take the weight of the saw and hold it steady or else if you push something heavy there 's a chance the saw will move during your pushing . I do n't want to have to follow my saw back and forth with shim stock . The nut and bolt type adjustment is tedious . I think Shop Fox has a heavier universal base that uses 2 feet but with large knob adjusters and also a thicker frame.3 wheels always stay on the ground regardless of the slight imperfection which is what I 've found on the one piece mobile base that 's made specifically for individual equipment . I just put the one piece base on and forget it . Rolling circles to my hearts content around like a crazy merry-go-round . Stop and cut or route and back to where it once was , no problem . Cost twice as much , saved more than that cursing this univeral base.I 'm going to put this mobile base under my drill press which does n't have to move , but only if it has too move , it will then be able too . I actually think the slight height increase would be worth it as well .	-1
First off - if you 're buying this base it 's probably because you ca n't find a mobile base specific for your needs . Hands down , the best mobile bases are made by Delta . They 're simple , durable , effective and easy to use . Check to see if Delta makes a size similar to what you need first . If you need this item , know that the frame feels flimsy , it rusts easily and the wheel assemblies are cheap and difficult to lock securely . BUT it does move equipment around on wheels , it does lock down and it can be customized for any size tool or machine .	-1
The package arrived without all the parts . I called the company and after several tries , they sent out the missing part . I put it together , placed my table saw on it that does n't weigh anywhere near the stated 400 # capacity , and the plastic levers snapped in two the first time I tried to lift it . Pure junk .	-1
I still do n't know what to think about this sander . I tried it several times and here are my thoughts . If you are doing the job from start to finish this sander will get heavy after about 10 minutes . It weighs too much , especially if you are doing a ceiling . I like the idea but it 's an expensive piece of equipment . I felt as though I had to push down on the unit to get it to sand . This is where it starts to get heavy . I think I 'm going to try the Fiba-Tape dustless pole sander next . As for my Porter Cable 7800 , well eBay it is.Update : I tried the Wilco Dustless pole sander and I think it 's a better alternative .	-1
For the price of this bag and a decent set of cables , you can get a portable jump start system from Husky , Coleman , etc . with a built in worklight ( added bonus , you can use these systems as a power source for power outages , tailgate parties , extended cell use , etc . ) And , these gadgets are easier to use and/or store than cables . Add about 10 bucks , and you can get the models that have light duty air compressors built in .	-1
I was hoping for something that would hold the jumper cables compactly , but this bag is much bigger than need be . And it does n't look like the picture . I think I 'll return it for those reasons .	-1
I got this Bucket Boss Jumper Cable Bag to put my cables in to go behind the seat in my truck . It 's a little small , except for the lightest cables . Mine are not , rather industrial , black heavy cables with the clamps that require a strong hand to squeeze . They will fit , but really tightly . If this bag were larger it would get 4 stars , but is lightweight and more for the back of a SUV driven by a socker mom , who feels obligated to offer help when one of her friends car wo n't start on a cold day out at the field . Good enough for that use , just not heavy enough for rough use , and it will get dirty too easily . The price was right , $ 14.38 delivered with my Prime membership , but I think I 'll look around and see if I can find one a little beefier for the long haul .	-1
much smaller than expected . this will only hold the shortest and thinnest of cables . bag is well made but anything longer than 12-15 of thin cables will not fit inside . 4ga cables of anything longer than 10-12 ' are n't going to work with this bag.disappointed with this one . not worth the return so i will find something else to use it with .	-1
Never even had to take it out of the bag . One review stated he fit his # 2 gage jumpers in this ' I would sure like to ask him how . This bag is SMALL . I have a heavy duty set of cables in my F-350 and it 's not even close to fitting . A standard size set could fit ? This is going back to Amazon . ADVISE - roll your cables up and measure diameter and height of the roll .	-1
This is just plain cheap-o junk . Really For the price of this kit and the price of the vacuum , I would expect alot more . I do n't even know where to begin . Poor fitting , sloppy and poorly designed too . Yuck .	-1
I bought this with the intention of inserting it in the same bucket as the one that I put the Bucket Boss 56 Pocket Tool Organizer onto . When I put it inside , I learned I could n't fit my larger tools into the inside pockets ( the pockets used for the larger tools ) of the organizer because the stacking tray made too tight of a fit . Maybe having a deeper bucket might solve the problem .	-1
These did not come in any retail packaging . On top of that the quality of finish was bad . They were scratched and dented . The mechanism did n't fit the other half well at all and there was a slight clicking noise whenever they were turned.I had bought for the entire house but I just returned them all and moved to Kwikset which were of a far higher quality .	-1
We returned most of our Schlage Plymouth locks . They were delivered without any packaging in generic brown boxes . Inside many of the locks were scratched . The plate that attaches to the door was n't exactly flat so a slight gap could be seen between it and the door.Also , the finish was really poor . I have moved all my locks to Kwikset now and those are an order of magnitude better . Really really bad quality .	-1
Got 2 of these and both had one socket no longer working in less than 2 months . One of them even has the motion detector just plain does n't work , since it kicks on and off randomly at all hours of the night , even with the detector itself completely covered . Defiantly would buy a different/better brand next time.Sure , it has a great warranty , but would you rather buy a product they replace WHEN it goes bad in a couple months and have to take time out to install , etc . Or buy a better product that may have a shorter warranty , but does n't fail for 10+ years .	-1
We purchased three of these . We needed some outdoor light fixtures in a hurry . These were cheap enough that I felt we could replace them in a short time if we needed to.We initially purchased one . It worked fine for a few months so we went ahead and bought to more identical ones for the 2 additional fixtures that we needed . About a week after we purchased the two additional ones and had them installed the first one started to go on the fritz . One night the dog decided he needed to go out at 2 am . The light decided to essentially Blink . On and off ... about every 5 seconds . I swore it would stop . After about 15 minutes of watching it and worrying that it would bother one of our neighbors I finally went out to the garage and turned the switch off that it is attached to.The timer on that light no longer really works . It just stays on as long as it feels like it . I have n't seen it do the & # 34 ; blinking & # 34 ; again , but it certainly does n't stay on for the 10 minutes that I have selected.The other two seem to be working fine so far , but I anticipate they will fail too in a short amount of time . I feel like this item is a hit-or-miss item . Its made poorly so some will be fine , and others will freak out.If you 're deciding between this one and a slightly more expensive one , I might spend the few extra bucks if you 're looking for something that lasts . I hoped ours would last at least the 6 months to a year that we required , but obviously that was asking too much . I certainly wo n't be replacing it until the spring weather , so if it goes on the blink again , I might just try to live without it until the spring . Our back yard is sort of a motion-light-mine-field so if the other two can pull through I think we 'll be fine .	-1
The inside of the socket did not align with the outside sleeve . There was a lot of interference and the socket disconnected from the grommets when I screwed the bulb in .	-1
Poor quality . The motion sensor ca n't pick up anyone at 45deg to the side . I would not buy this junk . I have used other brands and have good results	-1
I am not sure what this brand is about but I purchased 6 from local home depot and had to return all in 2 weeks as they failed .My neighbour purchased 4 and none worked after a week.Heath Zenith , Please get into some other business as you are bringing some cheap product in the market , which is very unreliable and cheap.After buying this product , I realized how bad some products can be , ..	-1
The last motion sensing flood light I paid the same amount for was made out of metal ... this is plastic and the range is half as wide . This was also a pain to install and took five times longer than it should have to install because it is that cheaply made .	-1
Had to shave PVC conduit tubes on back so it would sit flush against mounting surface , read instructions several times and it still does n't work properly , would have sent back but since had to alter PVC tubes I knew they would blame that on malfunction of sensor , it simply does n't work as advertised , disapointed with product but for less than $ 20 dollars what does one expect , enough said .	-1
Go to Mennards or Lowes or Home Depot and get an $ 11.00 Cooper instead . You will be happy you did .	-1
After 2 days : Sensor works , best for detecting movement between 5-20 feet awayHeavy duty plastic , not sure how long it will last , but for the price ca n't complain , I bought 3 of them so I can swap it out if needs be.After 45 days : Update , after 1 month , just disconnected it as it has been clicking on and off incessantly for the past 2 weeks . Acting more like a strobe light instead of a security light . First I just removed the light bulbs , no help all it would to is continually click . Will probably swap it out with one of the other units I bought , but failure after just 1 month of use does n't lend me a whole lot of confidence .	-1
this only turns off half your water tank . leaves one element burning continuously ! buy the spdp timer . waist of money .	-1
Jaws are not lined up on the sides . Front is not lined up either ( upper jaw hangs for about 0.031 inches ) . Poor made . Thin pliers . Hard to move jaws because they stuck time to time . It says made in USA , but it feels like in China .	-1
very little pliars for a lot of money . channellock makes a good product but this was over priced in my book	-1
i had to work on it to get the brass part to slide . it should have not been that way . must have been a second . lufkin mades a great rule but this one was very bad .	-1
I recieved this ruler on time and intact.The first segment is a full 1/16th inch short ! The slider does n't even line up with the end.Ridiculous . I returned the item and ordered a different brand.I had a Lufkin that lasted over 20 years before it broke . Obviously their QA department is asleep at the switch .	-1
They seem pretty low quality - stiff to open and close , with the spring barely able to open them unassisted . The cut aluminum ok , vinyl siding bends and can be cut with a few tries , but it is useless on paper and plastic . I should have tried it sooner so that I could return it .	-1
I had one of these for 10 years and used it every day from October thru April . Finally the screens that cover the burners started cracking and I knew it 's time was short . So I decided to buy another one . Amazon certainly has the best price if you can wait for the free shipping . When I received it , I noticed that the copper thermocouple tubes going to each burner were all kinked up and looked like they were smashed in several places with a pair of vise-grips . I 've installed a few thermocouples in my day and I know this is a no-no since it can short out the tiny wires inside the tube . I sent the unit back to Amazon and they immediately sent a replacement . It too had the thermocouple tubes all bent to death so I sent it back and they refunded my money . Neither of these units should have ever left the factory in this condition . Sorry Mr. Heater , but you blew it this time . I ended up buying another brand at my local Lowes for about the same price . This one is actually better since you can aim each burner in a different direction and it does n't need a wrench to attach the hose to your propane tank . Of course , it 's made in China like everything else , but the quality of manufacture is far superior to the Mr. Heater units . Here is a prime example of the fall of American manufacturing . You let your quality go and your customers go with it .	-1
The & # 34 ; sand & # 34 ; on this sandpaper is not solid and it does n't last long . This is not the 3M products I have grown accustomed to .	-1
As a safety engineer who investigates ladder accidents , I recommend that any step ladder you purchase have a duty rating of at least 250 pounds for safety . Also , the aluminum models , while lighter weight , are also more flexible and easier to tip over . I recommend a fiberglas model.I purchased this ladder for destructive testing , not for use .	-1
I 've been using these 3M filters ( size 20x25x1 ) for years , with the same 'Comfortmaker ' furnace , changing them once a month due to severe allergies that my family has . The last 2 filters were totally collapsed , to where I could not slide them out ! Makes me wonder for how long these had been sitting in my furnace collapsed/damaged like this ! It seems to me that 3M has significantly cheapened the quality and reinforcement ability of these filters . Shame on them ! I will be looking elsewhere .	-1
... and it vibrates the whole room horribly . This was what our modular home manufacturer installed into our new home and it 's horribly cheap and tacky . This thing is something that you 'd install in a low-budget trailer home and they stuck it into our 180-thou new home 's guest bath . We 're replacing it as soon as humanly possible.NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL !	-1
The air circulation is very poor and the light is n't very bright - the two primary functions of the unit . Beyond that there 's a air dam that rocks back-and-forth when it 's windy outside ; which is very frustrating due to the noise it makes when rocking back-ad-forth . I bought this to replace a non-lighted fan and will not use in the remaining bathrooms .	-1
I had a old Fluidmaster for years -- worked fine . Bought a new toilet and this valve is a bit quieter , but it stopped working after about one year . Tried the repair suggested by the video , but it failed again . Waste of my time to worry about whether a toilet is going to flush . Going back to a tried and true valve .	-1
Purchased from big box store in the summer of 2013 . Started leaking about 1 month ago , and adjustment would not stop the leak . Valve would not shut off fully , causing the trickle down the overflow . This is trash ! If it does not last even 8 months , it it worthless . Replaced with a cheap fluidmaster . Kooky , you should be ashamed to sell such worthless stuff !	-1
The quality of this product is horrible . MagLite has some of the worst flashlights in the world in terms of quality of the light throw and the brightness . For one , they do not use bright white LEDs which is pretty much unheard of nowadays . Also , the light itself barely exceeds 15 lumens . I would NOT recommend this product for the serious adventurer or even for utility reasons because there are so many other great lights out there . Even my nano key chain light from Streamlight is 2x or 3x brighter than this MagLite and it 's as small as my thumb nail ! MagLites are relatively expensive for what you get . Get a quality Streamlight pen light for 20 bucks and it will be literally 5x brighter , takes the same batteries and has much better construction and features.MagLites do NOT use the orange peel style reflector , the light is dim , it 's yellow light and the adjustment does not help to make it brighter nor does it help make the light more usable . My pen light may not have an adjustable light but it gives off such a bright light that it does n't matter and throws the light far enough that it would beat out the MagLite in every aspect . Even you put the MagLite beam into the Streamlight beam , it disappears completely which really shows how dim it is . Do NOT buy this product , invest your money in a much brighter LED system that resists water and shock . MagLites are trash and until they come out with a better and more standard up to date design , avoid them . I would n't even give this light away because it 's so low quality .	-1
I had 2 of their products . Both failed miserably.Never got a whole lot of use out the mini because the bulb life and battery life were just terrible . I recently tried to upgrade it with an LED kit . Forget it . The internal plastic parts just fell apart in my hands.I had bought one of their C cell lights about 10 years ago . It made it through one set of batteries . When I tried to replace the batteries , the tail end would not come off . It had somehow become welded to the body of the flashlight . I think the parts corroded together and got stuck . Tried a vice , channel lock pliers , you name it . Anything that would impart enough force to get it unglued would have damaged the body . Went in the trash .	-1
This flashlight has very average brightness . The beam that it produces is very uneven . Battery life is average . Basically , it is the Chevy Caviler of flashlights.If you are interested in top performance , check out flashlights from Fenix , Streamlight or Surefire . They will cost more , but there is a night and day difference . A similarly sized flashlight that produces 10X the brightness with a very smooth and even light is the Surefire G2 .	-1
To start with , this little flashlight is a first generation fashlight , whereas the modern lithium-powered `` tactical lights '' are of third generation . Therefore , it is clear that this light can not match those modern super-bright flashlights in performance.By todays ' standards , the Mini Maglite is an adequate general-purpose flashlight . It is comfortably small , although if it were a bit fatter , it would fit better to a hand . The body of the flashlight is of high-impact aluminium , making the Mini-Mag a very sturdy little light , tough enough to be used as an impact weapon.You need two hands to operate Mini Maglight . As there is no light switch , you activate the light by rotating the head of the light , until the light activates . This can be very ankward , depending on the situation on which you need the light . The light is actually quite dim , by modern standards . Again , it depends on the situation if the Mini-Mag is bright enough , but as a rule of thumb , the more powerful the light is , the better . After all , there is very little need for dull knifes , or dim flashlights . Also , the light pattern of Mini-Mag is not even , but the light beam has dark rings or spots , making it harder to see clearly the `` target '' on some occasions.If you need a small general-purpose flashlight to keep in the glove compartment of your car , for example , Mini Maglite is a reasonable choice . It is an affordable light , and the batteries are much cheaper than those used in modern high-powered flashlights . But if you need the flashlight for more serious use , it 's better to look for a third generation flashlight .	-1
Product works well initially but beware of product life LESS THAN the 10-year warranty . I have 7 on my home . The motion sensor has now failed on two of them . I called the 800 number at Desa and chose `` Sales '' . No answer after 25 rings . I then tried `` Tech Support '' . Put on hold for 20 minutes with music ... .never got through ... .I just gave up . Suggest you find another supplier . Maybe they are all poor products .	-1
It has 96 holes ( I guess , I never counted them ) , but I doubt it could hold that many tools unless you have an incredible screw driver collection . The larger holes are not quite big enough for hammers , too big for screwdrivers or chisels , so why are they there ? It does bend with a load over time . For the same money you could find a couple of scraps of wood , a few screws and drill your own holes to make a rack that is truely useful ! I came by mine as a gift , so I do n't have anything in it . I would n't buy one .	-1
This unit worked great for various type tool organization.I say worked as it did n't take long to `` weather '' and become brittle and that was indoors not out.I would be hesitant to reorder one .	-1
Terrible durability . COOPER BRING BACK MY OLD GUN WITH NUTS PLEASE . DUMP THIS GUN IN GARBAGE PLEASE . Tip good for 10 joints	-1
The bottom part is what I wrote thinking and looking at the photo Just knowing that I was getting what has been Weller 's mainstay for 50 years.LIE LIE LIE LIKE A RUG ! Which is another way to say a `` BEAR FACED LIE '' Or LAY as in getting hmmmmmm I can not say that word on hear as this is not TV . Nothing about this pistol style soldering gun reflects the older ones . Normally it is new and improved right ? Not in this case . Speaking of CASE that is the only new part that is worth a dang , Blow molded cases are really nice , Too bad the handle piece of the gun isnt at least made of that grade of plastic . I would have settled for the old handle rather than the new style which is ba terrible grade of reused recycled caca . The posts that hold the copper tip they screwed up with as well . Come one set screws for a joint that has constant heat and cool cycle . The old style with the nuts over the tip metal worked just fine . If it ai n't broke you do not have to go out and break it dummy . WHAT YOU CA N'T even get the product labels on straight . Hey there us a sot cast into the handle for them to fit inside the handle.I hope to find a way to take photos and show how bad this stuff is.Tell you what Weller send me the old style Handle you can send the lables with the backing on them I can at least get them put on straight . Send me new posts that have the nuts that screw onto and hold the tip to them . also a new tip with the nuts to hold them on . The proper type of trigger switch that lets the light dim when you do the one stage two stage type . that has a focus lens in the bulb/ I have not wanted to take it apart to see how bad it is in side so let us leave it at that OK Weller Or at least send me the parts list for the old style guns so I can build one from scratch . If you do that I can find a few illegal aliens to start assembling them I could sell them much fast than you can The word will get out in a heart beat , dray '' '' '' '' '' My Mom got me one of these so I could solder some little things I needed to solder together . Hey we lived out a ways and she got them with S & H ; Green Stamps . Yes I did learn to solder much better with other types later on still Every time I see one I think back to then . Back in the 70 's I taught soldering classes at both Litton Ind and JPL in LA . One of my demo 's was to show folks how to write their name with 22ga rosin multi core solder using one of these guns on low power and with a special home made tip I built out of solid copper wire.To this day they still make these guns the same as they always have and I hope they always will . It is funny these guns cost $ 26 back then , , , , Let us say almost 50 years ago . and the still cost the same to this day . Course minimum wage was only 90 cents an hour back then . Hey I drove a tractor and got a dollar an hour plus room and board in the bunk house . After dinner we would get together some of us and walk the three miles to the general store use the pay phone their . A local call cost a dime . Or spit on a penny and slide it just right and you got back fifteen cents change . Opps is their a statue of limitations on that I hope . I never call out of state.dray	-1
This & # 34 ; old & # 34 ; design may have been great 75 years ago , but I find it difficult to use , and not friendly to the surface . It is also very heavy , works best from your & # 34 ; handed & # 34 ; side , and has too loose a fit on the sliding handle . I stopped using this after two days and bought a titanium nail puller .	-1
This is a good belt , so I thought . I used it several times until the buckle kept coming undone . I finally gave up when I it came off while I was on a ladder 12 feet off the ground . I threw it out for safety reasons .	-1
I never received the results of the test after waiting six weeks to hear from the testing lab . I sent the charcoal bag to some lab in Texas . I would not recommend this product to my friends . I am disappointed in such a lag time ! I have never received the results from the lab . The price was cheap and so is the product . It is a waste of time and money . I would have never bought this product if I knew up front that it takes six weeks to get the results ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
1 ) Wasted the purchase price . 2 ) Wasted the postage to mail it 3 ) Waited 3 weeks and absolutely nothing . The web site is constantly down and then I am told that maybe the mail is late . Absolutely a waste of more than $ 20 and more so the time to find out the test . I should never have bought this bogus kit . This is not a first alert product , it is a small company that clearly can barely run a business .	-1
The instructions state to use two first class stamps . The envelope said to use five . I should have used five , I followed the instructions and it got returned to me . Unfortunately with MLK day and the weekend now I 'm over 10 days so by the time it would get there it would be invalid.The other problem is that the card you print your information on is unnecessarily small . I do n't see why they ca n't make this larger ( perhaps a full piece of paper ) and give me more space to enter my information.The kit is good and the idea is of decent quality . But after this mess I 'll probably just buy an actual detector . If I did this again I 'd make sure the test started on a Saturday morning and ended on Monday morning and I 'd take it to the post office counter .	-1
As a professsional firefighter/paramedic for nearly 13 years , I see a lot of fires . I do know that most detectors out there are NOT dual sensor ... .they are mostly only ionization detectors that detect flame . Remember it 's usually not the fire that will kill you , it 's the smoke and it 's deadly component carbon monoxide . Photoelectric detectors detect these smoke particles and alert you ... ... .ionization rarely do if it 's a slow smoldering fire . If your sleeping , by the time the ionization sensors detect the actual flames , the smoke and the CO will most likely have already gotten to you and you will be dead . That 's why it 's so VERY VERY important to have a dual-sensor smoke detector . This item is NOT a dual sensor and the manufacturer clearly states every home should have both types of sensors to protect you 100 % from fire related death/injury . Always look for a photoelectric/ionization detector and buy one . Have one in your hallway , in the main living room at the very least and I always like to put one in each room because I am overly cautious . Also make sure to have a B-C extinguisher on hand near the kitchen to put out kitchen grease fires ... .the # 1 cause of residential structure fires . Hopefully you can put a small one out , but if you discharge the entire extinguisher and the fire is not out ... ... evacuate the house immediately and make sure you or someone called 911 prior to exiting your home . Stay safe !	-1
We bought 2 of these to put in when we purchased our house a year ago . I am replacing batteries way too often . In the past year , I have replaced the batteries in one detector twice , and the other three times .	-1
The good : - Low price- Very smallThe bad : - Only has ionization sensorThis product only has an ionization sensor , it lacks a photoelectric sensor . I bought this product because rental code required a smoke detector in each room . I bought a dual-sensor for the hallway , and bought these cheap ones to comply with rental code.I would not use an ionization-only smoke detector as the only device protecting my family or my tenants ' family .	-1
Today this pump stopped working for me . I am not happy . I just bought it in Aug. 2012 - I use it for my goldfish and he needs this fountain // water flow , especially now . Of course it 's the new year eve and yadda yadda so I 'm SOL ... ... ... If it were not needed for my 17 year old gold fish I would not care . FISH NEED AIR . Of course it 's late in the day too . : ( ( ( I am so upset .	-1
I bought this tape to use to put plastic over our windows . I bought this specifically because the stuff that comes with the shrink window insulation is usually cheap.This stuff came down on 6 of 7 windows ! I am floored and shocked and pretty upset.I put this plastic insulation over my windows every year for 10 years . This is not a new process for me.TO have one window come loose is rare . TO have 2 window seals come loose is extremely rare . To have 6 of 7 is unheard of ! I '' m really not pleased.And i use the Scotch brand each year . I do n't know why this did not hold , my only guess i that this taps has been sitting for a long time on the shelf and it 's old . Ca n't explain it otherwise .	-1
As has been pointed out in other reviews , this sanding block has little or nothing to recommend it . It IS made of a light weight plastic , it relies on four small plastic pins to hold the block together in use , and is not in any way contoured to fit the hand.I have found that the block will not stay together unless I tape the joint on both sides of the block ( duct tape ) . It is far too light , too insubstantial to do any serious work with requiring far too much energy and attention to work at all well.Maybe for modelers but I can not see this used anyplace else : I would certainly suggest a different sanding block .	-1
I had a heavy solid rubber sanding block that I gave to my son . I ordered this one to replace it and was very disappointed . Cheap , flimsy light plastic and hollow shell . I ca n't imagine this lasting more than one good sanding session . Typical of things made these days , including most cars , appliances and tools . 3M used to be a quality-based company . Guess the good people in charge who cared about quality passed away . I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a quality sanding block .	-1
Despite my best intentions and the wording of the ad , this was the wrong size for my vac . Had to send it back .	-1
No Maglite product can get a & quot ; no star & quot ; rating - they are very well built . However , if you want the best ultra-compact light , you need to look to the Photon Microlight or the ARC AAA light . They use LED 's , and give , for all practical purposes , the same amount of light for many , many hours more than the AAA Maglite .	-1
The light is bright the first few times you use it after that it is dim and useless . Better off buying one of those LED key chains for like 2 bucks .	-1
As a keyring flashlight the Solitaire could hardly be worse . The light quality is terrible . It does look nice , though .	-1
Replaced all my mini-mag and large mag lights with Fenix and Pelican LED lights . Mags are behind the curve . The difference is amazing when you compare a Fenix 1 AAA cell light against a mini mag . You may as well not have a light if you are using the mini mag .	-1
The Mag-Lite Solitaire is well designed and well made but simply is n't bright enough . However , if all you use a flashlight for is looking for your keys under the seat of your car or assisting with reading menus , it may be OK . It has a sleek design , and it 's appeareance wo n't draw attention on a keychain . It functions like any other ( large ) mini mag light , by twisting the end where the light comes out to turn it on and off . Change the battery by unscrewing the other end . A spare bulb is concealed within the end cap.Pros : -It 's small.-it 's well made , with all components fitting together smoothly , and a clean simple appearence.Cons : -it 's just not that bright . Some of the newer LED flashlights are of a similar size but much brighter.Overall , I 'd have to give this one a pass , unless I developed a fetish for small , well designed gadgets ( like watches , watches are SOOO cool ! and miniature sextents , those things are SOOO neat ! ) . OK , so I have this fetish , and this would explain why I have a Solitaire in my toolbox .	-1
The lifespan of this poor thing as the companion to the spare house keys can be measured in decades . True , it is durable and tough . Recently , my LED keychain light died , so I decided to take up this poor , taken-for-granted thing on my keychain to take to work daily.What a piece of junk . The light it gives is truly weak and pathetic , even with a brand new battery ; there was not one task I gave it that it did even passably well at . After a few uses , I felt like throwing it onto the freeway for many cars and trucks and big rigs to run over and gloriously destroy.Do not buy this thing for any use under any circumstances .	-1
Very disappointed that maglight would sell such a useless flashlight , even with a new battery it is so dim you can barely see it - do n't wate you money . Another reviewer mentioned the Photon Microlights , I 'll try that instead	-1
The product description details of this item clearly stated the bulb type is LED . However the version that I received is the old incandescent model . It is not worth going through the hassle of a return so I will look for a LED conversion kit .	-1
Technology is a marvelous thing . I remember when the Pentium 4 processors were the end-all be-all of personal computing power . I remember when six megapixels in a camera was a `` whooooooaaaa '' moment.Things change , and this is especially true of electronics.We 've had LEDs for years , but until the past few years they had been destined to serve their place as tiny indicator lights . Well , that has changed . Big time.LED technology is now advancing at a pace comparable to the PC boom of the early 2000s . LEDs are getting brighter , more efficient , and much cheaper to produce.The history : I have a 1977 Eveready `` Little Commander '' flashlight that runs on a single AA battery and puts out what I guess to be about .5 lumen . I bet you that was great back then . The Maglite Solitaire puts out a recorded 2.3 lumens , which can be focused or spread out.The product : The Maglite was the standard of excellence for years , both with law enforcement and in the home . They 're tough , bright , and dependable . The same is true of the Solitaire ( although on a much smaller scale ) .My Solitaire is about seven years old , still on the original bulb ( the exception , not the rule judging by the other reviews ) , is still water resistant , still has great connections , and is still solid as a rock.It has , however , gotten a bad rap due to newer , brighter , and more efficient lights which have come out recently.The competition : Fenix- E01 , L0D , LD01 ; 4Sevens- Preon I ; etc.These are lights that operate on a single AAA battery just like the Solitaire , but offer much higher lumen counts ( 10~90 ) , much longer runtimes , and a much more robust light source ( LED vs. incandescent ) .My Fenix E01 throws 10 lumens for 10 hours , with an additional 10 hours on a low-power mode . The Solitaire throws 2.3 lumens for about ... well , 2.3 hours.Maglite as a company has rested on their laurels for too long and have become complacent in the ever-growing marketplace . They have a few LED adaptations of their classic lights , but it seems like they 're considering this whole LED revolution a `` fad '' that people will grow out of . `` They 'll get tired of the cool-hued , cold and sterile look of the LEDs ... '' Not gon na happen.This is not to say that incancesdents do n't still have a place.I still use my Solitaire to read at night so as to not disturb my wife.It is a bit overpriced for what it is compared to others in the marketplace , but it is still a quality light that will be dependable. -- -- -- -- UPDATE ( 6/4/11 ) -- -- -- -- The original title of my review was `` 4 stars 5 years ago , 3 stars today '' . Well , I can say that it 's dropped down a star . There are a plethora of single AAA that outshine the Solitaire in all areas , including output , runtime , versatility , and durability.Even though my Solitaire is still reliably pumping out its 2.3 lumens , it 's been outshined ( ha ) by my other single AAA lights .	-1
The quality is great and it 's easy to operate . I bought a couple of these as keychain lights . However , the light output even with a fresh battery really is n't sufficient for my use .	-1
Not sure if I have a different type of Kwikset lock or what , but this tool did n't fit . I would suggest trying to take your lock apart before buying this tool . The product description could be improved upon .	-1
Granted I 've only used this on the deadbolt cores and not the knob cores . However , for the deadbolt core , one uses this piece of metal to pry a c-ring off . Fingers or a screwdriver could do the same thing . It 's a wire c ring . Let 's hope when my knob fails this tool will actually be important . Until then , I keep it in my toolbag to add a little extra weight so I can get stronger lifting it around .	-1
This tool was far more cumbersome to use than a screwdriver and an allen wrench to take apart the SmartKey handle sets . Would n't recommend unless you do n't own a small flat blade screwdriver . It 's not well made either , just stamped metal with rough edges .	-1
I purchased this to repair a lamp and it seemed to work well . But this week the lamp died . I troubleshooted every which way , to be sure it was n't the bulb or my wiring . But it 's the kit .	-1
I thought I would give it a shot but after recieving it it was very flimsy and didnt look good . Up on the ceiling looked cheap.Better off finding one made of foam that alows you to cut and trim and shape it to allow fixture to sit right .	-1
Well it died in 24 months and 4 months . Nice light when it worked . Now it 's back to the switch and no auto light .	-1
Cheap , not shiny , but more of a matte black and its a weird plastic , I wont get again . I also found similar for less money at the home store . Maybe I got a bad one , but I wo n't try again .	-1
The plate is OK . The standard switch side fit my existing standard switch and the GFI ( large opening ) side fit my newly installedAube by Honeywell TI070-3W/U ECONO Switch Programmable Timer Switch , Whitejust fine . What I found reduced the value of this plate considerably was the screws that came with it . There was one long screw ( that matched the four long screws I removed along with the existing `` standard '' two switch wall plate , and one short screw.Turns out you can use either short or long screws on the `` standard switch '' side but require short screws on the GFI side ( or you can needlessly drill holes in your wall so the longer scerws will work ) . The picture shows four screws and I would have expected , at a minimum , to have four screws supplied with the product .	-1
Cracked on first installation . Bottom screw on GFI side is very close to the edge and the material is rigid , so one turn too tight and it will crack .	-1
Initially I thought this was a great deal , but the piece of junk cracked in three spots as soon as I tightened the screw . Went to Home Depot and bought an `` unbreakable '' one for half the price .	-1
This product is worthless ! If you think I 'm out of line saying this-then do this : Get the Stanley Two Outlet With Pull Chain Socket , it just costs $ 1.00 more . Look at the difference . When you choose the Leviton over the Stanley , the Stanley company looses a sale.Levitron gets the sale asnd grows and Stanley fades-I hate to see this happen ! I have no vested interest in any product my reviews are honest , my reviews are trustworthy .	-1
two of the teeth cracked off the second time i used it . very moderate hand pressure on the supplied chuck . does n't make you feel too good when you can feel it crumbling in your bare hands ... . see photo ... i 'd recommend moving to the 33BA-1/2 '' which at the time of writing , i 've seen on amazon for the same price.http : //www.amazon.com/Jacobs-Thread-2-13mm-Bearing-31811C/dp/B00E864WRY	-1
I had exactly the same problems as others have noted , and after much effort got in touch with the customer service manager who really paid attention to my problem . They have redesigned the control , and shipped me a pre-production sample to test . This updated unit works fine . So hold off for a while until version 1.1 comes on the market .	-1
While I 've not had the reliability issues others have had , I have a different beef about this product . After power is restored from a power failure , the light kit is turned on to 100 % ! Power outages are frequent in Florida and many happen at night . Try getting a bright light in your face every , single , time , a power outage happens . Not fun . So much so that I 've replaced all of these with a different brand to avoid this issue . Never had this problem with the Hampton Bay remotes I installed nearly 15 years ago , nor the ones I installed last month to replace these .	-1
Should of stayed home and bought didnt read discription on shipping cost way more with the shipping cost .	-1
It really is junky , it jammed for us after using it only a couple of times . I would look at a different brand maybe for a stapler . Arrow used to be good but they have cheapened their product to the point it is not usable when it needs replaced so quickly .	-1
I bought this and returned it . It jammed every few staples , while I put up my Christmas lights . A 15 minute job turned into an hour . Clearing jams every few staples is not desirable . I 'm going to get one with great reviews . Put your money into a quality product , this thing is cheap . It 's made in the USA , but for some reason this company hired the lowest bidder here .	-1
After light use ( homeowner ) for three years , a a ring broke and the clevis pin fell out , rendering the staple gun useless . Warranty ? Two years . Parts available ? Yes , for $ 1.00 plus $ 5.15 shipping from Arrow , for a total of $ 6.15 for a tiny steel ring that should have never broken . Obviously Arrow QA thought this was good enough . In sum , if you need a light-duty , not very comfortable stapler that is cheap at the outset but expensive to maintain , buy this stapler .	-1
5/16 wide staples come in various depths.Pros : -apparently sturdy construction-forceful staple action so no trouble going through pine ( if held straight ) -easy staple loading if there are no jamsCons : -rounded handle makes steady grip difficult and two-handed grip preferable to keep stapler absolutely perpendicular to surface , which is a must-difficult for smaller hands-high effort to squeeze handle-removing staple tray to clear jams is a clumsy process needing screwdriver and pliers .	-1
This is a review of the new RED staple gun from Arrow , an upgrade from the T50 . After trying two of the guns I will not try another . The gun is very powerful and can flush drive a 9/16 staple into hard pine very nicely . However , I had a some problems with the gun . I had many miss-fires when shooting into all materials . I believe the weak spring used to advance the staples might be to blame here . My guns were also very hard to open and fill with staples . The release did not operate properly . Third was when shooting into hardboard with 1/2 staples some drove all the way in and some stood proud of the surface , making it necessary to use the hammer . The last thing was the firing handle would come out of the socket when using it and need to be relocated back in place . All time consuming and frustrating.I am still looking for a better solution . Maybe the Duo Fast CS-5000 ?	-1
FLUIDMASTER use to be & # 34 ; the only game in town. & # 34 ; It was my preferred brand for years..With the latest design , quality has gone down . The devices are flimsier and defective . I recently purchased two kits . Both went bad within a month - the water release triggers did not work . As a result , I had to open the tank and manually release the water during flushing . Also , the chain got caught too frequently .	-1
I have purchased a number of these . The manufacturer used to include a con washer and a threaded connector so you could attach the unit to a one half inch copper feed line . Those of us who live in old houses understand this.I just bought one at Home Depot , and got home to discover these parts , worth at least 2 cents , are no longer included . You have to go back and bay them , sold separately . Nothing on the box about this - the instructions do n't even mention connecting the unit to a feed line of any kind.The unit works well , but this is so cheap ! ! ! the plumbing ref calls foul and Fluidmaster is in the penalty box ! !	-1
Bought this to try since I usually work alone and could often use a little extra `` reach '' on my tape . While this one does provide a little more than my old Stanley Powerlocks , that feature is worthless because of all the effort required to get the lock to engage . By the time I get it locked I 've shaken the tape so much that I might as well have been carrying a little pocket tape . I had hoped that after using it awhile that the lock would `` break in '' and become usable , but just the opposite happend - adding a little dirt made it almost impossible to lock at all . Also noticed that because of the large arc in the blade that the end tab needs to be longer ; it does n't want to stay hooked as well as my other tapes . Add in the overall bulk of the case and this is possibly the worst tape I 've ever owned .	-1
I own three of these Stanley FatMax 25-foot tape measures that I purchased about four years ago . The tape lock on all of them has failed . I would not purchase this tape measure.I also own two Stanley 25-foot PowerLock tape measures that I purchased about four years ago . These PowerLock tape measures still work perfectly . They are also much cheaper than the FaxMax units . I just ordered ( 12/20/2013 ) three more of the PowerLock units .	-1
I 'm with the other 2 star guy . I use mine many times a day . I wear them out fast . If you bend it to read the tape , its nick city , then tape tear , then new tape . I 'll be getting the cheaper one myself . UPDATEWhatever problems they had they are fixed I tried all the other tapes ( I got a pile ) they are not worth the effort . At any rate I kept using my last tape and am still using it , changed the case ( old broken tape ) because the lock quit working , but still the same blade all this time , and I measure a lot .	-1
It is a great tape but it does not retract if its more than 5 foot out . I have to pull it back in with my hand ! !	-1
This is a good tape and I have many of them ... at least 10 on hand and have gone though maybe 5 or 6 . In the last couple years trying to make life easier while still doing a lot of the work I have let others strap on the tool bags and have just put the tape on my pants pocket.I recomend folks take the pocket clip off and grind the inside so it does n't cut the threads on your pants pocket . I noticed I 've got several pair of expensive work pants and the pocket is just shreaded and many of them have about an inch of pocket missing now.It 's like a razor blade on the inside of the pocket clip and a single day of use will completly shread your pants pockets .	-1
I 've been stymied trying to find the width of the Fat Max 's body to calculate the total length . I measured it with another tape ( irony ) at 3 1/4 '' but wondered why there was n't an indication on the housing . Finally , with my arm's-length near eyesight I found a molded legend that 's almost covered by the belt clip . Pisspoor product design , but it 's a Stanley tradition . Even with reading glasses its hard to read the reflective chrome plated numerals on earlier Stanley tapes I 've owned . I wrote a big `` +3 1/4 '' on the case with a Sharpie and vow to avoid Stanley products in the future .	-1
This crow bar looks to be solid and well built but it was too short to be useful . I 'm not a big person so 12-inches does n't give me enough leverage to pry apart stuff . Also , the edge was too blunt for shimming into tight gaps .	-1
Do yourself a favor and spend another ~ $ 13 for the 12-960 Low Angle contractor grade plane with adjustable mouth . If you want a 45 cutting angle , buy a spare blade for it and bevel it at 32 . Then you have 2 planes in one . If you want a little more upscale , go with the 12-139 Bailey for ~ $ 76 . I have reviews on Amazon for both .	-1
The design of this plane is sound . It has been around for many years . The problem is the steel used in the body of the plane and the lack of finishing of the plane sole and iron.The sole of the plane is not close to being flat . Its finish is very rough . I spent hours using 10 '' diamond sharpening stones to flatten and smooth it . While resting 20 - 30 minutes between flattening/sharpening sessions , the plane developed a thin layer of rust . If you do as I did , be sure to have a good gun oil to wipe on it when you finish using it . If you do n't , you will find the plane has rusted badly . Was finally able to get it flat and smooth.The plane iron is also not flat . The back of mine is high in the center and with hours of trying to flatten it on diamond sharpening stones was unable to do so . For that reason , it will be returned.I suggest that you pay more for another model and hope to get one with a smoother plane bottom and a plane iron tha can be sharpened .	-1
This is Stanley 's simplest and cheapest plane , and if you do n't mind doing a LOT of work , you can turn it into a function tool . First , you have to flatten the bottom . This can be done with several sheets of sandpaper of various grits ranging from 120 to 320 , and anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour 's work . Next , file the mouth so it 's square , and flatten the frog as you did the sole . Last , flatten the iron and put a good edge on it , using your preferred sharpening system , . In the end you 'll have a decent plane that 's hard to adjust and has an iron that dulls quickly . Me , I 'd spend another $ 40 and get one of the good Stanleys , or spend another hundred and get a Veritas or a Lie-Neilsen that 's a pleasure to use and will last a lifetime .	-1
I saw another reviewer got a plane that he had to retool and rework to get good results from . I bought mine for one small project , and after struggling with this plane for a little while , I quickly gave up and used another approach instead . I 've used other planes , and never had so much difficulty . I may get it back out and see if I can retool it to work better as the previous reviewer did , but reviewing it as the plane I received rather than one I had to repair after receiving , I ca n't give it more than two stars .	-1
It came bent in the package and when I attempted to straighten it snapped in two pieces . I think it is smarter to buy it at home depot and buy it there so if you have a problem you can settle it right away and get a new replacement without hassle and most importantly time waist..	-1
I 've tried to use one of these and they just do n't work for me . The mechanism that latches the blade out will let the blade retract the second that you put any significant pressure on it . I usually end up either just using a razor blade with no holder or else an automotive style gasket scraper razor blade holder that does n't retract if I really need a handle . The concept is good , a razor blade holder that you can keep in your pocket or toolbag while you 're working , but it just does n't work in practice .	-1
Stanley 28-500 Razor Blade ScraperTwo bucks is about all this tool is worth . It works , but the blade extension mechanism is fair at best and sometimes gets stuck , especially as the tool gets dirty . There is n't anything about this tool that distinguishes it from all the other cheap razor scrapers on the market . My advice is to buy a scraper locally and avoid shipping charges .	-1
The body of the knife is alloy , but the blade holder is a cheap piece of bent sheet metal that you have to fumble around with to hold the blade and get it in the right notches . I am disappointed in this purchase , especially since it is supposed to be a classic designed knife.Once I got it together it worked like a charm .	-1
I bought this thinking it would be a useful and versatile tool to keep handy in my tool bag with a few extra blades for different applications . First thing I noticed is how thick this thing is , nearly 2 '' wide in some spots and about 1.5 '' everywhere else , not a huge deal the designers needed to make room for the internal storage compartment . The next thing I noticed , much to my irritation , is that the entire handle is made out of cheap abs plastic , the kind that literally shatters if it falls from too high and hits something hard . Another gripe I have about this handle is that instead of being assembled with screws this was glued/snaped together , making working on it virtually impossible . My third gripe is that you can only use 6 '' or shorter blades in both the saw 's arbor and storage compartment while still maintaining the folding feature , the fact that it wo n't take 8 '' blades is incredibly aggravating . Finally the locking arbor only half works , by this I mean that the blade can be locked open but not closed , due to either poor manufacturing or a design flaw . The only possible problem I can figure is that the lip on the closed side of the arbor was n't cut back far enough to allow the locking mechanism to be engaged , hence why not being able to dismantle the saw is so irritating . Overall this item is a POS that is likely the result of the designers not adhering to the 6Ps.Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance .	-1
I was hoping the blade for this one lasted more , it did the job OK but I think the material used for its blade is very cheap . I did couple of small MDF sawing jobs and the blade is gone . I do n't recommend this product .	-1
I picked up this mitre box and saw at the local home-improvement store over the weekend . It 's a cheap product and it shows when using it . The plastic body of the mitre box is quite mediocre and flimsy . The saw is serviceable , but I 've had mitre saws in the past that worked much better than this . The clamps are pretty worthless . I recommend paying more for a better combo . I 'm surprised at the drop in quality of these Stanley tools , but they are being manufactured in Asia these days .	-1
I used to buy Stanley stuff for years but the fact they had the Chinese stamp/mold `` STANLEY '' on a worthless POS miter box like this one makes me pause on buying anything else from them . I guess they let the communist Chinese do their design work as well as manufacture.The saw gets bound up in the slots and the saw is a POS as well . DO NOT BUY !	-1
Do you really need more cheap plastic junk ? It 's easy to smash if you 're frustrated . Or you could save your money , and your sanity .	-1
bought this to do one bathroom ... ..did not get but one piece of trim done . The blades on the saw are soooooo big that it looks more like you could go out and whack down a tree with it ! You spend more time cutting parts of the mitre box for some reason , as I had yellow shavings everywhere . Needless going to go get a much better one that does not ruin my trim .	-1
the torx is the only real useful tool in here for the evo4g . not a big fan , just use a credit card instead	-1
Seeing is how the 2 , 5 star reviews on this item are from fake users who seem to be trash talking other iphone battery sellers and 5 staring there own is pretty messed up so therefore it appears this seller is some type of scammer .	-1
Ordered new battery and it 's worse then the old battery was for staying charged . Our daughters iPhone 4 had bad battery life so ordered because it was supposed to be apple OEM battery but still battery life is even worse then her original battery that came with the phone new so now I have to try and order another new OEM battery to replace this one I bought last month ... This battery should have brought her phone battery life back to new so her charge would last more then just a couple minutes after a full charge	-1
SEE UPDATE AT BOTTOM OF REVIEW ! BATTERY IS WORSE THAN THE ONE I WAS REPLACINGThis saved me a lot of money ! I read about doing this on CNET , then watched the YouTube video , then found an awesome step-by-step written instruction guide . Just Google `` iphone 4s battery replacement '' and you will see the video , and also the CNET article . In the comments section of the CNET article is a helpful link to the step-by-step instructions.It took me about 20 mins and it worked ! As other people have said , just take your time and be careful with the tiny screws and the little gold piece . It 's very easy to lose these pieces ! They 're also extremely tiny . I 'm a petite female but I felt oafish as my fingers tried to manipulate these tiny pieces.I 'm so glad I did n't give Apple $ 70+ bucks to do this . So grateful to whoever makes this product.IMPORTANT : If your phone does n't turn on when you put it back together , do n't panic ( like I did haha ) . Plug the phone into the wall charger because the battery may well be dead . I thought I had ruined my phone , but the new battery just needed to be charged and it 's working fine ( knock on wood ) .UPDATE : After less than 24 hours , I 'm downgrading this from 5 stars to 2 ( still giving 2 for the relative ease of replacement ) . The battery I bought is no better than the one I was replacing ! I have screenshots of my phone at 94 % battery 23 minutes after a full charge . After an hour last night , it was at 74 % ( I was just on email and have already configured my settings to use as little battery as possible ) . This is worse than the battery I bought to replace it ! I get that these are n't brand new batteries , but it 's unacceptable to have customers pay for a battery replacement and then sell one that ca n't hold a charge . Why would I pay money and go through the hassle of replacing my battery to get something that works WORSE than the one I had ? The worst part is , after putting my phone back together , I tried to unscrew the back again to check placement of the batery , and one of the screws wo n't come out . One did fine , but one of them seems to be stuck -- the tiny screwdriver does n't seem to be `` catching '' the screw . So now my cover may be stuck on , making it impossible to even replace it . I will probably end up taking it to Apple and spending $ 70+ ) to fix TechAhead 's mistake . I contacted Amazon customer service and I 'm sure they 'll make it right , but I do NOT recommend this product . The battery is worse than the one I had ! Some must be good because there are so many positive reviews , but what kind of company sells extremely used and sub-par batteries and passes them off as replacements ? I guess you get what you pay for . BE CAREFUL .	-1
It looked like the original battery for sure . Came with all the tools necessary to install it . But when it came to test it out , it does n't hold a charge as well as the almost two year old battery it 's replacing . Disappointing . I would buy somewhere else if I were you .	-1
The item i ordered was red , and the one i received was yellow . That would have been okay , except that this level had no measurement markings , although it is exactly 4ft long . It is not very useful without inch markings .	-1
I do not recommend this awl . There are better ones out there . I had an older stanley that was great until I lost it on a job . The `` steel '' is weak and I doubt it will last . Point was not machined properly at the tip ... I had to grind it a little to form a point .	-1
This tapes lock mech held better but still a bit too large in my small hand . ergonomically the Komelons feel better .	-1
It suppose to be a proper measuring tape but turned out not to be , It gets stuck ever so often that I now refuse to use it .	-1
My wife had one of these and I used it for some rough construction work outside . It was not perfectly square but it was close enough for building a fence . The level was so far out of plumb so as to be useless . Besides , it broke when I knocked it off my bench . The blade came out , the holding pin was lost , so it ca n't ever be used as a square again . For less money , you can buy the Empire `` pro '' square , which , although it is no Starrett , is still accurate and much more robust . I keep the Starrett inside my shop . The empire is in the traveling toolbox . The old Stanley blade will make a great scraper or paint-can opener .	-1
This is lightweight aluminum ( it does say `` aluminum '' in the description ) but it is more of a toy-grade aluminum than a carpenter 's tool , or even a homeowner 's grade tool . But , that 's the very least of the problem . For me , and I have 20/30 eyesight , and even better eyesight up close , the markings are impossible to read without a magnifying glass . This is not because they are too small , but because everything - the markings and the entire square are exactly the same grayish-white color . The `` hash marks '' and the numbers are thin , shallow hairlines barely cut into the surface . If you have 5-minutes to spare , carefully studying this thing , then buy it . Even after you think that you know where the 3 & 3/8ths inch line is , if you glance away for a second , and then look back , you wo n't be able to see it again ! The aggravation this thing will cause will be enough for you to throw it away in disgust , but since it is shaped like a boomerang , it will likely come back and hit you in the head .	-1
This square was bent during construction , probably by rough handling ( was packaged very well , is n't delivery damage ) . It 's cheapness is an obvious lack of concern for the great Stanley brand . It is n't square , and is missing the scales , tables , etc . To be avoided if you want a quality carpenters square .	-1
This square is pretty standard and seems accurate . The downside is that it is made out of somewhat thin aluminum . I stepped on it once and bent it easily . My swanson square is thicker and has never bent with the occasional misstep . I 'd recommend buying the swanson instead .	-1
I have to mention that the nails are superb . Excellent holding power and no jams . Made in Canada , not overseas.The nails are packed in a paper box which is not suitable for shipping . Ordered 4 packs , all arrived in pieces . Bostitch should use a different packaging materialfor online stores . My advise , buy locally . It costs $ 5 more per 1000 than on Amazon in my local HD .	-1
I should have known better as several reviewers mentioned the same problem , but I tried it anyway . My package arrived completely busted within the shipping box , with all nails ripped from their strips . I used it anyway , only because I needed it that day . Next time , I 'll go to Lowes .	-1
Bad to purchase and be shipped . They came broken in pieces requiring too much time to be continually reloading . not good	-1
I sometimes fail to remember that one gets what they pay for and this sander was no exception to that rule . I saw the 'price ' and the 'intent ' of this tool right off the bat . The price was right in that it was practically free compared to its nearest competitor ! Unfortunately , the competitor sander had a lot more 'intent ' , and consequently ... higher quality , durability and reliability in mind during the design and manufacturing process . My new Porter Cable 550 will probably end-up in my Great Grandchildren 's hands in serviceable condition , and I am not a Grandpa yet ! After taking this sander out of its box , and putting it to use , it soon became clear that I could not keep sandpaper on it . As a result of its Billion RPM orbital action , it kept tearing off along the securing clamps on either end of the sander . I tried about every little trick I could think of before tossing this tool into the & quot ; lesson-learned pile & quot ; of other bargain-priced power tools in my shop . You know , the ones too worthless to really use , and too valuable to throw away ? Do n't end up spending your money twice on the same sort of tool . GO GET A PORTER CABLE , OR EQUIVALENT ! ! ! If you want the Black and Decker Sander above , send me an email and you can have mine for the cost of shipping ! Handy Dan	-1
I guess , what do u want for $ 25 ? It just gunked up and makes a buzzing sound and wo n't move after a year . Cheap junk . buyer beware .	-1
The main gear is plastic . It broke within the first week I had it using it under a light load .	-1
This is a little screwdriver that works well to drive a few screws , but has limited use in my shop for large projects . Great for those time when you have a dozen screws to remove . The locking mechanism broke the first day , so the screwdriver can not be used manually .	-1
I got this thing two years ago . It no longer can be charged , works only when plugged in . In addition , even when new , the battery would discharge itself in about an hour when not plugged into the charger . Complete waste of money .	-1
I received a 9.6V cordless drill/driver as a gift . With a cordless device , you need a backup battery , unless you have time to wait for the dead battery to recharge . After searching the internet for a spare battery , I found the best deal here on Amazon , which included free shipping ! : ) & # 9658 ; Update - September 22 , 2013This battery pack is failing ... weak , even after being recharged . The battery that came with the drill/driver is still strong.I 've decided to drop the product rating to show my displeasure . : (	-1
It 's better just to send your original NiCad battery packs to a recell company and have NiMH cells put in them . Twice the energy storage with half the problems of NiCad .	-1
Get a Dewalt . The B & D products are not made as well and will not get through as many projects . Plus , the B & D batteries do n't last very long at all .	-1
This battery , after minor modification ( small tab needs to be cut off using knife ) , can be used in Dewalt 12V tool range . This battery costs more than 2 times less than DeWalt battery , so you may think `` Why should I pay for brand name , if I can get same for less money ? '' And you will be wrong . This battery is very , very weak . While declared capacity is 1.2ah , the real capacity is around 0.7ah I guess . I 've installed it , fully charged , into DeWalt DC940 cordless drill . Used 8x120mm screws into pine . The 1st screw went in fine , but battery emitted bad odour . I 've tried to screw another one , but on halfway , drill stopped , and battery emitted much more bad odour ( something rotten-flesh like , never seens such odour from battery ) .That 's ALL ! ! ! One fully charged battery managed to screw only one and half screw into wood ! So , if you going to buy this , remember that you can only use it for light duty applications , and never put it into any Dewalt XRP series tools .	-1
It does work as screw driver , sorta . It 's too long to get into a lot of places . The fold over handle does n't go far enough . And not having a variable speed really sucks . I can get my cordless variable speed drill into just about any place this will go and some that it wont.Do n't try to use this to put slot head screws into finished wood . You will end up with gouges from it slipping off of the screw head because it sorta jump-starts when you press the button.The poor quality batteries are a whole other issue since they seem to die and wont take a charge after just a few cycles through the charger , when you can get the charger to work . I now have 4 chargers . 3 double , only one of those still works on one side . And one single charger that quit working after just a few uses.This has now joined the growing collection of `` Things that do n't work '' that I have . Along with the VersaPak Scum Buster , and the VersaPak Drill .	-1
I looked at this in the store and found it difficult to move the button that shifts from one position to the other . The button is smooth and set in so that your thumb ca n't get a grip on it and you have to use your nail . Although I did not consider the unit any further because of this problem , someone else might find it okay .	-1
I did n't want to spend a lot on something like this , because as a do-it-yourselfer , I would only use this maybe 3 times a year max . I 'm not a contractor who would make something like this take a beating so I did n't want to spend extra money on durability that would n't pay off . But this is a total piece of junk.When I was trying to assemble this , the 'pins ' would not fit into the holes of the vice screw and vice crank . I know stuff like this happens when things are mass-produced , so I jiggled the pieces around , tried using a rubber mallet to force the pins in ... could not get it . I do n't know how much time I wasted on this step , maybe 10 minutes and it became clear it was n't going to happen.I tried using it anyways cause I have stuff to do , and figured that all I had to do was tighten the vice screw by hand to adjust the jaws and that it would be usable but an inconvenience , but it really is unusable because it ca n't stay put.I do n't know if you would call this poorly designed , or poorly manufactured , but either way this is getting returned.And I found it a little odd that in the instructions , figure nine shows that you hammer the rubber feet onto the legs of the workbench , and yet mine came with the rubber feet already on . Does this mean I got somebody else 's return ?	-1
I dont know what metal they used on these , but these pliers started rusting within 2 weeks . I am a klein man ; from lineman 's to screwdriver 's I swear by the company . Something tells me these were counterfeit .	-1
I bought one of these based on the positive reviews . I now assume they were written by Bench Dog employees . This thing is an utter waste of $ 10 . It does not hold the blade unless you raise it all the way up , wasting time . Even then it does a lousy job of holding the blade . I am back to the tried and true method of a block of wood and being careful not to destroy my knuckles .	-1
After jamming a scrap of wood between the blade and the table of my arbor saw and radial arm saw for years I ordered the Bench Dog to get to the free shipping cutoff . Using this to take off the radial arm saw blade for cleaning was EASY . I put it under the blade , lowered the radial arm saw blade into it without exerting much pressure , and took the arbor nut right off . This tool probably saved me 5 minutes . Considering I 've installed and reinstalled blades after sharpening ( the days when this was normal ) , and installed new blades to replace old ones ( today 's normal ) perhaps 100 times ( not counting Dado blades ) this tool could have saved me perhaps 8 or 9 hours of time over 30 years taking off blades and another 8 or 9 hours putting them back on . It 's worth the cost.UPDATE - It works great until the inside of the tool shreds off and the it 's throw away time . I would not buy another .	-1
I am a C.ENGINEER myself . I like the product . It is an excellent air system , but it could use a better packaging . I called the JDS customer service the same day . The item came in with a big dent at the corner . JDS could use a bit morepackaging on their item . The wooden support was great , but the top had no support . I figure I had an American product I talk to them myself before I send it back to Amazon.com , I pulled up the big dent , but the filter came up crooket , or not straight . I contacted JDS . They call me back right away , I thought they will mail it back to me . I have n't received the the replacement filter yet . I may have to buy the filter on amazon.com . They could get 5 star if not the damage filter . I will strongly recomend this product .	-1
I got this sander to get into tiny places that my orbital sander could n't touch or was too powerful for , as well as contoured pieces , particularly rounded edges . For me , it 's weak , even for a detail sander . Takes a long time and does n't really smooth pieces to my liking , so I end up touching it up by hand . I 've found that it 's just as fast to do those small areas completely with hand sanding if you have a good , flexible sanding pad . It 's very weak on cleaning up glue lines and spots as well -- just lacks the power . The concept is good , but the performance is weak . If you want to invest in a detail sander , I would suggest that you go for one with considerably more power .	-1
This product is no longer on the market , I called Dremel Corporation to inquire and was told the product has benn discontinued .	-1
I 've been using Dremel rotary tools for over 25 years and they 're hard to beat . The 4.8V MiniMite , however , is a disappointment . While like the safety of the slower speeds , the battery pack has never held a charge unless it 's kept in the charger . Unplug it for a few days and it 's dead and useless .	-1
The tool is not of good quality . Some of the attachments for cutting broke after first use.After few months of use , I noticed that battery would not charge fully and the tool would be very slow and lose charge within minutes.After about 6 months , now the battery is dead and I ca n't use this product.I would not recommend this product	-1
I do hours of wood carving every day with my dremel , and it began to take a toll on my hand/wrist . With a smaller object to grip , I have more ways to hold it , and get better leverage by having my fingers closer to the tip so my wrist does n't have to work as hard . The cable can get hot if run at high speed at too high of an angle , but so far no problems have arisen from the friction . Great tool for detailed work.EDIT : 5 months later , the whole thing came apart in my hands . I picked it up to try to find out what went wrong and how to fix it , and it burned my fingers badly . Turns out high speed will cause it to overheat and destroy itself . I 'm pretty ticked , but maybe that 's just the way these things work . Anyways , be careful !	-1
I 've not really had very much luck trying to use this attachment on my Dremel . The inner drive portion seems to shift and come `` out '' during usage so I have to play with it a lot . Very frustrating and seems like the design could be better . I also wish the end of the tool were flexible allowing adjustment to 90 degrees . Seems like Dremel has the market cornered for having to buy special attachments when they could design one that would do the majority without having to constantly change pieces . I 'm sure in their mind it 's a good thing because we keep buying attachments to do the projects we need to do and it means big $ $ $ $ 's for them . Overall , my son could have designed a better attachment and am extremely disappointed in the quality / performance this tool provides .	-1
I got this and am really not too thrilled . Let 's look at my list of gripes:1 . What you actually GET is NOT what is shown in this illustration or even on the box . This tool does NOT come with the pictured tool holder that provides additional stabilization and support . Even though the holder is CLEARLY shown and there is an insert about it in the box , it ai n't there.Without the holder , your Dremel is ponly attached to the `` table '' with a a collar at the top of the tool that is secured with e hex nut . This leaves the body of the tool unsupported and that much linear mass makes for easy deflection when working harder woods.2 . Once you have mounted the `` table '' to a support surface correctly mounting the tool into the holder is a real challenge ( I guess I have big fingers ) 3 . The precision of the fence and depth adjustments is really hit or miss as most of the assenbly is plastic.Overall I give it a 2 -- mostly for false inducement .	-1
It 's good for edging and such . But it is no good for cutting groves or if you want to square up a piece to trim an edge . The dremel tool mount flexes too much and you end up with a really sloppy cut . Use the router attachment and make your own table . Do not buy this . Shame on you Dremel . I 've seen better tools from Playschool .	-1
becareful when using unstable and needs to make a jig for . dremel may fallout of holder and at high speeds it wobbles and make cut incorrectly . Better to buy and use the bigger more reliable models .	-1
after which it rolled off the table , hit the floor , and broke the tip holder . It was my fault that it fell , but I did n't know it was made of glass .	-1
I have used the Dremel only once , but I tried to mark an antique hammer head , and it mostly skipped around ! I thought you were supposed to be able to write with it . Maybe I do n't have the nack yet ! Will try the diamond tip I also ordered . This is a work in progress !	-1
I have both a corded and a cordless dremel tools and this thing does n't FIT either one ? THE instruction says it will fit the cordless model i have ' but it'not even close , seems like DREMEL changes the models so often , nothing ever fits unless it 's the latest model . Discusted ! THE OLD GRUMP	-1
Change out different collets to fit different diameter Dremel bits ? I do n't think so . You 'll save yourself quite a bit of time , energy , and frustration if you get the Dremel 4486 MultiPro chuck instead.The chuck costs a bit more , but if you do projects that require constant bit changes , it 'll be well worth the money . 'Late !	-1
I have not found this item very good for its supposed use . I have tried to use it a couple times already , and each time the bit I had in it would come loose and start slipping around . Perhaps if the bits were flat on the edges to hold them better . But this chuck is not work the money . I would not recommend or buy again .	-1
I bought this product thinking it seemed like a great idea , which it would be if it operated properly . It wobbles terribly at low speeds , so much so that I refuse to keep it on my tool because I am afraid it will be damaged with continued use . Other reviewers mentioned this problem , and I agree with them completely . It simply does not hold the accessories straight , and it is therefore useless to me . Not recommended at all .	-1
First , I have to say that I purchased this item for use on a Black and Decker Rotary Tool . I thought it would be inter-changeable . I was wrong.When the Chuck was put on a Black and Decker rotary tool , it seemed to work-for a few minutes . It began to vibrate so I stopped and tightened it again . The next time I turned it on , it went flying across the room.Granted , I was not using a Dremel product and did not even purchase it with that in mind . I have already sworn off all things Dremel , after over 35 years of on and off use .	-1
Ca n't tighten enough without a tool.I gave up my small wrench for a pair of pliers or a rubber met to assist gripping.Without the use of these tools the bits come out while under pressure .	-1
So , i have the dewalt 18v cordless saw w/ lithium batteries , brand new ... i made a few 2x4 cuts and some 1/2-inch ply wood cuts and this blade started smoking the wood ... it is a terrible blade.The 18tooth blade is terrible ... and so is the 24tooth ... . just as bad ... I actually bought this pack and returned it ... i thought maybe i just wore it out too fast ... not the case ... dewalt has a horrible product they put their name on.I was looking for a replacement here on amazon . I found the Freud 24tooth blade for $ 10 shipped w/ amazon prime ... WOW - the Freud Blade is AMAZING ... . Do not waste your money with this dewalt saw blade ... .I ca n't believe dewalt has made such a horrible product with their name on it ... I know its the blade that came with the saw , and its the starter blade ... but to only make a few cuts is terrible ! ! ! ! STAY AWAY FROM THIS BLADE	-1
I put them in my radio and the signal was weak . I took battery out and put it in my battery tester and they read 'Replace ' . The date on the battery reads : 03/2017 ? Disappointed .	-1
The seller , eTailing , send me a pack of USED batteries that were in the plastic portion of a regular battery pack that was taped with clear packing tape with a home-printed label that says `` Energizer Max Alkaline AAA Batteries , 24 Count New '' . Seriously ? I will be adding my photos to this product so you can see what they actually sent . Avoid this one completely.EDIT : I can not upload photos for this product or to this review . If I can find a way to do so , I will upload them to hopefully save a future buyer some hassle . I promptly returned the garbage that was sent . It 's a good thing I bought on Amazon .	-1
I thought this was a great deal for Energizer AA Batteries , buy a 16 pack of AA for $ 12.32 ( $ .77 each ) until I found Rayovac 48 pack for $ 25.30 ( $ .53 each ) . They also come in reclose able package so after you open the pack they do not role around in your drawer . My boyfriend uses Rayovac UltraPro at work , bought them at a contractor supply store.One of my students did a battery test and found all of them work the same . Comes down to price . Sign up for `` subscribe and save '' and get 15 % off too . Because these are $ 25.40 you get Free Freight at Amazon without having to shop for more to hit the minimum.Here is the product link.Rayovac ALAA-48 UltraPRO Alkaline AA Batteries , 48-Pack	-1
After the second day the nailer became inoperable . The trigger cover would not depress the trigger . I fiddled around with it for a couple of hours becoming more and more frustrated . I remembered a review here about the safety . I noticed a small metal flap under the trigger . I do n't know if this is a safety but this metal flap was not pushing the trigger cover . I took a piece a wire and tied the flap to the cover . This solved my problem . My question ... why should I have to do this on a tool I 've had two days ? My other problem . In the box is a piece of paper that states call this phone number for problems before you call Amazon . I called the number ( before I solved the problem ) . The only thing the Porter Cable person said was `` why do n't you return it to Amazon . What do you want me to do ? '' That 's it . Why have that flyer in the box.I will think long and hard before I ever buy another Porter-Cable tool .	-1
Received product fast but box was very beaten up and re-tapped . Was missing assembly instructions and a rod . Not worth retuning since the cost to ship back was 50 % of the value .	-1
Bolts on easily . Thats where the good ends . At full extension , the support bar is 1/2 '' low to the table . When push in , the front extension rod hits the right side table extension lever . No thumbscrews for locking it at extension or any position . Poor design . I emailed Bosch and they said that is the way it was designed . ? ? ? ? ? ? I redrilled the support bar to align it to the table , then I drilled the aluminum brackets for thumbscrews and it works acceptably .	-1
One of the snap-rings used as a stopper to keep the support from sliding all the way out of its rails always catches on the housing of the Bosch table saw . This is a design flaw that should have easily been caught and fixed . It means every time I take out my saw ( because I nearly always need the extensions ) I have to fiddle with this extension in order to get it past where it catches , and again when putting it away . The back extension does n't have this problem .	-1
Pros : Bits are from Good quality . Can be used on a 10mm driller ( driver ) .Cons : Do not fit a 1/4 inch driver .	-1
I received the item very fast , Thanks to Amazons 2day free Prime shipping . Just recently used the Clic-change bit with one of the Phillips screwdriver tips , midway through the job the end of the tip cracked and broke , it is un-usable . I did n't use it in a manner that it is not suppose to be used and i take care of all my tools , was not thrown around and has been stored safely since it was purchased . I contacted Bosch and explained to them what happened and they basically told me to either ship the item to them at my own expense ( which would probably be half the cost that i paid for the set ) or send it back where I purchased it . Not even going to bother paid under $ 9 for the set , but expected it to last a little while . The Clic change bit is handy and convenient , but it feels like it will start to fail soon too . Its a shame too because i own several other Bosch products and was planning on purchasing more but this experience with the Bosch warranty service and its product made me decide to stick with other brands .	-1
For what is is , it works well . Bag will clog if cutting wet material . bag lays on ground , so if ground is wet , it 's a mess . There is no suction , so sawdust still comes up from blade , therefore material will get sawdust on it , therefore sawdust will get on the ground . I do n't know where to store this thing , so now when I need it , I 'm looking all over the place for it.2 1/2 '' shop vac hose slides right onto saw . It is the better choice . I use a foot switch christmas tree extension cord so I can turn vacum on and off with ease .	-1
i thought i would use this for the small quick cuts but once you attach the bag , the saw blows the chips into the bag ( ok so far ) BUT the pressure that builds up because the air doesnt escape out of the bag as fast as it is blown in causes the chips to blow back up through the saw blade opening right into your face ( and all around you too ) . i measured the dust i had to clean up vs the dust collected and it did seem to get about 50 % of the sawdust ( very rough/unscientific measurement ) but at that point i had to go through the exact same amount of effort to clean up the dust that blew out of the machine.not worth it	-1
The 4000K must rank way up there with the world 's greatest sawdust dispersing tools . My Dust Collector was tried and failed . It is now gathering dust ( pun intended ) . It is a nice thing to look at and seems to fit OK , but you would n't want to depend on it . I ca n't be certain with actual efficiency rating , but I 'd be shocked if you could prove it captured even half the sawdust . Get a REAL dust extractor with enough vacuum to suck the paint off the tablesaw stand , and you will be sure to collect 90 % of the saw 's by-product . The other 10 % will be up your nose unless you wear a paper mask . : - ) But real men eat sawdust , do n't they ?	-1
It so happens that I purchased several accessories to the Bosch Table SawBosch 4100-09 10-Inch Worksite Table Saw with Gravity-Rise Standbefore I bought the saw itself . The reason for doing so -- yes , I admit it was rather warped logic , if even logic at all -- was that once I had all those accessories , I just would feel forced to buy the new saw . You can see the duality , right ? Part of me wanted that saw BAD , and part of me did not want to spend the money.Anyway , once I purchased the saw ( see my review elsewhere on Amazon.com ) , I installed the dust collector bag and started using it . Before too long it developed a tear that grew increasingly larger . Because this saw is advertised as being a contractor 's tool , then it should be of a quality to support that . Not just the saw , but its accessories should be , too . A heavier gauge fabric or a different material altogether for this bag would have been appropriate . Sorry Bosch , I 'm not impressed .	-1
About 70 percent of the sawdust makes it into an empty bag with the amount becoming less as the bag fills . When the bag is over 50 % full , most of the saw dust goes in the air , on the floor , etc . I have since stopped using the bag because my shop vac hose fits the sawdust port .	-1
This item does work somewhat . not the greatest . A shop vac does a lot better . Still a lot of sawdust escapes around the saw . Without it though , it would throw a lot of chips around the shop because the blade is enclosed to funnel the sawdust out the port . A very last resort item . I hooked my saw up to a dust collection system , but used a shop vac in the mean time and it worked good if you like the noise . On the job site ? A different story , just let it blow out on the ground .	-1
Please pay attention to the one to three star ratings . This dust collection bag only captures 50 % or less of the dust coming off the Bosch table saw . It 's not really worth the money . The table saw just does n't build up enough air pressure to force much of the dust into the bag.A much better , although more expensive , solution is a shop vacuum connected toThe Dust Deputy ( $ 89.99 ) and aniVac Automated Vacuum Switch ( $ 48.95 ) ( both sold on Amazon ) .The Dust Deputycaptures about 99 % of the stuff that normally goes into the vacuum which saves on filters or frequent messy emptying , and theiVac Automated Vacuum Switchlets you simply turn on the saw so that the vacuum turns on and off automatically . Great combination and a much cleaner work shop .	-1
This bagger is worthless uless you want a lot of dust and debree in your workshop ( and lungs ) -- it collects almost nothing . Hook a ShopVac to the exhaust of your table saw .	-1
There is usually more saw dust on the floor under the saw than in the bag . It could be the saw design but it the bag probably does not vent the air fast enough to let the saw dust enter the bag . With the standard and dado throat plates , a lot of saw dust is thrown back up and out the top of the saw . A zero clearance plate may help but I doubt it . A lot of dust accumulates on the front of the saw too . Will probably discontinue the use and get a second shop vac to pull the saw dust out of the saw .	-1
I can run my table saw all day and not fill up this bag one-eighth of the way . So why does it hang all the way to the ground where it gets stepped on , tangled in cords , and possibly even wet if there was rain the night before ? It should have been half the size and cheaper . The spring clamp used to hold it on to the saw work okay but the way it 's designed makes it so that you actually have to work to put the thing on the saw well enough that it does n't fall off . It should have been simpler to get that right - maybe a flaw of the saw as much as the bag clamp . Lastly , if you use the zipper to empty this bag then be prepared to get covered in dust . I think the size of the bag has something to do with this since the bag on my miter saw , which is much smaller , does n't have this problem .	-1
While a great concept , this dust collection bag proved of little worth to my dust collection efforts . I found that hooking my shop vac up to the dust ejection port on the back of my Bosch table saw is infinitely better than this bag , which only collected about 50-60 % of the sawdust	-1
Would get the same results if I tied on an old sock to the dust chute.Quickly clogs and becomes ineffective . Use a Vac or dust collector instead .	-1
flimsy is the only way to describe this . flexes way too much especially when making non-standard cuts like trimming tenons . would have been nice if it attached to saw the way the stock insert does ( spring clip ) which would make blade changes much easier . very disappointed .	-1
For pieces under 8 '' , if you 're pressing down on the workpiece , the zero-clearance insert has some give to it . It 's just not sturdy enough to hold the piece up . For large pieces that are continuously also supported by the table , this is fine , but for small things , well , I 've moved to using a table saw sled . At some point , I 'll cut new zero clearance inserts out of hardwood ; this is one of those things that 's best done yourself , but if you do n't have a thickness planer , this is certainly something to buy.Updating my review : this is a piece of crap . Make one yourself out of wood using the original as a template . I just wasted an hour of making a cutting board ; the last pieces were a 2 '' wide rip , and the lack of support on the bottom caused the pieces to vibrate and be very miscut . * ! @ $ ! $ ! .	-1
As stated in a few other reviews , a waste of money . Plastic is flexible and does not provide support for small pieces . Make you own from 1/4 '' plywood .	-1
Ok this insert is beyond flimsy . It is extremely thin and does not stay flat . It flex 's so badly that any small cut will cause the blade to bind and chop the edge of the insert , thus defeating the whole purpose of a ZERO clearance insert . Worse then any of that is if you are cutting a thin strip from the work piece while using a push stick the work piece can actually tilt to the side as it passes the blade causing serious kickback and jamming . To find a GOOD insert do a google search on `` Bosch Zero Clearance Insert '' and order one made from UHMW Polyethylene . They cost about $ 15 but last forever and are as thick as the metal insert that comes with the saw . The other option is to make your own from plywood , but be aware 1/4 inch ply is too thick for the plate . I used 1/4 baltic birch and ran it thru my planner to get an exact fit , then I had to rout the edges in a few places to get and exact ht on the edge . I did use the leveling screws out of the cheap plastic Bosch insert to level my plywood version . I hope this helps and if you do use this insert BE VERY CAREFUL !	-1
I bought this to cut small pieces of wood precisely . The deflection was a problem . The normal insert has some as well ( but less ) which complicates the squaring of the blade process . I had the trouble of the normal insert marking my wood with its red paint , so I thought this might be better . It 's much flimsier and comes with mounting screws to keep it in place . ( It does n't pop in and out like the factory insert ) . I have a crap blade I use to cut normal wood and a nice Freud blade for my more delicate work . So the idea of having to add the extra steps to remove the plate ( and find a philips head driver ) to replace the blade just does n't make sense .	-1
Way too flexible . For cuts requiring downward pressure such as edge grooving rails and stiles , the plate deformation is unacceptable . Better off making your own zero clearance insert if you can .	-1
Though it is good that this product is plastic because it allows you to create the sloted hole you need for your table saw or dado , the product does not have a locking clip and will not sit well or stay in your table saw track . It does not have adjustible screws either to fine tune the height within your table saw slot . Over all , I think this was a piece of crap . You may consider just making your own out of spare hard wood or plywood .	-1
This thing is a toy . It has no place on a saw as well designed as the TS 4000.Pros- It is red.Cons-It is about as rigid as a blade of grass.It is molded from material that is about as thin as a blade of grass.It is impossible to make it level with your table because it flexes every time a board touches it.Every time my saw starts , it catches a tiny sliver of the insert edge.Bottom line- The best use for this thing might be as a template to make your own out of ply . Love my 4000 . But , this insert is a waste .	-1
It is a mystery to me , how Bosch can make such a fine table saw such as the 4100 and then come up with a POC like this insert . It is a flimsy thin piece that melts when you try to raise the blade to cut the kerf . It throws little melted chunks of red plastic all over the shop . If you try to use it as advertised it cracks . Save your money and buy the PW948 insert here on Amazon and sold by Peachtree for $ 16.99 .	-1
I looked at this and decided not to use it . I 've kept it as a pattern and made my own out of 3/8 ply.Anyway , dado blades are set to different widths , you need different inserts for each width , and this is just one width , too wide for many uses .	-1
After struggling somewhat with fitting it and the dado blade to the drive , I decided it would be better to use it as a good template for my own homemade Insert .	-1
This does not fit my Bosch 4000-09 very well at all . I have to use a piece of scrap or a rubber mallet to hammer it in to place , and it 's very difficult if not impossible to level due to that . I 'm rather disappointed in this insert . I will probably be making my own out of plywood going forward .	-1
When I was considering purchasing an air cleaner , I looked at the customer reviews on the Delta 850CFM unit , the JDS 750CFM unit , and this Jet 650CFM model . The Jet won , mostly on innovative features ( variable speed , remote control & amp ; electrostatic filter ) . I was however , concerned about the quality of the Jet . First because of one of the Amazon customer reviewers said he received this item Dead On Arrival and second because Jet quality can be quite erratic in my experience . Well , chaulk up another D.O.A . for the boys at Jet and for the same reason as the other guy . The machine 's fan will not rotate at the 2 slower speeds . When you hit high speed , it sounds like a jumbo jet . Not good . I 'm not taking any chances with further quality problems so this is going back PERMANENTLY . I will get the JDS 750je model as that is always said to be a high quality unit .	-1
The first unit I received was in a box that looked like it had been through a war zone . The hardware bag , containing the remote and all other loose parts , was absent . I contacted Jet customer service who did nothing , saying all was well , the unit was just a steel box with a couple of filters pre-installed and that was all I should see . I explained that the owner 's manual ( as well as the product description ) listed a remote , batteries , mounting brackets and bolts , etc . that were absent . The rep said it was Amazon 's problem and I should contact them . I had dreams of actually talking to a human being at Amazon , explaining the issue , etc. , but Amazon 's customer contact firewall is strong and would not allow it . I therefore rolled along through the website options until I reached one that allowed for a replacement . The automated systems have worked very well , But it still would have been nice to talk to a person . The replacement has arrived , all the parts seem to be there , and I hope it works.Please also note that I have received 6 items made by Jet over the past week and three have been returned for ( in this case ) missing items or ( in the other two cases ) gross defects in workmanship rendering the machine unusable . I thought you should know .	-1
When the UPS man delivered my saw , I asked him why the box had been opened . The staples holding the box together were popped , and he had taped the box shut . When I unpacked the saw , I saw that the rear handle that locks the slide was smashed , and the saw was unusable . I have sent for a replacement .	-1
I ordered this replacement bulb on March 22 , 2009 and today 's date is July 27 , 2009 and it burned out 2 days ago ! That 's only 4 months and at $ 21.99 for a replacement bulb it should last allot longer than that ! ! I , too , noticed that it 's a close out item and that no returns will be honored ... ..therefore I think I 'll go to my local Wal Mart and buy another brand bulb and if necessary spend a few dollars more and get another brand bug zapper ... .one that I can trust ! ! I bought the Flowtron one only 1 year ago ... .had to replace the bulb approximately 8 months later ... .what a waste of money ! I gave it two stars because while it did work ... it did a good job . No better job than any other unit , however .	-1
So so so soft , ca n't do the job very well.Ended up having to replace this item with cheap ones that works better .	-1
I bought these for the solo purpose of drilling holes in some 18ga stainless . I know to run the bit slow and use water to keep it cool . I was having difficulties with my normal used hss bits but when I switched to these and expected an improvement I got nothing . I finally finished the job with a chest and shoulder bruised like crazy from pushing so hard . The next week I ordered the Bosch CO18 set instead - what an improvement . I did more holes in less than 1/4 the time . The Bosch actually grabbed in and cut unlike Dewalt . Now I can be bruise free and drill stainless , thanks Bosch . Skip the Dewalt .	-1
I purchased Dewalt because & # 34 ; it 's what contractors use & # 34 ; . I used this mandrel with a few hole saws to install a raised air intake on my truck , and the mandrel screw could n't stand up to drilling through the British & # 34 ; aluminium & # 34 ; body of my Land Rover . I ended up having to go out and buy another brand 's mandrel and hole saw to complete the install . The saw blades themselves held up admirably , and I may end up buying additional Dewalt mandrels just to continue using them . If not for that , I would n't buy them again .	-1
I 'm fairly disappointed with this set . One of the bits bent after using it for less than 15 minutes and the protective sleeves on both magnetic drive guides pretty much broke off or ripped off due to use from rubbing against material . I own a lot of Dewalt tools and accessories and this set let me down . It also seems like their blades have become questionable as well , now that all this stuff is made in China there is no quality control anymore .	-1
I got this thinking it 'll make driving screws easier . I thought that the `` sleeve '' would hold the screw while installing to make driving a breeze . Well , the sleeve part is ok , but the attachment point of the screw head to the main shaft sheared off after just several screw-driving . It happened to both of the pieces . What a piece of garbage . DeWalt should be ashamed to put their name on this product .	-1
This is not what I was expecting or hoping for . There are not actually many different types/sizes of bits here . There are just a few types , with many duplicates . I guess for pros that are likely to break tips frequently ? But totally useless for moderate home use I need . I guess i did n't read carefully enough.More importantly , I had wanted to a nice , compact , durable case for organizing and storing the bits . This case may be durable but it is very hard to use . Every bit storage case I 've had before , you just pull the bits forward out of clips attached to the shell . This one does n't work that way ... you have to remove the black rubber holder from the shell , and then remove the bit from the rubber holder . The picture makes it LOOK like the bits can just be pulled forward our of the case , but they ca n't . ( Or , rather , they can , but you have to wrench them out , and they do n't go back in . ) Two stars instead of one because the bits themselves seem good quality , as I 'd expect from DeWalt . But I feel like I just paid almost $ 20 for 8 bits and a useless case ... not a good deal .	-1
Works perfectly but I saw it at a box store for about half the price . Do n't think Amazon always has the best prices ! I used it to rip some 10ft boards I used for a step that goes from my living room to my dining room . It would have been unwieldly to cut on a table saw .	-1
The product description states that it will fit `` most '' DeWalt cicular saws when it should state that it will fit `` some '' circular saws . Bad enough that DeWalt leaves out the rip fence from its 18v cordless circular saws . Got the short end of the stick twice with my DeWalt saw purchase first from DeWalt and then by Amazon.If you enter the DeWalt DC390 model number for the cordless circular saw Amazon returns this DW3278 which will not work with the DC390 saws . Not listed if you search on Amazon but actually sold and stocked by Amazon is the OEM Replacement Part # 381091-00 rip fence which is the correct one for use with the DeWalt cordless circular saw.Amazon needs to fix their listing but accuracy is not a priority or even a concern for their product management people .	-1
These DeWALT orbital sander pads are wonderful and do a great job when new , but if you do a lot of sanding work they might only last 6 months to a year and then the sandpaper does n't adhere to the pads . After talking with a professional and looking at the loops under a microscope , we are pretty certain that heat tends to break/melt the tiny hooks that hold the felt sandpaper . Under a microscope on a bad pad , the little loops are gone and there is a little bump of plastic where the loop was . If the manufacturer used a heat resistant loop material , the pads would last a lot longer . Knowing this , your best bet is to lower the heat factor by using less pressure especially on wood edges and letting the pad cool more between uses .	-1
I used to buy Dewalt tools thinking they are going to last a long time without any problems . Not true and replacement parts are seriously overpriced . $ 22 for a piece of foam and rubber ? I expected that at the price I paid for the Dewalt Sander that I should not run into any problems . I 've had to replace the Seal twice and now the foam pad twice . I only use it for light woodworking and not that often either . I should have just bought Ryobi at 1/2 the price and would have been money ahead . I really think that with all the problems I 've had with Dewalt tools and Dewalt batteries that somewhere along the way Dewalt decided to cheapen everything , live on their reputation for awhile and somebody pocketed the savings from switching to cheap parts and cheap designs . And by the way , this Pad is Made in China .	-1
These do not cut that well , I used them on 1/4 in bolts and I gave up after breaking 2 blades on 3 bolts . Went back to the 14 tpi multipurpose and did much better	-1
These are the exact quality I have come to expect from dewalt / black and decker . The metal cutting blades struggle to cut threaded rod . Also if you do not want that dewalt yellow on your project do not buy these , the paint comes off .	-1
I saw this product online and thought it would be a great addition to my fiance 's saw . When i got the box it was open and only had packaging material in and thats it ! ! ! I had to re-order the product and pay for another one so i am one set less and like $ 13 bucks in the hole ! ! : (	-1
The DeWalt 4930 wheel slings wires like crazy whereas the Milwaukee wheels only throw one or two as the wires wear down to the point where the wheel must be changed out for another.I use these wheels very aggressively for rust removal , removing thinset mortar from the backs of tiles that must be re-used , and a host of other applications.My best experience is with Milwaukee twisted cable wire wheels or knotted wire wheels.There is no more room in my shop for DeWalt products after having been let down one time too many by DW 's underperforming tools .	-1
This does NOT fit my Dewalt D28402K grinder ; the output shaft is just slightly too short to for the nut that comes with the backing pad to grab onto . . Another reviewer made similar comment and suggested removing a piece from the grinder shaft . That piece does n't come off this grinder easily . Luckily , it fit perfectly on a Central Machinery ( Harbor Freight ) grinder I had , but I had to remove the guard.I own several Dewalt tools , and I expected better from them	-1
Not very useful . the sizes I need are not adaptable.I have a output of 2 & # 34 ; dia . this connection does not fitthe output hose .	-1
I bought this adapter looking for something to hook my Bosch table saw and my Bosch router table to my Shop-Vac . Unfortunately , both tools have outlets the same size as the large end of this adapter , and it wo n't fit . It looks like this adapter is designed to hook a 2.5 '' shop-vac hose to a variety of small tool dust ports . I needed something to hook my large tool ports to my small shop vac . This adapter wo n't do it .	-1
Go check out your big box stores before you buy this off of Amazon , I saw it for just a little over half the price ! I always thought that Amazon had competitive prices , but no longer ! I wo n't be so quick to buy off of Amazon assuming it 's a good price in the future ! The item does work fine .	-1
still waiting to received this item after so long . i only received the router bit set and 16 inch square after so much months of waiting . that rating is for not receiving the item	-1
PLEASE post actual dimensions for these vacuum adapters if you buy one ! ! ! Big end OD is 2.48 '' and ID is 2.28 '' Small end OD is 1.20 '' and ID is 1.03 '' It did n't fit into either side of the connection I was trying to make - attaching my Fein vacuum to a Bosch router table.The adapter is made of hard plastic ( like other vacuum accessories ) - there is no stretch or give to it .	-1
They do not adapt to a single power tool of mine . Hard plastic , inflexible and useless as far as I am concerned .	-1
Bought this to hook my mini vac to my router table . Does not fit the hose without removing the end ; does not fit the vac port of the router table at all .	-1
I received this one last Christmas as a present from my daughter , even though I already owned a Porter-Cable DA250B finish nailer that my wife bought me , based upon my wishes , for my birthday.Even though the two nailers cost about the same on Amazon , I think the Porter-Cable DA250B is around $ 168.00 , after using the Bostitch N62FNK Finish Nailer , off and on , for less than a month on cabinets and oak trim , I bought new packs of nails for my reliable Porter-Cable DA250B , and finished the job using that.The Bostitch nailer would constantly jam after about 15-18 nails , bending nails and leaving dents in the wood that had to be repaired later . It seemed that it had at least 1/4 less driving power than the Porter Cable , which meant that I had to use a hand nail set to seat the nails.Driving larger and longer nails into the cabinet framing was no problem with the Porter Cable , while the Bostitch mostly jammed while trying to do the same thing.Get the Porter Cable model . You 'll save hours of time and frustration , and the nails are readily available at either Home Depot or Lowes .	-1
History : I 've been building all my life and have extensive familiarity with all the tools of the trade.Review : I returned this gun before I ever used it . I only want to teach people about nail angles . I usually love Bostitch . I have their crown stapler with the quick change trigger and their F21PL framing nailer ( see my review . ) They are both awesome . This gun however , uses 28 degree nails , which are only used in Bostitch guns . Therefore , you have to buy more expensive , Bostitch-only nails , which you ca n't get at every store . Very disappointing . Bostitch finally started building other guns with the common nail angles , but you have to carefully make sure when you buy . They 're just behind the times with this one.If you buy a finish nailer , get one with a 30-33 degree angle . They can be bought everywhere , and usually compatible between manufacturing brands . I recommend the Hitachi NT65MA4 finish nailer ( see my review ) .	-1
I purchased this several months ago and have used it quite a bit . I had n't used all the chippers at one time until the other day . When I attempted to use the chipper I had n't used before the hole is not round , its oval , so it does n't fit on the saw . Next , one of the chippers broke . The blade part , which is welded on flew off . I mainly used this with plywood and used my Forrest for other wood . I have to say , there is no comparison between the two in quality and cut . **update**I still agree with my review but about a year ago I read an article praising the CMT Dado . I use them all the time and they work great and much cheaper than these things .	-1
You can get this exact ladder at Home Depot for $ 69 . Save yourself some money ( $ 68 ! ! ! ) and go to your local Home Depot . There are probably 3 with in10 miles of your house !	-1
I bought this ladder at Home Depot for use around the house . I was very surprised how weak the ladder is ... It says 300 pound rated but I did not feel safe putting my 185 pounds on the top step . It is cheaply made and weak . Wish I could give it a `` 0 '' rating . Is China the only place that makes a ladder today ? Nothing in North America ? I have given this ladder to daughter to hold a plant . It works good for that.But this one is only $ 11Metal Two-Tier Plant Stand	-1
I feel I paid too much for this product . It seems very flimsy . I think I could have gotten a much better bang for my buck with a different step stool .	-1
The Werner add-ons were a LOT of work and require you to cut the ladder.I found this other product and installed it on a second ladder . Far easier & this installation does NOT require you to cut your Ladder : globalwholesalersinc Quick Connect Ladder LevelersThe Original Levelok ladder leg leveler and stabilizer enables virtually any fiberglass , aluminum or wood extension ladder to adapt to nearly any indoor or outdoor situation . This ladder leveler is sold as a PAIR , one for each side of your ladder , and will safe your ladder on anything from home stairwells to uneven terrain on job sites . Its unique , patented design can be operated using only your foot . This frees your hands to hold and position the ladder . This ladder leg leveler is precision manufactured from high-strength 6061-T6 structural aluminum ( the same material used to build commercial aircraft ) . With its patented `` Anti-Trip '' automatic safety lock , this leg leveler exceeds every ANSI and OSHA requirement set for ladders up to and including Type 1AA 375 pound duty ratings.The pair of levelers installs on any extension ladder , with a leg width of 2 '' or more , in minutes.Improves ladder stability by increasing the footprint and leveling the stand.Used by Industry Trade Professionals where safety and dependability is a must.Installation does NOT require you to Cut or Mutilate your Ladder , like most other leg levelers.Safe ladder leg retractor only releases when the ladder is free of weight.Want to keep your original aluminum ladder 's feet ? Order model LL-STB-1SL . That pair comes with a longer bolt and extra spacers that will allow you to mount the leg leveler to your aluminum or fiberglass ladder without removing the original feet.I have no relationship to this company .	-1
Not only are these expensive , but they are difficult to install . You have to cut the feet off your ladder , drill holes , cut a rod to length . A lot can go wrong . Drilling a few holes in the rail is scary enough , but having to cut the ladder down seems like a big liability . Not worth the risk or investment .	-1
I tried to get these on my MT-22 ladder , but I could n't get them to fit . I tried soapy water , but still managed to get it only about half way on . If I continued to work on it maybe I could have gotten them to slip all the way on , but I gave up . I ended up wrapping the end of the ladder with a shop towel and duct-taping it into place.I saw that another reviewer here said he cut slits up the side to help them fit better.I 'm sure if I had gotten them on they would have worked well , and they definitely seem durable .	-1
These mitts always slip off my ladder . I had to buy a different brand that work much better . These were a waste of money .	-1
Will not fit my Werner ladder . Delievery took almost a month ... ... by the time it arrived I was finished with the painting job . Does not fit !	-1
Gilmour is the industry standard in hose couplings . These are brand X and are off by about a millimeter so they are n't compatible .	-1
The soft plastic & # 34 ; hex nut & # 34 ; for tightening the female end came off pretty much instantly when I put a wrench to it . One of the two places I wanted to install it would n't allow clearance to tighten it all the way , The threaded part needs to extend farther away from the tightening nut . It drips constantly when pressure is on . I 'll try a different brand .	-1
I 'm now purchasing a solid brass USA version here at amazon to replace one of these from the local big box that no longer sells the all brass . The one I bought last year is way too light to be solid brass . More like plated aluminum . The female side now does n't lock on without having to pull on it . Seems the metal is galling a bit and has a lot of friction compared to solid brass . It 's Dramm brand solid brass from here on out . I use this for a garden whole house filter to quick release so I can go from filtered to non filtered to hose off decks and such .	-1
I would not recommend this item . Overpriced and not dependable . Used this item ( turning off/on ) under 50 times and it stopped working . First the problem was sporadic then it stopped completely , and the warranty had expired . I then purchased a $ 19.99 remote switch from Home Depot , have used it frequently over the past year and no problems . Why spend $ 80 when you can get basically the same item for $ 20 .	-1
It clamps snug to a bench , and does not move , however the working clamp is not impressing me so far . I 've tried clamping several things , from copper pipes clamped lightly to solid steel tool bits clamped with maximum force , and no matter how lightly or tightly I clamp things down , the working piece seems to move around in the direction of the openings . The whole thing is painted a glossy orange , including the clamp jaws , so maybe I need to sand that down . It 's like the jaws need to be knurled or something to give it grip . Perhaps the intent of this small vise is to use it for delicate items , and the smooth surface helps things from being damaged , but so far I 'm using this for tools and other heavy duty things , so I would appreciate some better gripping power.I may edit my review if I decide to sand the jaw faces and they start to grip better , but right now I 'm not terribly impressed .	-1
For me , it does n't work any better than regular vise grips . In fact I prefer using a large pair of vise grips instead of these .	-1
Unlike the previous reviewer I felt that these delivered very little clamping pressure . I own several of the larger Irwin clamps and compared to them this is one very disappointing clamp . I 'll keep the two I 've got for special situations where a little clamping will do , but certainly will not buy any more .	-1
I wanted 2 clamps and saw this listing which contained a picture of a 2 pack , but when it arrived there was only one clamp ( in no packaging ) in the box . Now I see the other listing which has the same pictures but the details say it 's a 2 pack - CONFUSING ! And the real 2 pack is slightly less than double the individual clamp so I 'll end up paying more for the 2 I wanted .	-1
I have never had any issues with Channellock pliers until now.These new Channellock 460 pliers have production changes , They made the jaws wider which is good . But now the jaws do not line up together . In the closed jaw position one jaw end is longer then the other , And the jaws are shifted offset side ways.I have two other pairs of Channellock 460 pliers that I purchased about five years ago , The jaws line up perfect even after being used for years . The jaws have maybe 1/32 '' of side play and they work 100 % . The jaws are about 1/8 '' narrower then these new production 460s , But at least they are aligned when closed.The visual difference is ; The new 460s are flat on both outside surfaces . The good older production ones are flat on the small side , On the longer sloted side the flat side of the jaw is ground inward about 1/8 '' .The new Channellock 460 pliers are junk ! ! even the rivet is not staked as tight , leaving excess slop and side shift.If you care about pliers lining up on the sides and ends of jaws , Do n't buy these . I care about my work and excess marking on surfaces I work with , And my hands getting injured.I contacted Channellock by phone and email with pictures , They do not respond.I purchased one new 460 from Amazon and when received it has these defects , Amazon was very nice and replaced them with another new Channellock 460 . The second Channellock 460 pliers are exactly the same , The jaws do not align on ends or sides.It is too bad to see a tool go backwards in quality .	-1
ok if you are me and look at the picture you would assume the pliers in the picture is what shows up in the box ... WRONG ! they do n't come with the clamp piece to clamp electrical splicing joints .	-1
I do n't like them they ca n't cut greenfield good after snapping it like other dikes I had before in the past also the have a bigger tip making it harder to get into tight spots to make cuts . I would not recommend this product to others . But I will say channel lock dose make good pump pliers that 's for sure .	-1
I 've tried Greenlee , Southwire , GB and Channellock ( I own more than one model ) and have to say these are good but just to small for my hand . I am really fond of the screw cutter option which these do n't have . So needless to say I am not impressed with Channellock wire strippers .	-1
This stuff was n't flexible at room temp - It may be ok , at 90 & # 8457 ; + - but , I would n't bet my life on that .	-1
The model I got does n't light up , nor is it the one pictured . It 's green , yes , but the button is also green , and there are no lights . It still works , so I want to give it a higher rating , but really ... false advertising is n't cool either .	-1
The outer package says rated for 13A , 125V 500watts incandescent lamp load.BUT then I opened it and inside found `` CAUTION - Risk of fire . Not for permanent installation . Use only with a total of 5 Amps maximum Christmas tree or other seasonal lighting products . Do not install or use this product for more than a 90 day period per year . `` That makes it useless for my intended use . And makes me not trust it ! I 'm sorry I bought it .	-1
I 'm giving this item a poor rating because they 're describing it incorrectly and pictures are incorrect . The first bullet point says it has tipover sensor for a tree , this would make it a safety feature . This item definitely does NOT have a safety feature , its just a button on a cheap cord.The image shows the item has a light , but the item I received does not have one.Without the light or safety features this switch does n't serve a purpose to me . My original reason for buying the item was because I could n't see the light-switch in the dark . The item they shipped to me does n't have a light.If you look at the customer images for this item , you 'll see the item i received.I have done some research , and found that this brand ( Ho Wah Gentin ) has stolen the image from thisWoods Extension Cord with On/Off Foot Switchitem .	-1
I bought this based on the positive reviews here . I was let down.1 The stand is junk . If you were to set it up as it looks in the picture , it would fall over ( because the center bar would be lower than the legs ) . Basically , unless you have the sleeve completely lowered , and the legs completely out ( farther than shown in the picture ) , the stand is useless . Using it in any other configuration is meaningless because the center bar is too low ( thus the legs do n't all touch the ground ) .2 Once this unit heats up , the lights droop . Basically , the nut that you use to choose the angle gets hot , and then the light goes with gravity -- - down ( regardless of how tight you crank down on the nut ) . I 've only been using the light for 3 hours , and I 've had to reposition the lights 6 times because they keep sagging -- - and I 'm making it as tight as I can humanly possibly make it . It 's just a downright flawed design.Yes , the lights turn on when you plug it in , but other than that , this thing is complete junk . DO NOT BUY IT .	-1
I bought a 4 pack of these all keyed the same , either on my Amazon account or on my wife 's account.I put locks on two 20 ' shipping containers I own and did n't touch them for about 3 months . When I went to unlock the locks , I discovered they were stuck shut . Rain water had entered the locks and somewhat frozen them with rust . Rust streaks could be seen from the weep holes in the locks . With some coaxing from tools and WD-40 , I got them open.I thoroughly drenched them in WD-40 inside and out and worked the mechanism with the key back and forth , back and forth to exercise the mechanism . I put them back on and now that I open and close the locks more frequently , they stick less , but still do n't operate smoothly . I put the keys into the locks and they wont turn without cussing , jiggling , and sometimes resorting to needle nose vise grips to grab the shackle and coax it along . That 's not easy on a lock designed to minimize your access to that shackle.I 'm an engineer . My impression is that aside from the rusting , the construction is also at fault . the shackle scrapes along the inside of the lock and the friction is what I 'm trying to fight by turning the key . Add just a bit of internal rust and the increase in friction is tough to overcome with the key alone . Not wanting to twist the key off , causes me to reach for tools . Thank goodness , I 'm tool rich.Very disappointed in a brand that used to stand for quality.BTW - some joker shoved a round toothpick into the weep hole on the back of the lock and then broke it off . Jammed one lock to where I had to cut it off with an angle grinder equipped with a cut off disk . I had to cut the lock body off since the disk could n't get at the shackle . Good thing I have the tools , or else it would have meant getting a locksmith or someone with a torch . Incredibly poor design.UPDATE Oct , 26 - I just twisted the key off inside the lock trying to open it . Had to take an angle grinder to the lock body to remove this useless piece of junk.Update Jan , 6 - I twisted off the keys to the other locks . The complete set of 4 I purchased are now in the trash . Master has produced a product so worthless as to be termed junk .	-1
I 've tried every kind of round Master Lock for my eight outdoor storage units . All of them have the identical flawed failure . I live in Minnesota . We get a lot of rain , freezes , thaws , re-freezes . Water accumulates in the bottom of the locks . They can not be turned . I 've tried the de-freeze sprays , but they fail to penetrate solid ice . The only way to unthaw them is to use a propane torch . Definitely NOT for outdoor use . Even now , they are warped from the freezing . Very difficult to open/close . Anyone know of something better out there for outdoor use ?	-1
I live next to a salt water bay , so a very tough environment . These locks are decent , but could n't take the salt spray . The shackles have rusted on the lock by the bay , but are OK so far on the lock outside but sheltered from the bay .	-1
Becomes so hard to lock only after three months of use.I now have to insert the key into it , turn and lock.Disappointed with this Master Lock purchase .	-1
I have used one of these locks for an outside shed for 3 years and only now its starting to stick even after lubricating . However I have had 3 other of this same lock at a beach house . While not exposed to salt water directly they are exposed to salt air . The first lock failed at 5 months ( dials froze and even after adding lubrication would not move ) . The Second lock failed at 6 months ( could not close hasp also tried lubrication ) . The third lock I lubricated every two months and was able to get 11 months before the hasp froze and would not close .	-1
We bought 3 of these locks foroutside gates 5 years ago . One is still working , one failed to lock after a year . The other failed to unlock after 3 years .	-1
The problem I have with this is not the lock itself but how you change the combo . I had one I was changing the combo on and I apparently let the key slip during the change when I tried the lock the combo I thought I had set did not work and there is no recovering from that . I have been using the Sesame lock which came out before this . It 's damn near impossible for that to happen on that lock as you stick a pin in a hole not a key in a keyhole held in place by friction . The key can shift and mess up the process not so with the original . SO I have bought my last Master Lock knock off of the one that works . OH for the critic out there I did not buy them on Amazon but from Lowes .	-1
I 've used Master locks since I was a kid in grade school back in the 60s . The name `` Master Lock '' until today stood for quality , dependability , safety , durability and ruggedness.About 15 years ago , I purchased 5 of the `` set your own combination '' padlocks made by Master for use on gates here at my farm and for tool boxes . These locks have stood the test of time outside in bad weather , dust , Texas heat , and are still giving me great service to this day , which is why I ordered 5 more here on Amazon.My new Master Locks arrived today , 12-7-2011 and I was eager to change the combinations from 0-0-0-0 ( as I have done in the past with my original MADE IN THE USA Master Locks ) to the same combination as my older Master Locks . As I examined the shorter locks ( I got one with the long hasp and four with short hasps ) I noticed the short ones were no longer housed in a bright brass case , but now came in a regular steel case that was spray painted a dull black . When attempting to set the new combinations , two of the short locks and my long hasp lock none of them would allow me to re-set the combination . Two problems ( that I can determine ) why these locks wo n't allow this ... # 1 . The small `` key '' for resetting the combinations that now comes with the lock is so thin now , it is not durable enough to twist inside the access hole to re-trigger the tumbler . The cheap key bends when attempting to turn it 90 degrees . Those darned folks in China , now they are even skimping on this little key ! # 2 . The rotary wheels on the new locks , do NOT click into place on the back of the lock ( like my old Master Locks ) where the numbers are suppose to align-up with a indentation where you dial the numbers . The `` slop '' in the action on these new locks is so bad , it 's probably the reason the tumblers wo n't set when attempting to rotate the key . I spent half and hour trying to set the combination on three of the locks and I gave up . The tolerances are not as good with the Made In China Master Locks as the fit and tolerance as my old reliable MADE IN THE USA Master Locks.This is the first time in my 5 year relationship with Amazon that I am returning a purchase . Up to this time , everything I 've ordered has been acceptable.These new Master Locks are no longer made in the United States ( by craftsmen , like my older Master locks ) and when I inspected the packages this afternoon , I confirmed my suspicions where they came from.After nearly 50 years of being a loyal Master Lock customer , I will probably not ever buy one of these poorly made locks from them again . I 'll be looking for locks made here in the USA.I should have known when they switched from a durable brass housing to a cheaper thin-walled steel case that looks like it was spray-painted with a can of Krylon , that the executives of Master Lock decided `` cheaper is better . '' And indeed , `` cheaper '' also means `` ADIOS Amigos , '' it was nice knowing you Master Lock in earlier years , but not now .	-1
As everyone else already mentioned , and I clearly should have taken note of , this lock is junk . I bent the cheap key trying to set my combination . Apparently , the trick is you have to push it in really hard before turning it . You ca n't just push it in and turn it , you need to use force . Also , this is brass as depicted in the picture . It used to be a brass lock , but now it is just a cheaply painted gold color .	-1
Count me in as another user that could n't open the Master lock ( # 177 , same mechanism as # 175 ) after it had been outside for a little more than 1 year ( bought it on Oct 2008 ) . Yes , I wrote down the combination and it worked several times before . It was used to secure my circuit breaker box which is on the outside wall of my garage ( go figure why the builder do n't put it inside ! ) I only opened it when I had to reset a circuit breaker that was tripped and last time I successfully opened the combo using my written combination is when I had to turn off the breaker to replace my kitchen ceiling light fixtures . I was surprised when I can not open the lock the other day ( to reset a breaker ) using the same combination that I have always been using . Needlessly to say I am not happy with the thought of additional expense and inconvenience of hiring a locksmith to open this malfunction lock ... Then I had an idea to look online for help and found out how easy it is to pick this lock if you happen to have the right tools ( paper clip or a thin piece of metal ) . I tried the paper clip method for about 15 minutes and gave up . Then I found a video clip using a thin piece of metal and bingo ! The lock opened right up after trying for about 10 minutes ... I have never picked a lock before and definitely wo n't try to pick one that is not mine , and you should n't too . This is way too easy even for an amateur like me ! I ca n't believe it ! What 's the point hardened steel and all these security feature to prevent cutting , prying when all you need to open this lock is a paper clip or a thin piece of metal ? This lock 's internal mechanism is the same as the Master Lock Model # 175 and it looked like this simple lock picking method has already been discovered since 2006 . I ca n't think of any good reason why Master ca n't come up with a new design that can resist this type of picking in 3 years ! I definitely wo n't be buying another Master Lock again !	-1
This is a terrible product . Unlike almost every other `` set-your-own '' combination lock out there , you can not just depress the shackle and set your combination . You have to have the `` reset key '' that comes with the lock ( it is the same key for all of them ) . Like I need some tiny key to have to keep track of in my life ! Also , when I tried to set the combination with the key , some mechanism inside broke , and I was never able to set my combination .	-1
Every thing about this Bosch half sheet sander is nice . From the feel to the finish this sander seemed destined to become a great sander ! But after 15- 20 minutes of sanding it seems to lose power . Not good in the middle of a project . Wait a day and it runs fine for 15-20 minutes then back to its energy conserving mode . This machine was made to make dust not sit there and collect dust . It only has less than an hour or so run time since new and I am out warranty . I just purchased the Makita 1/2 sheet sander rather than invest any money in this Bosch .	-1
Had this saw several years but it does n't see much use because it vibrates more than I 'd like and a good Japanese hand saw does a better job on most things . I was just using it with a metal blade to cut some aluminum channel and it pinched for a moment before the pin simply sheared off . That 's quality ?	-1
I guess I am the odd person here . But I found this tool to be the least favorite of my large collection of Bosch tools ( as a remodeling carpenter ) . I suppose like the floor installers if I 'd just got the tool for cutting jambs for flooring I might be pleased but even then I am not happy with the quality of the blades . Fire-tipped blades just are n't as good as either carbide or just a good hand saw ( such as a Japanese pull saw ) . For jamb cutting I prefer my Fein multitool with wood/metal universal blade . Admittedly a very expensive tool and even the little blades are more expensive than the Bosch ... but I can resharpen them and guide the cut much easier than with the Bosch.The clip-on feature for the replacable saw blades makes the saw wobbly and unable to cut a straight line unless across a very small molding . Even then , if it was a really hard wood , the fire/hardened blade grabbed and cut unevenly . A simple miter box and back saw would have been better.. ( but who even has one of those ? ) I have the kit with a nifty clamp on miter ( box ) for the tool and it 's an easy set up . ( that 's maybe worth 3 stars ) but I 'd stick to two ... .for the disappointment and expense.I finally found a job for the tool ... cutting lots of screen molding , the long cord as mentioned is a goody , but I found I could use a small chop saw with a fine plywood blade ... and even with a carbide blade too ... ..to be faster and cleaner .	-1
I was very disappointed to see the blade bcome dull after a relatively light use . Disappointed ? Yes ,	-1
I was surprised to find that , unlike other buffers , the pad oscillates but is not really attached to the motor shaft , so any heavy polishing causes the pad to stop spinning . The motor does not sound good when it runs , it has a cheap Chinese product sound . It starts with a jolt spraying the compound everywhere . Speed control at it 's lowest setting is still much to fast . Crummy pad supplied can not be removed from the backing pad.OK for light polishing but the polishers with slow-start and slower speeds are a better choice .	-1
We 've had this clock for a couple of years . The buttons stick out in the front , and a light accidental bump and your clock will change time zones or modes , and you wo n't wake up in the morning . I would not depend on this clock to wake you up . Also , the projector is on the fritz and needs to be bumped to come on , if it does at all .	-1
I really enjoyed this clock for the couple years I 've had it , but the numbers are fading and I can no longer read them on the ceiling . In Addition , Oregon Scientifics ' customer service is lousy . They wo n't respond to emails on the web site and when I visited their store at Bridgeport Village in Portland Oregon the guy working there was extremely rude . I doubt I will replace it . It 's still working as an atomic clock , but the projector is useless ! Oh , and the alarm buzzer is really obnoxious and gets faster and faster the longer it takes you to get to it to turn it off . If you want to wake up in a frenzy , then this is a clock for you : oO	-1
I owned this clock for several years , despite not really liking it . The projector worked fine , but was n't adjustable at all . But the worst problem with it is setting the alarm ... there 's just nothing intuitive about it . There are no dedicated hour/minute buttons -- and the buttons that are there are poorly labeled . So you 'd better keep the instructions handy.The projector on mine finally died , so I bought the Philips AJ3600 and am so much happier with it . The buttons are infinitely more intuitive , and the projector is adjustable . The Philips also has a 2nd alarm and a radio .	-1
I do n't understand why anyone raves about this . It 's extremely heavy , not very bright , has a large central black spot , casts very uneven light , lights up only a small area . Yes , it focuses and can shine a spot a fair distance , but it wo n't help you walk in the dark or search an entire room quickly . Buy The AMAZING 95 LED Aluminum Flashlight instead ! ! !	-1
maglites need to switch these s***ty bulbs to LED 's i have a Streamlight 66122 Stylus Pro Penlight that no exaggeration is twice as bright and probably a fourth the size which is ridiculous this thing takes two d batteries and the output of light is a complete joke compared to my penlight that takes two aaa batteries ill never buy another flashlight without led 's again they last longer are brighter dont drain batterys as fast and dont get hot like these bulbs do get it together maglite and switch to led 's because eventually people will stop being blinded by a popular brand name and realize your bulbs suck and will move on .	-1
No longer an `` Arrow '' product and no longer in production after a brief run as `` Power Shot Pro '' . Will only accept 9/16 '' X 14MM 'brad nails ' . Will drive one brad every 2 or 3 times , then brad nails jam up sideways . The only staples it will accept are very narrow puny , light duty 1/4 '' to 9/16 '' ( long ) staples..This has to be one of the 10 worst tools in my 60+ years of using various tools . I 'd sell it for $ 2.00 if I could . Have had it too long to return , just started trying to use it . I now have 4 staplers requiring 3 types of staples , two of which ( available staples ) are discontinued..Sadly , this stapler is a domestic ( made in USA ) product that could only be improved by production in China ... ..and then only MAYBE . Save your money , folks !	-1
The concept is good , but the product simply does not hold up to use . Mine broke after about 100 staples . It is tricky to disassemble and always fails again after a handful of staples . This is one of the worst tool purchases I have ever made . My advice is to go with another brand , as Arrow clearly does not mind selling an obviously flawed product . If you have an air compressor , look at pneumatic models .	-1
Mine says Balck and Decker on it and is a piece of crap . If you use in the vertical position , say stapling insulation to a stud wall , the staples fall out . I threw mine in the trash . Get a Makita rechargable power stapler .	-1
PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME AS PROMISED - ITEM SMELLED LIKE OIL - THE OIL SMELL WAS EVEN MORE NOTICEABLE ( A LOT MORE ) WHEN RUNNING - PRODUCT HAD ALMOST NO SUCTION POWER IN ORDER TOO FILTER THE SURROUNDING AIR - THIS THING IS A REAL JOKE ... ! I HAVE OTHER VACMASTER PRODUCTS SUCH AS A WET/DRY VAC 12GAL AND IT WORKS GREAT - AS THE OLD SAYING GOES , BEAUTY IS IN THE EYES OF THE BEHOLDER ... GUESS , IT APPLIES TO THIS ITEM AS WELL ... ! I DID RETURN THE PRODUCT ... !	-1
A brand new Freud 3/8 router bit just exploded on me . RPM approx 20k . Going into 9/16 of Ash . No knots , no nails etc . I called Freud and they asked me to reuturn it for them to see what the matter was . In the meantime , wanting to get on with the job , I purchased another one - thinking that last one must have been a fluke . I used a piece of Alder to get the depth set right , and to test the cut . To my horror it exploded again . Using a Porter Cable 890 plunge router . Bit tightly chucked . I did notice - prior to use of both first and second bits that there were slight notches in the cutting edge . They were very symmetrical so I thought they were part of the design . I do n't see them on the pictures in Amazon though .	-1
I will begin this review by stating that this is my only disapointment with Freud brand Bit 's to date and I would rate it a negitive 1 if it was an option . The first issue is that the over all height is short by a minimum of 1 '' to use with any kind of sled or carriage to safely guide the front and side drawer pieces . Freud warns to collet the bit a minimun of 80 % , and I agree . But with a mere two inchs in length and half of that securred in the collet , there is not much height left to work and adjustments or clearences . The remaing height between the top of the collet and the top of the bit will barely allow the use of 1/2 '' stock . Do n't even think about 3/4 '' material or working with safety jigs such as a sled or a vertical carrage . To use this bit without a sled or a carrage is awkward at best and dangerous just the same.The second issue is that Freud does not include any set-up min / max suggestions.Finally , do not ... .use this with laminated stock such as Baltic Birch or red oak plywood . Any cross grain cutting will ruined the material.I will eat this experience ( time , raw material , purchased price and shipping ) and the bit will forever collect dust unless Freud will accept it back . I will go back to using reliable pocket screw and glue methods for now and seek more dove tail education.Jim Jones , Rochester NY	-1
I was thrilled when these arrived in the mail . The price seemed unbeatable , and they fit securely to all of my standard bits . However , the metal in the hex screws is very soft , and after only 1 use the heads were completely stripped -- making these stop collars completely useless.I was using these in a fine woodworking application . But perhaps if you just wanted to use them as a guide for drilling into drywall , plaster , etc. , then you could secure them less tightly to your bits ( and thus , hopefully , delay stripping the cheap screws ) .	-1
After one tightening of a collar , the Allen wrench included was stripped and the screw was stripped . Really ? That 's the best they can do ?	-1
I got these thinking I 'd use them all the time in my shop . Well , the very first time I went to use one , I found that the supplied hex key did n't even fit into the screw in the drill stop . Seriously , if you 're going to supply a hex key with the product , make sure it is one that fits . After finding one in my own allen wrench set , I tightened the stop down gently . It loosened and slid up the drill bit during use . Note that I had about 15 repeat-depth holes drilled , all inaccurately by this point . When I went to release the stop and go for a piece of tape on the drill bit instead , the hex screw seemed to strip out . The steel is so soft , that the gentle tighten that did n't even keep the stop from moving up the drill bit was enough to completely strip out the hex insert . what a joke . I just wasted several dollars on junk . I ca n't find replacement hex set screws that small in a hardware store .	-1
I like this product , the only thing bad is the rings doesnot hold the bits , may be the screw are not strong enough to hold the bit tightly	-1
I 'll give it 2 stars because the material is solid , however even at 620RPM while cutting through plywood the blades heats the wood and it smokes . The tool itself feels as if it could fly off at any moment . The distance markings are way off too . I 'm returning this tool . Perhaps all such circle cutters are similar .	-1
This tool is not balanced . I do n't know who designed it . It should be identical two cutting tools on the both sides . It 's so dangerous when I operate it . Do n't buy .	-1
I am no wizard when it comes to circular saws but I simply can not keep this blade from kicking . I use a powerful , top quality Porter Cable saw and have aligned the base plate parallel to the blade to within .001 & quot ; . I have verified that the blade is perfectly flat and that each of the massive , beautifully polished carbide teeth are razor sharp and properly positioned and have even measured the total run out of the blade as installed on my saws arbor to be within .001 & quot ; . I always use firmly clamped straightedge guides - a Tru-Grip for rips , and a c-clamped triangle for crosscuts . I try to keep the stock well supported and am very conscientious about supporting the waste and ensuring that the kerf does not close in or strain apart . I maintain a steady and appropriate feed rate yet roughly 30 % of my cuts end up kicking . The blade binds somehow in the kerf and tears the wood to pieces in a violent explosion of red Teflon coated splinters . It occurs mostly when cross-cutting but also somehow with rips and plywood trimming ! I do n't know how this is all possible and for quite some time I refused to believe that the blade could be the culprit , focusing instead on the saw , the material , and most intensely , my technique . But time and time again , when I mount my old ... Irwin Marathon 40T blade , I get perfect cuts every time with no exceptions whatsoever . I hope that someone else will add their experiences with this blade because it is a major source of confusion for me .	-1
Nice exterior build.This device depends on a slightly bent interior rod eventually finding a hole to `` snap '' into . I got a lemon ... .. the rod is straight ... every time I try to use the punch , the interior rod slips effortlessly into the hole ... hence NO SNAP ! The snap is what imparts the punch impulse to the device ... .. It works perhaps 1 time out of 20 . Useless ! Too much pain to return . Whatever happened to quality control ?	-1
Mine stopped working after a short while . Then I bought a Starrett . MUCH better . But , the general has a pocket clip , which is nice.And a warning : if you open an automatic punch to see why it 's not working , WEAR EYE PROTECTION . The spring narrowly missed my eye .	-1
This light duty center punch is a little bit TO light duty : the hardened tip broke off inside the unit and dropped out onto the floor after only about thirty punches ( into plastic ) . Not a very long service life ...	-1
I used it twice . The second time was to show a friend how cool an automatic centre punch is ... and the tip broke right off ... he laughed at me ! ! ! Do n't bother with this one - move on ! Returned for refund .	-1
I usually write favorable reviews for the products that I purchase from Amazon . But , this time , I must warn prospective buyers about the Generall Tools 87 Pocket Automatic Center Punch . I bought two and used at least one of them . That one , after just a few punched dimples broke near the point and fell off . Frankly , it scares me when I think of buying anything bearing the General Tools brand.May I suggest an alternative ? Buy an Empire Level Automatic Center Punch 2720 from Amazon . I have had one and used it for nine years . Not only has it been durable , but , with a ball-shaped upper end , it is MUCH more comfortable to the hand . Compare that with the potentially painful top end of the General Tools 87 . And the Empire Level Automatic Center Punch 2720 costs significantly less.True , the General Tools 87 has a very narrow point , which is sometimes needed . If that is what you sometimes require , buy an ice pick . I did.Buyer Beware . Forewarned is Foreamed .	-1
I should have known better than to order one of the cheapest center punches that I could find . After I took the punch out of the package , I did a test punch , just to insure that it worked without any problems . For the initial punch it did work , albeit a light punch . It was not until a week or so later that I went to use the punch again , and this time it did nothing , no matter how I adjusted it or how hard I depressed the punch.Do yourself a favor , purchase the Starret automatic center punch that Amazon has listed . It will provide you with a lifetime of trouble free service .	-1
This tool is a classic case of Junk made in China . The thing was worthless ; The `` automatic '' mechanism would not work . I sent it back and got a refund .	-1
This rule is nowhere near the quality of the Starrett rule I recently purchased from Amazon . The only reason I bought it was to obtain a rule with the sliding Tee , not made by Starrett , so I could easily compare similar measurements . The slide does not fit well and as a result , I can not obtain reliable comparisons . The Tee slides or wiggles around , not remaining square to the rule . It 's a poor product and not worth the time or effort to return it to Amazon .	-1
The magnetization I got from mine is weak ... .very weak . It will do little to help keep a screw on the bit I tried to magnetize . Pathetic.And you ca n't tell from the photo , but it 's only about an inch square . Keep looking .	-1
Guess I should have know but the hole diameter is maybe 1/4 inch . It did n't say anywhere in the description about the hole diameter . If I had know this I would never have bought it . I wanted 3/4 inch minimum for the hole.It only does a VERY light magnetization . Again a disappointment to me . I just use the halves to hold up some paper stuff on my toolboxes .	-1
Instructions state that product can be used to magnetize wrenches . Hole through which item passes for magnetizing is just about the size of a pencil . This product does n't have many uses . I tried to magnetize some screwdrivers and the result was pretty poor . None of the screwdrivers had enough magnetization to change the nature in a real positive way .	-1
Not sure what they were thinking , but this magnetizer is pretty useless . An ordinary screwdriver does not fit , only the smallest , thinnest ones . So I do n't know what else you 'd use it for . I threw it at a raccoon who was trying to steal my sandwich ; it was good for that .	-1
The roll is WAY too large for anything other than long pattern Snap-on wrenches or similar . I have no idea what they were thinking when they designed this monstrosity as the designer surely did not experiment with actually putting standard wrenches in it . The pockets are just too deep to be of any use . It is really close to worthless because it just takes up too much space and the wrenches get lost in the overly large pockets . Also , it is not cotton duck and it is made in China . I found other rolls by Tool Pak and they are 100 percent better .	-1
The base of the drill stand too small . When the power drill is fix to the drill stand , the two pole too near .	-1
made of plastic and not accurate at all.the head is floppy so no way to get it right . might was well just freehand .	-1
It is not steady for any work . I returned it the next day where I bought it from . You need to have a drill with 1/2 & quot ; chuck but you can use only the drill bit upto 3/8 & quot ; . If you have a drill driver that accepts upto 3/8 & quot ; bit you need to buy an adapter . If you want to use 1/2 & quot ; drill bit you need to buy optional adapter again . This is ridiculous . The base is not steady enough for most work . It is n't built that bad . It looks nice but what is the use ?	-1
Ca n't argue with the quality construction , but not very practical once you load it with tools . A slightly smaller profile that was meant to hold half as many tools would be handier . And offering in two colors would allow you to grab the roll you needed . And frankly I 'm not fond of the buckles either . For tool rolls as with tools -- simpler is better . I wish I had n't bought it .	-1
In my hasty Christmas shopping I did n't read the description well enough and assumed that this bag had cables and tools included similar to other items on amazon for a similar price . The photos are completely misleading . Just be aware and Amazon . Please make it more clear that this is just the bag and does n't include tools .	-1
It is smaller than I imagined , looking at the pic , comparing size to the size of the cable clamp . The zipper opens it up all the way like a clam shell . It would be better if only the top opened making it easier to put the cables in and out . The center divider is attached only at the bottom and has a mesh zippered pocket , and several small pockets well suited for screwdrivers , which I do n't need to keep with my jumper cables . Just like the extension cord bag , the handles are thin and floppy compared to the bag.Update 8/7/12.This is now made with a single handle zipper which means you HAVE to open it up all the way . The older one came with two zipper handels so you could zip both open slightly to slide out and in the cables . This minor change to save , what $ 0.05 , makes a big difference .	-1
I love how this is saving my hand a LOT of pain , but it slips & slides on the handle .	-1
I just paid under $ 4 for an identical bucket from Home Depot . Now , if the BB version had a molded durable and comfortable handle , it might be worth The $ 10 .	-1
I bought this and the BucketBoss Extreme Gear 01064 Fatback Bucket Organizer . The bucket is fine , but it does n't fit the organizer ! How strange , since this is a `` Bucket Boss '' brand bucket.Richard McGrath [ ... ]	-1
The machine was very well packed and easy to assemble right out of the box . It lacks a spindle lock . The chuck was a little out of round . When you chuck a bit and turn it on , the bit runs fairly true with the quill fully retracted , but when extended about half way or more it begins to wobble . When fully extended I measured a full 1/16 '' of wobble in all directions . You can turn it off and extend the quill and move it that same amount by hand . The spindle and quill must have some pretty sloppy tolerances . I will be returning this press .	-1
I purchased this hammer-drill from Home Depot about three years ago for about $ 140 . I used it sparely to hammer drill 5/8 '' diameter x 3 '' deep holes in concrete slab . During the past three years , I hammer drilled approximately 8 holes . Today , while hammer drilling the 4th of 7 holes , the drill began to emit smoke . Then the drill gradually quite altogether . This is quite unexpected of a Milwaukee Heavy Duty hammer drill . Has the quality of Milwaukee tool declined to the point where its hammer-drill ca n't even drill a hole as it is supposed to do ? Not wanting to repeat history , I decided to swith brand.I decided not to go with Dewalt as I heard it 's another brand of Black of Decker whose lousy tools are a complete waste of money if you used your power tool on a daily basis or on tough jobs . I learnt it at the school of hardknocks . Porter-Cable , a legacy brand , is over priced and has suffered quality decline in recent years . It 's probably no better than a DeWalt . While I 've never purchased a Makita tool but used one on several rare occasion , I came away not too impressed with its toughness . I decided on a Bosch HD19-2.To finish the job I purchased a Bosch from Lowe 's with a 2 year extended warranty -- just in case history repeats . The Bosch appears to be better-built than the Milwaukee but looks can be deceiving . During hammer drilling , my senses tell me the Bosch operated cooler than the Milwaukee . It hammer drilled the remaining holes as I had hoped the Milwaukee should . I 'll keep readers updated .	-1
Do not buy because of needed in an emergency the wall thickness of the sockets is too narrow and will crack rendering the socket useless	-1
This was really crappy , the case wo n't stay closed , the sockets were rough.I guess it worked technically but it was not a great experience.I ended up donating to goodwill .	-1
I would n't buy this set again , but for $ 10 it is great if you are missing a few of sockets or need a cheap ratchet or need an extension piece . The quality really is n't anything good but they get the job done for small around the house projects.Pros-Low price-Handy caseCons-Not the best quality	-1
I know this is only 10 bucks and I was certainly expecting cheap and cheerful . But this beats all standards of a poorly made product . The blow molded case is a disaster - nothing fits in its place . The ratchet is the cheapest I have ever seen and the sockets themselves are very poorly finished . Comes with duplicate sockets - one each for quarter inch and 3/8 inch I believe . A simple 3/8 to 1/4 adapter would have sufficed , but that 's an entirely separate design issue . I would never buy this again , even for the low price .	-1
This would only be suitable for keeping in your junk drawer for the smallest repairs . Poor chrome/poor design/crappy case ... it 's what you would expect from a cheap Chinese made product . Spend the extra money and get a better brand of tool .	-1
When I received my item I discovered that the ratchet mechanism did not work . It was locked in both directions and thus useless for what I needed it for . Additionally the case , both inside and out , seemed dirty and low quality . It seems to be hit or miss but I would recommend going with a better quality set .	-1
I bought these in the hope the tools might be useful in spite of their very low price of about $ 12 . However , the cheap quality and poor finish make them nearly useless for the most basic things around the house or shop or car.I did n't even bother to return them . Do n't waste your money on this socket set .	-1
Well our friends in CHINA have turned out another CHEAP CHEAP product ! Sockets fall off the ratchet and extension with the slighest movement . Socket walls are so thin I am sure they would split with the lighest load ! Bought this to carry around in the trunk of my car ... I should have known better ! Avoid this one ! Amazon refunded my money right away and did not want the set returned .	-1
The only good thing about this is that the case holds things just well enough if you close it quickly and hold it tightly , it makes it feasible toss the whole thing in the trash at once . The sockets are 'not quite right ' in size . Pretty close and mostly usable but not quite right . Then there 's the ratchet ... which does n't ratchet . Might get one turn out of it before it locks up . If the sockets attached to it or the extension properly , it would still almost be usable . But they do n't . I am a firm believer in you get what you pay for but this is something that would get rare use to assemble things like furniture and a ratchet is n't exactly a high-tech device . Honestly , I was expecting more low quality as opposed to no quality . I ca n't recommend enough that this be avoided even if you have the very minimal use case in mind for this and thinking that it & # 34 ; ca n't be that bad & # 34 ; , I assure you that it can .	-1
I was given this set by a friend as payment for a favor . The yellow handle broke off of the driver the first time I used it . I tried the sockets and two of them cracked while I was using them on my car . The ratchet is flimsy , poorly finished and has sharp edges on it . Do n't waste your money on this set . Spend a few more dollars and buy a Craftsman set . You will get better tools and help an American keep working since C-man sockets and ratchets are still made in the USA .	-1
This image shows that the tools are big and could be put to use . The real tools are small , the largest could not even open the wheels of my bike . Beware , right now i do n't know what to use it for	-1
I initially bought this saw because it 's advertised as being able to cut dowels or plugs flush with a surrounding surface . I tried this a few times , and was fairly disappointed - it cut easily enough , but scratched the surrounding surface badly ! After more research , I learned that a true flush-cut saw does not have any `` set '' on the teeth ( i.e . the teeth are n't bent out from the saw plate . Some set is important to prevent the saw plate from binding in deeper cuts , but it means that the teeth will scratch the surrounding surface if it 's used as a flush cut saw ) .I eventually bought a true flush cut saw from a popular Canadian woodworking/gardening retailer , and was amazed at how much difference that made . The teeth are truly flush with the saw plate , which means they wo n't scratch your workpiece when you flush cut a dowel or plug.Not so on this Shark saw - the teeth do have set and will scratch your workpiece if used for flush cutting . Some significant time spent with a sharpening stone could theoretically remove this set , but the impulse-hardened teeth would make this more difficult , and it would be hard ( for me at least ) to justify that time and trouble when ready-to-use flush cut saws are available for only a few dollars more.Second , this saw is advertised as `` Ideal for dovetails ... '' While it may be strictly FUNCTIONAL for dovetails , it 's far from ideal . The vast majority of saw cuts made when creating a dovetail are effectively rip cuts , which means you 're cutting along or parallel to the grain of the wood . This type of cut is fastest and most efficient when done using a saw with rip style teeth . This Shark saw has teeth shaped for CROSSCUTS ( perpendicular to the wood grain ) , so it 's optimized for slicing through wood fibers in this orientation . It will still make rip cuts , but these cuts will be slower and potentially harder to control than they would be with a rip-specific saw . In other words , you could use this saw for an occasional dovetail , but again , it 's definitely not `` ideal '' .The third descriptor in Amazon 's title is `` detail '' saw . Finally an accurate description of an appropriate use for this saw ! It does a fine job with small crosscuts and general trimming tasks , and leaves a fairly smooth surface . Nicer saws are available for these general small crosscutting tasks , but this is about as good as it gets for the price.In summary : If this had been called a `` Detail/fine crosscut saw '' , I would have given it a much higher rating . However , it 's NOT a flush cutting or dovetail saw , and should n't be advertised as such . If you 're looking for good saws for these specific tasks , look elsewhere .	-1
... . I 'd make my own . The adjustments on this are just too clumsy .	-1
I bought this over a year ago to remove interior door paint . I have tried it a few times , but have not had good results . The price is cheap , but so is the product . I would not recommend this product at any price .	-1
I 've had Milwaukee tools in the past - all great . Tried to defrost a snow thrower that had frozen with impacted snow from a deep snow fal with this model gunl . This gun puts out virtually NO AIR FLOW ! It warms to what seems to be an adequate heat , but you have to put the nozzle almost up to or touching the frozen snow , for it to have any melting effect . You must work along very slowly , inch by inch , to complete the job . Took me 3/4 of an hour to do what should have been done in 5 minutes.Although my hair dryer does n't get as hot , it surely blows far harder than this pathetic & # 34 ; gun. & # 34 ;	-1
If your stock pad has a 1 1/4 & # 34 ; hole in the back this IS N'T the pad for you . Keep looking , this has a solid metal back .	-1
At one time I was a finish carpenter and owned professional grade hinge templates that did all hinges at one setting . Unfortunately , these got damaged and I 'm not in the trade anymore so I bought the earlier model just for an occasional job . The new appears to have the same problems . Many are listed and all are aggravating and reflect on a poorly designed and constructed product . Make your own and stay away from this styrene monster . Mine broke and became useless before I had cut the first hinge.There are plans on the internet but all you need are a five inch wide piece of ply the length of the door , a couple pieces of scrap wood nailed on one side to accommodate the thickness of the door you are using and a 2-3 duplex 5d nails along and a pair of pan head sheet metal screws . I 'm assuming you have a router with a template bushing already . Simply mark out the hinge size , adding 1/8 '' all around and cut it out . The trick is marking it in place . Put the top of the top hinge 7 '' from the top , the bottom of the bottom hinge 11 '' from the bottom and the other centered between . The hard part is cutting them out with a saber saw . The scraps nailed on the back align you left and right for the right door thickness . The duplex nails are pre-drilled and hold the template to the door edge . The pan head screws go in to the ends of the template . when you do the jamb , the screw head holds the cut down from the head so you have clearance . One in both ends of the template for L or R swings . When you route the door , ignore the screw , holding the top of the door flush to the template . The cutout for the template is the tricky part but once done , you will have a template that will do three hinges with one set .	-1
Close up picture of the tool is similar to the style available 5 years ago , except that the nails are loose , not held in their holes . The pictures of the guy using the tool show an entirely different design , so what tool do you actually get ? BEWARE Any review older than 2010 is likely to be worthless if the tool has been re-designed .	-1
Had to return this unit as it did not provide sufficient surface contact with the jobs I was trying to complete .	-1
You get what you pay for . Only one out of 6-9 will fit if you 're lucky and when you only have few minutes to join boards , you 'll wish you had spent the extra cash and bought Lamello .	-1
It 's great when it runs . Not so great when you 're in the middle of a project and it wo n't turn on . I am on my 3rd SWITCH . Very frustrating . Add the cost of 2 extra switches , time to replace and order and shipping , and down time and this is one expensive tool ! The plunging base is also flimsy plastic handled and is not nearly as stout as the main tool . Buy a heavy duty Porter Cable .	-1
I use many routers . This is the worst of its price range . Sometimes it actually runs at top speed , but most of the time the variable speed knob can not decide . Mega electrical tape all around the knob helps . Sometimes it runs smooth , but most of the time it runs rough . Sometimes it is easy to height adjust , but most of the time the tool does not slide in its holder properly . Consider purchasingPorter-Cable 892 2-1/4-Horsepower Router . It is much better all around and remains in a good mood .	-1
The Bosch 1617EVS is an attractive router package ; however , Amazon is unable to deliver on it ! Do n't believe the `` ships in 24 hours '' claim . I 've ordered the item on December 31st and since then I 've been receiving `` delay in shipment '' notices . The one I received today promises me that I will not see the ordered router until the March time frame . Should I wait , they ask ? Unfortunately , along with the router I 've ordered several accessories . All of the accessories have arrived , but not the router . Do I wait ? Do I cancel and return the accessories ? Do I postpone the projects for which I 've scheduled the router based on Amazon 's false delivery date promise ? What would you do ? Go to Home Depot and buy a router that you can feel and touch and take home with you ? I 've been shopping with Amazon for many years and this is the first major let down on their part . Has Amazon outgrown its commitment to its customer base ?	-1
Not sure where to start . I ordered 2 of these in advance of some long cutting I need to do . The legs are not parallel to each other , thereby causing it to be unstable . The rolling top does n't roll very well . I suppose if you added a little grease , it would work better , but why bother . I ran a board across it and the board just dragged across instead of rolling and moved the whole stand since there 's very little friction between the legs and the ground . I can see this easily damaging the board . The knob did n't hold height very well and the whole contraption had so much give I highly doubt it could support very much weight . This is simply a poor product . Do n't order it . Not sure how much clearer I can make that !	-1
In order to get to any of the tools , you have to extend the pliers . Yes , extend . The pliers do not fold over , the way most pocket knives/pliers do . Instead , you flip the unit and the pliers extend . Then you can open the arms of the pliers and then pull open one of the tools . Also , when fully recessed , the tip of the pliers still stick out about 1/2 inch . Awkward in one 's pocket .	-1
First one I bought the `` Tool activated '' switch did not work i.e . the vac came on even when tool ( Dewalt router , table saw or miter saw ) was not on . OK , maybe a bad switch or something I thought.Returned it , next one SAME THING ! Called PC they said `` we can said out a new switch '' so there it remains in my garage unused . Also bags fill up VERY FAST and are $ $ $ . Do n't think about using vac w/o bags because it is a mess to clean out.Ultimately the vac sucks , but not in the good way .	-1
I have owned this tool for years , over 5 years in fact . Although it seems like a good idea , I seldom use it . Almost never in fact . It is all but impossible to carry around , and it is also hard to store . If you put it into a drawer it may get dented , and if you just put it out on the bench it can be harmed as well . How does a person carry this thing around ? Bottom line , you have to find a way to keep this close or it is useless.When measuring anything this tool is OK , but not great . It really measures no better than other measuring tools . If you do not have a special pencil with a .05 lead it is hard to mark through the little notches in the tool.What is excellent about the tool is the fractional markings . You do not have to count little lines , the measurements are marked with the exact number ( Like 15/16th ) . Other than that the thing has little value.AD2	-1
To delicate and not what I needed . I do n't have a saw that would cut accurately enough to justify this type of measuring device .	-1
It may be fine for marking off where tight tolerances are not important , but If you want to use this to mark perpendicular or squaring to an edge , you will be disappointed . I marked a 90 degree line with this on my work piece and then marked another line with my Starrett square . The lines were off by 1/16th inch over 12 inches .	-1
But , it is the one that my builder installed.That one died.You do n't replace the shell without ripping into the ceiling . This makes your only choice to replace the guts.The price and convenience of Amazon is great .	-1
Just one of life 's little annoyances . Lived with this cheap little rattletrap for about 18 years . Replaced with a 1 sone unit that moves 110 cfm , a big relief . This is the fan you buy and install for someone you hate .	-1
This is the $ 10 bathroom fan that housing builders will pass off as acceptable for venting each bathroom in your home . This unit only works in a very small bathroom at best and that is if you are a `` short '' duration shower-er . The noise is pretty high considering the low 50 cfm rating ... although I bet it has much to do with the small 3 '' venting duct . Heck at least you might not forget it running since you can hear it over the TV .	-1
When my house was built , I never even considered selecting ceiling fans . I allowed the contractor to install whatever was included in the home package . If I could go back in time , I would make sure this model was never even an option . It is too loud and takes too much time to clear the moisture in a small bathroom after a shower . It works and I have never had any mold issues but I have to run it about 45 minutes just to clear the condensation off the mirrors . Another half hour so that the room is not `` muggy '' .I thought I would at least warn other potential buyers . I can think of better things to do than spend several hours navigating an attic filled with blown in insulation , searching for the fan , removing it , cutting a larger drywall opening , mounting and rewiring the replacement , routing the duct , and then cleaning up all the insulation that I tracked into the house . It is the task that I have to endure as punishment for not thinking ahead . If you are already planning on having to do that much work , get a better unit so you will have something to show for all your effort.I can understand wanting to find a replacement that is the same size as your existing model but if you are going to replace your fan , do it right the first time . If it is a new installation , then do n't even waste your time with this model . Even if it was rated at twice the CFM , you would n't experience that kind of airflow for long because the openings on the grille are very small and plug up with lint fairly quickly.Just to give you some perspective , a single PC case fan in many computers moves more air than this model and does n't make a racket in the process . Several are typically used to move air through a space normally less than 4 cubic feet . The CFM on this ceiling fan is lower and yet it is responsible for clearing the moisture out of a room that is ~200 cubic feet or larger . This unit would be more suitable for a Honey Bucket.I am typically a sucker for products that are low priced . Who does n't love a great deal ? The price on this model is really low and if you want to look at cost/years of service , then this certainly is an excellent value . If you use the fan daily and care about performance , then do n't cut corners . Your ears and bathroom walls will be much better off . ( I just read some other reviews after mine was posted . Purchasing this item to use for replacement parts is a brilliant idea if you desire a quick repair of an existing unit . After about 10 years of enduring substandard performance , I look forward to retiring this model permanently . )	-1
Bought these for my newMilwaukee 2625-21CT M18 18-Volt Hackzall Cordless One-Handed Reciprocating Saw Kit . The spec DOES say for metal , and once I got the package it read not for metal . You need a diamond saw blade for cutting metal.Luckly the kit did include ONE bi-metal saw blade ; and I was able to do the work I had bought it for .	-1
The package itself shows that this blade is NOT for cast iron or hard tile . I bought this product to cut through a piece of aluminum channel . Took probably 45 minutes , which was far longer than it took at the metal yard . They did it in about 2 seconds . I like my sawzallFactory-Reconditioned Milwaukee 6538-821 15-Amp Super Sawzall Orbital Reciprocating Saw with Casequite a bit and eventually I got through the channel , but I expected way more out of the blades . I do n't find them all that special . Oh , and this might be painfully obvious to most people , but just in case , do NOT use them for wood - they will make a huge mess out of that.I still have two out of three left , so if I find a good use for them that I would recommend , I will post it . By the way , the package says that these cut : FiberglassBlockMasonryPlasterCeramic tileThe two items shown that they specifically are not able to cut are : Hard Tile ( Grade 5 ) Cast IronThe one that is supposed to cut Cast Iron and Hard Tile ( Grade 5 ) is the diamondMilwaukee 48-00-1440 Sawzall Blade 6 '' Diamond GritandMilwaukee 48-00-1450 Sawzall Blade 9 '' Diamond Grit	-1
This is hardly an improvement they fit the flash light but I should have saved the time and money and purchased a 5 dollar led light instead of replacement lamp .	-1
This is an amber colored light with very little difference from the standard bulbs that once were used all the time . Ca n't believe Maglite went through the trouble to get Germans to make this over designed inexpensive setup . The same old simple bulb is available in a LED version even though more expensive . The LED version is a clean , bright white light that is great a substitute and superior to the vacuum filament style incandescent of old . There must be a reason Maglite is NOT making LED replacement bulbs for their once loyal customers .	-1
When I ordered this bulb I expected to recieve whats pictured but when it arrived I received some LED bulb . Now normally I would probably be pleased to get an upgrade for something , but I needed the bulb pictured not an LED bulb . To make matters worse , the LED bulb i got is quite dim and is a complete waste of materials , technology and money . I 've used LED bulbs in Maglights before and was generally pleased with the results , but what I got was a cheap quality product . They should have just told me its no longer available .	-1
I advised amazon that their picture was not representative of the item they are shipping . The Item is a modified replacement with an adaptor you must cram in the flashlight housing , the bulb is a two pin wire and a new retaining screw on collar . They told me & # 34 ; No change is required for the picture associated with this item. & # 34 ; I guess even Amazon has knuckleheads working for them because what you see is not what you get . If you want the original style bulb , then do not order this item .	-1
The vendor did not send the bulb as advertised but rather a little bulb with wires sticking out that had to be installed . I am stuck at home with an injured shoulder that made this very difficult to do . Besides , otherwise I would n't have ordered it and paid shipping . Once I finally got it working it only lasted a week . It was too much trouble and I did n't want to spend any more money on it so I just said forget it . However , I did fill out the Amazon request to rate the vender . To my pleasant surprise Amazon contacted me and refunded my money including the shipping .	-1
This replacement lamp is just ok and not a very good replacement . Bulb which comes with the flashlight is a better option . Go for Led bulb , it is more bright and gives a long life .	-1
Come On ! These are sanding discs - it 's their job to make dust . Why not call them Mirka 23-615-AP Gold 5-Inch 8-Hole DUST-MAKING Hook-and-Loop Sanding Disks ? Boo !	-1
I tried this on two expensive ( new ) sanders with the same result . The backing for it wont stick on the sides nearly as long as other brands . For the price though , it almost makes it worth a good buy but be weary of this.Note : For disks that last longer with velcro , they also cost a lot more even on here which does n't make it a good financial choice .	-1
Our builder installed one of these in our new home 11 years ago . The unit failed after 3-4 years . I replaced it with the same model , for the simple reason that it made installation very easy ( I knew that the supply line would be the right length and the sink hole would be the right diameter ) . The replacement also failed after 3-4 years . This time , I resolved to replace the unit with a better model . Unfortunately , the only model the hardware store had in stock was the HOT-1 , so I broke down and installed another one . That unit has also now failed . Each unit showed the same symptoms -- the unit would start sputtering for a couple of months , then it would start leaking a little , then it would start flooding the cabinet under the sink . For each of the failed units , the seams all around the tank showed mineral buildups , indicating multiple leaks . In a nutshell , the HOT-1 is very simple to install , does its job for about three years , and is easy to replace . If you do n't mind replacing it frequently , it can be an efficient solution , at an average cost of only about $ 40/year . If you want a durable hot water dispenser , definitely install a more expensive ( and presumably more durable ) model , which is what I plan to do this time . The HOT-1 is a cheap , disposable appliance with ( at best ) a three-year life expectancy.UPDATE 27 March 2010 : Sure enough , right on schedule , the HOT-1 that I installed in January 2008 has started to leak . Based on past experience , the leak will become a flood over the next couple of months . That 's it . I do n't care how easy this unit is to install . It 's crazy to have to replace the HOT-1 every three years . Time for a serious upgrade .	-1
This is my second HOT-1 . They just do not last - each less than a year . I am not going to make the same mistake again .	-1
I bought this for my dads leatherman . It was to small . You have to really look at the demensions when buying . Not all leathermen are the same size .	-1
The mandrel used for this wheel has only a screw to hold the wheel to the mandrel . Consequently it tears away as soon as you touch the item you are cutting . I had a masonry nail in a chimney wall where a picture once hung . I thought the easiest way to deal with the nail was to cut it off with a cutting wheel . I touched it as gently as I could and the wheel went flying . Useless !	-1
I HAD TO SEND THESE BACK AS I ORDERED THEM AND THEY DID NOT FIT THE MACHINE I THOUGHT THEY WOULD I DONT KNOW HOW THEY WORK	-1
If you 're cutting metal , you 'll have to pony up for the metal discs which are CRAZY overpriced and STILL do n't last . Someone 's got to invent a lasting disc that guys who need hi RPM precision cutting ( not angle grinders ) require in our jobs . I 've spent years looking for the perfect disc , these are just about the worst . They 're great for tiny little jobs like if you want to cut a toothpick in half . That 's bout it .	-1
I 'm sure I just do n't know how to use these or I 'm missing something vital to it holding up . I tightened the screw on a couple of them and they crumbled . When I figured out how to keep that from happening they flew appart when I started to cut a pieice of thin steel . My dremal multi saw does the trick . I bought some other thicker blades and they did okay .	-1
Uh huh , I know they are supposed to be used gingerly- only at the edge ... But when cutting at dremel RPM 's - on any but the lightest materials , these fail.I mean , come on.. Who is cutting things with a dremel , in which you dont apply some sort of pressure ? ( Which usually sends the disk into several fragments ) My dremel came with a pack of these and I spent more time screwing these things on the holder than actual use . Which sucks.Unless you are making tissue paper models or cutting whipped butter , get the reinforced disks , or the full fiber disks . In cost / time comparison with ANY other cutting disk , These are useless . Even the super cheap `` off-brand '' diamond wheels cost less , cut more .	-1
20 of the wheels ? took 19 to cut a single bolt head , off they break instantly even if they are looked at wrong .	-1
Anyone with a set of Dremel bits probably got a little tiny cup of this stuff with it . It 's good that they include it in buffing sets , but as a separate refill these are insane . When I ran out of the included cup about 15 years ago , I went to my nearest home improvement store and got a tube of it which was about 6 times larger for the same price . I still have it .	-1
The people reviewing these wheels with 5 stars must be taking great care of them as one only lasts me about 20 minutes . Admittedly , mine is field use and there 's a high likelihood the die grinder will get knocked around , in which case the wheel will break quicker than you can blink . Compared to a 5 '' cutoff wheel in an angle grinder , this product is junk . Lasting 20 minutes instead of 2 is an improvement , but not by much .	-1
I HAD TO SEND THESE BACK FOR CREDIT A THEY WERE NOT FOR THE MACHINE I THOUGHT THEY WERE SO I GOT CREDIT FOR THESE	-1
I got this to use as a GP bit , as it is sold , and have tried it on wood and plastic . In both instances it did not cut very well when trying to move through the materials , vibrated excessively , and jumped around quite a bit . I would not buy another until I figured out if this one was broke or I was using it improperly , and it could be operator error as of now . I would say to buy with caution , do n't have to high of expectations . Also , for the price its almost not worth it to send it back to Amazon . Would not buy as gift .	-1
I used this bit in my basement remodel to cut a hole in my air ducts to add more lines . The bit broke after cutting two holes .	-1
I needed to trim a broken floor tile with a curved cut on it . Upon receiving this item for my dremel , it pretty clearly said ( NOT FOR FLOOR TILES ) . Awesome . Wish I knew that before I ordered it . I used it anyhow on the ceramic floor tile ; Not surprisingly , It did n't cut .	-1
I was looking for a easy way to enlarge strike plates on existing doors that I am installing new hardware on . Some of the doors have settled and the knobs do n't latch properly . I have to enlarge the holes to receive the knob throw . This was suppose to be the ticket . It is n't . Do n't waste your time buying it . I have had some good luck with a metal & # 34 ; burr & # 34 ; in a drill .	-1
Whatever these are , they are NOT Dremel 9901s . They mic out at 3/32 '' at the cutting head , whereas 9901s are 1/8 '' from shaft to head . Additionally , 1 of the 3 I ordered has burn marks on the metal , indicating it may have lost its temper . Finally , they do not arrive in Dremel packaging . They come in a plastic baggie with a sticky label on it.If you are surface scrolling , these might work fine for you . If you are slotting , you will NOT achieve the size slot you need with these !	-1
Having read the other reviews here , I am very leery about this particular product -- and vendor . It if comes sealed in a Dremel package , fine , but if not , this is bootleg and of bootleg quality .	-1
I got this bit to cut/route some simple shapes for a bracket from a piece of 18 gauge sheet metal . It says it will cut through hardened steel etc . but it is not good for that at all . It will only be effective with very thin or soft metals . If it has such a difficult time with plain sheet metal I ca n't see how it could work at all for hardened steel . It will NOT work with a drill press as one reviewer suggests as it has no point and is not made to plunge . It needs to cut from an edge or through a drilled hole . Also it is a 1/8 shank so it did not fit my new trio model though I expect there may be an adapter available my local store did not carry one . It would probably be OK cutting through thin or soft metal . In comparison an EZ 406 cutoff wheel was not great but several times better at cutting the same metal than this bit . I am actually changing the material to some .063 inch 6061 aluminum to see if either of my dremel tools will cut well enough with the softer metal . So just do n't expect this to cut through any hard or thick metal , it is for light duty only .	-1
I hate this thing . It 's over priced and flimsy at best during use . Avoid it . I have found the cheaper Chinese diamond engraving bits to be 10 times better .	-1
I purchased 3 Dremel tools last year , and ordered extra brushes so that I would be able to change brushes and continue to work.The brushes are still in the package , since none of the tools lasted long enough to change the brushes .	-1
This product did not work for me . I obviously did not get a good fit , or the product was n't what I thought it was .	-1
After 6 hours of work and 20 sheets of wet/dry sandpaper I am still trying to get the sole flat n smooth . The initial grindingis so rough u could use it as a rasp . It may be a fine tool ( I havent used it yet ) but it takes a lot of hand lapping to get it ready	-1
You 'd be far better off buying an old plane off of eBay . The old toolmakers would n't know what to make of this pathetic imitation of the true quality that was their standard .	-1
Save your money on the plane tune up books and buy a decent tool . This piece of garbage is not worthy of the stanley name . They used to make fine tools ( pre WWII ) , but now sell unusably poor scrap that is a disgrace to their heritage . The castings are hopeless , and the blades are worse . No amount of filing or sanding will eliminate the chatter marks because the blades are too thin . The blade alloy will not hold an edge and chips with the slightest use . The plastic knob and tote are deplorable . The blade adjuster has more slop than a hog farm . Lie-Nielsen makes the finest planes on the market , and if you want a satisfactory plane , you 'll buy one there .	-1
I hate it for many reasons . Basically , it 's a sorry excuse for a plane . And you do n't have to be a & # 34 ; tool snob & # 34 ; ( a term some of the other reviewers used ) to see that.I did n't buy mine ; my wife brought one home from a yard sale , to my considerable consternation ( let 's just say she wo n't make that mistake again ) . The plastic handle ( which the description euphemistically calls & # 34 ; polymer & # 34 ; ) was cracked and the wife got the thing for $ 2 , which I thought was still too much . A little test on our glass coffee table showed that the sole was n't flat ( and still is n't , since I do n't see the point in bothering to lap the sole of a worthless plane ) . The iron and frog are flimsy affairs , if you ask me . The weight was pathetic . My guess is that these are churned out in China along with a lot of other cheap tools.For a little more , you can buy an antique Stanley plane with a rosewood handle and genuine quality . NEVER buy cheap tools , you always regret doing so because they underperform and/or and you end up having to replace them .	-1
I bought this because it was cheap , has good reviews , and seemed like a quick and easy way to maintain the edge on my knives . Boy was I wrong . This makes a dull blade a bit sharper , but it is nowhere near what a good Japanese wet stone will accomplish . It 's also not nearly as good as the scary sharp method of sharpening knives , which I find produces razor sharp edges . What this WILL do is give a blade micro-serrated edges that HELPS to cut through things . But , it will not create edges that will slice through things . What I mean by this is you will need to handle the blade in a sawing motion to accomplish a cutting task . Whereas , a really sharp blade will slice through something without the need to saw . That , to me , is the true litmus test of a sharp blade . And this sharpener will not accomplish this .	-1
I 've been using the EdgeCraft 480Chef 's Choice EdgeCraft Diamond Hone Manual Pocket Knife Sharpener - 480 480for a number of years . I decided to give the AccuSharp a try after seeing the review on Cook 's Country.The AccuSharp is more aggressive for restoring a dull blade . But if you stay on top of your knives , the EdgeCraft will maintain a sharper edge . Just a couple of quick and light swipes is all that 's needed to start slicing tomatoes.The AccuSharp seems to tear the steel as it removes metal . That leaves micro serrations which tear as they slice , similar to a saw . The AccuSharp is useful for serrated blades.Both products are made in the USA.Having said all that . Using a stone , I get a knife sharp enough to shave with . Neither of these products can do that . If you 're really serious about sharp knives , learn to use a stone . It 's not that difficult , nor does it take that long if you maintain your knives properly . I highly recommend this bookThe Razor Edge Book of Sharpening.The Chef 's Choice EdgeCraft 480 is great for touch ups between sharpenings when a steel wo n't do the job .	-1
I ordered this item at the same time that I ordered a J.A . Henckels 8 Piece Stylus Block Set . When I first received this sharpener , It worked well at keeping the knives very sharp . After using it for around four months , honing the knife blades about once a month , I needed to open it up and reverse the carbide inserts because it had stopped sharpening the knives.Within another four months the sharpener was completely useless . It would n't work any longer . So the carbide inserts do need replacement after 30 to 40 times of use , and the carbide inserts that need be replaced are at a cost almost equal to what I had paid for the entire unit the year before.The `` 5 to 10 years of use between blade changes '' on the product page is a complete exaggeration . I , just two weeks ago , paid over $ 7.00 to Amazon ( best price on the web ) for a new set of replaceable blades , after 8 months of light use .	-1
Seems to pit the knives quite a bit . Tried to use it in place of a steel , and it just does n't seem to work all that well . Went back to my electric wheel sharpener .	-1
The Accusharp works by having fixed tungsten carbide blades you draw the knife through . They essentially rip away a layer of metal at a fixed angle . After a few strokes you can visibly see removed metal . The amount of metal removed is a long term concern with repeated use , unless you like to replace your knives on a regular basis . Edge sharpness tests show good fist level sharpness ( ie will bit into your thumbnail ) but poor second level sharpness ( ie will not shave arm hair ) . Closer examination under a microscope shows jagged metal fragments on the edge of the blade and jagged pitting on the edge . This type of pattern essentially turns your blade into a serrated blade where the serrations will quickly break off leading to need for re-sharpening . Sharpening in this fashion will result in greatly reduced edge retention.This product will essentially take a blade that is so dull it has no edge and quickly remove a lot of material producing a very rough edge . It is small and easy to use . Because of its ease of use and ability to put a edge on a knife quickly it has gotten rave reviews.I 'd like to compare the result to theTri-Angle SharpmakerThe Sypderco triangle sharpener is less convenient to use , you have to spend about 30 seconds to set it up . It also takes longer to use ( it will take probably 3 or 4 dozen strokes to restore an edge ) . It 's also more expensive . However , the results are so much better I have to recommend it as the preferable sharpening system . For one thing it removes far less metal so you knives will last much longer . After following the instructions a good blade is noticeably sharper ( good send level sharpness , ie will shave arm hair ) . Even better though is when you stick the blade under a microscope and see a smooth edge with no pitting or jagged metal fragments hanging off . This is the type of edge that holds up much better in use . Sharper knives , longer lifetime of your knife , and better edge retention . It 's worth the extra time.Still , I 'm not throwing away my Accusharp . The triangle sharpmaker is the better sharpener but it takes time if you are putting an edge on a knife that did n't have one instead of restoring an existing edge to full sharpness . So for a knife that has n't been properly sharpened before I start with the accusharp to save time because I 'm lazy and then switch over to the triangle sharpmaker because even though I 'm lazy I care about the result .	-1
Trust me , if you have blades you truly care about ( which is probably why you 're considering buying a sharpener ) you do NOT want to use this cheap sharpener on them . The carbide teeth really 'rip ' the blade more than they do sharpen it , so yes the blade gets sharper but it 's a dirty jagged edge . You 'd be much better off with the Lansky 5-stone system or the Smith 's TRI-HONE . Yes they cost a little more but think about how much you spent on your knives and it 's probably a small investment in comparison . All I can gather is that all the people giving this thing 5 star ratings do n't really know how to sharpen a knife . It does n't take much skill , especially with a setup like the Lanksy . Please , if you care about your blades , do n't buy this !	-1
Use this for a knife that 's cheap and you do n't care about ! Wo n't set an edge that will hold or be worth any thing for using ! Glad I tried it though . Re-affirms my belief all my great knives should be professionally , if not sent back to the factory , for sharpening as needed . All knives need sharpening at some point . I guess oil and a whetstone still work best , for the laymen , in my opinion .	-1
I was a professional chef for years , I still do all the cooking at home , and now I am an amature woodworker as well . This gives me both a lot of experience sharpening knives and other various sharp edged tools , as well as a pretty good idea about what sharp is.What this tool leaves behind is not close to sharp . It does cut and leave a nice angle on the edge of whatever it is you are trying to sharpen which could be sharpened if you were able to maintain that angle or want add a second bevel to it . I do n't mean true it with a steel ; I mean sharpen it . This tool does not.I was looking/hoping for a convenient way to quickly re-sharpen a knife or tool in the field . If there is one , this is not it . What it leaves behind would be suitable for an axe , hatchet , or machete , but not much else.I do most of my sharpening by hand , but if you lack the experience , skills or proper stones to do this , there is only one powered device I would ever let near my kitchen cutlery . If you want really sharp knives , spend the $ 100+ for a Chef 's Choice 120Chef 's Choice 120 Diamond Hone 3-Stage Professional Knife Sharpener , Whiteor 320Chef 's Choice 320 Diamond Hone Knife Sharpener , Whitesharpener and follow the instructions to the letter _OR_ bring your knives to a professional to have them sharpened .	-1
All this so-called `` sharpener '' managed to do was turn decent but worn edges into ragged , gouged crap . Do n't waste your money . Get a real stone sharpening set instead .	-1
I do n't know if it 's the angle that this product creates , or what , but my knives go dull very quickly after using this sharpener.I bought this sharpener based on the reviews here on Amazon . And the first time I used it , I was impressed : a few swipes with the sharpener and my Cutco knives seemed to work great . After a few days , however , it became obvious that the sharpness does not last long . After sharpening a knife with this gadget , it seems good for the next cutting job , but the next day , it feels like a hacksaw and I find myself needing to use the sharpener again and again.I 'm back to using my flat stone . A few swipes on the stone and my knives stay sharp for several , even many , days.If you ca n't use a sharpening stone , this might be better than nothing -- barely .	-1
I cant believe all the good reviews on this . I bought it based on the reviews and dont get it . This thing is junk . Ok , it sharpens slightly better than dull , but thats it . It also leaves a really rough chewed up edge . I tried it on thin kitchen knives , a pocket knife and a hunting knife . Same results , junk !	-1
I bought this to conceal a Cat-5 wire running through a hallway . The product itself works fine - width is just about right for a Cat-5 , HDMI or other similar gauge low voltage wire ( do n't use this for a power cord , VGA , etc ) . The problem is the way it 's built.Firstly , getting the cable through it is very hard . My cable was already run , so i could n't just thread an end through , rather i had to & # 34 ; press & # 34 ; the existing cable through the narrow opening in the wiremold . it was a bit hard to get the wire in . but much harder was snapping the wiremold closed - that took a ton of force and left me with 2 sore thumbs for a day.Honestly , this stuff does n't have to be designed to withstand an earthquake . making it a bit & # 34 ; flimsier & # 34 ; would make installation much easier , and probably save the manufacturer a few bucks also .	-1
I bought this about 2 years ago to detect a leak from my water heater . Well , today I noticed wet carpet outside the closet where the water heater is but no alarm had gone off . I pressed the test button and it went off as expected . I then set the sensor in a pool of water and nothing . I Replaced the battery and tried again . Nothing . So the product does n't do the one thing it 's designed to do . Look elsewhere .	-1
This is a poorly designed product with nonexistant quality control.The design is poor because you have to disassemble it ( 2 screws ) to open the unit up to install/replace the 9v ( not included ) battery . This is simply a pain , there is no reason you should have to take a device apart entirely , there could have easily been a battery door or compartment that is accessible without tools . This also causes trouble with putting it back together , if you are n't very careful , you 'll pinch the cord to the sensor and likely break some of the wires.I had the unit in use for about 6 months before it started beeping about every minute . There was no water leaking or full alarm going on alert , I assumed it was a bad battery . Seemed odd to me after just 6mo in standby mode with a good quality new battery ( I even used the special long life lithium smoke detector battery ) , but I replaced it anyway . In my install , it 's hidden in a crawlspace under the stairs near an air handler and condensate pump , so it 's a real pain to get to . After replacing it and sealing everything back up , the beeping started again . The unit has `` gone bad '' after just 6 months , never even having gotten the sensor wet . Very disappointing , I 'd send it back and demand a refund , but the shipping would cost more than it is worth.I 'll be looking for a better quality product , even if it costs substantially more . Avoid this one , it 's not worth it 's weight in postage , and I certainly would n't count on it to save you from property damage .	-1
In our 30 years at this home we 've had 3 basement floods . The last one was because the sump pump switch stuck . This seemed like a good early warning device but I 'm disappointed . It 's really pretty chintzy and the alarm can not be heard upstairs unless you 're really listening for it . It will not attach to a sump pit , so I just dangled it in the pit on it 's wire . It does set the alarm when water contacts it , but unless I lengthen the wire it 's not doing much good . At least it did n't cost too much .	-1
This did not work from day one . a waste of money . The return policy make syou eat the cost .	-1
I bought a number of these for the obvious reason of providing emergency lighting in a power failure . Regrettably , most of them were defective and did n't work at all . It would be a useful device were it not for the sloppy manufacturing .	-1
This alarm was easy to install and pretty easy to use . Let me just show you the pros and cons to show you how I feel about this little plastic disk.Pros : *It works as a smoke/carbon monoxide alarm ( I feel safe that if there was a real fire , this thing would tell me ) *It was really easy to install on my ceilingCons : *It is WAY too sensitive . It goes off all the time when I cook or roast something especially . And it will keep detecting the 'smoke ' for hours after it has aired out . *I still have NO idea how to 'mute ' it when it goes off when I cook . There is only one button so there is not a whole lot I can do.In Conclusion : This is not a good alarm for safety . Do not get it . The only way I can 'mute ' it when I cook is to take it off the ceiling and take out the batteries whenever it goes off . Since it takes a few hours to stop detecting any hint of smoke and going off , I usually leave it off for the day or through the night . If I forget and have it off longer or if there was an unlucky fire , this alarm would n't do anything because it is sitting on my table with its batteries out . If I had to make the purchase again , I would not at all get this alarm .	-1
What I like is how the alarm twists on and off the ceiling mount . Problem is that ours eats batteries . Using quality AA Energizer batteries , our KN-COSM-B , only lasts 2 months before the dreaded dead battery beep . I 'm going to switch back to a 9volt battery fire alarm and then get a plug-in CO alarm so I 'm not spending the time and money on batteries so frequently .	-1
Bought three for $ 24.88 . Then came back for a couple more and Amazon raised the price on me by +9 % for second purchase ! I dont like Amazon tracking me so much and then hammering me on price when I return for purchase .	-1
Made in China kinda says it all . Would you risk the safety of your family on a product made in China ? I certainly would not . Products made in China have much shorter lives than the same product made here , by far.How do you know if it is really working ? How can you really trust it ? How many Chinese products have you purchased that failed miserably ?	-1
I had this POS installed less than 6 months before it started going off randomly at night for no reason . I checked the batteries with a tester , and they are fine . I 'm staying away from Kidde .	-1
I think the build and design of this knife ( and the Gerbers in general ) are well thought out . I 'm not so sure about the material used in the blade . This is supposedly 440AHC ( with the HC for high carbon ) which should be both weather resistant ( which it is ) and cutlery sharp-enable ( which it does n't seem to be ) . The blade can be sharpened up to a certain point and no further . That said , it seems to hold that sharpness forever , no matter how you use it . I suppose it is a matter of expectations .	-1
I have used this for four years . I wish I had better news : Pathetic design . As you can see from the picture , the aligner has a nice large thumb-screw for tightening the clamp on the knife blade.BUT , the thumbscrew gets in the way of the rod for small sharpening angles . This causes the stones to drag across the aligner and not touch the knife blade . I really like the material that the aligner is made from , it wo n't scratch blades.Recently , I replaced the DMT aligner which came with my set with the GATCO aligner ( about 12 dollars at Amazon ) , and I could n't be happier . DMT makes the best stones that I have used ; but this item is poorly engineered in my opinion.ALSO , in the picture , you can see a brass screw at the fulcrum , which screws into a brass nut on the other side . The nut on the other side pulls out and must be epoxied back into the black polymer holder.One last point is that the aligner is designed to be used with a rod system OR on a bench-stone . GREAT idea , but poor results.It 's only fair to mention that I own SEVERAL DMT products and will continue to purchase them . This is the only DMT product I own that I would not rate as excellent . The DMT company is a class-act .	-1
I own 3 large DMT diamond stones but my own estimate of sharpening angle is not steady enough to achieve the best sharpness.I bought this aligner blade guide to help achieve a razor sharp finish on my knives.All I can say at this stage is What ? In order to get the calculate angle , the stone would have to be at the same level as the support on which the aligner rests . However , my stones are at least 1 inch high so I end up with a very small area and room to sharpen my knives.The other thing I am not comfortable with is that the plastic leaves some marks on my sharpening stones.In conclusion , either I am an idiot ( which is still possible ) or this aligner is not defined for my stones and it is a shame because I saw nowhere about this restriction.For the moment , I am not satisfied .	-1
It just does n't work . You either should have frictionless table or frictionless plastic on a guide . It does n't move smoothly at all , it does n't keep your angle to the stone constant . I had it for a while , total waste of money . I myself used Razor Edge and Lansky systems-they do work . This one is total gimmick .	-1
Since making the transition from mostly framing to mostly finish ( and working on huge houses with tons of stairs ) , I figured I 'd get a compressor that weighed less than 60+ pounds ... I had never seen this P/C compressor on a job but it looked perfect for what I wanted- just something that would keep up with a finish gun.It appeared to be a nice , light package , but it ran forever , got really hot , leaked ( oilless ? ) , smelled like it was about to fry and as nearly every other reviewer has noticed , it is REALLY LOUD . I sent it back before it crapped out , no thanks.A cabinet installer showed up with the same model and the same complaints . It 's a good idea but does n't work - perhaps at lower elevations it might ( job in question was at 10,000 ' ) . In addition , although it seems a lot of people review the P/C nailguns favorably , I 've seen more of them thrown out windows & hurled at floors ( by the younger guys ) and sent back over and over for repairs - than anything else . Save yourself the headache - get a Hitachi framer / Hitachi or Senco finish gun .	-1
These are of variable quality . Apparently , they are not tested after they are `` assembled in USA '' of parts from `` guess where '' . I suggest you buy two if you need one , and test them both . Chances are one will be good and you can return the other one later ( at your convenience ) . If you buy just one , and it does n't work , you are forced to make trip right away . They can easily be tested with a cut-off AC cord and a light bulb or an AC test probe.This is much easier than installing it and driving yourself crazy trying to figure out why it wo n't work . You can not test these with a meter or a continuity light like a three-way switch , as the triac/diac circuit inside requires AC power to test it .	-1
This switch does not work well with LED lights . There is nothing in the product description that states this switch is only for incandescent lights and you find out when you read the warning on the product . I installed it anyway to see what would happen and it did dim the LEDs for a day or two then it failed and would not turn on the light at all . I removed it and ordered a switch specifically for LEDs . I would have given one star for the poor product description , but I can use the switch someplace else so not total loss .	-1
It works as described except the slide dimmer is a problem . Being located along side the on/off switch , it almost always gets moved along with the on/off switch . So , when you turn-off the light there is a tendency for the sliding dimmer to be moved to a very low dim . When you switch the light back on you almost always have to readjust the dimmer to provide full power . The slide dimmer does not react the way you might expect . The upper last quarter of the slide controls most of the lighting scale and the lower three quarters of the slide has very little adjustment in it . For this reason , a slight touch while turning off the main switch will reduce the dimmer almost to zero . It is very annoying .	-1
I had high hopes for this item after reading some of the reviews . My parents have a hard time hearing the doorbell when they are in their room because the doorbell is on the other side of the house . I thought this would do the trick . The chime was very simple to wire into the doorbell and has a very good range . Where it falls short is on the sound . It is not loud enough at all . I switched it between low , medium and high and they were all very similar in loudness . I was hoping the loud setting would be well ... loud .	-1
Update : Started to have problems after about 1 year . Would only work some of the time . Does not have the range that it used to . Would only give it 2 stars if I could change them.Previous Review : This product works great . I tried the type that you put close to the existing bell , and they did not work . This Lamson product worked like a charm - even with walls in the way and an 80 foot distance . I purchase an extra chime receiver , and put it in the workshop outside , and it works !	-1
Measures Voltage only . This is no way to check a Battery 's state of charge . Buy something like `` Delkin Devices DD/BATTEST MULTI RoHS AA/AAA Battery Power Tester '' . This Tester Rocks !	-1
This thing is huge ( like 2 inches wide ) so in order to shrink it to fit the 14 gauge as the directions say you can , you must shrink it to one tenth it 's original size . I tried but failed to get it to make a tight fit . The directions do not specify exactly how to heat the tube either ( all at once or in stages or in a panning motion or in one area then another ) . I would not recommend this for any gauge below 12 and even then it would be difficult to get it right as the insulated section of the wire would have to be huge ( maybe 4 conductor ) . It seems to not like you to heat it more than once as it stops shrinking on subsequent attempts .	-1
I used to count one ironclad gloves , but for the last three years or so , the quality of workmanship has fallen off dramatically . The stitching between fingers unravels well before there is wear to leather portion . They look cool , and fit well , but if they come apart , they become dangerous around equipment .	-1
As many other reviewers have stated these gloves fall apart . I went through two pairs in short order when the `` washable '' synthetic leather literally disintegrated , the material stretched way out and holes showed up everywhere in the material . Lasted less time than much cheaper gloves I 've owned.For a heavier glove I 've had better luck with Ironclad 's Icon line which seems to use a more durable synthetic for the palm .	-1
I should have read the other reviews more carefully before buying ! I am a homeowner/handyman , and I used these gloves for about 9 hours of light demo before the stitching in one of the fingers started to fray.Before they started disintegrating , I had no problems with the gloves . They were comfortable , the grip was good , and I enjoyed the good tight fit . I found they gave me the dexterity to do things that I could n't do with my regular cheapo work gloves . I did find myself having to take them off every once in a while for tasks that demanded a little extra dexterity , and in those cases , the wriststrap/tight closure was kind of a hassle . But if the gloves had held together , they would have been worth the price.However , given the way these have held up , it is unconscionable that these items are being marketed as anything other than disposable ! Save your money !	-1
These are very small for a x large.. I have big hands but these are ridiculously small I have used other gloves that are x large that fit fine ... now I have to pay 4.55 to return insured/traceable to get my money back ...	-1
Very disappointed , I bought these on 12/10/2012 and have used them 9 days as a stagehand . the velcro that closes the left glove came unstiched , I resowed it myself and now the right one 's falling apart . these are complete tommyrot , do yourself a favor and do n't buy them .	-1
after three weeks of purchase , wearing them for only 3 1/2 days of continuous use , the stiching started to come apart . these gloves are a complete waste of money . i normally buy the blue vinyl gloves and they last 4-6 months of continuous use , unless i abuse them or use in a circumstance i know will tear them . but better the gloves than the hand . with the blue vinyl gloves , i can pick up a washer on a concrete slab . i 've also bought leather gloves for 11.00 and cut off the fingers i use most often , just like the ironclad gloves offer . leather feels better than the ironclad . these gloves are just a gimic-gadget , not a quality , durable product , at least that has been my personal experience .	-1
Not what IR was in the past . As other have pointed out the retainer spring breaks fast . No big deal this is expected with any retainer spring.The issueI have is the barrel coming loss all the time . The barrel band is warped.Keep in mind I have this thing a hand full if that times in the 3 years I 've had it . IR is making some real junk lately . I 've had some real issues with there other Pneumatic tools as well . It never was like this in the past ! ! ! What 's changed ? ?	-1
Like listening to a rodent fart . You wo n't hear it if there 's anything between you and the alarm . 95dB is wishful thinking . Go to a Hallmark store and put one of the beeping greeting cards about 100ft away . If you can hear it while people are talking around you than this product might be for you . Calling it an alarm or even an alert is a long stretch of the imagination.Definitely no need to worry about it waking the neighbors , or even yourself if you 're asleep . Good concept . Pathetic execution.Going back to Amazon . Very dissatisfying purchase .	-1
Disappointed with these . Not enough structural support to really keep things locked properly in place , and they do n't fit on my 4 & # 34 ; or 6 & # 34 ; vice correctly . Magnets are n't strong enough to hold it down during really high-pressure operation . Non-marring , but leaves yellow paint marks on the metal finish . Would not recommend .	-1
very sensitive to any inline voltage noise or perhaps static electrical noise to where you might come home and find your lamp mysteriously on when you wish it not to be .	-1
The one thing you will find is this product works well until a bulb burns out . Something happens to the electrical load and it burns out the unit . Happened on both units .	-1
Like one of the previous reviewers said , this product will probably not work in most lamps . In older lamps , the entire metallic housing that the bulb screws into is exposed , allowing the two contacts ( protected by the two tabs ) to contact.However , with most ( if not all ) newer lamps , the metallic housing sits inside another housing , usually made of plastic or ceramic . So when you screw this product in , the two plastic tabs hit the plastic/ceramic housing on the lamp and prevents the two contacts from contacting your lamp 's metallic housing.It 's a little bit difficult to explain , but trust me , once you buy this and find out it does n't work , it 's easy to see why .	-1
Did not go all the way into the socket , and did not work as advertized . A call to the MFG resulted in no return calls . This unit was to replace an older model that plugged into the wall . I suggest they go back to that model . We have two of the old style , one of which died , and newer model was supposed to replace it . If you look at the base , their are two wires that are supposed to make contact , however if you have a paper inside , that will not allow it to work .	-1
This jointer is well-thought-out . But ... when it came time to manufacture the unit , Delta obviously forgot the Quality Control part of the equation . My unit has a twisted fence that 's also cupped from top to bottom . I 'd recommend not ordering this machine unless you can actually see the one you 're going to receive and spend some time on the fence with a good straight-edge.I went through 4 separate fences and kept the & quot ; straightest of the lot. & quot ; It 's still not straight , and I finally got tired of dealing with Delta on this matter.Having said that , the rest of the machine is great . The tables are flat and coplanar , and the motor , stand , and switch are all great . The overall finish of the unit is good.Having the fence ground flat at a machine shop makes this a worthwhile option in the jointer market ... but c'mon ... how hard can it be to get 'em right to start with ? Apparently very hard , 'cause Delta 's sure let a lot of warped fences hit the streets.Bottom line ? If I were buying another 6 & quot ; jointer , I 'd consider another model ... In fact , my advice to you is to avoid this unit until it earns the reputation for quality .	-1
I had this on a garage door I did n't open very much . I used my birth year , figured I would n't forget that . I had n't opened the lock for several years , but it was exposed to weather.Today I opened the lock , but it did not open at the original combination . Luckily It popped open while I was spinning the last two wheels to get to the correct combination and I was able to remove the lock . Now it will not open at either the correct combination or the one that did open it.I 'll be taking a Dremel to it to see what went wrong and have a SesameSesamee Keyless Padlocks Sesame Brass/Steel Shackle Padlockon order .	-1
Count me in as another user that could n't open this lock after it had been outside for a little more than 1 year ( bought it on Oct 2008 ) . Yes , I wrote down the combination and it worked several times before . It was used to secure my circuit breaker box which is on the outside wall of my garage ( go figure why the builder do n't put it inside ! ) I only opened it when I had to reset a circuit breaker that was tripped and last time I successfully opened the combo using my written combination is when I had to turn off the breaker to replace my kitchen ceiling light fixtures . I was surprised when I can not open the lock the other day ( to reset a breaker ) using the same combination that I have always been using . Needlessly to say I am not happy with the thought of additional expense and inconvenience of hiring a locksmith to open this malfunction lock ... Then I had an idea to look online for help and found out how easy it is to pick this lock if you happen to have the right tools ( paper clip or a thin piece of metal ) . I first tried the paper clip method for about 15 minutes and gave up . Then I found a video clip using a thin piece of metal and bingo ! The lock opened right up after trying for about 10 minutes ... I have never picked a lock before and definitely wo n't try to pick one that is not mine , and you should n't too . This is way too easy even for an amateur like me ! I ca n't believe it ! What 's the point hardened steel and all these security feature to prevent cutting , prying when all you need to open this lock is a paper clip or a thin piece of metal ? This lock 's internal mechanism is the same as the Master Lock Model # 175 and it looked like this simple lock picking method has already been discovered since 2006 . I ca n't think of any good reason why Master ca n't come up with a new design that can resist this type of picking in 3 years ! I definitely wo n't be buying another Master Lock again !	-1
Have returned this item for a replacement because it only came with 2 keys . THE PICTURE SHOWS 4 KEYS . I described fully what the problem was and Lo and Behold , the replacement only had two keys . It appears that customer service does not read what the problems are when they receive a return . Have to return this for a second time . What a waste of time and money !	-1
These are nice locks but they only came with 2 keys , there should be 8 keys , 2 per lock , I have several people who need keys for these so I went and had keys cut	-1
within a week , had rusts spots everywhere , and was getting harder and harder to open . I feel like the quality build of the locking mechanism is very flimsy . For me a bad purchase , at least for any outdoor use . ( that 's the only reason it gets 2 stars and not 1 : maybe it is better indoor ... but still , , flimsy ) .	-1
These locks are very cheaply constructed . So cheaply constructed , in fact , that I 'm afraid they 'd spring open if I stared at them too hard . They do use a very unusual key which would make them really difficult to pick , though . Unfortunately that would n't be necessary in the first place : I 'm sure even the crappiest bolt cutters would get through these locks easily .	-1
I had bought one of the & # 34 ; 3009D & # 34 ; locks individually from a hardware store , and was fairly satisfied . The key for that particular lock was of a higher quality than the TWO keys that came with these FOUR-lock packages . I would almost term the TWO keys sent in this four-lock pack as & # 34 ; flimsy & # 34 ; . I also ordered a four-lock pack of the & # 34 ; 140Q & # 34 ; Master Lock from Amazon at the same time I ordered this four-pack of the & # 34 ; 3009D & # 34 ; Master Lock . If I had it to do over , I would have ordered only the & # 34 ; 140Q & # 34 ; locks -- that came with FOUR keys . The & # 34 ; 140Q 's & # 34 ; were more in tune with the quality I would expect from Master ( locks & keys ) .	-1
I have windows on the first floor with bars that need a lock so I had them locked , but lost the key . These replaced the other locks from 20 years ago , same brand , same look . But theses are a little cheaper looking , but seems ok so I 'm using them .	-1
These work in the broadest sense of the term for a few openings and then you will roll to the same combination you 've always used and the lock will refuse to open . No amount of jiggling or repeating series of numbers will open it and you will finally have to CUT it off . I have had 5 of these Master set your own combination locks in 2 different sized models and have had to cut every one off eventually . Chinese junk !	-1
I just purchased the exact same ones from a local department store . The size was perfect except that the locks are very delicate . I was using them on a hard-sided case with enforced lock loops ( pelican 1510 ) . They fit perfectly , leaving very little play , keeping the case shut and almost no opening for prying the case open to access any valuables inside.From a little stress test of lifting and torquing , the locks proved to be very easy to break through . Took me about a minute of twisting the locks moderately to bend and break them off the case , leaving the locks deformed and useless.I would not recommend this lock for protecting anything valuable . For traveling with your clothes and toiletries as a deterrent ( anything of little value , easily replaced ) , sure ... but if you intend on protecting anything like camera equipment or electronics from being stolen , I would not recommend these.Note : there is a small scale of 1-10 of how secure these are . The packaging rates it at 2 , but it is probably more like 0 , seriously . Maybe 1 ...	-1
Put this lock on your bags and watch this demo how to open your luggage if you 're a thief . Google OPEN LUGGAGE PEN and watch the YouTube video . Bet you now realize what happened to that valuable thing you thought you packed for your trip but ca n't find it when you arrived . This kind of thievery has been going on for years and the luggage and lock manufacturers do n't tell you . Maybe you 're better of using small plastic stay-ties which you or the TSA cuts off . Take several of these next time you travel AND do loop a second stay-tie into the first one and attach it to the top handle so no one can close the zippers if they open it illegally . Lewis N Clark makes a nice metal cable Lockdown Triple Security Lock for this purpose . Yes , Amazon.com sells this for $ 12.99 . Yes , is is TSA approved , but that might not be so good if they use their `` five finger discount '' keys .	-1
The drums wo n't stay on the rubber holders unless you really tighten them . If you do that then the drum bubbles out in the center and makes it hard to get a straight sanded side on your stock . It was bad enough that I purchased an osculating table sander.Tim	-1
First , note the date on the reviews.Next , compare what they are asking for these to what they are asking for newer versions with better filtration.For less money , you can get a newer version with canister filters that have agitator paddles . The canister filters out down to five microns . This means more of the fine particles , that are the most dangerous to us , are not trapped and dumped back out into the air , which the 30 micron bag does .	-1
Part numbers 903370 & 903369 are ill engineered and are discontinued ! They are plastic pivots which define the machine side of the fence hinge . The fence is sharp aluminum and it cuts/shaves the pivots . Porter Cable is now owned by DeWalt/Black & Decker . ; They are offering the DeWalt DW682K as a replacement for $ 152.00 if you bring your defective Porter Cable 557 to a service center and offer it as trade in , but the DW682K can be purchased outright for $ 169.00 without trade-in ! ! ! ! DO NOT BUY -- DISCONTINUED -- SAY NO OR YOU WILL BE SORRY ! ! ! ! !	-1
Type 2 Porter Cable 557Bad design : With fence folded up the portion surrounding blade is n't flush with fence..Poor construction : plastic baffle ring between motor housing and gear housing self destructed after limited uses . Did n't even outlast the original blade .	-1
I have had it with this tool . First I could n't remove the cutter , the allen wrench actually broke ; then the cheap fence broke . The local PC repair shop replaced the entire tool . Now one year later , I ca n't remove the cutter again . Poor design ; shame on PC . Buy the Lamello .	-1
I looked at this plate jointer , and did not buy it . The angle fence rotates on a joint made of plastic . I do n't use my tools much , but I keep them for a long time . Based on past experience , I will not buy a tool where a primary hinge is made of plastic .	-1
Purchased this router from warehouse deals . It was used , but listed in good condition . The first problem is that there were no collet wrenches with the router . The listing did n't expressly say they were there , but a bit of a disappointment anyway . I then tried an edge bit in the router and the run out was so bad that the router shaft must be bent . There was an inspection ticket with the router supposedly saying that the router had been thoroughly checked out , but obviously they did n't check the shaft . Had to return the router . Amazon was a delight with the return . Extremely easy and convenient .	-1
I owned a DeWalt 705S for a bit more than a week before returning it . For about five years , I owned a starter model Craftsman 10 & quot ; miter saw , which was fine for simple 45 degree miters and straight cuts for small projects ; however , even after extensive adjustments , it never would cut a straight bevel ( probably due to lateral weakness in the arm , among other things ) . Because I was getting ready to do some extensive remodeling and trim work , I decided it was time to replace the Craftsman with a more serious saw.I looked around at various saws and picked up the DeWalt . I like to buy American made tools when possible , and that was one of the factors in the decision . The DeWalt does have a nice , smooth action and is fairly solid overall , much better than the Craftsman it was replacing . I have had good experiences with other DeWalt power tools I own ( e.g. , a circular saw and a drill ) . After using this saw for a few days , though , I noticed problems . The worst of them is that the locking mechanism is terribly designed on this unit . Other reviewers on this site have noted this ( and I wish I 'd read their reviews before buying the saw ! ) . The problem is this : when you lock in a miter setting by cranking the knob , the pressure lifts the rotating miter table relative to the & quot ; fixed & quot ; base of the saw . The table even lifts a bit when you set the saw to a pre-slotted angle ; the spring that settles into the detent also pushes the table upwards and out of square.Now , this may not be an issue for you if you are making straight cuts in 2x4s or building a dog house , but it is a big problem if you 're trying to do fine trim work where accuracy really matters . The defect effectively throws off the angles you 're dialing in.At this price point , I do n't think a saw should have slop engineered into it . This DeWalt unfortunately does and is therefore an inferior product in my book . ( Even the flawed Craftsman saw I had did not have the table accuracy issue that this saw does . ) DeWalt customer service offered me no solutions or workarounds and suggested I return the product if I was n't satisfied . Back to the home center it went . And I did check the display model for this particular issue after I returned the saw . The display model had the exact same issue . Just tighten the knob and watch the table go up . It 's even worse when you have the miter set to 45 degrees , where you can really see the contrast between the table and the base after the table rises . DeWalt just does n't seem to have been able to figure out how to set the table solidly in the base.After shopping around again and reading more extensive reviews , I picked up a Delta TwinLaser 36-255L instead . Though it is a Taiwanese saw ( as most appear to be ) , it is dead on accurate and needed minimal adjustments out of the box . ( To be fair , the DeWalt was fairly well set up from the factory and did not require more than about fifteen minutes of work to get it squared up . ) It also seems much more solidly built than the DeWalt overall . The same Delta saw without the laser ( 36-255 ) currently sells for the same price as this DeWalt . ( The cookie-cutter Porter Cables are also nice , but the Delta incarnation has a two-year warranty instead of a one-year warranty . ) Even if you 're a DeWalt fan , as I have been , I would suggest that you shop around before dropping three Franklins on this particular product . Cast a cold eye on the 705S and ride on .	-1
This saw has been rated pretty well . Although myself as well as a couple of other people here seem to have noticed the same problem.When you lock the table anywhere , the table flexes up in the front . It just pushes right up . All of the Dewalts do and non of the competitors do . The knob applies pressure directly to one point and bows both pieces of the aluminum up and down . The wider the molding the more tapered the cut . So regardless of how excact your marks are the cuts will be off.I got the Porter Cable 12 & quot ; laser . Dead on accurate , no flimsy table .	-1
I concur with the reviewer that labeled this saw `` junk '' . After mapping out the room for crown , I proceeded to make my cuts . then came installation . I 've hung miles of this stuff , how could I be off so much ? Oh well , just go and recut . What is this ? When I tighten the table knob the front end rises ? My ego felt sooo much better . I 've checked many since , I even showed it to a product rep. on a brand new out of the box . She was dismayed and swore to tell the people up the line . Right . But what the hey , it 's your money buy one , heck get a couple for the wife and kids . It gets worse the more you use it ...	-1
I am so tired of finding my favorite tools now being made in China ! These pliers are sub-standard quality , poorly made , and just as expensive as the original USA made good ones ! Look elsewhere ... maybe you can find one MADE IN THE USA somewhere !	-1
I bought this to use with the & # 34 ; Vermont American 20371 1/8-27 NPT High Carbon Steel Pipe Tap & # 34 ; and eventually returned it to Amazon . The tap did not fit in this wrench . Perhaps I misinterpreted the capacity since 1/8 & # 34 ; is smaller than 1/4 & # 34 ; ... Either way I ended up just using a mechanic 's 10mm wrench to thread the tap for my steam radiator valve . Amazon 's customer service was great in assisting my return .	-1
Do n't know how they measure these things , but this is TINY ... I wanted to use it to move around some tall 1/4 barrel sanke kegs . Wo n't do it due to the small size . If you 're looking to move something that will either fit on the tops , or in the recessed section , it should be ok . If you want to use it to move something else , look for something else . I 'll probably end up getting a furniture dolly from HF at some point .	-1
Cheaply made piece of junk . Does not fit well . Typical Chinese junk . It 's too thin and feels cheap . Looks ok when installed although I had to play with it to make it fit right .	-1
Too narrow . Would n't cover width of opening created for receptacle . Was to be used with a usb receptacle which is somewhat wider than standard .	-1
This requires a neutral . Make sure you have it set up this way before you buy this switch , or have easy access to add additional wiring .	-1
If you need a wireless switch , this is ok . The wall switch looks ok and not too out of place , however the button can be unresponsive at times . You may need to press the button 3 or more times before it will work . I believe this only happens if you press the buttons too fast . I 've checked the battery and it 's fine so I have to assume it just does n't like fast switching . Other than that , it 's not bad .	-1
Very poor range . Was working ok for a few months . Thought maybe the battery died . Works about 80 % of the time within 5 feet . Currently mounted 15 feet away behind a couch . Was working perfectly , no longer works at this distance , channel A or B , it does n't matter , needs to be within 5 feet to work now . Will have to research another option	-1
I purchased two of these switches . One , thus far , has operated quite well . The other had problems `` out of the box . '' Removing the face plate screws proved to be a challenge . Apparently one of the screws was so tightly fastened into threaded brass ferrule that the ferrule actually `` spun '' in the plastic receiver that was holding the brass ferrule into which the faceplate screw was fastened . This necessitated the removal of the faceplate by `` coaxing '' it off the switch box faceplate mounting screws . Then , after remedying this solution , the switch operated properly for two days , and then commenced to function properly only sporadically . I returned it for credit . For me , a 50 % reliability does n't cut it .	-1
There are two ways to connect these type switches : a ) wrap wire around screw and screw it inb ) insert wire into hole until it locksThe problem with these switches is that the hole is way too small for normal house wiring.Fortunately for me I am using the wrap method.If you are using the other method , these wo n't work unless you have unusually small wiring .	-1
This thing is junk and Amazon should not crap lie this to be sold to it 's customers . It wo n't work with a ceiling fixture that also has a ceiling fan . It does state in the instructions & # 34 ; not to be used with electric motors & # 34 ; but it does n't state that in the description of the product . It wo n't work with compact fluorescent bulbs . And with an incondescent ( sp ? ) bulb I have to stand there while it dims to & # 34 ; off. & # 34 ; Who would want to wait for a switch to dim before it shuts off ?	-1
I bought two of these switches to control two sets of security lights ... one set by the front of the house and one set by the backyard . The objective was to add a layer of security by allowing us to turn the lights on at night from the master bedroom . Currently , the front lights are controlled through a switch by the entrance door and the backyard lights through a switch by the patio door.Installation was simple . I know my way around electricity and did n't encounter any installation issues , except perhaps with the position of the antenna . The switch for the patio door is installed to an outside wall , which has spray-on insulation . In order to insure the thin wire antenna is extended , I had to poke a hole through the insulation and push the wire through . Because of the limited space of the electrical box and flimsy antenna wire this was not as easy as it appears . Another issue is that the presence of any metal next to the switch can interfere with the remote signal . My whole house is constructed by metal framing , so it 's very difficult to keep the switch away from metal . However , after trying different settings I got the switches to work ... or so I thought.After completing the installation of both switches , the remote seemed to work just fine adjacent to them . However , when I tried to operate them from the master bedroom , they worked intermittently . Took a while to find a spot providing consistent operation ... and of course , not the location we wanted . Yet , up to that point , we were satisfied ; at least we had three way switches for both sets of lights and felt more secure knowing we could turn the lights on from within the master bedroom.However , three days later I 'm trying to turn the backyard lights on and they did n't want to come on . Trying pressing the wired switch up and down and nothing . I grabbed the remote control , and after a few tries , the lights came on . I then tried to turn the lights back off and encountered the same issue ; it took many tries to turn them off ... with either the remote control or the wired switch . Then I tried the one by the front door and it did the same thing . Removing the switch and repositioning the antenna did n't work either.Perhaps the metal framing in our house had something to do with it or maybe there are other interferences , but even if those were the cases , such expensive product should still be able to work with some adjustments . My other concern is that the switches worked when first installed , why not three days later . I like products that work from the start and do what they are engineered to do without so many restrictions ... this product is not one of them and I do n't recommend it .	-1
The swith fits too tightly into a standard wall mount box . I had to file the box down to get it in . Unfortunately the box was so tight that the antena wire got caught between the switch an the box . It shorted out and destroyed the switch . I now have a $ 27 hunk of plastic . Do n't try to mount this in remodel box . In fact I would not mount it in any metal box as the metal acts like a shield for the signal from the transmitter .	-1
This broke within a few weeks of using it . Dont buy it . It 's a waste of money . Believe me I know	-1
these are bad for your house . they allow moisture in to your house which causes mold . it you have build-up of moisture on the windows then you have a problem . If you hook this to a gas drier then you also get carbon dioxide in your house . if you really want moisture in your house then do n't use the fan when you take a shower . you should n't need more humidty in the house if you cook , bath and breath .	-1
The level sent to me was not an empire level and is one of the cheapest made levels I 've seen in my life . Its yellow plastic and is 2 halves that has to screws holding it together . Not the aluminum one that is described above.Cost more then its worth to send it back so I 'll just throw it away , piece of real garbage , thanks for nothing Big Ten . I wo n't buy anything from you again nor would I recommend your company or products .	-1
Have not used the two brad sets I received yet , and may have trouble trying to use them due to poor packaging in the shipping box.The Brads are packaged in plastic press fit blister packs about the size of a candy bar . The packs were shipped in a 12 '' x 6 '' x 4 '' cardboard box with a piece of bubble wrap and no means to secure them from moving . The blister packs must have moved around considerably during shipping because both packs opened and the brad strip separated into anywhere from single brads , to strips of only a few brads , to a half strip of brads . I do n't know yet if my nailer will accept very small strips let alone single brads.The brads themselves are probably fine as a product , but Amazon gets a `` F '' for shipping . Keep this in mind when ordering small parts that can not handle shipping without being secured . Sigh ... ..	-1
Go to your local big box store and buy these brads ( a lot ) cheaper , plus have a better choice of the lengths needed	-1
I never have a problem with these nails and in fact , are my staple . The only issue is do n't buy them here . I have found them cheaper at local hardware stores , alot cheaper..Thats the sole reason it got the stars it got . So you know I 'm not a spokesman for anyone else but me..	-1
This is a low quality inset.A cheap casting.End up getting stuck in saw table from painted sides.Ours broke in two down the middle.Either save your $ and make your own from MDF or plastic , or buy something in the Betterley class of inserts for about $ 80 .	-1
My husband bought me a Delta Unisaw 4 years ago . A few months ago , I noticed that the insert was harder and harder to remove . Recently it was stuck so bad that the only way to remove it was to use a screwdriver , which bent it beyond repair . Rather than spend the money for a new one , I will just use my zero clearance inserts . For the cost of this table saw , you would think Delta would have an insert that is more durable than this one . I also have some issues with the saw , but that 's another review .	-1
When you fork out the big bucks and get your first `` real '' table saw ( in my case a left-tilt x5 Unisaw ) you expect everything to be right . Everything seemed to be in alignment out of the crate and not much fussing was necessary before I was making short work of anything that came through the saw . I 'm a stickler for tuning everything to square , and every time I thought I had achieved it I would find the occasional out of square cut . Finally after many hours of rechecking and test cuts I found the culprit : the standard Unisaw insert from Delta was not flat . . . During my next trip to the local Woodcraft store I checked out their floor model Unisaw and found the same dip toward the blade that mine had . Though I had wanted to get a zero-clearance insert , it bothered me that I had to get one if I wanted consistent cuts . Not only does the Unisaw come with a `` throw away blade '' but at least some come with a `` throw away insert . '' C'mon , Delta ! !	-1
I received this unit , took it out of the package and it was bent , and twisted , ... .not a chance of laying flat on my Unisaw . I returned this insert and purchased a Betterley insert . Compared to this insert , the Betterley is a real work of art .	-1
This product works well for its basic purpose -- providing a flexible mechanism to drill or drive fasteners around corners or in hard to reach locations . Unfortunately , when only a bit of load is applied ( such as when driving a screw or other fastener ) , the head of the tool breaks off of the shaft . I had several of these self-destruct in this way , so this appears to be a fundamental limitation of this tool . Bottom line , this is probably ok for drilling , but do n't expect to use this to drive screws or other fasteners .	-1
I drilled exactly 11 small holes with this thing befor it fell apart . I was installing cabinet door closers for my kitchen cabinets . I ca n't imagine this product holding up under any significantly heavy use if it could n't withstand that .	-1
These cheap item snapped during the first screw I tried to fasten . It broke off where the flex part meets the part that inserts into the drill . Maybe I should not have flexed it so slightly . I do not recommend this product .	-1
This is the second one of these that has broken on me . If you are looking for extreme flexibility but only very light duty work , this might be OK .	-1
It comes shrink wrapped after a cardboard box the plastic wrap is extraneous and lasts longer than the few metal parts of the rod which has fell down 3 times in one month , the last one i had broke when i stressed the cheap plastic threaded tension rod so I 'm worried about breaking this one . The finish scratches very easily as the shower hooks are already wearing the finish off . I would not recommend this product . I 'd bite the bullet and go to Bed Bath and Beyond where you can return any item with no questions as long as you have the receipt . The fact that Amazon supports the Fascist oppression of free speech & Wikileaks is one more reason to shop elsewhere and if you ca n't at least buy a better shower curtain rod .	-1
Flimsy , weak , poorly constructed . I honestly just threw it out when it came . I was n't expecting much for what I paid , but I was expecting a little more than this .	-1
Of cheap construction . It does look like in the photo . It does hold my sheer voiles , but wo n't hold anything else . The caps at the ends are made of plastic , not rubber , so it does n't hold very well against the wall . Do not count on it holding anything heavier than a sheer panel . It wo n't .	-1
These are extremely weak if you need to swing a heavy door . I have a solid wood door going into my basement and two of them can not close it completely , and yes I adjusted the tension to the max . If you are using it for a hollow core door they may work . Anything other than that , these are useless . Use the Everbuilt spring hinges which work great but require a little more work as you have to replace the whole hinge rather than just the pin .	-1
Pros:1 . Compact , inconspicuous2 . No need to drill holes on door frame/door3 . Easy to setupCons:1 . It lost its functionality within 1 month.2 . Its door-pressing plate slightly damaged my door frame.It 'd be 4-star if it had n't broke so fast .	-1
I was disappointed by the strength of the spring on this . I used it on very light , hollow , standard size closet door . Even at the tightest setting it would barely close the door . I was able to improve it a little by jamming a small piece of cardboard between one of ` arms ' and the door to make the spring force even tighter . I lubricated the other hinges . The door swings with almost no resistance . Despite this the device barely closes it . In fact , even with all this it will not really close the door . It swings it to the point where the latch meets the frame . It does not have the strength to actually latch the door . I was hoping to use this to keep the cat out of the walk-in closet . However , because the door does not actually latch , the cat can push the door open and get in . I suspect that if you added two of these to each door it might work , but if I 'm going to spend that much , there are probably better options . Installation is kind of a pain too . I spent at least a half hour trying to intall this and get it to work properly . Overall I can not recommend this product .	-1
Sorry Stanley but this product failed my expectations . I installed this product to the door leading to my garage . I could not think of any other door I could use this for so I proceeded with my installation . My door has 3 existing hinges and figured that the weight is no longer a factor since it is suspended and swings freely . Once installed , you would have to adjust the spring tension for your door to swing shut . After several adjustments , my door would still not completely close . I noticed that I could no longer make additional adjustments because the exposed spring on the top of the hinge started to buckle up . I did not have any other options but to remove it . It took me several hours installing and removing . The pin that goes in the hinge became stuck and had to improvise ways to get it out in order for me to reuse my own hinge . I thought of sending it back but installation/removal made it not reusable and left me no choice but to throw it away .	-1
I used TWO of these on a normal weight door to my basement , and as many of the reviews say , it closed to the point where the door was near the latch , but did n't actually swing it that last crucial centimeter.I 'm going to spend the twenty bucks and get a real door closer !	-1
I did n't do enough research before purchasing this item . It is a fair price if you consider having to drive to Home Depot for the item . However , if you lump your purchases together on the same trip which I requently do , then the price is n't as cheap as it should be . Home depot is cheaper .	-1
I could use it for 2 rivets and than it didnt pull anymore.It 's a pity because the swivel head is a great idea .	-1
Get a Malco 2 in 1 riveter , you wo n't regret spending the money . This is the worst riveter of the dozens I 've used . I ca n't believe something like this even got out the door of quality control . Were they trying to build a tree ornament ? Because it sure does n't hold up to any riveting .	-1
Usually Arrow equipment lasts a while , and on contact you 'd expect that from this unit . It 's heavy and the exterior is strong . This riveter has features , but stopped working about the third time I used it ; it jammed up and no longer can pull rivets through even after clearing . Even when it did work , it required a huge effort to squeeze-and-pull the rivets .	-1
purchased this to recover my chairs . Was not aware of the lip on the end , which makes it impossible to use on any flat surface . Also not easy to load .	-1
I used this staple gun for tacking tar paper on roofs . After two roofs it went bad . Now in order to use it you have to drive in one staple and then hit the top a second time to advance the staple . Two strikes for each staple . Tried putting solvent on it but nothingcorrects the problem.I finally found out what the problem was . I loaned this tool to a friend . While he was using it he dropped it on the sidewalk and slightly bent the front . Pushing it in so that it would bind on the mechanism . I took a flat punch and hammer and hit the front bracket from behind pushing it outward . It now works OK . It does n't bind anymore . Only a few thousands of an inch was needed .	-1
Come on ! Fine grit ? Fine grit you claim ? This grit was mediocre at BEST . Why would you call it fine ? Boo !	-1
I use this tape with a nice 3m tape gun . I 've packed and shipped several boxes with it and it usually works fine inside , but try taping something in 50 degree weather and this tape turns horrible . I just finished packing a box outside and I literally went through about 1/3 roll because I had to rip off pieces after they started splitting lengthwise about 8-10 times . Even got my fingers bleeding a bit ( just from the tape - not from the tape gun 's blade ) . Will never order this again .	-1
3M typically makes great tape , but the batch I received worked poorly . We had to use it for a project , not enough time to return . Just did n't stick well to our cardboard shipping boxes . Peeled off by itself in several cases . Waste of time and money.Solution : forget plastic tape , use reinforced paper tape instead -- a far better product for box sealing . Amazon , B & H ; Photo , and other quality companies use paper tape for sealing their shipping boxes -- it stands up to abuse , never peels off , and basically does the job at lower cost than plastic .	-1
It appears that Scotch has redesigned their winning packing tape and totally ruined it . Have been using their tape for years and it has been outstanding . Bought a new roll today to send a boxed package across country and spent over an hour trying to get it taped up enough to hold together . This NEW stuff will only stick to itself ; it absolutely will NOT stick to a cardboard box . Finally , after using a half roll of this stuff on a 15 '' X12 '' X12 '' package by wrapping it around and around , I HOPEFULLY got enough wrapped around it to be able to get it shipped . Will know tomorrow when I take it to UPS and see if they even accept it.If you get a roll of this that advertises `` 20 Times stronger '' , be aware that it has changed drastically , and NOT for the better . The tape may be stronger but the adhesive is practically non-existent when it comes to holding a package together , unless you totally encapsulate it in tape .	-1
Way too thin . It does n't stick all that well to the cardboard . I 'm having to double tape everything to make sure it does n't open . No amount of adjusting of the dispenser seems to keep this tape from curling back onto itself . It 's not a bargain when you are throng out bunched up tape and having to use twice as much to assure adhesion . I wo n't be buying this again .	-1
I used it on a pellet stove vent pipe and I had to seal over the edges of the tape with high temp silicon sealant after I found ash was blowing out around taped joints . Useless on flue pipe joints that never exceed 200F . High temperature flue tape ? Not this one ! I did clean the pipe with acetone before taping the joints .	-1
The mask was deformed and did not fit on my face correctly . It was crooked on my nose and pointed sideways . It is unfortunate I had this problem because I would have used it while cleaning out my garage . My garage was full of nasty pesticides and anti fungal dusts for bushes . Among the poisons was an old bag of Diazinon . Diazinon is so bad the EPA apparently outlawed it and it can no longer be sold in the US . Since my mask was defective and therefore unusable I have to sweep nasty spilled powders and poisons out of my garage all the while breathing in the toxic substances as it was airborne due to cleaning and whatnot . I got headaches and incessant sneezing attacks . It was bad . So I wish I had one that worked so I would not have exposed myself needlessly to such hazardous conditions but I was in a hurry and needed to get things cleaned in time for spring .	-1
Mixes paint OK , but takes a lot of work moving up and down , side to side to mix in gallon containers , because these are so small . Will look for bigger mixers in the future .	-1
I purchased this charger to put life back into some of my old batteries for my 18V batteries from DEWALT . It would not even charge them much less renew the life of the battery . Returned the item for a full refund . Company was good about refunding my purchase price .	-1
I have found that on about an 80 degree day , charging will never start unless the battery and charger are put in a shady spot for quite a while . Has anyone else had that problem ? Not good for many job sites . I will follow up with DeWalt in case it 's a malfunction .	-1
My batteries finally died on my older cordless screwdriver of the exact same model.Rather than pay $ 50 for new batteries , I decided to pay a few dollars more for the screwdriver with the batteries.Turns out they have `` improved '' the trigger switch.The newer switch does n't pull near as far as the old one.And the variation comes at the end of the pull ... like the last 1/4 to 1/8 inch . It 's really weird.And sometimes nothing happens when the trigger is pulled.And finally , the slider that reverses the rotation and locks the trigger easily comes out of position and you end up trying to pull a locked trigger . I suppose I could have gotten a bad one but I do n't feel like trying again.I returned it . Time to look for another model .	-1
I had my Dewalt screw driver only a few days and accidentally knocked it off the work bench . It landed on the hinge and broke in half . The local Dewalt service center would not cover this under warranty . I have now switched over to Bosch .	-1
Not bad but why would I want one . So what it can driver a 3 '' deck screw . I can do that better with a cordless drill or impactdriver . This dewalt is still too big for a small screwdriver . The Milwaukee is over priced a little but it does the one thing better . Being a cordless driver . Its much smaller like a screwdriver . And you can drive a screw and then twist it like a manual screwdriver to check thightness of the screw . And dont have to worry a lot playing with the clutch so you dont strip out screws . Or like installing plastic electric plates , you can screw in then turn screw just a little manually so you dont crack the plate .	-1
Total Junk . Wo n't cut through drywall ! Seriously , what does n't cut through drywall . The most accurate drywall cutting tool is still the sawzaw or somthing like it . Do n't Waste Your Money	-1
Practically every allen set screw rounded out immediately making the countersink bits unusable until I purchase new screws . The flip drive is nice which is why I kept the order .	-1
I bought this because I could n't find the Craftsman version in stock anywhere at the time and I was gearing up for some assembly work . When I finally got to drilling holes , after the 4th hole , the cutter and the bit broke in the hole . I think it boils down to the fact that DeWalt uses a 4 prong cutter for the countersink portion and the cutters themselves are small and brittle . If you drill into anything harder than pine , you 're likely to break something.In any case , I wound up getting a Craftsman version that has much stronger bits and cutters and I was able to finish the rest of the job . Save your money and get something you can rely on .	-1
Not up to the DeWalt quality that I had expected having used their bits , drills , sanders and surface planers . The drill bits themselves are pretty flimsy , but the cutter seems to be decent quality . The flip drive mechanism is fine and seems to hold secure . The case itself is a cheap blown molded thing instead of other hard plastic DeWalt bit cases and I do n't expect it to last very long . Once the bits wear out I 'll probably toss the kit .	-1
I BOUGHT THIS BOSCH ROUTER ON 8 17 13 AND IT TOOK A FUE DAYS TO REBUILD MY ROUTER TABLE . IT WAS BIGGER THAN MY OLD TRITON . ON 8 27 I WAS ABLE TO PUT IT TO WORK . LOVED IT AT FIRST , AFTER A COUPLE OF EDGE CUTS ON A PIECE OF OAK 6 '' X 10 '' . I NOTICED THE COLLET NUT GETTING WARM . MADE AN OTHER PASS ON PINE . NOW HOT , CA N'T TOUCH . I FIRST LOOKED TOO SEE IF THE BIT WAS SLIPPING , NO COLLETT MARKS BIT WAS TIGHT . AFTER IT COOLED SO I COULD CHANGE THE BIT , MADE ONE MOOR TRY / AT THIS PIONT I TIMED THE RUN / 35 SEC . AND EVEN BEING CAREFULL FINGERS TIPS WAS BURNT.AMAZON SENT ME A REPLACEMENT IN 48 HOURS 10 STARS TO AMAZON . THE REPLACEMENT HAD THE SAME TROUBLE & AFTER 3 OR 4 MINUTES OF FREE RUNNING NO BIT OR COLLET I HAD TRACES O F GREASE COOKING OUT OF THE BOTTOM BRARING . I CALLED BOSCH AND TALKED TO RICK A WARRENTY SERVICE TECH . AT FIRST HE SAID IT WAS BAD AND HE NEEDED BOTH ROUTERS BACK TO FIND OUT WAT WAS WROUNG . HE SAID HE WOULD TEST ONE OF THE 1619EVS ROUTERS HE HAD THERE AND CALL ME BACK . HE DID CALL BACK IN 45 NINUTES THAT WAS A SURPRISE , BUT NOW HE CLAMES HIS GOT HOT TO . AND BECAUSE IT HAD 3.25 HP AND ALL THAT ELECTRIC IN THERE IT WAS NOW NORMAL TO GET BLISTER HOT & I WAS NOT SUPOSED TO CHANGE THE BITS SO OFFTEN . I NEED TO WAIT TILL IT COOLS DOWN THEN CHANGE BITS . RICK NEVER USED A ROUTER BEFOR OR HE IS A GOOD LYER COVERING BOSCH 'S ASS , NO ROUTER GETS THE COLLET BLISTER HOT IN 20 TO 30 SECCONDS OR MINUTES FOR THAT MATER . SO IF YOU DO BUY ONE OF THESE BE CAREFULL IT VERRY WELL COULD BE GOING BACK TOO . I HOPE THIS STOPS SOMEONE ELSE FROM ALL THE TROUBLE AND BURNT FINGERS I WENT THOUGH . I WENT TO MILLWAUKEE FOR MY FIFTH ROUTER , 2 DEWALT , 1 TREND , 1 HITACHI NONE OF THEM ARE HOT EVEN AFTER ALL DAY LETS GO MAKE SOME CHIPS FLY .	-1
I purchased about five of these for use on different tools . Initially they looked good , but in use they are annoying and end up breaking . Most other commercially available featherboards for table saws are better designed , better built and cost less ! I am surprised other reviewers rate these so high , I suspect the ratings are given before much use.1 . The black plastic knobs that you use to tighten the featherboard in place capture onto a nut head . The largest problem with these featherboards is that it is easy to strip the black plastic knobs when they are tightened , allowing the plastic knob to turn freely on the captive bolt.2 . A better design would ensure a more positive capture into the miter track by having both black knobs works to lock the split aluminum bar into the miter slot , in this design only one of the knobs does this . Which BTW is the one that strips as above , since you have to tighten it enough to stop the featherboard sliding in the miter track.3 . The black plastic knobs are small and feel cheap , other commercial featherboards have larger knobs that are easier to tighten.4 . Also after using them for a while you 've start to hate the non-parallel bolt slots that the featherboard slides around on . Most other commercial featherboards have parallel slots and these are easier to adjust.Amazon has wooden featherboards and the Grip-tite model available , both are much better than these . Also Rockler makes a good $ 7 table saw featherboard that is a much better product .	-1
i have this base - and i have the delta/rockler base . i would n't buy this one again . My beef - that it 's not really foot friendly.1 . it 's tough to lift or lower with your feet.2 . when the base is in the lifted position the handles stick out far to either side - i now have at least two pairs of boots with gouges through the leather because of it . A beater pair of shoes - ok - but sometimes i 'm just cutting through the shop or have only a couple minutes of work to do and do n't want to change ... The rockler model is great . i did n't get another because i did n't want to bother making the oak rails . should have sucked it up and put the hour of effort in .	-1
I thought these would replace my spring clamps , which are sometimes too strong for small jobs . However , the Handi-Clamps do n't provide enough clamping pressure . I returned mine . I would recommend the Quick-Grip bar clamps , they are just as quick to use and can provide a large amount of clamping pressure . I use them on almost every project .	-1
Looking at these , you would think that they should work well , but they do n't . They have no clamping tension and can not be tightened enough to hold anything firmly . If you need a clamp that fits loosely , these will work . My recommendation is to keep looking for another product .	-1
Not enough pressure . No mechanical advantage applied to work . You might as well use your hand .	-1
What a novel idea : clamps that exert no pressure ! I was very surprised to find that these clamps which look well-designed , simply do n't work . Squeeze the handles together as tightly as you can and the clamps still fail to hold whatever it is you you are trying to secure . Color me surprised when I released my grip - and the clamp released as well.Like I said , these look like a great idea , but they aren't.Jerry	-1
The biggest flaw of this clamp is that it utilizes zero leverage in the design . Because of this , the clamp will only be as tight as you can squeeze it with your hands and nothing more . This is in contrast to more effective clamps that maximize clamping pressure by taking advantage of a pistol grip handle 'trigger ' or a screw set fastener riding on a lock rail.Because of this deficiency , items clamped down with these clamps tend to slip and come lose . This is especially true if you do n't have the strongest grip to begin with.This clamp has potential for being used for jobs that require very light clamping pressure , but you will get more bang for your buck by purchasing metal spring clamps.Overall , I do not recommend this product .	-1
Pressing the yellow button no longer releases the blade on mine . Blade removal was always difficult , requiring several tries , and now the blade can not be removed no matter what . I think the yellow blade removal depressor is made from an inferior plastic that is not up to the job . When it still worked , it was inconvenient to use , as removing the spare blade took one compartment opening and replacing the in-use blade took another step . Both involved plastic parts that were difficult to use and prone to failure.Like so many imports , it was nice while it worked.I replaced it with a Kobalt 50074. all metal utility from Lowes . It is all metal construction and sliding one button opens the knife for blade change and access to the spare blades . It also fits my hand much better .	-1
I 'm quite mechanically adept and could n't figure it out . I ca n't believe that Stanley handicapped this product and their brand by not doing a better job on the instructions.This review gives great instructions on how to change the blade . http : //www.amazon.com/review/R3MG0YO1V5ELTD/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm ? ie=UTF8 & ASIN ; =B000051WTG & nodeID ; = & tag ; = & linkCode ; =	-1
Just received this knife . It jams very easily and the blade is hard to install . Opening the handle to get at the stored blades is cumbersome as well . Needless complexity . I have to get a band aid now , got ta go !	-1
Like most button type quick change knives the blades falls out if you cut drywall or shingles.As well it is too big to fit into a carpenters knife pouch .	-1
I like the retractable blade , but the notches that keep the blade in one of various positions are not adequate , and the blade keeps retracting.Also , the access to change the blade and storage of extra blades are NOT obvious and are difficult to figure out .	-1
I finally threw mine in the garbage yesterday , I did n't even consider selling it on a garage sale . It is the worst utility knife design I 've ever had , , , and I go back to the old style with the screw in the middle to remove for blade changes . The blade is stuck in it now , I ca n't slide it in or out nor can I change the blade . I tried the tips in these reviews , I 've tried a vice and pliers , nothing moves the sliders . It just simply sucks ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I use the word nailgun loosely because it actually has to fire nails to qualify . I bought this gun brand new and right out of the box there were serious problems . Primarily with the fact that I have to depress the nose so many times to even get this thing to fire once . I have the framing nailer too , so I know these guns have to be cleaned . Right out of the box though , there should be no excuse for this . Do n't waste your time or money on this piece of junk .	-1
All the same problems everyone else has had , except after my Paslode refurbishment it began shooting nails out of the bottom of the nail holder ( about an inch from the tip of the gun ) . This is not good at all . I had high hopes for this tool and I really wanted it to work .	-1
This is the second supposed pro series gun I 've owned . The first started sticking between shots and wouldn , t countersink in hard woods . I 'm a finnish carpenter by trade and while this gun preformed well for about 3 months . I had to keep it on turbo setting almost all the time at 110 pressure . So after returning that gun I got another , this would have been my 4th Senco gun . The second gun started having trouble sinking 2 '' in hardwoods and I started running it in turbo . In 6 months the second gun started leaking air at the head . I noticed the piston head was badly marred and scored at the retainer sleeve and was causing air to leak . I 'm currently taking it to the repair center as Senco cust service wo n't send out replacement parts . This gun has not stood up to the rigors of professional use and should have its XP designation revoked.UPDATE 10/21/08 After seeing a newer model of this tool in a tool store recently I reopened an old wound and rembered my non-setting piece of trash shoved under my workbench unused for the past 9 or 10 months and decided to try and get some justice for my purchase of this tool . Called Senco direct and got a great customer service rep and they are sending me a brand new gun , newer model , hooray Christmas in Oct. Will post how the new model works ASAP . But kudos to Senco for standing behind what was probably just a lemon .	-1
I have same problem as previous post , drive stops and starts .have owned it a few years .gets moderate use .problem was there from the start , minor at 1st and today it is driving me nuts .I need it now and my recent exp with makita parts was months coming . sure got good reviews .the depth adjustment stays put which is good , no gimckie anti snipe handle . wish it worked today	-1
Before anyone claims I did not follow directions . Wrong doors where inside heated to 70 f , They where clean and precisely measured to the specifications in the instructions.They went on easily , instructions are included.10 hours after installing they are both falling off therefore a ZERO or a one as far as the rating goes . Pure garbage .	-1
These are probably very good door sweeps but they are too short for the opening under my doors to do any good . Thus the low rating . I have n't installed them yet because it will take an extension to make them work and I 'm lazy .	-1

In an attempt to save $ on overhead door garage door bottom seal , I purchased two of these items . I did a fresh level adjustment on garage door before installing this new MD seal and installed it with screws instead of the enclosed nails . I placed the screws w/washers every 12 inches and kept torque on the remaining seal as I inserted the screws into the door bottom . The job came out well as far as appearance but not so well as far as sealing the door bottom . I recommend spending the $ to get a better made seal if you are looking for something to keep out rain water , dust , etc .	-1
I have owned a variety of high-end flashlights over the years and at one time worked as a Sheriff 's Sergeant in a major metropolitan area . In that line of work a bright flashlight is a tool of the trade , and is carried at all times , even during the day.A belt holder for a flashlight should keep the flashlight securely attached to the belt and allow the user to rapidly deploy and replace the flashlight with a minimum of fuss . It should allow the flashlight the freedom to swing and swivel to accommodate sitting in a vehicle and/or riding a snomobile , ATV or similar conveyance . This belt holder only accomplishes the first objective . While it does hold the flashlight securely , it tends to bind if one attempts to remove the flashlight without using a second hand to hold the ring perpendicular to the flashlight body and a second hand is required to hold the ring perpendicular to the flashlight body to return the flashlight to it 's holstered position . The ring also has only limited freedom to allow the flashlight to swing forwards and backwards to clear obstacles and vehicle steats and saddles.For casual use this product is OK . But for professional use , the product 's single-axis swinging ring design detracts from it 's usefullness . If you 're serious about a flashlight holster , buy one of the all-leather products that has a ring that is soft and compliant and hold itself at 90 degrees to the belt ring . These can be obtained at a Police equipment supply .	-1
The bezel and mounting clips are useful . If you have D cell Mag-lites on a boat or vehicle that moves , this keeps your flashlight from rolling around . The mounting clips are made well and hold the flashlight in place . The plastic red clear and blue covers are not the greatest though . The red is not very red , the blue is not very blue and the white is not able to diffuse light much at all . Better to get a blue or red LED light if you need colored light and just use the clear filter already on the light . The clear one seems to have no purpose as it does n't diffuse light enough . Better to just get the mounting clips yourself . The rubber bezel is good for keeping the light from rolling around , but will discolor and dirt will stick to it .	-1
I 'm pretty fond of DeWalt ... but blades on the countersink do n't last long . Bits do n't last long . I 've had the best success over the past 10 years with Ryobi 's version .	-1
I rec 'd this item today and opened the box to find that it has been used . There was sawdust in the box and the belt was on the sander and had clearly been used . Called Makita and they said the belt should be separate in the box ( NOT on the sander ) and should not be used . Returning item . This should never have been reboxed and resold as it was obviously used and not new .	-1
Totally ripped and fell apart within the first five minutes of use . Do not purchase . A real disappointment . The Porter-Gable polisher is great , but the pad is junk .	-1
I previously used a Sebertool M4 multi-tool for EDC for about 15 years . I carried it openly on a belt keyring and despite hiking , camping , house renovations , attic crawls , crawlspace dives , working under cars , etc . I never lost my original , despite its unorthodox and seemingly unsecure carrying mode.I also used it to assemble furniture and work on smaller components on cars . I actually have seen the tool shafts flex and bend but always return to true.I bought this particular item to replace my M4 so I could retire it . The IDL was similar enough in form and function.So after acquiring the T10 , I casually used it to remove staples from wood . I used the flat-head screwdriver to accomplish this . Imagine my surprise and horror that using the T10 for such a simple task actually damaged the screwdriver . It bent and gouged and is visibly out of true by about 1/16 inch.My old M4 has no peening or gouges , and looks relatively pristine.This T10 has failed on its first use , and a relatively simple one at that . I cringe to think what would have occurred if I had a stuck screw.The T10 is no replacement for the old M4 . It literally does not hold a candle to it .	-1
I 've rewritten this review to provide more detail . The IDL T10 keychain tool is a cute looking little package . It it a typical multi-tool layout with foldout locking tools in stamped sheet metal folding handles of the pliers . Folded the T10 's overall dimensions are 2 1/16 '' x 1 1/18 '' x 3/8 '' The manufacturing quality is good , with radiused edges . The pliers are not needle knose but flat-sided like a mini lineman 's plier . The jaws meet precisely and work well , but are thick and clumsy for such a small tool . The nose of the pliers measure 1/4 '' wide by 1/8 ( 2 x 1/16 '' ) thick . A needle nose format would have been a better choice for such a small tool.In one handle there is a # 1 ( approx ) phillips head ( cross ) screwdriver , a flathead screwdriver and a small ( 1 3/8 '' ) knife blade . In the other handle there are tweezers ( poorly made , the jaws do n't line up ) a two-sided ( double cut and single cut ) file with a nail cleaning point and a bottle opener with a small flat head screwdriver tip.Overall it 's a pretty package , but unfortunately , performance wise the T10 has more flaws than functions . *The ingenious locking system allows for all tools to lock , but it also forces you to pull you fingers toward the sharp edge of the knife blade to unlock it , a danger exacerbated by the small size of the tool . *The phillips driver is smaller than the ubiquitious # 2 but too large for glasses or other precision work , a little under # 1 size , I 'd guess . *The small flat screw driver on the bottle opener is only bevelled on one side allowing it to slip and damaged screws easily . It is also a bit too wide for many eyeglass screws . *The large flat screw driver is bevelled on both sides but the bevels are mismatched again causing the tool to slip in the screw easily . *As stated earlier the jaws of the tweezers do n't mate up correctly , probably due to the construction . Two separate pieces of thin steel are indexed with a pressed in bump on one side fitting into a hole in the other . *The straight back profiled blade is beveled on both sides but the edge is chisel ground ( sharpened on one side only ) . It will take a ok edge wit some effort ( it fairly dull when recieved ) but it does n't keep that edge for very long . Not a big problem , as you 'll not be doing much with this tiny blade but opening letters or packages . *The plier is well made but lacks a useful profile for a tool this small . The blunt `` lineman 's '' style is better used on heftier tools . The handle rivet points ca n't take a lot of torque so , like so much of the T10 , the pliers are more for show than for go.All of the tools are clumsy to open with a distinct sticking point when the locking reed opens . As noted earlier , this locking mechanism forced you to pull toward the knife 's edge to unlock the knife blade , a safty concern.The keychain hole relies on friction at the handle rivet points to stay closed , with a little use it will open on it 's own and fall off your keychain.Think of this as the mall ninja replacement for one of the small keychain Swiss Army knives and you 'll be pretty close . It 's pretty and `` tacticool '' but not very practical . If you want a small multitool get a Leatherman or Gerber . If you just want to open packages and clean your nails , the small Swiss Army knife will do a better job with a nicer blade.Sorry , I tried to like the T10 , but in the end it 's long on looks and very short on performance .	-1
These dont do a good job . Not recommended and not worth the money being charged.I am surprised of some poor quality dewalt tools and blades . I am going gradually over to Bosch and Makita .	-1
I have been a Pro . carpenter for over 25 years , bought this combo pack because of the `` deal '' . They are probably the crappiest blades I have ever used , not sharp and splinter the back of the cuts . Both blades were also warped and upon start up made the saw jump . Dewalt has really gone down hill , all of their products are made in China and their hand tools are n't much better than cheap box store home owner tools . Shame on you DEWALT ! ! Spend a bit more and get a Pro . quality product . Makita makes excellent finish blades as does Freud .	-1
The DW3128 finish blade in this set is horrible , I do n't recommend buying these if you do finish work and here 's why:1 . The carbides are very small compared to those on a good quality blade ( such as Freud Industrial or CMT ) .2 . The kerf of the blade is thinner than full , so it will flex some and there is no room for a stiffener on the DeWalt miter box due to the short arbor . I used a caliper to measure my DW3128 and the teeth are .096 '' wide and the blades body is .074 '' . This is in contrast with a real full kerf blade with 1/8 '' wide teeth and a body that is ~.088 '' .3 . I 'm not sure why , probably to save on cost , but DeWalt does n't appear to finely grind the sides of the carbide teeth compared to other more expensive blades.4 . You really can and will notice a difference between these and a good quality Freud industrial blade . After only installing 1000 SQFT of oak flooring , my blade is crap.5 . The technology of these blades are very poor , there is minimal vibration dampening using only an old technology of slots versus the wiggly cut lines a good blade has.6 . My miters were never perfectly tight until I ditched this blade and bought the one linked below . Yes , the blade does cut OK miters that are plenty good for a normal person , but if you want the most professional looking cuts , do n't skimp on the blade ! I recommend the Freud LU80R012 blade if you are doing finish work and want professional results ( and a blade that has much more carbide , e.g . can be sharpened many more times ) . I did a lot of research and finally decided on the Freud LU80R012 blade as it can cut Melamine and plywood very well , but still has Freud 's best rating for cross cuts . The hook angle is also smaller than the Freud LU85R012 and the kerf slightly larger , so it 's much better for use in a miter box.I 'm no longer sure one needs a thinner kerf blade for a miter box due to it only doing cross cuts . That 's why I 'm recommending the full kerf LU85R012 . My DeWalt sliding miter box with the full kerf blade seems plenty powerful.Here 's what I 'm replaced this blade with : Freud LU80R012 Ultimate Plywood & Melamine Saw Blade 12 inch x 96t Hi-ATB 1 inch arbor Perma-Shield CoatedIf you are in doubt about the quality difference and my review , just zoom in the pictures ! I 'll admit I 'm a tool junkie . I did receive this DeWalt pack as a gift , but lets just hope the person who gave it to me never reads this review and how the blade is n't even worth resharpening ! ; )	-1
Both of these blades became very dull very quickly . IMHO , the metal is poor quality and these should be avoided .	-1
With a blastgate at each machine , you can control the air flow from the DC unit as if you only had one machine hooked up , providing the most efficient use of the air suction . By opening and closing each blastgate , as needed , you will get the maximum amount of air flow at all times.For a more & quot ; durable & quot ; blastgate , there is a metal version available at a premium . But I have found the plastic gates run into problems with use . They jam with debris and can not be taken apart to clean . The spot welds , which hold them together , will lossen with use , then the sliding gate , which is a friction function , will not operate properly . The metal gate uses a screw to kept the gate open.Overall , it is a needed product that allows for maximum use of a dust collection system , with a blastgate installed at each branch to control the air flow to the machine in use . BUT , do not invest in the plastic version , go with the metal blastgate .	-1
If someone can explain to me what the tapered design of the inlet and outlets are for , I 'll upgrade the review to 5 stars minus 2 for the overbloated price.I ca n't imagine what the design of a taper is for . The Y-Connectors and Splices do not have a taper . Why do the blastgates do ? The problem is that the natural springness of the hose keeps it coming off the tapered outlets just as you 're trying to tighten the clamps . This is frustrating to just a wee degree since the problem should n't exist at all . In addition , the price is just a tad expensive for a piece of plastic.Look elsewhere if you can find a better design , or a better price . Otherwise , once you have them on , they work as expected .	-1
I would not buy these . They jam with dust . These do not come apart for cleanout . These will only work in a dust free shop . ( A shop that is not used . ) I recommend the metal gate at the same price . The metal gate is sturdy and solid .	-1
Jet JW1007 4-Inch Blast GateThese Woodstock International blast gates are identical to the ones I began using over 20 years ago . This same blast gate is sold by countless vendors ; Jet is just one of many.They are inexpensive and work acceptably , although they leak a little air when closed.They have three parts , the two halves ( glued together ) with the movable gate in the middle . The two halves on all of my Woodstock gates eventually came unglued . Some lasted a couple of years , and one lasted at least a decade before separating . Rather than replace them , I repaired each gate using pop-rivets or 8-32 machine screws & nuts to hold the halves together . Except for this issue , none of my plastic blast gates ever `` broke '' .The gate 's ABS plastic body is smooth and each male side is slightly tapered . Because of that taper , a clamped-on air hose tends to slip off , unless screws or other methods are used , to keep it attached . See Customer Images . It would have made sense to taper maybe the first 1/4 '' so it slides into a duct or hose , but tapering the entire male fitting end was not a great idea.I have a blast gate for the table saw , sliding compound miter saw , planer , sander , band saw , jointer , and drill press . Unlike other reviewers though , none of my Woodstock blast gate has EVER filled up with dust or debris to the point that it stopped working or needed cleaning . Perhaps that 's because the dust collector is a 3-hp 1800 cubic feet minute unit ; and the air moves so fast , it does n't have a chance to clog a blast gate ? Also , the grooves in a blast gate are more likely to clog if the gate handle faces down.I rate them at two stars , since a customer should n't have to repair a product to keep it working , and the tapered male ends allow hoses to slip off .	-1
I could not get the hose to fit over any other manufacturer 's 4 '' fittings . I had to split it and then tape it closed . I have a system going from 6 '' mains , mostly 5 '' drops ; just a few 4 '' connections off a wye at the bandsaw and router table . Everything else worked well together except this hose .	-1
These are the same product and quality that you can buy from various sources , but these are 1/3 again as much ! ! No matter whos ' you buy expect to have to use some silicon to seal them up or they will leak mercilessly.I hope this helps and , Good Luck with your own dreams !	-1
LIKE ANY `` OLD-SCHOOL , '' TESTOSTERONE-DRIVEN , ALPHA-MALE WHO IDENTIFIES WITH CHARACTERS LIKE `` TIM , 'THE TOOL-MAN , ' TAYLOR ( TOOL-TIME ) , I JUST HAD TO HAVE THESE `` RUGGED '' BLAST-GATES IN MY DUST-COLLECTION SYSTEM ... .

I expected the wire clamps to be a better alternative to the steel-band hose clamps since the wires can wrap the grooves of the hose . The problem with these is that one wire crosses a hose rib instead of seating in the groove all the way around , which means you really have to apply torque to get a firm seating . The phillips screw head on these is worthless on that score and you really need a ratchet for the torque ( which the screw head accommodates ) . Several times I thought I had a firm install and only to have the hose plop right off . Also youre not careful you can dislodge the little washer that is part of the screw design.I 've gotten excellent results with the steel-band hose clamps . The ratchet design appears to be superior and one can apply the torque to get a really firm seal . I have not tried the JET version of these clamps , instead from a home supply store .	-1
It 's noisy , but it works OK in a tight space , like my condo in Cambridge . The fence sticks and it 's impossible to get straight , and then it moves and the tiles bind . I yanked it off and in the process I broke one end ( it 's poly something or other and thinly made so it was easy ) I went to MK looking for parts and they provide a list of distributors . .. $ 12.00 for the fence ( OK ) $ 14.00 for the shipping ( thanks a pant load ) . What I 'm gon na do is bend a piece of steel to go around and catch the groove that runs along the back . It 's not worth it to me to buy another saw . You could also draw a line on the tile and cut by eye but that 's a nuisance if you have a lot of similar cuts .	-1
EXTREMELY loud , overpriced . Definitely not worth the money IMO . I ordered it in an attempt to avoid setting up my large MK for smaller jobs where I only need to cut a few tiles . My current MK is a large wet saw that weighs 121lbs.. It 's a great saw but the weight and the ten gallons of water required to get it up and running is a bit much for small jobs . I 'll keep looking . Just because it has MK on it does n't make it any better than the junk ones they sell at home stores . In fact , the home store brands are better in my experience . I would NOT recommend this saw to anyone . It is a piece of junk .	-1
This saw is good for very rough cutting . It actually tears the wood when cutting . This saw is too rough for me so I wo n't be using it much . It would be good for cutting up old pallets for firewood when going camping .	-1
Used this for a while . Handy if it 's all you have available but using my old Stanley flatbar works just as well . Great concept with the nail holder , just does n't work very well .	-1
I just got off the phone with Jet . I have 2 of these machines and the spindles both got stuck in each of them . This is not from user error . As the machine runs , it naturally continues to tighten the spindle . I am not able to loosen it up at all . Jet told me to use brute force and & # 34 ; try harder & # 34 ; . I 've had the machines for less than 6 months . They are used in a professional woodworking shop by professional woodworkers . Jet needs to fix their design and come up with a better fix for the current machines . They also use a low grade of steel on the threads from what I have seen . I 'm sure the rest of the machine I can not see is also low grade garbage . I have a Jet table saw that I am happy with as well as their drill press ( one belt started to shred after 10 hours of use ) and belt sander ( everything good so far ) . For whatever reason ( money ) , they completely messed up this machine . Grizzly has the same problem with their spindle sander machine ( not a great company to be compared to ) .	-1
The machine seems to work fine but the top began rusting within days . This is inside my home with heat at 70 degrees . not like it was out in a cold damp shop . very disappointed .	-1
I give this item a single star , as I never had a chance to try it . The sander appears to be a well made and heavy ( for a bench top tool ) machine , however , the packaging falls far short . The sander , when it arrived , had the base damaged . There is sufficient styrofoam packing around the sides of the machine , but the top and bottom have about 1/2 '' thickness of foam protection . In shipment , the box had been dropped and the base is deformed to the extent it does not sit flat.The sander will be returned and I will not risk delivery of another Jet sander.As an aside , if anyone considers the purchase of this tool , be advised that with the height of the basic machine , if your bench is , say 30 inches from the floor , then the cast iron table of the sander will be about 52 '' from the floor ! You may need to make a special base cabinet to get the table at a more workable height .	-1
before you buy this or any dewalt miter saw with a turning knob for the lock , go to a tool store , loosen the knob , set the saw to any angle that does n't have a preset , turn the knob to lock in the angle and watch the front of the table rise . if you are cutting for framing it 's no big deal , if you 're doing crown , it is . you will find this problem only gets worse the more you use it . get a makita or hitachi .	-1
I was kind of upset with this product . It was very easy to install , BUUUT it makes a super loud grinding noise like the gears are bad . It works fine but every time I use it I 'm scared its just going to fly apart . Maybe I just got a defective one but if I did n't this product needs to be rethought out .	-1
I do n't care much for this holster . I have two different Dewalt drills and they both wedge in the holster when they tilt forward . It makes it very hard to pull the drill out . I spend a lot of time trying to adjust the holster so it will release my drills ! Before you buy this look at theDEWALT DG5120 Heavy-duty Drill Holster . It fits the drill MUCH better .	-1
. , ..P > Beautiful saw , until you run your first piece of wood acrossthe table which becomes scratched and marred imediately.The body is what I would expect from the cheapest tools aroundnot the most expensive . The suspension is absolute garbage , You have plastic gears that raise and lower the saw and the factory recomends keeping them packed with grease wich we allknow will become a saw dust magnet . After cutting one piece of wood they were caked in sawdust which I would assume willeventually cause binding . The subframe is garbage too.I am very disapointed to see such poor quality and craftsmanshipfrom a noteworthy company.On the other hand the motor is strong and the fence is accuratebut so what , The motor and fence wo n't do me any good if the blade wo n't raise or the body has cracked . I should have gone with the Dewalt evan though it 's motor does not compare it'snot loaded with fatal design flaws.If this saw holds up I 'll be shocked ... more later ... ... .	-1
I love add-ons such as this , ones that add function.. But the value on this one is just not here ... Unless you have a router that you absolutely dont want to give up , if i did it again , id put the money to a router with above table adjustment.It will get the job done but ... eh ... I bought this for quite less than full price , but still find it unworthy . ( And it does fit the Ridgid R2930 just fine , still i use the built in above table adjustment on it . )	-1
After purchasing this item , reading the instructions completely and understanding them I decided I didnt want to screw up my router with drilling it out etc . I bought a Woodpeck lift instead and sold the Raizer on ebay .	-1
The product came in a plain cardboard box with no indication anywhere who the manufacturer is even though the Amazon website says B & C Eagle . The box did have a prominent warning on the outside stating that the unnamed manufacturer would not warranty the galavanize coating against deterioration for any period of time.The nails themselves seemed to have a very thin zinc coating and were not aligned especially well in the strip . ( they were n't all parallel to each other ) I did n't use any so I ca n't say if the misalignment would have caused any jams but I 'd rather see better quality control.I recommend that you do n't use this product for any serious outdoor structural project that will need to be inspected , especially ACQ treated lumber . Your inspector may want to know that you used quality fasteners . You could find yourself tearing them out and starting over with nails from a known reputable manufacturer.Keep 'em if you 're making a dog house or fence , but do n't risk it for anything important . I sent mine back .	-1
The instructions were not only of no help they gave dangerously misleading information . The nail adapter supplied had an oval bored nail holder that did n't fit the nails I wanted to use . I was unable to remove it after applying considerable force . Not really sure how to either . No information on the company site or the 'net . There is a leather thingy that looks like a support garment for a miniature dairy cow no way it would fit . Returned it . Too bad as it looked like just what I need .	-1
I could n't believe the guy who is using these for 3/4 plywood . Theye do n't have that kind of power and burn easily unless you do ten passes . Not impressed at all , though I guess if I did dollhouseas I might find them useful .	-1
Used it on large boards thinking it would work however it dulled and the sharpness faded . Only works on thinner wood boards and for a short amount of time . After that it dulls.. Hard to stabilize when cutting large boards and small boards because you have to make a jig . Be careful when using .	-1
Excellent idea , I 'm dissapointed of Dremel.I use the smallest router bit for a 15 inches long piece of wood , the idea was to insert a small piece of thin triplay ( 3mm ) and the drill get burn and broke it . I had to finish the work with the carbure bit , so the router bits are kind of cheap things .	-1
I bought this kit to use with my Dremel 4000 . I restore old Kodak folding cameras and had grown tired of hand cleaning and polishing the metal.But I found this to be Worthless ! If you screw a Polishing Wheel or Tip onto the Mandrel , it only takes a minute or two before the tip stops spinning with the Mandrel ( just strips out inside the tip or wheel ) . I only use moderate pressure ... you have to in order to accomplish the task.Not sure if others are having the same issues ?	-1
I bought this kit hoping to use the larger felt pads to polish out scratches in glass using cerium oxide . My intent was to use the felt pads like a rotating buffer , i.e . use the full surface of the pad perpendicular to the tool . Unfortunately , the felt pads included in the kit mount onto a threaded metal shaft with a sharp tip . When the felt pad installed , the metal tip points through the felt . I tried epoxying two of the felt pads together , but that only lasted a few minutes . If i had n't ruined two pads with epoxy , I would 've sent it back . I 'm sure I 'll find a use for the tools eventually .	-1
I used this just one day . I then let it sit for one year and it simply does not work any more . This is my second let down with Hitachi tools ... never again will I buy anything from Hitachi . It is not just American companies that are selling junk made in China ; Hitachi is too . I am left with very few brands to select from which have not disappointed me with junk tools . Good bye , Hitachi .	-1
These saws cut terribly straight out of the box ... Using them to cut metal ( using cutting oil of course ) they last only about 20 notches/cuts ... . I get roughly 5-10 times more cuts from other brand hole saws in my shop . I decided since I use and like so many other dewalt tools in my shop I 'd give these a try but I 'll never be buying them again after the first 2 I ordered to test out.The kerf width the teeth chip away is far too narrow and leaves the saw to bind up in the cut , and this issue also causes excessive heat leading to terrible cut life and a slow , bogged down cut .	-1
I bought this ( and its accompanying mandrel ) to make a series of holes in 12guage steel sheet metal ( part of a sculpture ) .It is practically useless for even modestly thick metal . 20 minutes of coaxing made little impression in the steel . I tried the bit in a drill press next - same poor result . Perhaps the hole saw that I got was defective ( the teeth looked pretty timid ) or maybebi-metal bits are a tame bunch . One star is charitable	-1
Good thing I bought this to cut a few holes in drywall for recessed cans , planning to throw it out afterwards - it 's not round , but rather , *oval* in shape . The weld joint flares out from the body , causing a nasty condition . Clearly , DeWalt 's Chinese supplier has some serious quality-control issues . I 'd have been seriously screwed if I needed to make accurate holes . I 'll stick with Lennox in future .	-1
Used it on a standard ceiling to install a 4 '' round electrical box.when I got to the third one , it failed as it lost all of its teeth . we are talking drywall here ! returning this !	-1
This lantern just does n't put out enough light . I get more with your basic everyday flashlight.Unfortunately , it might put out more , but one of the & # 34 ; bulbs & # 34 ; failed after less than an hour of use . I 'd look elsewhere next time .	-1
The light has 8 D batteries on the bottom , which are heavy , held into place by a lid that has very flimsy plastic . Although the lid is held on by a long screw , the design of the lid makes it hard to put the lid back on , and the lid is not sufficient for the weight . While the upper light portion looks decently built , the battery compartment on bottom looks like it was built in a third word county . I suspect that 's where this light has a lot of problems.Our Rayovac light failed during an emergency straight out of the package . Thankfully , we had backup emergency lights .	-1
I am not sure if it is just me but out of the box , I found that at best after 3 or so feet into the cut with the help of a fence consisted of a spare sheet material to guide the base alongside , the saw likes to get stuck , deviates from the straight line , and pretty much messes up the perfect straight line cut . the line deviates from 1/8 to no more than 3/16ths from the line.Material I have used this saw on is 3/4 MDF and plywood . Both have the same results . This is with the stock blade that is included.It seems the blade gets loose over the course of the cut adding to the way it gets off course . I am starting to readjust my methods and using this saw for a purely sloppy ( and slow ) cut and using the same sheet fence on the piece , adjusting that for my VERY RELIABLE TRITON ROUTER to finish the edge.This is probably the first time I truly regret a purchased tool . The official milwalkee edge guide ( sold separately ) for the saw is n't worth anything in my book . I thought I ca n't go wrong with the Milwalkee brand .	-1
This product works as stated for a short time , but after a few hours of steady use , it becomes desensitized and will not respond as it did on previous occasions . The sensitivity screw setting is also MADDENING when it as the hours go on ! It is NOT an investment at all in a wood shop , especially if you are in reclamations of antique lumber and trying to protect expensive machinery . Just another $ 70 extracted from the pockets of busy consumers.Forget it ! The only reason why I gave it one star is because it does detect aluminum when it IS working , whereas most beach-comber type detectors don't.Even fresh batteries do n't effect it when it is having fits of desensitization.Where can I get a Secret Service style detection device ?	-1
I have a Lumber wizard I got a while back - it worked for a while but now it does n't work , and having paid $ 100 for it I tried to get it fixed ... You can search all day and night on the internet , call the numbers on the instructions , the company that makes this is now hiding behind some internet distribution outfit that wo n't return e-mails or phone calls requesting info on how to get it fixed.Forget it , no after purchase service at all . Very disappointing $ 100 piece of junk I now own .	-1
Do n't buy this item . I tried 2 Lumber Wizard Metal Detectors and neither one worked . The first just gave a constant beeping sound . I returned that one and received another from Amazon . The second metal detector could be adjusted to work , but the sensitivity kept changing . It would beep constantly , then not beep at all when held near metal . In other words , it would work sporadically . Also , when not in use , it completely drained my battery over an 8 hour period.In short , I was zero for two and can not recommend the Lumber Wizard Metal Detector .	-1
1st ) I left a detailed reply with amazon before ; however , you chose not to post it . In short , do not purchase this metal detector since it is unable to scan deeply into a piece of wood and it 's inconsistant ( device works when it wants to ) .-Scott	-1
I tried using this on reclaimed 1 '' thick oak boards and found that the only nails this unit alerted on were the ones I could already see with my own eyes . The blade on my table saw proved to be a lot more effective in locating the nails I could n't see . Save your money and put it toward a much more sensitive unit like a Garrett .	-1
Tested it out on an 8 ' long old birch-top workbench . Unit found the screws holding 3/4 '' top to the frame . It also found most of the visible nails that had been pounded into the top over the years . The key word is `` most '' . It could not find a finishing nail embedded in the top corner of the front edge of the top . I could see the nail with the naked eye but this unit did n't know it was there ! ! I was going to return it but figured for $ 20 I 'd keep it and use it to at least find bigger metallic objects .	-1
I 've had this gun for a little over a year and it is a dog . It worked great the first time out but it has malfunctioned in some capacity ever since then . I 've shot less than 300 nails with the gun and the first problem I noticed was the exaust leak . Since the second time I used the tool , it has had an exaust leak . I 've broken the gun down , checked all of the seals , cleaned everything and the problem temporarily goes away but it always comes back . The more recent problem I 've had is the gun stops firing . I have not figured it out but it seems the air releases but the hammer does not . When it happens , I 'll repeatedly bump a scrap piece of lumber until it starts nailing again.I 've maintained the gun well ... oiled it as instructed and really like the weight , balance and the belt hook . It just does not function consistently . I 've since ordered a Senco FP41xp and I 'm hoping it performs much better .	-1
Boy this thing looks and feels great . Just wish it worked . Retired the PC angle nailer for this one , because the PC weighed as much as my car . The PC also makes a huge hole with each nail . This DeWalt though has major problems each time I use it . I now give up . It NEVER sinks nails all the way , despite the depth adjustment . It double fires more than my bostitch N80 coil nailer , which is known for double firing . It is difficult to load , and the trigger safety moves to the on position if you just breath on it . All in all , a useless , expensive tool . Dewalt makes some glorious tools , but this one just plain stinks . If history is a guide , they will get it right eventually , but only when people stop buying it , or complain enough . Basically , it does not do what it is supposed to do . A MAJOR disappointment , as I love all my other dewalt tools . If people think this is how these things are supposed to work , then they should try other types of these units.Time for the Bostitch N62 or Senco . I 've had it ... ..	-1
Wow ! What a rip offIm a woodworker/installer i use 18 gauge brad nailers quite a bit.Installing trimwork such as crown moulding etc etcI had `` one '' 18 gauge brad nailer for 7 years a hitachi heavy bad boy man i have installed miles and miles of trim with that bad boy has been kicked around dropped etc etc7 years ! ! ! So ... .finally it ate s*** must have hit a metal stud not uncommon have done this many many times.Searching for a replacement i opted for this dewalt.i always figure you get what you pay for ( its not cheap ) boy was i wrong.this bread nailer ( might not break nailing bread together.if you can..lol ) lasted `` ONE '' jobsite.installing 6 '' solid mahogany crown.Really ? This $ for 300 lineal feet of crown ? Now i past the return date so i cant even return..STAY AWAY FELLAS ! i seen the cheaper 50 $ hitachis those can also take a beaten.Im not a hitachi spokesman but im actually impressedby hitachi.rumors in my industry was that sencos where the best brad nailers.Jeez i domt even know who to rely on .	-1
Bought from amazon for installing interior molding . I have shot maybe 300 nails . 3 Jams . At least one was due to hitting another nail . So it works . I do n't know if it works better then a nail gun half its price.Watch the amazon price it floats above and below the box stores.Update . This thing jams like crazy now . Oiled it every time I used it . Which was like for 10 small jobs .	-1
This compressor could be so good . It 's got good capacity , very compact design , a well-placed carrying handle , the Emglo reputation , the DeWalt service to back it up . But ! The first one I ordered from amazon came with a crushed air intake filter . But we all know UPS 's propensity to destroy everything that comes their way . Since I live near a DeWalt service center , I drove over and they gave me a replacement filter free of charge . Tried to install it and & lt ; * ? ^ $ ! ! ? > It would just barely fit between the pressure regulator housing and the motor that it screws into . Hmm . Maybe I just got a bad unit . Thanks to amazon 's excellent return policy , they had UPS at my house the following day to pick up the compressor and _the_next_day_ a replacement showed up . Opened the box , same problem . If it would n't have been damaged in transit with UPS , it surely would have happened the first time I hit a good pothole on my way to some job with it in the trunk . Amazon chose not to try a third time and issued a refund . ( Which I used on a Makita model - heavier , but quiet ! and runs like a champ , see my review . ) Chalk this up to bad design , yet I 'm giving it two stars simply because such a good percentage of reviewers have had good experiences with this unit , maybe it was an older design that has been updated to save production costs , but > ! ** $ ? & lt ; created a compressor too big for its own britches .	-1
The 3 , gear ranges are hard to lock into , the batterys only last a few months and cost over $ 78.00 each to replace . Tool is very heavy . Has no belt clip . Hammer drill is slow drilling .	-1
Did n't even open the box . It was clearly labeled , `` For one time use ONLY . '' With children in my son 's house , we were afraid to use this . If they tried a practice test , is that the one time ? Unfortunarly , we returned it .	-1
I purchased this drill at Amazon to replace a 10-year old well-used & abused Sears drill that went up in smoke . I was told by my FIL ( contractor ) to get the Milwaukee since `` they 're the best '' . I 've used it only 3 or 4 times now and it spits out oil ( from the motor vent ) . I guess it 's only a matter of time before all the supposedly sealed oil leaks out & burns out the motor . Would NEVER purchase another Milwaukee product . I really thought this to be the last drill I 'd ever need but now expect it to start smoking in a few more uses . Perhaps I got their only lemon but this tool was way too expensive to take another chance . Back to Sears for me cause on-sale I can get a corded 1/2 '' drill for & lt ; $ 100 . I should 've sent it back to Amazon after the first use but it 's been too long so I 'm stuck with this POS . Also hate that keyless chuck .	-1
Carpenter for 35 years and have owned several circular saws . The brake occasionally works , the shoe is not parallel to the blade and the tilt lock , while good in theory , is in practice never used . That last complaint is not really valid but I never think or need to change the handle angle . I have a 25 plus year old Super Saw Cat that to this day slams to a stop the moment the trigger is released . Were the blade guard not partly missing I would still be using this saw daily . This is my second Milwaukee Tilt-Loc and I have now bought a Dewalt that I really like . But like the tool it replaced the brake rarely works without a second trigger pull . This problem is also true of my Dewalt chop box . The old Black and Decker Super Saw Cat always stop on a dime why not the newer equipment ?	-1
Not sure if the quality of these blades is offset by the cost . On a per unit basis they are fairly costly for the amount of use you get out of one . Additionally , due to the the high speed of the tool , they are horrible went they encounter metal . They tend to harden the metal and end up destroying the blade . They cut dry wall well and wood okay . They provide a precision that is not available in the other tools , but that is a function of the tool and not the blade .	-1
The multimaster is the tool for plunge cuts . But the blades are way too expensive . If I can buy an excellent utility 7 inch carbide blade from Freud for $ 9 , and a durable sawzall blades for $ 3 , why must a Fein blade cost $ 19 ? Teeth sheer off on nails .	-1
The Fein multimaster is a great tool for specialty cutting jobs , provided only cutting soft materials and limited use . I have had the same experience as other users . The tool operates much like ( and could be substituted for ) a Stryker surgical cast saw . However , the steel blades are expensive for their limited life . The carbide and diamond blades are better.This Fein tool has enabled a few jobs not possible with other tools , or saved considerable labor for some jobs ( as opposed to the usual methods ) .But do n't expect it to be a workhorse because of the limited life and special cut design of the steel blades . I have done limited blade sharpening touch-up using brasselerusa.com serrated diamond saw blades , but this is specialized/expensive equipment most tool users do n't have . Sharpening would require very specialized sharpening equipment which apparently only Fein has at their factory . It is so sad that they do not offer blades make from more durable materials .	-1
As with all the `` multi Master '' blades this one is too expensive and dulls too fast . With all the `` knock offs '' out there I 'm hopping that someone will soon make a cheaper group of blades that fit and are fairly priced .	-1
The good : the saw goes 'round and 'round like any other saw . The Makita blade they send along cuts very smoothly.The bad : once you drop this delicate piece of 'construction ' equipment you might as well cut the cord , remove the blade and give it to your 6yo for a play toy . The base bends -- making it impossible to make a square cut or use the rip guide . The track guides one uses to set the depth bends & twists and makes raising/lowering the blade depth nearly impossible ; the bevel angle gets knocked out of plumb ( this is from a 30 '' drop onto soft grass ! ) Let 's face it , people drop saws ! And one minor drop should n't render this saw useless ( for all practical purposes ) ; but it does ... Also , it 's not balanced very well and the mitre settings are difficult to read.Next time ? I 'm buying the ( much cheaper but more 'manly ' ) Hitachi . ( forget Dewalt ; they 're crap , too )	-1
The most positive thing that I can say about this product is that the dust port works well.I bought this fence , several years ago , as part of a bench top router table . The table was a piece of junk that was too thin to stay flat , but that is not what this review is about.The fence had me perplexed , I could n't get consistent results when using it . I retired this year and I decided that I would spend the time to figure out what was going on.The first thing that I noticed is that the particle board fence wings were too flexible . The pressure of a feather board was causing them to flex enough that the board being worked on did not stay in contact with the out-feed fence wing . That is n't much of a problem . If I ca n't make a couple of oak or ash faces for the fence , I need practice with my router anyway . They would have done better to leave them out of the package rather than give the customer something that is disfunctional.The second problem is more serious . With the particle board removed , I found that the two metal plates they attach to are not co-planar ( these were seriously tilted with respect to each other ) . Now , if these reference surfaces are n't in the same plane , the out-feed fence will never properly support work coming off the in-feed fence . After some time spent at the belt sander I had them to a point where I feel that I can shim them and using a doubled mount ( second fence mounted to shimmed first fence ) , get by with it the way it is.Considering the amount of time and effort I have put into making this product work acceptably , I could have built one from scratch and had much better satisfaction.I bought this fence because I loved the concept . The micro adjustment in both directions ( in or out ) reduces trial and error to trial and adjustment . It has the potential to better than halve setup time . The implementation , however , is so bad that I am being generous in saying that I only dislike the product . I think of Freud as a competent company that makes some excellent products , and perhaps Freud has increased the quality of this product over the years , but the one I got is so bad that I really have to ask , Was this really made by Freud ?	-1
I 'm surprised that so many reviewers think this is a good accessory . It 's absolutely necessary , and every Delta planer owner needs one ... . but it 's a poor design . Boards hit it on the outfeed . You also ca n't lower the head all the way if you need to plane really thin stock - instrument makers beware ! The other problem is that a standard 4 '' slip fit connector does n't stay on well . This is only a problem if you move your dust collector hose from machine to machine . But , a lot of folks do that , and it 's just absurd that this chute is n't correctly sized to fit well.Finally , it 's annoying that the dust chute is n't included with the machine . It 's not really optional - you have to extract the chips from a planer , or the machine 's rollers press the chips into the nicely planed surface of the wood.I like the planer pretty well , and this thing is necessary.. but poorly executed .	-1
I have purchased 6 of these units over the last 20 years . They seemed to last and last until the final two I purchased last year . The armatures went out with in a year on both of them . The quality of the winding must be way cheapened from the old ones that have kept going with a simple brush replacement . I will be looking at other brands for my next purchase .	-1
The tool itself is quite powerless although I am not sure it is due to the weak battery . When I used it to cut acopper pipe or one ( I really mean one ) 2x4 is ok . The worst is the Ni-Cad battery . On a full charge , its runs about 5 minutes and then the battery runs down and heats up to the point that it needs to cool down for 10-20 minutes before it can be recharged . As such , the tool is useless . More then once , I gave up and finish the job with a hand saw . They offer a Lithium ion battery/charger upgrade for $ 200 ! So , the message from Milwaukee I get is thus , spend over $ 200 for the hatchet kit and if you really want it to work , double the money . This is a upsetting .	-1
Save yourself time n money ... ..only buy milwaukee with 19/28 v Li Ions . The nicads are expensive JUNK read al the reviews on them ... ... ... ..	-1
First , this is a very comfortable hammer ( grip , balance , and easy on the elbow ) . The comfort comes at the expensive of keeping the vibration in the hammer.After every strike , the hammer continues to ring for a few seconds . I thought I had a 5 star hammer until I helped a friend build a shed . My elbow felt great , but the continuous ringing for 2 days was enough to drive me insane ! Even my friend was affected by the ringing while working several feet away.He had the 20-ounce Antivibe and it does not experience any ringing . I headed to Lowes to buy a new hammer and tested these two models in the store . I sampled several of the Antivie hammers on the shelf and the 16oz/20oz ringing/not ringing held true.If you can handle the extra weight , the 20oz Antivibe is a great hammer . It dampens the vibrations in a split-second . If you need a 16oz , I 'd continue to look elsewhere if you need to drive more than a dozen nails per project .	-1
Chinese junk with a Stanley sticker ! Poor casting and the grip does n't align with the head . A $ 2 hammer at a premium price .	-1
If a contractor showed up with this , I 'd kick him out in a heartbeat ! First off , it does n't cut true ( the 90 degrees setting is n't a true 90 , the 45 is n't really 45 and so on ) . It has presets for 6 angles ( 90 , 75 , 67.5 , 60 , 54 & 45 ) and you ca n't set it to any other angle . There are so many plastic parts that the blade wo n't hold stable enough to cut a straight line and would probably break or wear out in less time than it takes to cut the baseboard for just one room ( I gave up using it after 3 cuts ) . The dogs to clamp your work come loose in just a few strokes of the saw and are only good for items thicker than 3/8 '' , they might as well not exist . The back stop is only 1-3/4 '' tall meaning that items much taller than that are not properly supported ( not an issue with a power miter , but important with a manual one to get a clean and straight cut ) .Save your money , this is worthless !	-1
I do n't get it . It DOES make a laser dot brighter WHEN you can get the dot on the target , but if you can do that in the first place then why do you need this ? Maybe I 'm not using it for it 's intended purpose : I wanted some help in seeing the dot of my laser rangefinder over moderate distances in bright light , but the description focuses on hanging it from a steel grid and hitting it with a rotary laser ( presumably mounted on a tripod , etc. ) . I suppose that the sweeping beam would be more likely to hit the target at some point in its sweep . But trying to hit it with a handheld rangefinder , when you ca n't see the dot in the first place , is virtually impossible . For this it would help to have a much larger target.Also , the way it 's made , if you hang it on a wall using its hole it will not hang flat , but will be angled out at the bottom by about an inch .	-1
The item I received was 3 '' x5 '' , not 5 '' x9 '' as advertised , and was made of simple pink plastic , not even laser-reflective . As such , it is virtually useless for enhancing laser-reflectivity . I 'd sorta call it a hoax ... I returned it .	-1
Ok , so i liked th way the clamp worked , but the fact that broke one might be justification to bring the rating down a little . i am not one to think a product is junk , just because i get a dud . So it works really well , and i did n't brak both of tem . i may have had a defective part , as casted parts can have internal voids that could be hard to see , but make one clamp fail prematurly . So now the warranty comes into question . I was too busy at the time to peruse it , so I ca n't comment on the warranty.I bought two of the 48 '' model clamps and had one snap in a way to make the clamp useless . The part that snapped was inside the clamp side , it was made of a cast metal of some sort . It actually broke into two , plus two small fragments of metal that I found sitting on the ground under it . The clamp was holding Ok , but then I heard a pop , and found that the clamp had given up . I will be curious about the warranty on this clamp . I noticed that the adds here in Tool Crib do n't mention a warranty , so I will have to get in touch with the manufacture to see if there is one .	-1
very robust bar clamps . i bought a few of them last year and am very satisfied with them . they are more robust than the besseys . the only problem could be that their shoes marr the workpiece but i do not mind because i always use thin plywood as step shoes . they are also larger than the besseys . a must .	-1
A word of caution about these clamps . The pads on the jaws of these clamps is made of an oily plastic that makes oily marks on the wood.Cleaning the pads with solvent does n't help and getting the oil off the wood is difficult/impossible.I 've contacted the manufacturer and they are aware of the problem . They recommend going over the oily marks with solvent two or three times . Then , they recommend that you apply wood stain to the project.To read more Amazon reviews about this problem , check the 12 inch version of this same clamp.Even with the problem I 've just described , I have to say that these are strong , well-made , quality clamps ... .if you remove the plastic pads .	-1
Got the two clamps today . Both clamps were visibly bended . They were shipped together with another item ( 48 '' level , painted surface with plastic components ) . None of these items were wrapped ! Even though the box is full of packing paper but the packer seems not bother to use it to wrap any of the items . They collide with each other at one side of the packing box ; unbelievable .	-1
After having these clamps for several years I find that I have replaced them all ( about 15 ) . They sit in a corner . The clamps badly stain wood and it takes a good deal of work to get the stains out . Even placing doubled over shop rags under the clamps leaves stains . It is necessary to use another wood that can be sacrificially stained . I have tried to clean the pads with every solvent I can think of . The stains simply come back . I simply got tired of having to think about the clamps to be used . Do n't get me wrong - these are stout clamps and if not for the pads ( which I should change out with ones made from another company and may some day ) I would highly recommend them . I have not purchased another Jorgensen clamp since and probably will not again . For me their somewhat better clamping is not worth always having to have something ready to block the stain when I need to throw on another clamp . Obviously others have little problem with them and I am perhaps simply too impatient . In my experience I found that quite a few clamps work well enough and the downside of the Jorgensen is not worth it .	-1
Decided that I would take a chance for the price ( less than 1/3 the cost of a Devilbliss gun ) . Until I actually used the gun to spray water based latex primer ( using the 2mm accessory nozzle ) , I did not see the ( 6 ) ultra tiny jets that clogged up during use . Beware any gun that includes a cleaning brush with the kit , as this one does ; it took about 1/2 hour to disassemble the gun and get it properly cleaned . By comparison , the better quality HVLP guns have no cranky secondary jets and no cleaning brushes . Spend the extra money if you value your time .	-1
This Bosch Router would not function as a dovetail jig router . The base opening is non standard opening.tried for days to purchased the required template bushing adapter . The Bosch adapter is out of stock . the entire country did not have the adapter . Makita , Milwauke , PC , DW , and Hitachi all have the same size template opening and thus utilize the PC bushings for dovetail routing.The 1617 is an odd duck and makes a case for nickle and dime do IT MY WAY . All the named routers do a good job . Be smart , 1617 has fans as it is a fine tool . and consider a router that follows Industry standards . Of course the Pro level DW and Milwaukee and PC are appropriate alternatives to consider.The power switch is not sealed - clogs with sawdust .	-1
I 've used this for 5 years or so . The regular base is great for someone needing a moderate power router - it 's not a high power router for heavy regular use . The plunge router is poorly designed making for continual need to tighten bolts on the handles . The switch has gone out twice on my machine . First time I bought a new one after looking for awhile online . 2nd time I realized that YOU CAN FIX THE SWITCH : pull it out , file the contacts off ( it 's faulty probably because of the wrong metals used in the switch causing sparks and carbon build up on the contacts thus reducing it 's ability to conduct current ) .All in all it 's a pretty faulty product with some strong elements . I 've used a Porter Cable 3+ HP for years professionally and they seemed way more solid than this machine .	-1
Sealed Box - Looked new on outsideScuffed Carry Case - Strange , is Bosch trying to pass off used or refurbed as new ? Router - Deep scratch about an inch long in the metal , many scuffs on the metal , a couple scratches in the plasticPower Cord - several gouges taken out of it with one spot showing copper wireFixed base - one handle loosePlunge base - scuff markPlunge base also had a little wobblie when pushing down , not feeling like a quality tool . Because of the unsafe power wire I did not turn it on to test the motor.I purchased at a big home center . I guess Bosch use to make quality tools but now they are made in Mexico . Really shocked at how bad the quality control of this Bosch tool . I totally changed my oppinion of Bosch , i thought they were suppose to be the best , but now I do n't think so .	-1
For less than the cost of this unit I built a nice solid table with all kinds of features that are either unavailable , expensive or under built in the store bought models . Any router how to book will walk you through it . If you 're truly a woodworker or aspiring to be one & not just a collector of power tools , this is an opportunity to improve your skills & make something worth having that will last a long long time .	-1
Sure enough , after barely using this edge guide the sliding plastic edges of it 's fence broke just from having the tool sit on the backseat of my car with other tools , maybe something rolled on top of the tool but it was't dropped . Now , I have to buy another new complete guide or make or find the delicate edge pieces of my fence.I do have the latest humongous new Bosch plunge router to go with this and that 's been a great tool . I 'll keep searching for the edge guides of fence or make some outta hardwood ... .they 'd be tougher than the plastic ones .	-1
I purchased this for a project that needed a larger router bit . The bit is by Bosch but it was too large in diameter to work with this guide ! Sorry I forgot which bit it was or what the diameter is , but I just needed like 2 or 3 mm more to clear the guide . I did n't see any way to accommodate the bit by adjusting this guide unfortunately . I 'll keep it just because it 's otherwise well made . I had to borrow a friend 's Festool router and guide , which worked great with the Bosch bit and was a lighter assembly .	-1
Very disappointed with Bosch for designing a system of attachments that do n't work together . I purchased a RA1165 base to mount under a RA1181 table . Then purchased a RA1172AT Dust Extraction Hood Kit ... with the intention to mount the dust extractor hood to the base , using the adapter to bring the hose size to 2 1/2 inches . You can attach the dust hood to the base , but the outlet points at an angle towards the FRONT of the router table . It is not possible to attach the VAC020 adapter to the dust hood and angle the hose so it exits the rear . There simply is no clearance . I should have returned the entire system , but decided to try to solve the problem . The 1 1/2 inch port size of the dust hood required the purchase of a POOL vacuum hose that is flexible enough to turn nearly 180 degrees beneath the table and exit the rear . There I used the VAC02020 adapter to attach it to a 2 1/2 inch Y.BTW , here 's is Bosch 's response : `` Thank you for writing . The RA1172AT is for use with the fixed and plunge bases included with the 1617 and 1618 routers . The hood is not designed for use with the RA1165 base . A 2-1/2 '' hose can be connected on the top side of the router table directly to the dust chamber the router bits sits in for dust collection on the router table . `` So Bosch designed an under-table base that does n't support Dust extraction , EVEN THOUGH you can physically attach the dust hood to the base ! If this sounds complicated , it is . And it 's a direct result of poor design by Bosch . The under-table base should be aligned to port to the rear ( like the router fence dust port ) . The under table dust hood should be 2 1/2 inches ( like the fence ) . And there should be ample clearance for a hose to exit.I am going to post this exact review to all my reviews of the various components I purchased .	-1
I really think that if you want serious dust collection from a router , you just have to go Festool . These things are very fiddly and require a lot of patience to set up , and even then do n't really work very well .	-1
I used this with my router combined with thePorter-Cable 4216 Super Jig - Dovetail jig ( 4215 With Mini Template Kit ) . I have to say I was less than impressed . The sawdust output was a bit diminished , but not significantly . Also , the addition of a vacuum hose made the router harder to handle . The hose almost pulled my router off line several times.Perhaps if you had a shop-central vacuum system this would work better . It ended up being more aggravation than it was worth in this application.I still hope to test it out on some other applications , such as edge routing . Maybe I 'll be able to arrange the hose so it pulls less.If I had to buy it again , I 'd probably save my money .	-1
I bought this dust extraction hood kit on sale directly from Amazon after reading another review which stated the kit had been updated to be compatible with the current Bosch fixed/under-table base . I primarily bought the kit for use with the fixed base that I have mounted in my router table . Unfortunately , the kit I received seems to be outdated stock ( the packaging looked really old and had an orange $ 17.09 price sticker on it ) , so the rear-mounted hood does n't fit the current ( as of 2011-2013 ) fixed router base shipping with Bosch routers . The under-table adjustment shaft is in the way and prevents you from mounting the rear hood . I think stores with old stock are shipping it to Amazon and the old stock is being mixed with new stock in Amazon 's warehouse.According to my Bosch router 's user manual , the updated version of this kit has the hose hook-up offset an inch or so right of center , but the one I received had the hose hook-up perfectly centered.The bottom-mounted hood ( for edge routing ) probably would have worked fine , but I did n't bother trying it since I mainly needed the other hood . Fortunately , Amazon is letting me return the kit and has already refunded my money .	-1
This is junk . Cheap plastic parts . Fit is poor and doubtful that they will provide good dust collection . Not recommended	-1
I agree with the guy that 's a little dissapointed in this tool . Although it has nice power , and will cut through wall board , etc . with ease ( what does n't ) , it is very messy . This thing will fill your house with sheetrock dust . I was cutting out a large hole in the ceiling ( for wallboard repair ) , and the whole entire living room was completely filled with dust . I even had goggles on , and the vent on the tool directed the dust directly to my face and dust just managed to get in my eyes.The noise I can deal with ( wear ear plugs ) , but I 'm hesistant to use it for wallboard repair from now on . NOTE : This is the only power cut-out tool I ever used , so I have no reference to compare it to any other of this kind ... I 'm no contractor or anything , but I do a lot of home repair/carpenter/landscape & amp ; metal fabrication work as a side job .	-1
I have used this intermittently and occasionally for the past two years . It has been back to Pasload for repair . It has been adjusted for altitude . ( I live at 7200 ' ) Nothing seems to keep it reliably working . It will fire , and then refuse to do so again even though it seems like it wants to . Battery is charged , new cartridges . Nothing will induce it to reliably fire . The gas cartridge opening is poorly designed and requires much fiddling to get it open and shut . I purchased it in the hopes of not having to go to an air compressor unit . Others seem to have better luck than I have . Pasload keeps you on hold for ever , so they are of little use as a manufacture .	-1
I find this sander a bit hard to use and find myself using my Porter Cable belt sander in most cases instead . To do the job right you should change belts to finer grit often and be very patient to take off only a tiny bit of wood at a time or you burn the wood and the belt . The belts are expensive unless you make your own but that task requires a lot of time . I can change a belt on my Porter Cable in 10-15 seconds . On the Jet it takes me 3-4 minutes . This is very frustrating . It is also difficult to perfectly level the gap between the table bed and the sander roller . And if you do n't do this you will have uneven sanding . I could NEVER succeed in sanding a board wider than 16 inches even though that is the claim ( 16-32 ) . This requires an absolute perfectly even gap between the table and the roller or you will see a `` step '' in the middle of the board . I suppose if I used this sander on a daily basis I would conquer some of these hurdles . If you are only going to use this sander occasionally , stick to you portable belt sander . On the positive side , the motor is powerful enough and well designed . The dust collection is effective ( I use a 4 '' Jet dust collection system ) .	-1
The machine sounds wonderful . It looks so good and sports the `` Jet '' name as well . The problem is that it just does NOT work good in many situations.I have the machine as shown in the description ( as in the photos ) with the extra wide support wings added too.If you have fairly short wood lengths , and it is soft pine wood , it will probably do pretty well for you . However , if you work hard woods the feeder really SUCKS big time . I ruined enough wood attempting to work around the feeder defects that it has become the `` Least Used Tool '' in my shop : not worth the risk.I looked at my 16 inch `` yellow '' planer unit . That has a feeder that works fantasic with all woods : from soft to hard the feeder is positive and as perfect as it can get.So why is the feeder on this Jet so defective ? ? ? If you look at the photos shown in the ad description , you will notice that you have a flat belt of hard sand paper grit for traction to pull the wood through , but there is nothing to keep the pressure stable , consistent , and to prevent slippage like the `` yellow brand '' planer.So , it slips very easily , and even more so on hard woods . If it slips even the slightest , there will be a depression left in the wood , and it may ruin the piece completely . Your only hope is to attempt to apply hand downward pressure on the wood to keep is solidly on the belt , but , even then , the belt will slip a bit from time to time defeating the whole purpose of the auto feed in the first place . Had Jet even installed a downward pressure rubber roller on each side of the drum head to keep it pushing down evenly on the wood to make it not slip , it may have worked ... .. who knows . The cheap `` yellow brand '' had smart enough engineers to realize that this was so and has the rollers on top as well and they are chain driven to ensure a positive clean feed that really works and works well ! Jet did n't make the grade . That is too bad for as expensive of a machine as this is , you would think that they would have made sure that it had a class-act feeder ... .. without it ? it is worthless . Sad.If anyone wants mine , it is almost new , and is about as close to new as it can get ! 1/3 the price of new and it 's yours . I guess you get my point .	-1
I used two different units . They displayed the same characteristics . This router has a few issues:1 . The plunge mechanism is jerky . Requires too much pressure to plunge , I find it difficult to make a controlled plunge with this router . I prefer my Makita even though it is a heavier router for hand held use.2 . The base is cut straight on two sides . This makes the base narrower in the direction that you are pushing when using the edge guide . This makes it easier to tip . You have to pay special attention not to tip it . This is especially an issue when using a longer spiral bit , because the handles are too high . the router is a bit top heavy . Combined with the narrow base , this is not good.3 . If you do n't hook up a vacuum the wood chips stay right around the bit in a wind tunnel created for the vacuum mechanism . You can not even blow the chips with your mouth , as you would with a jig saw for instance , because the wind tunnel effect created is stronger than you can blow away ... You have to stop and take the router off the workpiece and clear the chips . This becomes an issue when you are trying to rout up to or near a line.4 . The debt stop mechanism is prone to slipping . The unnecessary force used due to the jerky plunge mechanism makes this issue worse . After repeated cuts you may find your last cut to be deeper than your first cut . This is pretty annoying . You have to check measurements after each cut just to make sure.On the positive side , I guess it is a lighter router . I would not recommend it .	-1
I purchased this in january of 2003 . It worked well for 4 months of light home use . In April I returned it to the store where purchased , because the sander was & quot ; surging & quot ; in speed . It 's now October , and the new replacement sander is doing the very same thing . This would definitely lead me to believe that there is a manufacturing problem with this model . When it works it works well , but who wants to continue using it , knowing that any minute it will stop working . I 've used a lot of Porter Cable Tools , but this thing is junk . Furthermore , I 've noticed a lot of these for sale as & quot ; Factory & quot ; reconditioned & quot ; . Stay away . If they could n't get it right the first time , why would you believe they can & quot ; recondition & quot ; it . I just purchased a Dewalt instead , and trashed this trash .	-1
There are apparently two different types of these straps being sent . Look at the seventh picture that was uploaded by Jason on 8/14/2013 . The description clearly states 3 '' straps , and all the pictures show 3 '' straps . Look at the proportion of the straps to the peoples arms in the pictures . Some folks seem to be getting the 3 '' straps , I did not . I got the knock-off 1 3/4 '' chinchy straps ... not what is advertised . COME ON AMAZON ! ! ! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ! ! ! These are going back today .	-1
We had ordered these while I was visiting my brother , they worked fairly well and I liked them so I ordered a set for myself . What I received was NOT the same as my brother received . He received three inch wide heavy duty straps , while the set I was sent was about one and a half inch wide straps and NOWHERE as sturdy as the set he was sent . I immediately returned them and noticed that REPLACMENT was NOT an option . I also noted that there are several sellers for this item that also qualify for Prime . The pricing is very close , so who knows who is selling what ? ? ? ? ? ? ? My Prime purchase was from a seller named Beautiful Time.7/31 UPDATE - I re-ordered these with Amazon as the seller , they wo n't be delivered until end of August despite being a Prime item , but I am not in any hurry . I plan on keeping them in the car in case I may need them . For home use I have the original Shoulder Dolly . I will update again after I receive this new order.08/09/13 - UPDATE - I was notified that the second order for these were actually going to be shipped much sooner than anticipated . I just opened the box from my second order of these straps , and this time the seller was supposedly Amazon . I received the cheaper ones again . These straps are only 1.5 inches wide , not the 3 inch wide ones we first received . Amazon needs to update their description of these straps , or otherwise get the correct ones in stock . Since I only wanted these as spares to keep in my car trunk , I am going to keep them - but I am definitely very disappointed .	-1
Just like others , I bought these without reading the reviews . How could a nylon strap be junk , right ? Well it is possible ! These are too short and thin to be useful . I tried to move a dresser and this lifts it just high enough to sit on your thigh so you get to make short choppy steps the whole way . They also do n't provide a lot of vertical support so the dresser felt like it was going to tip the whole time . I too received 2 '' straps like other reviewers . I would n't recommend these at all . Buy lunch for an extra person to help you move instead .	-1
Did n't really help all that much since I needed to go up stairs . Wish I knew about the shoulder dolly first , would have bought that in a heartbeat over this .	-1
This seemed like a great idea , but it just does n't work nearly as well as advertised . I bought them when I was moving a few years ago and had high hopes . I found one piece of furniture that I could move easily with this , but the rest just got moved the old fashioned way .	-1
Echoing numerous other reviewers who point out that this product is falsely advertised and described . Description says straps are 3 inches wide whereas the ones I received are 1 3/4 '' . Amazon must have several suppliers for this item as it is listed several times at various prices . Some suppliers may be supplying the described item but obviously some are not based on the complaints . Amazon has to have known about this problem for years as there are numerous complaints about ( 2009 , '10 , '11 , '12 ) yet Amazon apparently chooses to do nothing about it.I 've noticed that many reviewers who have returned items ordered on Amazon because of problems with the items will complain about the item quality but then go on to compliment Amazon about their `` great '' return policy . I ca n't agree with them . It 's no skin off Amazon 's nose ( or $ out of their pocket ) if they knowingly continue to sell shoddy , dishonestly described merchandise knowing a certain percentage will be returned ( at the customer 's expense ) so they do n't deserve the unjustly earned praise.This reflects a real and disappointing lack of integrity on Amazon 's part . I will notify them of their ongoing dishonesty but doubt that anything will change if numerous previous complaints have had no effect.Les Vliet	-1
I have moved very large items , but when it came time to use these I never really found they made it much easier . Maybe I was using them wrong ? I dont know didnt come with any instructions , but when we tried to move sofa 's , bookshelfs , chest of drawers , these just hurt our forearms and didnt make moving much easier	-1
I have been very disappointed with this product . It was delivered twice by UPS damaged . The factory packaging was very poor . The ladder appears to be a good idea , but it does not meet up to the standards of other Little Giant Products that I have owned . I have always highly rated Little Giant Ladders and prefer to use them over any other product . The first was crushed at the top . The second was bent at the steps reinforcement bars . Amazon.com will not ship a third and refunded my money . If this item is so fragile in shipment , I doubt that it would be durable in everyday use .	-1
The switch on this drill is difficult to operate . Myself and two other guys had problems with it . The drill is either locked on or off . If the bit jambs you can not quickly stop the drill or for any matter it is difficult to stop . This is a problem and will probably burn up the motor when it is jambed and attempts to turn . I guess if Hitachi makes a better switch or even a simple trigger it would be a great drill . I am returning mine tomorrow .	-1
It looks pretty . However , the first time it is dropped , it will badly ding because of the soft aluminum alloy ; especially if it lands on a corner like mine did . I dropped mine off the table saw from less than 30 '' and the ding was so bad I had to file it off in order for the square to function correctly again ! It is still square after the drop . However , since I had to file a chunk of the inside edge , it will not make a good straight edge anymore.You are much better off with the imported machinist 's squares such as those by iGaging . At least these are made from steel ! Sure , using a low grade alloy is great for Incra as it saves on tooling costs , but it is simply too soft to be used in a work environment in my opinion . As much as I say buy American , only do so when the tool can stand up to normal wear and tear .	-1
I am not sure why this is so expensive but I would recommend looking for cheaper options than this unless you are a machinist and not a woodworker.I found cheaper option from glad stone tools , which is equally accurate but way cheaper.Avoid this one unless you want scintific accurary , which is 'Over exacerated ' when it comes to woodworking ! ! .	-1
the gun lasted only a few times before the cheap plastic screw on thing broke . if you do n't use all the glue in a tube the first time you open it , the rest of the glue goes to waste because it hardens after that and takes forever to heat up . then when it finally does it drips out of the end wasting a bunch unless you use the cap which means you got ta screw it on and off every time so you have to wear gloves coz the gun is too hot . The glue holds when you can get the gun to work . the glue is good but the gun is bad . you 'll be sorry you bought ( I think ) . hope this helps . this has been my experience with it . others may have different experiences .	-1
Well over a year ago , I purchased the HiPurformer kit that is overpriced at $ 100 . At the cost of the glue tubes , they should give you the gun . Anyway , I needed some kind of super glue and this seemed like it was it . The glue does work and is excellent for trim where you really ca n't screw or nail or air nail . Problem is , the gun no longer feeds . I read reviews about this before I bought this kit - the feed mechanism breaks and then the whole thing is useless . The guy at the Woodcraft store where I bought my kit said that two had been returned for this problem . Nevertheless , I bought the kit and it worked well and I did n't force the plunger . A year later , it does n't feed . The plunger works okay , nothing looks broken , but the glue does n't flow no matter how long I let it heat up . I sent an email to the company for help but they did n't reply . So , in reality , it cost me about $ 25 per tube rather than the 6 to $ 8 they charge for it . Good idea , poor execution . Go for it if you do n't mind throwing the whole thing away after you use it .	-1
I bought two of these guns for an installation in New York where I had to assemble double thick shelving panels on the site . We used the longest set time ... I think it was 90 seconds , and alternated guns to get enough of the glue down fast enough to have time to adjust the assembly . For this they were indispensable and I would invest in the glue if I had to do it again . That said , they do n't make any sense at all for occasional use . the glue comes with a stamped date and a shelf life of a few months . Once the tube is opened or if it goes beyond it 's date , the glue tends to harden near the spout . You can push a drill bit up into the tube to free it up and sometimes it works , but more often than not you end up throwing the tube out . The guns are so cheaply made that if you need more pressure they just crap out . I just threw out my last cartridge and came looking for more , but at $ 9.00 for one ( should be for 4 ) it 's a ripoff..	-1
got this for a Christmas present . Went threw all the instructions for break in . Did n't use it till March the 5 . Ran for 10 minutes total and quit running for no reason . Called Amazon and said it was over the 30 days . Only a partial return . Called dewalt and tried to find a place close to my home for repair . called and still never got a hold of any one . Got it for mobile use.. No chance of that happening . Really sucks that it did n't run for at least long enough to get our work done . Just setting in the shop now collecting dust . Will never buy this brand again .	-1
We have had three of these units for less than six months . We also have two other CO units that are AC only that we have had for a few years.Just about every week one of these three units beeps very loudly for three or four beeps and then quits . This is very annoying when you are sleeping . It does not continue like it is a real alarm . They are not the soft chirps indicating low batteries . I have replaced all the batteries with new quality batteries instead of the cheap ones that come with the unit . Our regular , more expensive , CO units have never gone off at the same time as these cheap units . Buy the more expensive units.We do not think these are unsafe , just annoying .	-1
I agree with the previous writer . This is NOT a review , but a complaint . I too waited almost 2 months for the thing - Now if you do n't have it , you ca n't ship it - BUT I cancelled my Amazon order and ordered it from Rockler - Got it in 3 days . Jet - get with it and supply your venders . Amazon - if you ca n't get it , take it out of your catalog .	-1
The templates do not center in the router base . That means the router bit is not center . I really love the Bosch router . If I were to do it over I would just order the RA1100 interface . That way I could use the standard Black & Decker style guides in the RA1100 interface .	-1
These guides are cheap 2-piece guides with the `` barrel '' guide swaged into the `` base '' . You would be better off to just buy the PC adaptor from a Bosch Service Center and buy PC templates or a PC guide set . True the BOSCH snaps in but I had one come apart at the swage , the first time I used it , dropping the barrel of the guide into the mortise I was routing , while the bit was spinning . Ruined a $ 32 bit and the guide was ruined . Bosch offered to replace the guide , but I would have had to package it and ship it and wait for who knows how long to recieve the replacement . I just chucked the guides and replaced them with Porter Cable guides . You would be better off to just buy the PC adaptor from the Bosch Service Center and buy a PC template guide set . These guides are cheap , poorly made JUNK.NOTE : If you ever plunge your router into the top of the BOSCH guide ( let the collet nut even touch the guide- and who has n't ) both your guide and your bit will be history , due to the swaged construction . Also , if the swage is loose ( and it will get loose if you use it ) your route will be sloppy and the guide will probably contact the cutting edge of the bit . I say this from experence , not to dog the product . I love the router , hate the guides .	-1
I ordered this template guide set and expect to get working with the Bosch router right away . I was so wrong . None of the template guide will fit in my new Bosch 1617 router base . They all fall straight through . I found out that you need another adapter , RA1126 , before you can use these guide bushings . What the heck . I do n't see that described in any of the product descriptions . I had to go to the Bosch website and search for it . Bosch even made it difficult to purchase because none of its recommended vendors have this in stock.So my project is on hold while the adapter is on backorder . Why does n't Bosch include this quick change adapter to the kit or even in the router ? I buy the tool and have to wait for Bosch to nickle and dime me .	-1
Had this in my pickup for about 3 years and it 's brittle now with cracks the whole length of it . Before it started cracking , the vinyl coating was getting hard and the lock would n't bite but could easily be slipped down and that started within the first year . I still use it because it `` looks locked '' but now i 'm shopping for a replacement . Do n't think they do n't know what sort of plastics they use in items . They do n't want you to have to buy another sooner than later of course .	-1
I am so disappointed with this blade . It cuts rough on my DeWalt saw . Actually , my dull 40 tooth ATB DeWalt blade that I 've been using for a couple of years ( and which this blade was meant to replace ) cuts MUCH smoother . I tried all sorts of wood , with and without riving knife , rip and cross cut . Not at all happy . Too bad I disposed of the packaging before I tried it . It will be a backup to the backup blade .	-1
These are too big and slip off the furniture - they appear to be made of flimsy plastic . I like Magic Sliders , which I have used in the past , much better - they really are like magic and work perfectly on wood floors as well as carpet . The kind that are self stick and stick to the furniture legs are the best - others have to be tacked on which is impossible when you have to get them under a heavy piece of furniture . I could n't tell from the description which kind Amazon was selling so I tried these instead , to my regret . I should have taken the negative reviews more seriously . I will now have to go to a local store and look for Magic Sliders .	-1
We used these at home on clean wood floors , and they scratched the floors terribly . Perhaps they 're fine on carpet , but keep these away from wood floors .	-1
The disks work quite well on carpeting and tile . If your appliance has wheels these are not as valuable , but can still be of benefit on carpeting .	-1
A number of months ago I put some hard black plastic sliders under my sofa so that we could easily slide it over to our small flat panel monitor for `` movie night '' and then slide it back . Well , my wife wanted sliders under the dining room table too , and since the black ones went with the table I put them under the table legs , and then I put these so called `` moving men '' sliders undert the sofa legs to replace the hard black plasic ones I had moved to the dining room table.Surprise ! The sofa does n't slide any more . Not one bit . It seems that the plastic these are made of is way thinner and more flexible than the ones they replaced . These are actually just slightly bigger than the ones they replaced , so I think it 's a fair comparison.Anyway , I 've got to find more of those shiney hard black sliders . These are useless unless under really light furniture I suppose .	-1
I bought this planer from Amazon and was surprised to see the way it arrived in damaged Box.Well , When I opened the box , I could not find the manual / instructional video / wrenches in the box and machine clearly looked like 'Used Before ' . I checked the stores in my area for this planer and they told me that I must get all these items in the box if product is brand new else it is refurbished one being sold as 'New ' . Also I found that front plate clearly out of 90 degrees.I am very disappointed with this and never expected amazon/delta will ship used/refurbished products as 'Brand new'.I have called amazon and waiting see if they offer a replacement . I really wish they will give me replacement ( Brand new planer ) and not the money back as based on reviews , I really would like to have this planer.I will update my review once I hear from Amazon .	-1
This tool is not very useful ; I feel that I largely wasted my money . You have to manually level the tool ( using a tiny bubble level ) every time you want a level line , which means it is no more helpful than a traditional 48 inch framing level made of aluminum . But does n't the laser at least work over longer distances ? Not in practice , because you also need to manually hold it up on the wall while you use it ( unless you want to pin it in place , leaving holes ) , so the line is only good as far as you can reach with your other hand . Real self-leveling , tripod-mounted laser levels are great , but this is not that tool .	-1
I purchased this about a year ago . It works well for putting a line on the floor for a grout line but it has some major disadvantages . For $ 34.95 on sale , you can buy a Craftsman that comes in a nice neopreme case and has a bundle of attachments . Why is it better ? Because if you mount the Irwin laser on the wall , you had better get it right the first time . Once you push those little feet into the drywall , that 's it . You ca n't move it . That 's the way drywall is , you ca n't keep punching holes in the same spot and expect it to stick . Plus the laser only points straight ahead . The Craftsman on the other hand comes with 2 mounting brackets . One for mounting it on a tripod and one for mounting it on a wall . The tripod bracket has adjustable screws so you can fine tune the level of the laser . You can also set this on the ground or a table . Adjust the screws until the laser is level , and you are underway . The best part of the Craftsman is that the laser is magnetically attached to the mounts . So when you mount the drywall bracket on the wall , you then attach the laser via its magnetic base . It 's got enough attraction so it wo n't move on its own , but you can adjust it on the bracket . Thus you can slap the bracket on the wall and fine tune the laser after you put it on the bracket . Plus you can rotate the laser from verticle to horizontal . It 's much more versitile and the laser appears to be much brighter than the Irwin . I gave my Irwin away.Some of the applications that I have used this for are:1 . Laying out floor tile2 . Mounting valences that go from one wall to the next3 . Pictures4 . Canned lighting . That was hanging it upside down from the ceiling . Now that 's some magnets . If it 's on the laser they are straight5 . Cabinets6 . Pestering the catGo buy the Craftsman ! !	-1
Got mine as a gift . I 'm a carpenter by trade . I 've used lasers since they came out . You had to literally bolt them to the wall . Now they are small enough to fit in you hand . The one I have is out 3/4 '' in 8 feet plumb , and twice that in level . Jet line with a line level is more accurate . A plumb bob takes a little while , but is more accurate also . So is a level with a straight edge . The beam is straight and does seem to go over small obstacles in uneven walls or floors . For what it can and ca n't do it still needs to go down in price . It is only good as straight line . I hardly ever use the one I have .	-1
If you 're like me you look at the reviews before buying . I was very excited when I saw this product . For me it meant no more lugging my big rotary laser . Well he 's the deal . The Strait-Line 64001 Laser Level is a great idea , but it lacks greatly . The laser is just to dim to see . You can hardly see the line on a white wall . The laser 's power is just not enough .	-1
The sheath that I got was the second one in the picture , the one with the yellow stitching . I do n't like it that much.First of all , it 's not formed at all . It 's a sheet of nylon stiched to another sheet of nylon . The sheath that came with my Wave is formed , with four sides . The sides of the Wave sheath are elastic , and stretch just enough to hug the tool tightly without being too tight . This sheath , though , only has two . Accordingly , sliding your multi-tool into it is rather difficult . One might argue that such a tight fit is a plus , that your multi-tool wo n't fall out if the top is n't closed . Fair enough , but it 's also much more difficult to get out and put back in.Also , this sheath does not have the little hole at the bottom that my Wave sheath does . This hole is nice because it allows you to reholster your multi-tool while it is opened up . You can be working with the pliers , reholster the tool without closing it back up again , and then get the tool out again . It 's a very nice feature , and one this sheath does not have.This sheath also lacks the little pockets in the back for the extra bits . My Wave sheath has them.Finally , this holster is much larger , about 1/2 an inch longer and almost 1/2 an inch wider than my Wave sheath . Not that big a difference I suppose , but a bit annonying.This sheath does work and does hold my Wave and Skeletool . At the same time , it 's not formed , is bulky , lacks the hole in the bottom , and lacks a pocket for extra bits . If I could order all over again , I 'd spend 23 cents more and get this : Leatherman 934810 Premium Nylon Sheath for Wave . That 's one that came with my Wave .	-1
I gave this product one star only because I could n't select `` zero '' stars . The idea is not a bad idea , just poorly implemented . Despite reading several reviewers ' reports that these clamps easily broke , I ordered them anyway since they looked like a solution to a common problem and I expected that the defect would have been fixed by now . Wrong ! Without actually seeing the clamps , it may be hard to understand how they are made . There is a polycarbonate `` base '' with two `` spring steel `` clamps '' attached via a separate polycarbonate `` lid '' which is screwed on . The lid is not strong enough to hold the clamps leading to stressing ( bending ) of the lid and potential failure . I did not actually use the clamps . One clamp looked `` okay '' in that the polycarbonate lid was not obviously stressed and deformed . The same was not true for the second clamp . I 'm sure it would have failed the first time I used it . So , I returned the clamps to Amazon for credit which they did give . For awhile , I thought about remaking the polycarbonate lid out of something more substantial , thicker , or stronger , like aluminum . The lid is secured to the base via screws so this may have been possible . But , why should I have to do this , especially when I really would have to buy three more sets to use on any four sided box ? At $ 10 per set , maybe I would have done this . But not at $ 25 per set ! The manufacturing fix would have been at least to make the lid thicker . I usually read most of the reviews with a grain of salt and discount some where I think maybe the user was at fault . Here , I was at fault for not listening to other users . Conclusion : Good idea , bad design/manufacturing . It really should have been fixed by now .	-1
item is a nice idea but the base is plastic and cracks the first time I used it . there is a piece of metal under it but i do n't see this item lasting very long in regular use . do n't buy it , save your money .	-1
5 years old and constant false alarms even with brand new expensive lithium battery . Disturbs my neighbors and aggravates me . Why do I need this stress in my life ? My advice is to stick with something simple and reliable , not this expensive high-tech junk .	-1
I read on line that you need to replace your smoke alarms every ten years . My house is close to 75 years old and we are in the middle of a kitchen remodel so I bought these for the entire home.After having them in use for 3 months they started going off in the middle of the night . We replaced all the batteries and 3 months later the same thing ! We gave up and returned them all and bought another brand.We have 5 kids , 3 dogs and one cat , family safety is very important to us .	-1
One of the most satisfying moments of the past year has to have been destroying this insane smoke detector . We 've had it at the top of our basement stairs since early 2008 , and it gradually became a proximity alarm instead of a smoke detector . It never went off unless we opened the basement door , and then it ( sometimes ) blasted full volume into your ear to let you know that you opened a door near it . No other smoke alarms go off , there is no fire , and looking through the pieces of this smoke detector showed zero dust inside . It wo n't be giving us false alarms any longer . While the plastic case is fairly durable , it can not ( thankfully ) survive being hurled full-tilt into a concrete floor 15 feet away.Also , the & # 34 ; set it off with your television remote & # 34 ; feature was n't a very bright idea on the part of First Alert , which is why it had been relegated to the top of the basement stairs .	-1
This product is lousy on many levels . I have obtained many false alarms , some in the middle of the night . I also get a fair share of false alarms by setting it off with my remote , despite the fact that the alarm is in my hallway , AWAY from my remotes in my bedroom ! Lastly , the directions are terrible , with no clear way to install the 9V battery . It took a while to finally get the battery in , after accidentally breaking off a tab . Not user friendly or well layed out at all . I 'm returning this , and getting a 'Kidde ' in hope that it will be a better choice.Update , May 3 , 2008 : I 've had the 'Kidde ' dual-sensor alarm in place for a few weeks , and it has been flawless . NO false alarms , even stationed a few feet outside an upstairs bathroom where the alarm may be exposed to some moisture and mist . And , no , I am NOT affiliated with the 'Kidde ' company in any way . It 's just a more superior and hassle-free product .	-1
Bought 3 of these for our home in 2007 and one failed within 3 months and another failed within 3 years and all go through a fresh 9 volt battery in less that a year.Failed unit does a rapid triple-chirp every minute or soThe first warranty replacement was done at no cost . The most recent was done for a shipping fee of $ 6.50 that I needed to snail-mail in to them.Test feature set off my the remote from toy helicopter so I ended up taking apart to cover the sensor as tape over the small hole on the outside of the unit did not prevent the Infrared remote from activating the alarm .	-1
we replaced our smoke alarm in the kitchen because when I stir fry the alarm would go off . We paid extra for the remote control feature . this feature does not work , even when trying 3-4 different fully-charged remote controls .	-1
This product has a feature that one 's Ir TV Remote can be used to turn off a false alarm - ones ir remote can also be used to test the alarm - in reality it sets off alarms . My compact Fluorescent light bulbs set off false alarms . I had thrown away the packaging so I could not return it . I took it apart and blacked out with black tape the ir sensor and it seems to be ok. Not every one will be able to do this . Others have had similar problems .	-1
I 've had this exact model in my main bathroom for over 3 years with no problems , grief , or any complaints , so when the master baths shower developed a split in the middle and began spraying everywhere I was delighted to see that Amazon carried this . Based on 3 years of use I think I can say this is a great little hand-held shower for $ 16 . It has only 4 settings , but they are more than enough for most people anyway . Never used those other settings on previous models I 've owned.Another nice little `` feature '' of this shower is in the fine print . Our wonderful government mandates that all hand-held showers have a flow regulator built into them . Look carefully at the front page and you will see where it is at , and how to remove it and place it in that special drawer or box you keep all those pillow tags that say do not remove under penalty of federal law . I doubt all models are this easy to fix for those in low pressure areas , or like me where the pressure is high but already stepped down in the main supply.Something else to consider when buying these things , If it made of a Nickel or Chrome finish , Do n't Buy It , it made of a hard brittle plastic that will crack , or worse crack your Fiberglass tub . You want a soft lightweight white plastic like this one . These wo n't crack if your fumble fingered.Finally , for the idiots who have bought this and complained about leaks or splits from the plastic fittings , Get some thread compound from the hardware store and learn how to use it ! You do n't have to crank with a pair of pliers to tighten these things , and I guarantee you if you look in a plumber 's toolbox you will see he uses that stuff too.It been 4 months since I bought the 2nd unit , and I have to take back most of everything i 've said . The first unit is still working fine , but the 2nd I bought in April has self destructed internally and is throwing water from everywhere . Makes for a very weak shower .	-1
The Cascadia is hard to get it to stay where you want it . The button that changes the spray pattern broke after about 3 months and is not repairable . Poor plastic construction . I wo n't buy another one .	-1
In a word this is junk . The flexible arm is too weak to support the large rainfall head . From day one it wanted to droop down and not stay in place . If I managed to get it in the desired position it only took the slightest touch to make it fall back down - forget about the button for spray selection . It 's very disappointing considering I had an older `` gooseneck '' shower head from Waterpik that worked without any issues , but it seems they decided to go with a cheap design that renders this product essentially unusable .	-1
For a company with a good reputation , I 'm very disappointed in Waterpik . The large showerhead is quite heavy and the gooseneck can barely support its weight , so unless you can mount it fairly high up on the wall , the showerhead wo n't stay at a proper horizontal angle . Or it will stay up for a while , then slowly sag . It has recently developed an annoying whistle ; those holes are tiny , so they are probably clogged , but how does one clean this unit since it does n't come apart ? Stay away from this one , and buy something else .	-1
I have purchased three of these and all three failed about the same time . It works great at first , and the toggle switch is easy to use . I really enjoyed the experience of having the water fall down on me like rain , and the adjustable arm is maneuverable enough to raise the shower head fairly high . Unfortunately the housing is cheap plastic and breaks easily . I did n't even move the showerhead after the first couple weeks and left it in the same position all the time , but on all three showerheads , the plastic housing broke at the point where the white meets the adjustable arm , and leaked . On two of the models , the adjustable arm failed and would fall down and no longer hold up . There are better and stronger showerheads out there .	-1
Like many others , I had problems with getting an even plane . Whether it was the soles , blades , or both , the result was removal of 1/32 deeper on the right side of the workpiece . Even with it set on zero , it would take material off the right side only . I need to perform precision tapered planes with successive passes and this really compounds the problem . Me being the sucker that I am , I returned it and ordered a new one only to get one with the same problem . After contacting Bosch tech service , their only suggestion was to take it to a service center . Sorry , I do n't think I should have to take a brand new tool to get serviced . Thankfully Amazon has awesome customer service for returns . Bosch blew it on this one .	-1
As others have noted , this planer has many fine features including power and very good chip collection . However , the front and aft sole plates are not parallel to the cutter head and Bosch service could not correct the issue . With the plane sitting on the aft sole plate , the cutter head will cut an angled trough ( about 1/32 '' deep ) on the right side of the unit . I know that Bosch can successfully build a planer without this feature , because I have an older , lower power Bosch planer , Model 3272A , that never had a problem with surfacing rough boards . With this unit , that task would be impossible.A year ago , I assumed the unit was defective and sent the unit back to Bosch for repair or replacement . It appears that Bosch choose to `` repair '' the unit and returned to me a unit that functions just as poorly as the one I sent them.So much , for Bosch factory repairs and my attempts at getting warranty service on the obviously defective piece of equipment . I still have unit , because I have n't had the time to list it on ebay as a piece of factory defective equipment.Since the bi-directional dust collection chute is nice and I have a 35mm to 1-1/4 '' vacuum nozzle adapter from other equipment , I gave the unit a star .	-1
What I should say is : It is not for a door expert . The planer is great but the bevel guide adjusts in the opposite direction from most `` door '' planers . This is a problem because if you have the door on a saw horse , you will have to flip the door over to get the bevel going the correct way . Also then your marks would be on the opposite side if you mark on the high side . Otherwise is very nicely made with good features.I bought this for another door installer and he promptly returned it due to the backwards fence .	-1
I thought I was buying a planer and if you know what a planer is then you know what I 'm talking about . This is not a planer , it is , well , a wood distorting device . There is no possible way a cupped outfeed shoe and a twisted unparallel front shoe can ever make a board straight . I bought this for what I thought was a great price , I would have been better off going to Harbor Frieght to find similar quality . I gave this `` planer '' and Bosch the benefit of the doubt and proceeded to get it repaired . Week one passes , I drive back to the Service Center and excitedly picked up my tool , but my expectations were shattered while there . I pulled the planer from the box and checked its accuracy . Nothing had changed . I took my garbage home and called Bosch and was transferred to the Bosch Repair Service Center . I spoke to the guy who repaired the tool and he tells me he only checked one side for parallel and deemed the `` planer '' as `` nothing was wrong with it '' . I was quite irritated , but all the Bosch employees had been very nice and so was this guy . I asked how I could possibly fix the tool and he told me . I tried , opened the tool up , discovered it was poorly made , and called the guy back . He told me to send it back to them and would have it replaced . By the way , the guy told me this planer is made for homeowners . What ? ! The top of the line Bosch planer is made for homeowners . Bosch should put a label on their `` planers '' stating `` Made for largely inaccurate work , increments on tool are just for fun '' . Anyways , I send this piece of junk back , wait another two weeks and get the call my `` new '' `` planer '' has arrived . I get it home and open my new planer . It is no different than the first . If I could curse in this review it would be chalked full of F-bombs . I have no words for Bosch 's incompetence and absolute worthlessness . I do n't recommend this product to anyone . Save your money and buy a junky Ryobi . If you insist , you will have yourself an expensive paperweight or wood distorting device .	-1
I bought the tape mostly for the writing pad and the side body . I find the metric side interferes with reading standard measurements when holding the tape in reverse ( backwards ) . Also , the stand out length is poor . My next tape will be the new Milwaukee tapes	-1
I have used one of these for a few months in my drill press and I have had several scrapes to my hands . The problem is that the cutting end is very aggressive and as soon as it cuts through the far side of the work piece with the pilot tip , the drill bit tends to break through the material and grab it - spinning it rapidly . I am not exactly a novice with using a drill press . Any bit has some tendency to do this and you need to clamp the work piece , have a backer piece under it , and slow down the feed just before the drill exits the other side.The worse case using these bits is in drilling thick polycarbonate plastic - it 's tough and these blasted bits grab every time on the exit . I have had similar but lesser problems in brass and aluminum.I finally gave up and plan to sell the set in a garage sale - buyer beware ! I have gone back to the standard point type bits.These bits are an accident waiting to happen in my opinion .	-1
Pros : - 1/64 '' steps- Very nice plastic case- `` No spin '' hex shank ( also lets larger bits fit 3/8 '' chucks ) - Pilot point works as advertisedCons : - Gold Ferrous Oxide instead of TiN- More shank and less flute than your average drill bit- Design aggressively chews up wood badly ( with tear out on exit ) - Not good for soft woods ( works better with harder woods ) - Flutes seem less sharp than other brands- Too much heat concentrated at pilot point risks burning the bit- Halfway down , bits bite hard into the wood ( especially the larger ones ) and cause the drill to screw itself into the wood until the chuck hits requiring you to backout and try again . This is very frustrating and is a major design flaw in my opinion . As such these bits are not well suited to hand drills.If you are set on this purchase , consider the package with the measuring tape : DEWALT DW1969TM Heavy Duty 29-Piece Pilot Point Set with FREE Tape MeasureOr the 25pc Black Oxide version with the normal tip : DEWALT DW1164 25 Piece Black Oxide Drill Bit SetNote there also exists a cobalt version with the Pilot Point tip : DEWALT DW1269 29 Piece Cobalt Pilot Point Metal Drill Bit Index Set	-1
This air hose is good if you are going in a straight direction.It will kink at the begining and end of the couplings.So it 's no better than any other hose I have had	-1
I bought this lathe in 2007 and use it for mostly pens and small items . I have never turned anything as large as a table leg on it . By the beginning of 2011 the bearings were completly shot . I can do small faceplate work but if I use the tailstock , the bearing noise is deafening and I ca n't get enough accuracy to even turn pens . The steel is really soft in the tapers and galls easily . At least I can smooth it out with sanding cloth.I replaced this lathe with a Nova DVR XP .	-1
You have to be very careful with these bits . When they break through to the other side of the material being drilled they will screw themselves right down to the chuck and if your hand is near any part of the piece being drilled you can get your fingers smashed . I thought this was a quirk in my first set but when many of them broke I bought a second set . Same problem . They screw themselves right through the material being drilled instantly without completing the hole . They are very difficult to hold back and prevent this from happening .	-1
Some of the bits appear to be ok. Un fortunately when I first opened the wood case one of the wood mounts had broken free and a bunch of bits were rattling around in the box . That is bad for the sharp edges . The 1/4 '' bit broke after about an hours use . Not to good . Spend a little more and get a good set if you plan on using it much .	-1
I purchased this set a couple of months ago . I have used two of the bits so far and ruined two projects . As reported in other reviews I had the shank on the 1/4 inch straight bit snap off . I was routing in 3/4 '' pine plywood . I was not overloading the bit . Next I used one of the round over bits . About half way through the project the bearing came off and ruined the project.This is a very light weight set and suitable for very light use . If you buy it take all the bearings off and use lock tight before re-installing . At the very least tighten the cap screw holding the bearings . I found several less than hand tight . I would not purchase this set . Pay a little more and get something that will last and not ruin your work.Since writing this review I have continued having poor experiences with this set . I have had other shanks break on light to medium use . I consider this set cheap Chinese junk . Go elsewhere and get a serviceable product .	-1
I own lots of pneumatic tools and have had two Senco finish guns that ran like champs . Though this pin nailer has been treated well and oiled often it jams frequently . I 've had this thing apart way too often on job sites trying to clear jams and often resort to using my brad nailer instead . Also , its lack of a safety means this gun will fire when the trigger is pressed even if the nose is not in contact with a work surface . ( Of course , this assumes that it is a working gun , which mine often is not ) I 'm very disappointed with this product .	-1
I had this Bostitch BT200K Brad nailer for a little over 2 months . I was not impressed with it at ALL ! It jammed often , did n't countersink , felt `` sloppy '' , and lacked power to set 2 '' brads in hardwood . I ended up selling it on eBay and buying a Ridgid brad nailer instead . My impression of the Ridgid nailer are , it is superior ! Every detail seems to have been carefully thought out with it , fit/finish is superb , no jambs ( yet ! ) , tons of power , just as light as the Bostich , and it has a lifetime parts/service warranty ! I suggest you steer clear of the Bostitch BT200K , and look at the Ridgid instead . ( Check on eBay , I got my for $ 49.99 + $ 9.99 S/H ! )	-1
Compared to other Bostich nailers this one is terrible . I 'm on my second nailer in a couple years . The first one worked very well but developed air leak somewhere around the trigger . I did n't have the time to mail it to Bostich to fix so I bought a second one.The second nailer is terrible . It jams and wo n't fire their own ( Stanley ) 1 5/8 '' nails - there are grooves in the magazine where the heads of the brads sit and there is no groove in the nailer I have for those brads . A minor issue but that 's what I had on hand for brads.I do n't recommend this tool .	-1
I had this Bostitch SX150K stapler for a little over 2 months . I was not impressed with it at ALL ! It jammed often , did n't countersink , felt `` sloppy '' , and lacked power to set 1-1/2 '' staples in hardwood . I ended up selling it on eBay and buying a Ridgid stapler instead . My impression of the Ridgid stapler are , it is superior ! Every detail seems to have been carefully thought out with it , fit/finish is superb , no jambs ( yet ! ) , tons of power , just as light as the Bostich , and it has a lifetime parts/service warranty ! I suggest you steer clear of the Bostitch SX150K , and look at the Ridgid instead . ( Check on eBay , I got my for $ 59.99 + $ 9.99 S/H ! )	-1
I bought this stapler to replace an old Atro stapler and was very disappointed with it . While it is better than my old stapler in some respects , the bostitch line has not kept up with the competition . First problem with it was the fact that even on it deepest setting it would only drive a staple about 1/32 below the wood and often only flush , I had to use a nail set to sink to thing . You also have no idea how many staples are left or what size they are . A better window would help and is easy to do . Plus a lot of miss fires happen . This tool caused a lot of blemishes on my work and had to be shelved , and used only for background work . I bought the Hitachi stapler , and it 's a world of differences . Very smooth operation , good depth of drive , and a nice window to see the remaining staples . And that 's using the Boxes of Bostitch staples I had bought for the Bostitch gun .	-1
This worked just ok with a primer , it was very splotchy and the coating had speckles all over it that required sanding down - the result was not a smooth service . Then when we moved on to an acrylic latex the Critter was unusable . It clogged up within two minutes of use , to the point where I was constantly taking it apart for cleaning just to get through the job . This was after cutting it with water several times to try and get it to work correctly. Can not recommend .	-1
Tinkered with different dilutions , but I just could n't get good coverage with this gun . The coat was either way thin or I had to crank the pressure way up . Made the room smell like paint more than it actually painted the work piece . I 'll be going back to my cheap HVLP guns . Really wish it had worked since it was very easy to clean when I packed for return .	-1
I am very familiar with photon lights and the ones I got from this listing were without any chance of doubt FAKE . What a rip-off .	-1
Received it fast and on time , packaged well . The push button switch works well , but the on/off switch does n't stay in the on/off position .	-1
I gave my light to a family member who really liked it and ordered a second one from Amazon.Com . The 2nd light had the cheaper ring on it instead of the spring clip as shown in the photo on the product information page . The spring clip was very convenient . If I 'd known this , I 'd have ordered a package of ten cheaper lights for the same price . They all have the cheap rings.BURNED AGAIN .	-1
I trusted the great reviews of this but I 'm not a fan . The on button is very small and mine wo n't stay on . I have small hands and still , the tiny button is hard to turn on .	-1
Ordered several white , yellow and red lights . The white ones came in OEM packaging and appear to be the real thing . All of the red and yellow units arrived in ziploc bags and are obvious knock offs . No Photon marking on the plastic , look different , keyring is wrong , etc.Seller is CS Discount Imports , LLC . Do n't buy from them .	-1
Slide switch requires a *very* tough fingernail . I often have to use a key or something to move the slide switch.The LRI FMW Photon Freedom model works better for me . It uses an integrated circuit in the flashlight to detect that you have held the pushbutton down for a while - thus preventing accidental turn-on . No need for the tiny slide switch . Because of the electronic circuitry instead of the mechanical switch , the `` Freedom '' model costs a little more than this model .	-1
The first bulb I used and wrote the review on worked . The second one I tried to use ... did n't . The filament was already broken . by that time I had tossed the packaging so I could n't really return it . Beware buying bulbs online is the message here I guess.ORIGINAL 5 REVIEW : Bright light . What more can I say ? These were for 6 ' floor lamps that could take up to 150 watts . The bulb is larger than a standard 60 or 100 watt . I could see the top of the bulb poking out from the top of the lamp shade . That may be a drawback for some . Some lamps may not fit this larger bulb ... so take that into account .	-1
This was not durable at all . With minor vibration it went out almost immediately . I think it was lit no more than 4 minutes . If you need quality high wattage lamps , buy rough service ones .	-1
Very cheaply made . These were originally an AMerican-made part , but are now imported . This may carry a fancy name and part number , but it is very flimsy and I broke the wiring on two of them trying to get them to work . Go buy a new light fixture and give up on this .	-1
My torchiere light burned out and I was trying to replace it . I measured it faithfully and the bulb I had was nearly 4 3/4 inches ... I matched it with the closest measurement I could find on amazon and purchased three bulbs . Unfortunately I have no idea where the measurements on the page came from because the bulb itself was barely over 3 inches ... despite it saying 4+ on the page . So I 'm off to shop locally where I can SEE what I 'm buying and know in advance if it will fit or not..	-1
There a at least 2 lengths of T type bulbs and Amazon or its seller DOES NOT provide the information on this bulb length . I need the one that is just a tad over 3 inches , not the 5 inch model.GE at least calls them both `` T Type '' bulbs . So if you need the longer one , this is it . If you need the shorter one , do not waste your time and money on this bulb . Gave the one I ordered from Amazon to a neighbor as I had no use for it.Jim in So Calif	-1
Initially this broom seemed awesome . However after pushing some fluffy snow with it , the handle broke where it meets the actual broom base . I am very disappointed .	-1
Extremely light . And very small ... i did n't had to buy those for a long time and forgot to look at the dimensions . my old one is 10mm in diameter and have a good 'feel ' because of the weight , this one is 7mm and you can barely feel it in your hand.Also the included blade is very dull . required some sharpening before it became fun . really not worth the price . get a Chinese brand and be happy , as these are pretty much it .	-1
Comes tightly coiled in a small box.Great for shipping - BUT UNFORTUNATELY it means that you can not get this thing to lie flat when you unroll it.I tried all sorts of stuff - soaking in hot water , hair dryer , etc.Eventually just tried to stick it done with the enclosed sticky strips - which almost works , but of course - nobody wants to stick this thing down to their nice floors . Plus - sticking it down on rugs , carpets , etc wo n't work.Nice idea . Shame about the execution .	-1
The product arrived tightly rolled , which made for a small package , After unrolling , the plastic 's memory made it want to return to its rolled-up state . I laid it on the floor with weights on it for two weeks , but it kept wanting to curl slightly after I removed the weights . It has now been lying `` flat '' on the floor for a month but still refuses to lie completely flat , creating a trip hazard , which is in complete antithesis of its intended purpose . Nice prototype , but not ready for `` prime time . `` Following up after six months of use : The product still has enough retained memory from being would in its package that it still refuses to lie absolutely flat on the ground , creating exactly the trip hazard it was supposed to eliminate ! One year follow-up : The track has lost most of its memory , and lies fairly flat . However , it still lifts enough that it can represent a trip hazard if one is not careful when walking around it .	-1
It 's fine except it does n't lay flat , leaving the possibility of somebody tripping on it . Kind of the point of the product ... .	-1
I have tried this product and I can not use it anywhere I tried it . As other have said , it comes tightly rolled up . It NEVER , EVER quits trying to roll back up . Hence , while you buy this to lay flat so that no one trips or sees unsightly cords , it does not fulfill it 's function . It is frustrating and time wasting .	-1
i have had this panasonic drill now for about 2 years . in 6 months one battery would no longer take a charge . replacement bateries are quite expensive.the drill will only work ofr me on lighter materials , it does not have the power to go thru 2 inches of oak , or 1/8 inch steel without stalling out.the chuck does not grab the bits well , they spin inside the chuck under moderate loading.i have seen this same drill at orchard under the craftsman name for a little less money.i would have sent the drill back to amazon but you do not find many of these things out until too late.the second battery would not take a charge after 8 months.i would estimate that each battery went thru 60 charge cycles before biting the dust.my feeling is that they should like a computer printer nearly give these away on the assumption that they will make their money back on selling the replacement batteries.the drill is small and lightweight and that alone should tell the story that the drill is meant for the very casual small-time user .	-1
I bought this drill new last year at Home Depot and used it to drill holes for 24,3/16 '' Tapcon screws in concrete . By the time I got to the 24th hole it smelled like it was burning , the bearing was shot , leaking oil and the shaft was wobbling . Unfortunately , I could not find my receipt and they refused to take it back . If you buy this hammer drill make sure to hold on to your receipt because you will need it .	-1
I would give it 5 stars if it lasted more than two or three months . It did make our water and ice cubes taste better . We particularly enjoyed the fact that as ice melted , the taste of the water in the glass stayed fresh.Every one we have bought developed a leak from between the screw-on collar and the valve body . This means that unfiltered water sprays or runs into the pitcher or glass you are using.We first thought we might be overtightening it , so the next one was tightened only enough not to leak . It failed.With the next one , we tried to avoid putting too much stress on it when we moved the lever . So , the next one was actually secured to the faucet spout with tape to take any stress off the attachment of the body to the faucet . It failed.It 's too bad Brita ca n't tell the Chinese factory to use a little better or thicker plastic to make this product stay in one piece . Chinese shortcutting has increase their profit by a nickel per unit , but has lowered durability and has already cost them sales , at least in this household .	-1
I do n't know what it is about this product , but it just does not hold up at all . Actually , I do know what it is : cheaply made.When it works , it works great . There is nothing like having fresh water at the tap without having to refill a pitcher every day . But it wo n't take long for you to realize that this device is n't made for the long term.Within months of owning small leaks start to occur around the device . Shortly after those appear , the leaks worsen and will actually run into the water you are wanting to filter.After spending over $ 100 on 3 replacements and how ever many replacement filters , I have learned my lesson the hard way on this product.You really do get what you pay for in this product .	-1
we liked it better than their competitors.We live in a rural area where the water , while legally potable most of the time , is frequently cloudy or has a `` flavor '' . While flavored water can be pretty good , we do n't want it `` on tap '' .The holes the water comes out of on the bottom seem to enlarge over time and spray in strange directions . The threads do n't hold well after a while and it comes loose.We do like the 3-way option of regular unfiltered , spray unfiltered and filtered . It is easy to keep clean and to change the filters . And , the water tastes like it 's supposed to ; non-flavored.Since the unit comes with a filter , the annual expense is not all that big . We also buy the replacement filters from Amazon . Do n't wait until the last minute do buy them , though . They change prices quite often and you can get very good buys if you check often for deals.Brita On Tap Replacement Filters , White , 2-PackBrita 42401 On-Tap Replacement Filter , 1-Pack ( Update January 26 , 2012 ) As I had said , these come loose from the faucet . It seems that the newer the unit , the more easily that happens . Our faucet has threads on the outside . The included washers are too thick to allow the unit to seat itself . Attempts to get help from their customer service led to more of the same washers and adapters being sent with no better results . No matter what I tried , the filter unit was falling off the faucet at least once a day.We have switched to the Culligan filter . I have no idea how much better or worse the filtration is , but it has a metal connector and you can just feel that mechanically it will work better . On top of that , the main unit is cheaper than the Brita and the filters are about the same price . After a month , the unit is still firmly attached.Culligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet FilterCulligan FM-15RA Level 3 Faucet Filter Replacement Cartridge	-1
Picked one up on clearance for the cost of the filter alone . Have been using a PUR system for years with no complaints , but the housing was getting crudy so I figured I would try the Brita . The PUR housing I previously had went onto the faucet without issue onto a metal adapter . I could even add low flo outlet underneath . This Brita filter however would not attach to the metal adapter , although it appears to be the size required . Brita did enclosed two of their own adapters . One looks indentical to the metal one I have , but theirs are a cheap stiff plastic with less threads.Their adapater would attach to my faucet but NOT to their own unit . Let me repeat that , their own adapter would not securely attach to their own unit . I tried the second adapter , knowing it wo n't work with my faucet ( to small on he faucet side ) just to see if that one attached to the unit , which suprising it did . When I looked at it vs. the one I needed , the threads were slightly different . Also when I took it off , it broke . The plastic was too brittle.Headed out the door now to take it back . Will be getting a new PUR unit . Really wanted this to work . When not on clearance these are the same price as the PUR systems which are better . Filters look to be slightly cheaper over the long run as well . Can not recommend and in fact advise that you avoid .	-1
When the base and filter work its great that is if it works when you buy it that 's 50 % of the time or if it works after several months thats about 50 % of the time.The base is supposed to be reusable well it is 50 % of the time . The treads strip and the base needs to be replaced . What a shame because the 1/4 of the time your setup is working its fantastic .	-1
I was at J & R ; for the purpose of buying a year 's worth of filters for my Brita pitcher and saw that not only was `` Brita on Tap '' very reasonably priced but that there was a coupon rebate offer for a total of $ 10 if I bought some replacement filters as well ( which I have yet to purchase ) . Since it seemed that this system would ultimately be cheaper than the pitcher and that I 'd also have the convenience of ... well , Brita on tap , I jumped on it.I should 've looked before I leaped.My tap is an `` innie , '' so I had to use one of the included plastic adapters in order to mount the unit . I installed the correct one and added the unit . All was well until I literally TAPPED it while filling a pot : first it sprayed me , then it fell off . I ran to Amazon and noticed that other users had been having similar problems , so I took their advice and called Brita . They promptly shipped me some metal adapters . I assumed my problems were solved.Unfortunately , I 've since had occasion to tap the unit and while things have improved -- it starts leaking but neither sprays me nor falls off -- this is still unsatisfactory because it necessitates removing the unit and reinstalling it . Why ? Because even though the metal adapter is an improvement , the receiving end is still a crummy , shallow piece of plastic . I realize that this might be satisfactory for some taps , but it 's not for mine . A near-total waste of money and an exercise in futility.To its credit , Brita on Tap does a good job of filtering water and I like the fact that the non-filtered flow can be set to `` spray . '' But the filtered water flow is VERY slow , so while I thought this would be a good option for filling pots with cooking water , it 's not , especially when the likelihood of bumping the unit in the process is factored in.Much as I like Brita and find them a good company to deal with , I ca n't recommend this unit . Caveat emptor , especially if your home has older spigots.UPDATE : As of July 2011 , I was told by my local vendor that they can no longer get refills for this because Brita wants to sell them exclusively online . Talk about adding insult to injury ! Based on this corporate decision , I 'd nick another star if I could . FEH .	-1
I certainly do n't doubt anyone 's story ( good or bad ) about this product but it was a complete FAIL for me . I installed about a day and a half ago . This morning , it shot off the faucet and now it wo n't stay attached with the water running . It does n't appear to be blocked , and I can blow air through it . For what it 's worth , I only hand-tightened it and I do n't believe I over did it.Before this , I had a Pur under-faucet filter for about a year . It developed a crack in the thin housing and started spraying . I bought the Brita because it looked sturdier.While it lasted , here 's how I thought it stacked up : * The water tasted good . * The flow out of the filter was relatively generous . * The filters are MUCH easier to change . * The unit has a slide-switch so you can bypass the filter . It 's easy enough to use but I like Pur 's version better . * The unit does n't get in my way when using the sink . * The aerator is n't that smooth . I 'd call the water flow `` chunky '' .Overall , if the Brita had to fail , I am happy it failed so quickly . I still have the receipt and have n't invested in a box of replacement filters .	-1
I usually do n't just trash a product , however after Brita discontinued a previous model that was great ( owned two ) they came out with this abomination . I thought there may have been an installation issue , however the unit is just a uncontrolled leak , from the fitting seams , from the unit , from the valve , etc . I just bought the pitcher model and deal with filling it up which is really no big deal , however do not waste you time or efforts on this absolute failure of a product .	-1

If you mount this upside down to a router table , the router will fail in a short time . I have gone through three of them in the span of a year . ( I bought three at one time , I am not stupid enough to keep buying the same garbage product ) . I originally had one that lasted about 3 years that was never mounted on a router table . The magnet on the inside shattered . DEWALT wanted over $ 50 for the magnet which is absurd . I am sticking with BOSH routers from this point forward .	-1

Like many others , I came searching for this obscure plate on Amazon because none of the hardware stores in town carried any . Lowes has 4 gang black but they 're screwless , which to me looks like some 90s `` trying to be futuristic '' looking garbage . Lo and behold , I finally find the glossy black , screw-on wallplate , vulgarly overpay to purchase it from Amazon so I can use my Prime benefits and get it on time to finish my remodel before my relatives come to town . The plate arrives missing 3 screws , which in itself is already irritating , but I figured I could fix that easily . Then , upon closer inspection , there 's a massive crack in it from the outside gang to the exterior . Upon even closer inspection , the entire plate is scratched to oblivion . Really Amazon ? This is n't like you , it would behoove you to actually read these persistent reviews .	-1
I am not going to reiterate the things I see in the other reviews here ; I will add a couple of things which you should know.1 . You should not attempt to use this saw without checking it top to bottom ( not just the checklist in the documentation ) . For example , when I turned mine on for the first time it vibrated so bad that the door not only came open , the hinge broke and the corner of the door cut into the tire on the bottom wheel . The hinge *appeared* to be very sturdy . I know this sounds a little hard to believe , but it is the truth . I might add , that I have never seen or heard of such a thing in almost 20 years of woodworking.2 . I could not align the belt to my satisfaction until I reversed the pulley on the motor . Judging only from the picture in the manual it appeared to be mounted backwards ; at any rate reversal is easy and that solved the problem.3 . The quick release band tension lever would hang about every other time . Sometimes it would hang only for a few seconds and then pop and release . I took it apart , checked for burrs etc , wiped it down and put it back together ; so far so good for this problem.4 . It is impossible on my saw to resaw hardwood boards anywhere near the thickness the saw can accommodate . Softwoods ( or thin hardwood ) do alright . I tried 3 different blades ; only the 3/4 inch blade resaws acceptably on mine.5 . The trunions broke on the table when I dropped the end of a 2x4 on it . I normally do n't resaw 8 foot boards , but this time I had a reason . I do n't treat my equipment roughly and typically use each device I purchase for 4 or 5 years.6 . The guides are pretty bad , but I have always found this to be the case on new bandsaws ( anybody who ships one with a good set of guides will probably sell me my next bandsaw ) .I am giving 2 stars for quality materials ; that seems generous . I have in my shop the following Delta equipment : Table saw , jointer , drill press and several other items which have performed much better . I will still buy Delta machinery because I get more for my money . However , I have to say that I had to work much too hard to make this bandsaw usable.I am still experimenting with balancing methods and have no intention of involving the factory . After all , I do n't think I could possibly make it any worse .	-1
Opened the package , turned it on and in less than 3 minutes with motor on ( did n't even sand anything ) the nylon gear stripped making it completely useless . Reference other owners who had the SAME problem . The only saving grace was Amazon . I returned it without question and Amazon paid the UPS bill . Thanks Amazon .	-1
to the point , this machine has a plastic drive wheel . I got a small piece of wood jerked out of my fingers ( my fault ) and it wedged the belt and stopped it ( safety built in ) . However , that stripped the plastic drive wheel . After that , anything above slight pressure on the sanding piece and the belt/disc stopped . I did n't want to go through the hassle of begging Delta for an exchange , so I fixed it with JB Weld . Now it works fine . The discovery of the flimsy construction has kept me from considering Delta anything .	-1
This is a very low quality tool . Not even a hobbiest level in my book . In a word , it 's `` garbage '' . No power , no bite , terrible vibration and the disk sander is useless . As a matter of fact , it was n't long after I started using this sander that the disk just started spinning freely with no torque at all . It 's run off a thin little belt driven by the motor instead of a direct connection . Any resistance ( like sanding ! ) and it burns the belt and that 's all she wrote . The belt sander is better but it bogs down with not too much pressure too . I ca n't believe Delta needs to sell this stuff and ruin their otherwise good name . But it 's my fault for buying cheap tools . I wo n't ever do that again . You do n't get what you do n't pay for .	-1
30 micron bags this product uses makes it worthless for saws . It lets too much dust get through . Buy a collector with 5 micron or less bags or canister filter . The AP400 lets a lot of fine dust through the standard bags and blows it all around your workshop . I think this is a big health risk.If you get this collector due to limited space or power requirements , throw out the original 30 micron bags . Replace them with Delta 's 5 micron bags , Penn State Industries ( PSI ) 1 micron bags , PSI canister , or Grizzly 's 5 micron bags or canister . Any 14.5 inch diameter dust collector bag or canister will work.Works fine for a planers and jointers . They do n't generate fine dust .	-1
I was a toolmaker for 25 years and have used alot of pro drill presses . I bought the dp350 new about 3 years ago for my home wood shop . I was impressed with its build and wanted a small varible speed drill press , I thought this would be perfect . All my machines are JET except for this one drill press and a Delta planer . The planer is great this drill press is JUNK . Over the years I do n't think my dp350 has more than a few hours total on it . It was always noisy stiff and vibrated too much no matter how I tried to adjust it and dampened the way I have it mounted to a table . 3 weeks ago it really started to make noise and vibrate and then the on-off switch started to smoke . I emailed Delta and did what they suggested . When that was n't the problem I loaded it into my truck and drove to the repair center as Delta suggested . I just got the call from them $ 155.00 to fix it . Needs a new Quill and switch and a few other things . I 'd like to dump it in the river and buy something else , but I 'm hoping my $ 155.00 will now give me the drill pres I thought I was buying 3 years ago . It never was right and I 'm going to let Delta know how I feel after I finish writing this . I will write back if they tell me anything I should share with you . I am very disappointed with this drill press . Buyer beware ! // Today I talked to Delta . I told them I know I have no warrenty left , but I just wanted them to know how crappy their dp350 is and how unhappy I am . They had a tech call the repair center I took it to and then the tech called me . He told me everything I already knew about the repair ! He said they ordered the parts and he will check back to see how the repair center makes out ... .not to help with the $ 155.00 so far , but at least he 's trying to make some kind of effort . It kills me to pay this repair , heck I could buy a new one all over again for about $ 40.00 more , but then I 'd have 2 boat anchors instead of one . I 'll give a final report here when it 's all over . Mean while if your buying a drill press buy a JET . FINAL UPDATE : I picked it up yesterday total bill for estimate and repair $ 146.00 . Needed a new pulley , new switch , new belt and a new quill . Repairman did a good job , no problem with the service center . I think it 's better than when it was new , but it should be considering the amount of hours I used it . Anyway nothing more from Delta in the way of satisfaction . Just think twice before you buy one.Just an update June 2010 . Delta never did anything for me , but the drill press is still running fine , but I still would not buy it if I could do it again .	-1
Buy anything else ! Delta obviously does n't test their tools . Mine broke after less than two hours of run time.Top of motor pulley slips off bushing , resulting wobble breaks snap ring . You 'll spend many hours cussing it.Replacing the snap ring wo n't fix it . I ran a screw through pulley into bushing . This fix is chronicled with photos by another Amazon shopper . Will probably end up replacing # @ ! ! % snap ring with cotter pin.Just figuring out how to depress the spring to install a new snap ring took me a couple of hours . Finally assembled lever system using some bar clamps and carefully sized hole in wood .	-1
New Review as of 05/02/2011After having this drill press for now over 3 years i still like the drill press , but i have had pulley problems also i have modified and corrected the problem through trial and error but it now is working good again you can purchase new belts through an auto parts store just take off and measure or take and compare until you find the one that works , delta does n't have any on hand per my experience with them . I feel the quality of Delta products is now much to be desired , they need to sink the boats from China and start making good American products again and MADE in USA , but go look at Craftsman products they are the same china junk , i do n't buy craftsman anymore even hand tools , instead i go to Auctions and garage sales and purchase old USA made tools and am getting rid of all non USA made tools in my shop , at garage sale prices .	-1

Well built , but not enough power . I picked up 2 of these from lowes , and a 10 inch Drill press ( # 21900 ) from sears to compare . I ended up getting 2 from lowes because the first one i thought was defective , the pin that holds the drilling table level was drilled in at an angle , which i thought was just bad workmanship . I picked up a second one from lowes to compare it with , and the second one ended up having a broken switch housing , But the pin was straight on this one , so i switched the drilling table and ended up with 1 complete drill press . I was making a wine bottle holder and needed to make 2 inch and 4 inch holes with the hole saw drill bits . Even on the lowest speed setting , there was not enough power , and the motor would lock up many times ( stop ) . It took over a minute to make each hole . I used my Hand drill and made the holes in less than half that time . I tried forstner bits and spade bits on the same 3/4 plywood for testing purposes , and again with the motor lockups . I picked up the 10 inch drill press from sears and ran the same tests . In comparing the two , the sears unit is slightly small , but same height . the base is about an inch smaller on each side , the table is about 1 inch smaller on each side , and the main pole/shaft is also about 1/2 less in diameter . The belt/pulley/press on both units are roughly the same size though . The sears drill press has 2/3 hp , of wich i could feel the difference immediately . It made short work of the sameprojects attempted earlier with the Delta . Not once did the motor on the sears drill press lock up , even on the same speed/torque belt setting . In conjunction with the more powerful motor , the sears unit also had a laser guide , which was a plus . I ended up returning these delta drill presses back to lowes , since the motor driving them was just not enough power . Since manufacturers usually list hp as peak , the delta probably had way less than the 1/4 hp listed . My overall impression was that the delta drill press was a well built drill press unit that is severely underpowered , which makes it nice to look at , but pretty much useless for my needs . It appeared to me that it was built for a bigger motor , but probably ended up getting cut for cost reasons . I would highly recommend looking into the sears unit for about the same $ . It offers a laser guide , a fence and stop block , which i used a lot for drilling out the holes for cabinet hinge cups . it also has a much larger , more powerful motor , with an electric brake that had enough power to drill through all of my wood projects . Both units employed the belt drive system with pulleys , which at first i did not like , but after using forseveral minutes , ended up liking . Sure a transmission style drive system would be nice , but much more money , and not really worth it for me . The belt system allows for lower speeds and an increase in torque , something that a speed controller does not add . For example , by holding the trigger a little lighter on your hand drill , slows the speed down , but does n't give you more torque . that would require a gear or transmission change from `` high '' to `` low '' . The belt system is like that `` high/Low '' switch on your hand drills , but with greater variation , or more gearing options to choose from . For a $ 100 drill press , the pulley system is a great `` manual '' transmission . The depth adjust on the delta is a joke , and seems to be common among the cheaper drill presses ( ryobi ) . It is adjusted on the press lever and constantly slips . A better alternative is that found on the Craftsman , an actual depth stop , like those used on plunge routers and biscuit joiners . I was n't looking for a monster drill press that could drill holes through rocks with blazing speed . Just something that was accurate and had more torque and power than my 18v Bosch Cordless drill . I agree with the other reviewers who say this is a well built unit , with the exception of the depth stop and limited power . Look at other units similarily priced.pros : well built , sturdy , good size , nice to look at , looks powerful.cons : weak motor with no balls , does not perform as well as it looks . handles keep coming loose , depth adjust is a joke as it constantly slips .	-1
I learned a lot from this mortising machine . Like , how to uninstall the chisel and bit to remove the wood chips jammed in them . Of course , removing the chisel and bit ruins all your squaring efforts and you have to square everything again . And I learned to put a gorilla twist on the chuck in order to keep the bit from falling out of the chuck whilst you mortise away . I learned how to swing on a handle in order to get enough force to cut into the wood ( Oh , yes , the chisels are honed and very sharp ) . I learned to cut my fingers when changing out the chisels or having to bang on the top of the drill auger bit to get it out of the chisel when it jams with wood chips , or more often wood CHIP.I do n't have any problem with the actual quality of this albatross . It is heavy , roughly finished , and everything squares ... again and again . But I now use a router or more often a drill press and a hand chisel .	-1
I rated it 2 stars because of the quality contorl from the factory . I had to return two damaged machines to finally get a good one . After the second unit that had a cracked casted yoke assembly , Amazon removed thwe item from their site and had the vendor investigate the problem . The problem was not with the shipper . The package was not damaged . It had to packed up already damaged.I have to compliment Amazon for working this out and being very responsive . I finally got an undamaged mortiser yesterday and after the short assemby and a single test it does perform as expected.The actual mortiser is very well made and is easy to use .	-1
When this machine went on sale for $ 145 shipped , I decided to ignore some of the bad reviews and took a chance . Amazon got it to me within 2 working days without any external signs of damage . When I unpacked it , I saw that the metal casting around the motor assembly had broken into 2 pieces . I thought about getting a replacement , but when I inspected the edge of the metal which had broken off , I found that the metal used for the casting is of incredibly poor quality . It looked very brittle . There is no way this machine can stand up to even moderate use . I 'm getting a refund and will pick up a Jet or something else. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --	-1
Spend the extra money and by a good ( free-standing ) Jointer ( You 're going to eventually , once you realize how useless this product is on anything but the smallest scale project ) . I built a couple of small end tables with this jointer , but when I went to put a straight edge on some longer lumber I am using for a desktop , I was not able to effectively do it ( I eventually rigged-up my router table to do it ) . It is mainly 'cause the outfeed table is so short.Also , there is no way to effectively hook up a dust collection device to this . I ended up using a magnetic dust chute , but it 's still not very effective .	-1
It may be good enough for a pot-head to roll a joint on ( especially if the boss is paying for it ) . I went through two of them in a month 's time . A dopehead will hang out in the shop for days and milk you dry before he tells you that it broke down , or that he can not change the blades on the aluminum head once they have worn down a bit . The bolts wo n't come out of the aluminum drum in order for you to change the blades.Of course , it worked just long enough for me to put a little faith in it , as Delta rests on it 's laurels and it 's `` American-Made '' name of old . But of course , it 's made in China now.Do n't buy this thing , and do n't hire any `` American-Made '' dope-heads . The combination would drain your checkbook in a very short time.-A Professional Woodworker since 1985P.S . Not trying to win a popularity contest with dopeheads .	-1
I researched this purchase for a long time and finally decided that I would get this machine , even though there were so many negative reviews . Well , I am not a negative reviewer , but I returned the machine and got a Ridgid JP0610 from HD . The Delta machine I received was just as described in the reviews on this page , so before purchasing this jointer determine what are your needs . Small projects ( boards & lt ; 24 '' ) or small shop then you may need to get this machine , but be forwarned because the distance apart b/t the Ridgid machine I just bought and this Delta machine is measured in light years . Now I 'm not selling the Ridgid machine , but for $ 150 more you will get a tool that is worth 10x that compared to this little machine . The Delta fence is pathetic , and the table to is very small , but I got it setup in 30minutes and had it finishing boards right away . Good finish , but when I tried a few longer boards it was much more difficult to manuver . Just not a good long term purchase for what I need it to do . So , figure out what type of work you will be doing and then make your decision , but if you have the room spend the $ 150 more ! ! ! It is a no brainer ! ! !	-1
Please note in my update below that I have raise my rating to 3 stars. -- -- This is n't so much a tool as it is a way to spend an afternoon getting frustrated . I really wanted it to work out as it 's the perfect size for my tiny shop , alas it was not to be.On the plus side , it seems to have plenty of power for a small unit . It also seems to face-joint okay , which is nice.And then there is the vertical fence , what a piece of junk ! Between having a rather high coefficient of friction , even when waxed , being slightly warped from one end to the other and its greatest downfall , the pathetic mounting system , I have yet to get one square edge.The plastic-headed bolt that attempts to tighten the fence stripped out within a few days . Even when I actually got it tight , I could still alter the angle of the fence slightly without too much pressure pushing against the base of it.The results I 've had are not worth $ 200 . Maybe $ 100 as a face jointer . I can still combine this with my router table to get the job done , but I 'll be in the market for a real jointer as soon as I can make the space ! Save your money and get a better unit . Delta has a full sized one for $ 300 and it has to be better than this ! UPDATE to my review : I have fixed this unit 's two major shortcomings . First I replaced the useless swiveling fence mount with a solid and supportive piece of MDF . Now it holds 90 degrees . I do n't miss the ability to bevel the fence , but if I had to , I could stick the factory mount back on.Second , I covered the face of the fence with low friction tape . Now wood can smoothly slide through without binding.In it 's current state , I 'd probably give it 4 stars as it works as it should , but because I had to do those things myself , I 'll go with 3 .	-1
I do n't see how anyone could get good results with this thing . A jointer must be heavy ! Without weight , a jointer is useless . I bought one of these and sold it at a loss a few months later . If you 're looking for a jointer setup for a good price , get the Rigid 6 '' jointer ( with a cast iron bed ) , one of those magnetic knife setting jigs ( a MUST ) , and a set of carbide knives from a shop that specializes in making such things .	-1
this model was a bear from start to finish . i had before put up 3 different sears openers and had little problems . this unit , hmmmm ... how many times did i feel like tossing it out.there are the safety sensors , which must be adjusted PERFECTLY . and i fear the future with them . they are sooooo sensitive , the little bit they are off , no door will work . and i see no way to bypass them in the event of either of them failing . then the book several tiems has the caveat , the weather will adversely effect the opener working . i have NEVER EVER had any door fail to sork due to weather ... ever ! the booklet is sort of ok , but in many spots very hard to discern what they mean , and the picture to help was useless.overall i wish i had used the local door company for them to install a belt drive unit . yes at 300 , but a better unit and NO hassle . this unit at 129 is decent in price , but not in hassle ... what is that worth , not to mention the darn thing working over time , the sensors working over time and their out , the weather .	-1
If you use any of the Craftsman openers ( chamberlin , Liftmaster , Craftsman , Security+ , etc ... ) do NOT get this opener . I fought it for DAYS trying to get it to work with my existing opener . It would either work on it 's own , or the old GDO would work , but not together . Turns out that it somehow `` takes over '' so unless you want to buy a whole new set of openers , dont ' bother . Go with the Craftsman Security+ GDO . Works great ! Solved all my problems , unlike this POS .	-1
The Sportsman 's Guide is probably a reputable company . But this advertisement leads you to believe you will receive the Hooks and Clamps as described in their ad and shown in the photos specifically for the 14429 model . You do NOT . This specific version of the 2x4 Basics Kit is NO LONGER AVAILABLE from them . And they can not send you one -- even from back-ordered items.When I called The Sportsman 's Guide to complain it was suggested that I -- the customer -- bring the problem up with Amazon ! They did offer to issue a Return Label , but you have to request that they include the shipping , too , since the item you will receive is NOT AS ADVERTISED . This Kit is available cheaper here at Amazon if you take advantage of your Prime Membership . Which is what I will do -- knowing that the cheaper kit will be exactly the same as the one The Sportsman 's Guide shipped to me , and not the one they advertised.The Sportsman 's Guide also directed me to the item they list on their own website -- which does NOT include the Hooks and Clamps . But how the confusion is the Customer 's fault , or responsibility to correct , is absolutely BAFFLING.The item , itself , seems well-made.Incorrect advertising is a deal-killer from this Reseller .	-1
I bought this `` thing '' about three years ago and was constantly resetting my table saw using this expensive piece of junk . Come to find out the master plate has a .004 `` hump '' in it and the gauge never reads the same . I was going crazy trying to align the saw.Although I got a replacement , the same problems existed . I now have a real alignment tool made in usa that 's all metal and with an accurate gauge . Have n't had any more alignment problems . Do n't waste your money on this ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The concept is good , but the execution leaves a lot to be desired . It took a lot of fiddling around to get almost consistent results . There is way too much flex in the plastic body that fits into the miter slot . Trying to get the dial Zeroed was a pain in the rear . With so much body flex I was n't confident the measurements were accurate . Maybe others have had better luck , but for me , it 's outta here on its way back for a refund .	-1
This tool was not useful to me . I laid my Starrett straight edge across it and could rock the straight edge noticeably . Not worth the money . Precision is overstated . Sent it back .	-1
Certainly do n't depend on the MasterPlate for setting up your saw . I measured a .008 '' warp across the plate . To quote another reviewer , it is 'unflat'.Putting this into perspective , Sawstop says to unbolt and realign the tabletop whenever the arbor is more than .003 '' out of adjustment . .008 '' misalignment will cause burned wood and poor fit.I have added two of the pictures that I took of the MasterPlate 'unflat'-ness just after opening the package . The factory box was perfect , unblemished and undamaged ; the Amazon box that the plate arrived in was undamaged ; this problem was n't a shipping issue . MasterPlate have stopped drilling the 1 '' hole and they also stopped anodizing the plate ; the surface is now just plain rough milling.O1 Tool Steel Sheet , Precision Ground , Annealed Temper , Standard Tolerance , Inch is my next reference plate.UPDATE : BOO ! FOUL ! Someone removed the photos showing exactly how 'un-flat ' the April 2013 Masterplate is . I considered those as part of my review . I can post videos but not photos ? ? ? They were damning photos ... The photos showed two different _reference_ straight edges ( Starrett 387-36 and Woodpecker SERX-36 ) placed diagonally across a new Masterplate . Under one edge was a .008 '' feeler gauge showing the Masterplate was not flat as specified in the literature . This is the proper way to quantify 'flatness'.The photos also showed that the Masterplate no longer has an anodized surface , it has just a rough ground finish.The photos also showed that the Masterplate no longer has support for a 1 '' arbor ( my Makita miter saw has a 1 '' arbor and was one reason for me originally wanting a reference tool with the original specifications ) .My original review also had an active html link showing the solution I have now gone with . Since someone has removed the link you will have to look it up yourself . 'Starrett 56985 ' , it was 65 bucks , just look around ... Its an inexpensive 18 '' x 6 '' precision ground plate ( +/-.001 '' thickness tolerance ) that you will have to carefully use a hack saw to cut to length and then carefully use a drill ( hand or press ) to punch a 5/8 '' and 1 '' hole ( s ) .BTW : I did return it the next day .	-1
oh yes , this is very easy to clip onto your tap.just do n't turn on the water : because it will hurl the purifier off the tap and in less than an instant ; you will be soaked with ( unpurified ) water from shoulder to waist .	-1
This thing started to leak like crazy after about 1 month of normal use . It leaks out of the black toggle switch on the side and elsewhere . After about 1.5 months it completely stopped dispensing water . We do not even have hard water where we live . I called PUR and they are sending me a replacement . We 'll see how it works , but I do n't have high hopes .	-1
I have owned PUR faucets for over two years now and the story with all of them is the same : the collar that connects to the faucet broke on each of the 4 mounts I owned including this same model . At first I figured it may simply be a defective model but now I am convinced PUR makes substandard products . I love the filtered water that come out of it , I just hate the fact that they break so easily . Here 's my tip to PUR : PAY YOUR MECHANICAL ENGINEERS BETTER . Now I am left with a few expensive 3 stage filters and I have no choice but to buy another one of these crappy things . Fool me once shame on PUR , fool me 5 times ... I must be an idiot .	-1
I do n't know why , but I went through THREE Pur faucet filters before finally chucking them in the garbage and buying theCulligan Faucet Filter . The Pur filters were always leaking from the connectors . And if you tried to adjust them , you 'd end up stripping the plastic from the connector and being left with an unsightly , scraped up piece of plastic on your sink . And if you do manage to get the Pur filter off to try to repair the leak with plumber 's tape , good luck getting the filter back on again.But the Culligan 's connector is made of metal ( whereas both the filter housing and the connector of the Pur filter was made of plastic ) , so it 's easy to get the Culligan filter on and off the sink without any leaking whatsoever ! I also love how easy it is to replace the filters ! Just a twist of the fingers and it comes right out . I once got a deep cut from replacing a Pur filter where the edge of the cap sliced right into my hand while I was twisting it off , since there were no finger grips to hold onto.The Culligan is also nice b/c it does n't sit as low as the Pur filter , so you can put tall bottles or water pitchers under it with more ease . And the quality of the filter and the taste of the water is the same , if not better than the Pur filter . My main complaint against the Culligan is that it does n't have an indicator to show you when to change the filter ; they tell you just to mark it on your calendar , when to change the filter next.One last hesitation I had about switching over was the fact that I did n't see replacement Culligan filters readily available in the stores . Pur replacement filters are sold in bulk at Target and my local warehouse store . But once , when Amazon was running a buy 1 , get 1 half off sale on theCulligan filters , I saw that buying them one by one on Amazon.com was STILL cheaper than buying the Pur filters in bulk at the warehouse store . Add to that the fact that the Culligan filter is cheaper to begin with and you wo n't have to waste money replacing it periodically when it breaks down and you just have a product that makes good `` dollars and sense '' .	-1
I went through 4 or 5 different PUR faucet mount filters over several years - in various different configurations . Invariably , the filters clogged long before they had filtered their rated capacity of water , and the mounts cracked in less than a year - often less than 6 months . The filters are difficult to change because the caps on the mount get jammed . The water quality was very good , but the product is truly junk.I switched to Brita faucet mount and have been happy with the same one for almost 3 years now . Water quality is 1/2 notch below PUR , but much better made and easier to change.The best I ever used was the PUR sink mount filters which lasted the longest but they stopped making those years ago unfortunately.Have n't tried Culligan but from the reviews they also have big quality problems .	-1
This filter worked well for about 6 weeks , until the threaded faucet attachment wore down . The attachment was too short ; the off-center weight of the heavy filter was hanging from the faucet by only about a couple of threads of the plastic attachment . Eventually , movement of the filter wore the threads just ever-so-slightly , and it would n't stay on for more than a minute . Back to the PUR refrigerator container . For the money per use , I think an under-the-counter filter with a dedicated filtered-water faucet is a better buy .	-1
The `` improved '' version with the snap on faucet mount makes it very easy to install . It literally only took 3 minutes and includes unscrewing the faucet aerator , inserting the filter , and snapping on the mount.I 've used mine for 3 months and my parents have had theirs for 2 months . Both of our models have leakage issues . Despite tightening the mount multiple times , a lot of water is still wasted near the indicator light where the faucet and filter are screwed together.This is not a long term investment , and it 's hard to justify the cost when leakage becomes an issue after just 1 month . The water tastes great , but I 'll stick with my Brita filter for now .	-1
I 've been using these PUR water filter units for several years . I like the convenience and the quality of the water , but I 'm getting very tired of the problems with the hardware itself . This turns out to be quite an expensive unit because the faucet mount has never lasted more than three filters for me.Another issue is that the filters really do n't last very long . In just a short time the `` green '' led will start to flash yellow and then red . I usually keep it on red for as long as possible to get as much out of it as I can . But the water flow will progressively lessen over time until a filter change is essential.I 've had leaky units that needed replacement . I 've had units break right off the faucet because of a blast of water pressure when the faucet is first turned on . And my last unit had such a problem unscrewing the cap for filter replacement that I broke the unit off the faucet when trying to twist it . Another $ 40 down the drain.Even with all of the replacements , it is probably still cheaper than bottled water , but not by much and I 'm sure getting tired of having to buy another unit every 4-6 months . Usually the unit does n't last much longer than the two filters included in the mount kits I buy.Overall , I would give this product two stars ( instead of one ) because the water does seem purified through the 3 stage filter .	-1
Shame on me for not investigating this product more thoroughly before I got it . It will fit none of our faucets and hence is worthless to me . I 'm giving it two stars because I ca n't find where it says what kind of faucet you need for this to work in the online product description . It simply says fits most sinks . Obviously not ours .	-1
Nice variety of accessories , but cheap metal , poor China construction . One of the connection pieces had a beyond obvious flaw from the factory . The first 3 threads were not alligned and a large notch went through them , making it basically unusable . The blow gun is too small , designed for a child maybe . The valves do not thread snug with the air hose , heavy tape needed to stop severe air leakage . Not what I would expect from Porter Cable .	-1
... I think Delta gave this item to a rookie to design , and I 'll bet they did n't give it to a woodworker to test . Nothing about the left/right movement makes sense . It 's either too far from the blade , or the workpiece is sitting on the metal base of the tool . The part that holds the workpiece is fine , so if you buy this thing , figure on redesigning the base , and attaching it to a better miter bar . The bar that comes with it does n't have slop adjustment . ...	-1
I 'm a pretty patient guy , but this tool really pushed the envelope . Disassembling and cleaning was no big deal , had some problems with screw holes that had some pretty bad burrs on em , took a couple of hours to clean , and reassemble . As soon as I mounted in my miter slot , I noticed it rocked pretty badly , thought maybe the guide was out of whack , but it turned out that the base was no where close to flat . It was almost a 1/8th of an inch out . When you would press down on the blade side of the guide , the outboard side had an 1/8 of an inch space between it and the table . I double checked the instruction manual , but could n't find any way to `` adjust '' it out . Called Delta , no joy there , they said it must be my saw table top . I have a Dewalt 746 , have had it for a few years now , and my table is flat . Turns out the base was incorrectly machined , the bottom side is not flat or parallel to the top of the base . Called Delta again and they had no answer other than return it and get a new one from the store . Took it back to HD , they were n't very receptive to replacing it , wanted me to wait while they returned it to Delta and got it fixed . One of the `` tool '' guys told me they have returned a number of these jigs ... guess that is why they were on sale . At any rate after more than an hour of hassle , I demanded a refund and took my business elswhere . I went to my local woodworker store ( where I should have gone to begin with ) , they have about 5 differant jigs in stock and they took the time to show me the good and bad about each one they carry . I ended up buying the Shop Fox D3246 . It cost 10 bucks more than the Delta , but is heavier built and has more features . I have quite a few Delta tools in my shop , and I am pretty much satisfied with their performance , but this makes three Delta tools I have returned in the last few years because of shoddy workmanship and pretty bad customer service . I also think that HD has seen the last of my money for anything . Would n't recommend this tool to anyone .	-1
Delta should be embarassed with this item compared to the company that made my Unisaw . Oh I forot Black and Decker ownes them now . The old heavy Delta jig was one of the best and now the 34-183 then 34-184 ; keeps getting worse . I also have a deta grinder and drill press , which I like so I am not a delta basher.This may be the worst item Delta makes , in quality and design as other have noted . The metal of the screws and plastic handles look like something on a $ 10 jig.Buy the Grizzly .	-1
I was hoping that this would save some time by not having to attach clamps each time I switched to a different machine . That has not been the case . The fit on most of my machines is not good . The connector simply slips off after a few seconds . I would reiterate what another reviewer said about wrapping the port with some duct tape . I did that on my planer and it seemed to help . I 've gone back to taking 10 seconds and tightening the clamp each time I move to a different machine . This was n't worth the headache for me .	-1
These have a really , really basic problem - they fall off . Another reviewer mentions using duct tape to hold them on - which completely flies in the face of their purpose - to quickly move the hose from machine to machine . The plastic is too hard and the taper is n't designed properly . Manufacturing quality is n't great - they are only more-or-less round and given the taper problems and hard plastic , the results are n't good : They do n't slide on most machines ' dust outlets deeply enough , they do n't seat , and they do n't fully seal . I went back to using the raw hose end , which works fine when using a soft hose .	-1
This drill did not get used every day but it did get used fairly often . I am surprised that this weekend while driving some relatively small lag bolts , the gears stripped out . This is the end of a rather lackluster tool . Before this untimely death I had experiences other dissapointments , including a chuck that would freeze and require two pairs of large pliers to release , a strong ozone smell coming from the motor , and battery life that was quite a bit shorter that the Makitas that I owned before this one . I went with the Porter/Cable brand because I thought I was buying American . I now believe these are made in Mexico . I think I will go with a Panasonic to replace this one because of the good reviews for battery life and real metal gears .	-1
Filter lasts 3 weeks then you have to replace it .Do not buy do n't buy unless you want to keep replacing the filter every few weeks	-1
Less than 3 months of us and the outer shell started to show signs of wear & tear . Cracks developed on the outer shell at the top and bottom edges . The shell has loosened a bit and no longer holds the filter . Suprised with my experience of such a highly rated product on Amazon .	-1
This product sits in my hallway closet . I ca n't find any attachments that will fit with my modern looking faucet . It may work great on older type faucets . But not mine . Thank you for reading my review .	-1
Pretty let down with this product overall . It was easy to install but the `` filtered '' water still has a lingering chlorine taste and is hardly any better than straight from the tap . I also have a Brita pitcher and the water from that is much better than this filter , and that 's comparing from the same tap .	-1
Hard to determine exactly how well it 's filtering but it does slow the faucet and reduce pressure at the tap . Not a giant deal but be aware . Easy to turn on and off , the default is off . The instructions say to let it run 3 seconds before using the water which struck me as odd , but I 'm used to it now . Installed quickly and easily . Overall I 'm glad I bought it and installed it .	-1
Look the only reason for buying a faucet filter is to get pure water , this ant it . I still taste chemicals in the water . It does reduce that taste so I 'm assuming some filtration is taking place but its not as good as Brita by a long shot.CulliganInstallation was a snap , and no leakage . Solid fit , I was impressed.Since I dont read instructions , which is my fault , I did n't realize you need to run the water first then pull the plunger out to get `` no hands filtration '' , but you must run the water fast or the plunger will fall back and you get tap water again.Filtration is poor , to get better filtration you need to reduce the water pressure by running the water slow , that means having to hold the plunger out to keep it from falling in , then filtration is almost adequate.The fact that the plunger falls back easily has a plus , you save the filter from over use , the minus is its a pain adjusting the pressure.BritaI have had installation nightmares , leakage , poping off the faucet , fast aging of the faucet base . I went through 4 basses in 4 years one because it never stayed on but popped off with the slightest water pressure.I 've had 3 filters spring leaks in those 4 years after very little use . Had to throw them out.Filtration , the best darn water I 've tasted out of any bottle , or any other filter system . My soninlaw paid big bucks to gef an filtration system installed . Besides having to pay for the installation he pays $ 60 every 6 months for a new filter , filtration is as good as the Brita , no better . Well maybe by chemicle testing it would be better but who knows.The truth , I 'm going back to the Brita , why , filtration is the objective . Hope Brita gets their act together.PS : Pur reviews are teriible , Pur has the same construction problem as Brita .	-1
We have average water pressure and all we got out of this unit was a trickle of water . When the glass did get full the water did taste ok . The wait was not worth it . If you tighten the cartridge to tight it leaks .	-1
you have to run the water a while each time you need to use the water who wants to wait to get a drink of water	-1
Received my filter and installed it OK , but to my horror the flow of filtered water is ridiculously slow and the flow of unfiltered water not much better , both are unacceptable . Have read other ratings that bear up my complaint . No more water filters unless they do not impede the stream of water , particulary the unfiltered . IT IS GOING BACK TO AMAZON THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND GOOD RIDDANCE !	-1
Save your money ... I wish I did . Get a pitcher with a filter or PUR or Brita 's tap filter . I loved this the first couple weeks , but after that , the pressure is horrible on the filtered water . It takes over 5 minutes to fill a glass . I bought a replacement which improved the pressure for less than a week , and now it is worse than ever . I wish I listened to the reviews and spent a little more on a much better filter . Until I get a new one , I put a pitcher under this and come back 20 minutes later .	-1
I purchased this filter on the glowing recommendations given on Amazon and after years of poor quality PUR faucet filter units . Sadly , the Culligan does not fit . There are essentially two thread types on kitchen faucets : regular and small . Mine is the small external thread variety . The Culligan included no adapter for this ( although my old PUR units did ! ) and their instructions never even made mention of the possibility that a faucet may be of the smaller variety . One would think that Culligan -- if anyone -- would be cognizant of this . Hence , I never could install the unit and am sending it back to Amazon for refund . My one-star rating reflects my disdain over Culligan 's oversight of not including a minicule adapter . I guess I 'll never know if the thing even worked .	-1
The button to switch from filtered to unfiltered water popped off and I never could get it to work quite right . I should 've bought a Brita or something like that . Definitely do not recommend this .	-1
I have no idea if this product works or not . This Culligan faucet filter does NOT fit my Moen Faucet , so I 'm returning . My faucet is n't fancy , it 's just a regular faucet . I 'm disappointed.Thankfully Amazon has a wonderful return policy !	-1
Installed a new one about 3 weeks ago , after my last one cracked .Used the TSD water meter to test the water this morning.With this filter on I got 138ppm ! without filter I got 110ppm , with the large bottle from Sam 's club I got 88ppm and with polar spring bottle water I got 22ppm.So now I 'm not so sure what does this filter do , it seems to add stuff in to the water : -/	-1
I was all ready to purchase this bit set and read the reviews . Based on these reviews , there are three losers:1 ) Freud -- - they just lost a sale2 ) Amazon -- - they just lost a sale3 ) Me -- - I ca n't purchase the product that I want at a good price.Amazon shipping is still pitiful . I have made over 100 orders with Amazon , and my shipping and packaging history could fill a book . Hmmm ... maybe I can write a book entitled , `` When Getting it Right the Fist Time is Not Worth the Cost '' Amazon has ALWAYS made it right by shipping out replacement merchandise . But they really should get it right and learn how to use more than ONE piece of tape on boxes that are always oversized and poorly packed.UPDATE : 2/26/2007I broke down and ordered the set and it just arrived ... the unit arrived intact .. which was quite a surprise . There were two extra pieces of tape on the blister pack , so it seems that all this negative feedback may in fact be helping Amazon to get it right . The set is black not , not red as shown in the pictures . I have no doubt that it will perform as expected -- if not , I can always update this review.Since I ca n't update the rating for some reason , I 'll just state that it is up to a 4.UPDATE : 3/5/2007I used the bits a few days ago . Really slick . There is a range of cut sizes for the width . I would think that it should be documented . I 'll document the slot width range next time I get out the paperwork.I am glad I took the chance and ordered these .	-1
Yep mine arrived chipped as well . One day they might get the message . All they would need to do is tape the packaging shut	-1
Product seemed O.K . I guess . Was n't overly impressed with feel and quality of the product . You know how sometimes you open a package and are pleasantly surprised by the build quality . This was n't the case . I extracted it from its packaging and fit and finish seemed on par with its price . That is & # 34 ; just OK & # 34 ; Problem I experienced , and the reason I returned it was , one of the end base pieces was missing a hole for the bolt to slide thru to attach it to the center section of the base.So I did n't get as far as using it so ca n't address that in this review .	-1
It took me 1.5 hours to assemble due to parts misalignment . I had no problem tputting my mountain bike 26 '' wheels and hybrid bike with disc brakes 700cc using front wheels . Very poor quality product . One end is raised due to poor assembly . I 'll keep ( it too much trouble to disassemble and ship back for $ 18 item ) .	-1
product was not designed for easy assembly - it fits together sloppy and does n't lay flat without persuassion . I 'm not new to tools - this was just poorly manufactured in terms of the end user .	-1
Racor actually makes some very good products for mounting bikes but this is not one of them . Very flimsy construction ( the main pieces do n't even bolt securely together ! ) . It has to be leaned up next to a wall so I do n't see how this is `` freestanding '' at all . It would not fit 2 full size mountain bikes . I called Racor and asked if they could send me some kind of extension piece and they refused and told me to return the product , so I did .	-1
Unit is not free standing and needs to be anchored to wall . The arms are not as adjustable for female or smaller bikes to fully function .	-1
`` Entirely freestanding , no bolts , no screws ! `` Not quite . It wo n't even stay up unless you prop it up against a wall , for crying out loud ! At least once it 's holding a bike or two it stands up by itself ... in a wobbly kind of way . A small child could very easily destabilize it and tip it over , with potentially disastrous consequences.Another fairly major flaw of this rack is that the hooks holding the bike frame are not sturdy and bend easily.Considering its very low price , it 's relatively acceptable as long as you 're willing to bolt it to the wall ; just do n't expect to receive a rack that even remotely resembles the description made on the Amazon page .	-1
I bought a few of these to give a Christmas gifts and kept one for myself.Pros : It did n't cost much and was compact in size . I like the ease of inserting bits and the forward and reverse controls.Cons : This thing has almost NO power at all . It is good for removing screws that are not long or well-torqued . Otherwise , you will need to get out the old screwdriver in your tool box . In other words , it is almost worthless . Kind of like a pencil without lead . It looks like a screwdriver , sounds like a screwdriver , but does n't work like a screwdriver . Like I said , you get what you pay for and I should n't have expected more than what it was.Do n't buy this if you really need to use it .	-1
This drill is barely adequate for most of the jobs I use it for . The slower rotation means slower drilling . It seems under-powered for its size and not better than the tiny Dremel I bought it to replace.Make sure you do not select `` Price for all three '' as the bits in this offer DO NOT go with this drill.Bottom line , if you get this at a great sale price is will do an adequate job , if you are not in a hurry -- but make absolutely sure you get drill bits that fit this model.One nice feature is that it takes standard AA batteries .	-1
I bought this because I have the other B & D cordless screwdriver that takes AA batteries and really liked it . But it is in-line , so I could n't get into tight spaces with it . I thought this would be of similar quality . I was wrong . It is more expensive but feels like and performs like a cheap plastic toy . Do n't even think about using it as a drill or to torque screws down with any significant force . Spend a little more money and get a quality tool .	-1
I took it out of the package with the brad-point wood bit in it , put in new batteries and dried to drill a hole in hard wood bit gave up . It is way too slow and would probably drill the hole in five minutes but not me ; or get it for someone you do n't like	-1
If you 're looking for a portable unit for extremely light duty work , this may be your solution . Otherwise it is too slow and weak for anything serious.Actually it could be a huge success if they marketed it as `` My First Drill '' for 8-10 year olds . It is stronger than a Fisher-Price kid 's tool , yet not strong enough to do any real damage . Would be perfect for a young boy who wants to get a start in learning basic carpentry .	-1
I bought one from the local wally world thinking it would be nice to have a drill that used such convenient power source , especially since i have a 15 minute charger . i was disappointed , i did n't notice that it was listed as 130rpm on the back , that is absurdly slow . i had assumed it would be atleast close to the speed of my previous 7.2v drill since it was 6v , boy was i wrong ! it is great for a screw driver , but it is more or less useless as a drill , the cheapest cordless drill at wallyworld was a 7.2v kraftech that runs at ~600rpm for $ 14 , for 20 dollars you can get a corded black and decker that runs 1200rpm . I ended up biting the bullet and getting a $ 28 5.2amp corded black and decker from target and it came with a canvas bag . 1500rpm and uses regular bits , and best of all , it varies speed with trigger pressure , and no worrying about replacing expensive rechargeable battery packs . it should last for years . the hex bits this alkaline drill uses also limits how easily you can buy replacement bits . its harder to buy a single bit instead of a kit filled with things you do n't need . so really , if you need a new cordless screw driver and like a drill grip , than it works ok , but other wise , its a very poor drill even considering price . because of the slow speed i looked up information on my other black and decker screw driver 3.6v~ $ 15 , and it was 180rpm ! somethings not quite kosher when a 3.6v screw driver is faster than a 6v `` drill '' .	-1
I was convinced on this grinder . I bought it for one job and then took it with me for more heavy duty work , cutting bricks , sanding mostly . It felt well made , but then the rear bearing went out . Looking up tool parts , I see that there are n't any interior parts for this model , it 's considered a `` throwaway '' model , unlike my much older B & D ; 2750 , which still has parts available. [ ... ] I bought mine in the orange version at Walmart , same model , type 3 . I specifically bought it to use with thin diamond discs and it worked for me.One thing ( besides the unrepairability ) I do n't like is the lock-on switch . It caught something and jumped out of my hands one time and went flying , wreaking havoc and gashing my arm , though not bad . If it had a momentary on switch like the old 2750 , then it would have been winding down before it got to my arm.Blade guards in general protect a little , but not much . Lots of blade still exposed . This one is decent , spring loaded , not screw adjustable . for better or worse ? This is no better than an off brand chinese tool . I just hate to support the mentality of trashing a good tool for lack of brushes or one bad bearing . I gave it a little lower rating due to that.UPDATE : I want to add that I found a bearing that worked for this and fixed it . But now , I was using it for some light but continuous sanding ( knocking off the corners on boards ) and it got wobblier and wobblier . Checking , I now notice that the bearing sits in a plastic mount , so if it gets hot , it heats up the plastic and the bearing mount goes bad . This piece , of all pieces , should be metal . I 'm so irritated with this tool that I 'm avoiding all Black and Decker from now on . The design is ridicuous , does n't even save them much money .	-1
I bought one of these locally and was appalled by how cheap it was in construction . It was missing a part ( one of the slider blocks ) actually instead of two front and two back I had 3 of one and only 1 of another . A phone call to the support line resulted in a replacement a few days later , and I finished assembling my WorkMate . I 'd had another B & D WorkMate which I bought probably 30 years ago which ended up with my son . I wish I had the old one back . It was n't the chintzy piece of crap this one is . The new one is flimsy , hard to crank in and out , and the crank handles wo n't stay in . It 's difficult to fold shut and to open . Every time I used it I have to fight with it . I 'll definitely find something better once I get totally fed up with this piece of misery .	-1
I remember years ago my dad had one of these and used it a good bit . I recently had the need to clamp some wood together why gluing planks into fatter ones for table legs so last night bought this ( albeit locally ) . It is made in China . I doubt it used to be.The top wood is ply with a true bamboo at least on the top layer.Others have reported poorly fitting parts . Mine were fine except for one of the pins that refuses to go in all the way on the handles ( somebody else said he bought cotter pins and that seems a great alternative ) . Still , it went in far enough that it 's working . The only other problem is that on one of the top pieces of wood its edge is only perfectly straight about 90 % of the length . Close , but I plan on bringing it out in thickness with some layers of tape so that I can clamp more consistently.So , workmanship is not perfect , but I think it will do.To the table itself it feels quite sturdy . In regard to clamping force I really honked down on those clamps quite tightly last night and did n't have any indication that anything felt like breaking or giving way and looking at the construction of it -- assuming all the parts go together properly ( ! ) I doubt the thing would fail from over hand-clamping.Notice that each of the wooden join surfaces is ridged in the middle , this to assist if you want to hold something like a pipe.It 's $ 30 . I am not aware of anything better to clamp large surfaces like this . I have quite a few large clamps but for my particular need -- two feet straight of constant clamp force -- this does the job.EDIT : Sept/10 . I have barely used this since I bought it but this morning was clamping some wood together and the way the knobs are attached to a piece of metal ... this piece of metal flexes under heavy clamping so that the knobs wo n't turn properly . Anyway , I snapped one while tightening it . I suppose that 's what you get when you have plastic knobs designed to torque something down . I have learned a lesson in life : you get what you pay for with clamps . I 've now been collecting , at substantial expense , quality clamps from Lowes . They are expensive but I can really torque those bad boys down and no ridiculous snapping . So in conclusion an apology on original review ; this clamp table is a waste of money . If I still had the receipt I 'd bring it back .	-1
once again , you must read the tool review for an explanation . why is this company selling useless products , especially to consumers who want to make work easier ?	-1
This tool because of it 's price and apparent utility seems perfect for the professional.Everyone in the plumbing and electrical trades has long waited for a small , powerful right angle drill that does the job in tight places without breaking your wrist , arm or noggin.What we are trying to do is bore holes in tight stud bays to accomodate , water piping or electrical conductors : usually using auger bits . Drainage/Waste/Venting often requires the use of a 2 7/8 hole saw.There are several reasons why this tool may be far less than perfect to handle these jobs:1 . Right angle drills are most effective when using an auger style bit that pulls itself through the wood . Boring 3/4 '' holes with an auger tends to bog down this tool 2/3rds of the way through a pine stud . You have to reverse the drive direction to extricate the bit and then go at it again.2 . Once the screw on the auger has reached the other side - one must apply significant pressure to drill completely through . Often the effort to force the auger ( the rest of the way ) leads to the whole bit length travelling through the stud . If there was something that could be damaged in the next stud bay you would have to adequately protect it.3 . Hole saws and paddle/spade bits need to have force applied in line with the direction of boring . This is not the strong suite of the right angle drill when confined in tight places . Unless you can get your hand behind the head of the drill you will have a rough go.4 . The chuck and it 's key are both problems . The key does not mesh in the chuck adequately or is it large enough to provide adequate tightening for large bits . Because of this - the chuck tends to lose it 's grip on the bit and needs to be retightened often - too often.5 . The chuck key is attached to the cord in close proximity to the tool . It needs to be removed from it 's holder to be used . If it were mounted in an appropriate manner - towards the end of the cord it could be used without separating it from the tool - saving it from being lost.6 . The chuck has a problem tightening on hex shank and large bits - the hexshanks are prone to wobbling . Even when you get it right - the chuck soon loosens up and you have to play around with it again.7 . That LED light that will last `` forever '' turns on when the you apply trigger pressure . Would it not make sense that the light should allow you to align the bit before you start drilling - not after ? 8 . No carrying case ! I kid you not . Everyone who lugs their tools into the field knows the importance of the carrying case . It 's all about work/time management . You want a `` kit '' that holds the tool and all of the accessories that tool needs . The best designed carrying case will allow you to effectively manage the kit.8 . When I first looked at this item 11/15/06 it was selling for $ 159.00 . I purchased one on 2/1/07 for $ 178.00 . Now 2 weeks later 2/17/07 it is listing for $ 202.10.I can only hazard a guess as to why the price of this item has risen so sharply in just a few months : Recently the dollar hit a 6 month low with respect to the yen.Of course supply and demand . Based upon amazon reviews - I purchased one - as I am sure did many others , Increased demand - increased price.Unlike other reviewers - I found that this tool was not a good choice for driving screws in tight places . It just does n't have the low speed torque to do the job.I have had the opportunity to use a Milwaukee 0375-6 3.5 Amp 3/8-Inch Close Quarter Drill and have found it to be more versatile and a far better value $ 138.00 . It assuredly does a better job with paddle/spade bits and holesaws.Controlled driving of screws is best left to a cordless tool.caslo	-1
FLAWED DESIGN , DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ! I was looking for a saw to cut some door and window shims flush . I purchased this saw based on the positive reviews . However , I am extremely disappointed.I had read how the blade can come loose , but I assumed if I tightened the red retaining screw and was patient I would see success ; no such luck . The blade would continuously come completely out of the shaft rendering it useless.The problem is the basic design is flawed . The blade has an open ended forked tongue - & lt ; which slides into the shaft . The blade is then secured to the shaft with a red plastic retaining screw . Because this type of saw cuts on the pull , the combination of an open ended blade tongue and plastic retaining screw generate inadequate force to keep the blade firmly attached to the handle , even using a light touch when cutting the blade comes out of the shaft.The saw design is so flawed it can not perform its basic function , therefore I am being forced to return it for a refund , ( my first return ever ) .UPDATE : I was finally able to secure the blade using a pair of pliers to tighten the blade retaining bolt ; so I kept it . However I stand by my initial assessment , the blade retaining mechanism is flawed , and I do not recommend this product . The manufacturer should redesign the blade retention mechanism to be more like the Milwaukee utility kit 's Quik-Lok blade system : [ ... ]	-1
Although the individual templates are fine , this review is for the set . I bought this set several years ago when I purchased my Milwaukee plunge router kit . The kit is supposed to contain ( among other sizes ) a 3/4 & # 34 ; template and a 51/64 & # 34 ; template . Unfortunately , this sat in my shop for a couple of years but when I finally needed to use it , I found that instead of a 3/4 & # 34 ; and a 51/64 & # 34 ; I had two ( 2 ) of the 51/64 & # 34 ; templates . So now I need to either buy a whole new set or see if I can purchase the 3/4 & # 34 ; separately . Lesson learned ... If you do n't intend to use it right away , CHECK THE CONTENTS !	-1
Major issues : - Diameter too small - you have to trim the sandpaper to fit- Too light weight - bounces around- Disc cleaner is not attached - it spins , reducing the effect on the paperOverall a good idea that was poorly engineered .	-1
Ca n't remember why I thought I needed this sander sitter . You have to set the sander down in it perfectly or it spins off the bench . If using a variable speed on highest setting the whole thing will `` walk '' off the bench if you leave it running more than a few seconds . First time my sander hit the floor I was a little more than upset . The whole mech is too light . As for the cleaning aspect , with the new stearite disks you can get , here on Amazon and from suppliers like Klingspor , you are hard pressed to ever load em up anyway . It 's another one of those `` good ideas '' that just does n't transfer from concept to actual use very well . If you just really have to have one , let me know , I 'll send ya mine for the cost of postage . Ca n't recommend this one .	-1
I can easily say that Im a notch above being a `` novice woodworker '' and I have had this product for a year . I am finding some things that Ive purchased I use more others less . This I do n't use at all and find it taking up space it the shop . I too have read the instuctions1 ) it is a hassel and fustrating to have ones sander with rolled up edges . I found myself trying to accomodate the sander to the sitter2 ) Clogging of my sandpaper really has not been a issue unless I really grind the machine in the wood or wanting to remove too much material ( I use a belt sander for this ) 3 ) I really got suckered in this one I would of perferd buying another pack of sand paper or a clamp with the money I spent on this.Its disturbing to me that these types of woodworking products are being bought instead of an nice hand tool like a block plane or chisel which I am finding out I use a lot more and will last me a lot longer than this . I give one star for being fooled into buying it . I wont get fooled again .	-1
these bulbs say 100 watt but there not giving the voltage on these whyare they keeping it off the talk if there 130 volts these wont light up enough as a 120 volt 100 watt bulb . these are the new world order bulb and old home arent designed for the low wattage with the old fixtures . why not put there 130 volts or not tricky arent there . wake up to the new third world take over	-1
Technically , I suppose it DOES fit the saw . However , the supplied arbor wrench does not , nor will any combination of ratchet and socket that I could come up with since the throat opening on the saw interferes with getting anything other than a wrench onto the arbor shaft with the stack set up for a normal 3/4 '' dado cut . As popular as the DeWalt hybrid saw is , I ca n't imagine there are n't thousands of disgruntled woodworkers out there like me who are fuming over Freud 's short-sighted designers .	-1
I puchased this blade to replace an old wobble blade . I did n't mine the cheap case it came in as much as when ajusting it to it 's full width , it was to wide to fit on my arbor with a nut . After paying this price I expect it to work in all widths . I have a Delta unisaw , so I do not know what saw you would have to have to meet it 's full specifications ? I returned it .	-1
Horrible CS . I have bought from amazon for years but Timberline made some excuse about a price error and it was the price for one chipper blade only , blamed it on amazon and would not honor the sale . Amazon would not do anything to help on 3rd party sales . Amazon is usually very good on honoring their own prices , even if it was an error and the order was placed with them . Not so with Timberline.I have had good results with Freud blades and have sd508 and sd206 blades . Do not know personally about this set .	-1
The good thing is that it seems to be constructed well . The bad is that this pen light , with its dull fuzzy blue beam , does n't light up anything very well . It is very difficult for me to make out anything that I 'm looking at.No instructions or paperwork of any kind came with my light , and it took a few minutes to figure how to make the pen light stay on without constantly pressing the button . Sometimes when I 'm working in a dark area I hold a pen light in my mouth so I can use both hands.I finally found out , after a few minutes of experimenting , that you can just push the button in and hold it to get light , or twist the end where the button is located clockwise and it will stay on.I 'm glad it stays on when you twist the end where the button is , My tongue is n't strong enough to hold the button in by itself . But now that I know how it operates , I would advise a white beam , if you are trying to see something in the dark .	-1
Perfect in every way for its intended use , it would rate 5 stars , except for two things : 1 . It is WAY WAY TOO SMALL , even though it is relatively long , it 's diameter is strangely tiny -- you will lose it forever when it drops into some crack , and 2 . The weirdo , expensive batteries . Just wait until you lose it in the dark and you really need it !	-1
I purchased this to replace a medical penlight that had broken . Once I received it , the package had a warning on the back that said ... Warning : Class 2 LED Radiation , Avoid Eye Exposure.That ruled out using it for the nose and eyes of my children , which is why I purchased the light in the first place . I had to ship it back and purchase a different light.I wish someone had mentioned that in the product description . It is a very bright light and would be useful for other things where eye injury would not result .	-1
I 've owned eight Streamlight flashlights and only one still functions . My original Scorpion is still going strong after years of use as a Peace Officer working in the Criminal Warrants Division of a large law enforcement agency . I owned three Stylus flashlights and all of them quit or became glitchy . Five of the eight Streamlights used LED 's and the electronic guts in them just did n't last . I would n't depend on one in a survival situation .	-1
I have owned three of these and all three have done the same thing . Afer a month or so the light works intermittently and you have to shake it or hit it with the palm of your hand to get it to work . It seems like there is a loose connection or something . If it didnt have this issue I would give the light a great review but since all of the ones I have had failed in the same way it falls short of being a solid tool in my opinion .	-1
4 years ago I thought this was a good flashlight , but a lot has changed since then . For the same price , you can get better LED flashlights from other brands . Even Mag makes a better LED flashlight now . Almost any flashlight with either a 1- or 3-watt LED will be brighter and run off of fewer batteries .	-1
This light is great until you drop it or bump it then it just craps out . For the money the buyer has a right to expect a better quality , more durable , light .	-1
A flashlight seems like a simple device and they are available in various qualities everywhere . I chose to pay 30+ dollars for a 10 LED flashlight that the reviews here would indicate was expensive but nearly indestructible and could be counted on in an emergency . I bought this Streamlight 3C LED flashlight to have available in emergency situation and it failed to operate properly in normal use within the first 4 months . After a couple months of non use I found the batteries to be dead . ( the 3 C batteries were measured with a voltmeter and were at half their 1.5 full capacity voltage or less ) ( they were new and a solid 1.54 volts when they went in ) It appears that either the electronics built into the 10 LED lamp assembly are defective or the switch on the end has a bad connection which never quite turns it all the way off.Bottom line , , , , , , , , , , , I can not give this Streamlight Flashlight a good rating and took the time to come here and write this review so others can be aware that paying more does n't necessarily get you more.I 'll be looking for a less expensive flashlight from a local store for something like this next time as it is n't worth my time to package and ship this off to the MFG and wonder if they will ever send me a replacement.Life is too short , , , and in an emergency a light can mean your life ! **** Additional comments****Streamlight `` tech support '' spontaneously responded to one of my many emails for support and sent me a new 3C flashlight to their credit . ( I had written them I had given up and would buy a new light elsewhere ) I was pleased ! BUT , , , , , , , , , , I just went to use the new light that was fitted with new ( voltage tested ) batteries and placed in my toolkit , and you guessed it the batteries are dead and the light does not light . My guess is ( now ) there is some sort of defect in the 10 LED `` bulb '' component of the flashlight . As this is the identical problem as before it can be no coincidence and I would suspect that they may be aware of it but are still selling them , figuring 30+ dollars is too small an amount for anyone to hound them about . I wo n't be contacting them but once again took the time to write this so you wo n't waste your money on this particular light .	-1
As another reviewer has noted , the clip breaks easily if you are doing anything except sitting reading . Mine broke , but I recovered the light and used it for a while as a simple flashlight.However , the lens bezel started to separate from the body , and the light is now unable to stay turned on . I attribute both of these failures to a low grade of plastic that deteriorates with age , and a design that increased profits by making those parts too thin to have any strength after the plastic started to deteriorate.The light has always hung from a lanyard , so I have never carried it in a pocket or a backpack . So it has suffered no undue stress which would contribute to the plastic failure.My advice is to use this light for gentle indoors use only , and be very gentle turning it on or off . Or buy a metal flashlight.Streamlight 's warranty is worthless . I have not heard from them in the six weeks since I sent them the failed light.UPDATE : They did finally send me a replacement .	-1
clip wont hold onto hat and there is no pressure ring to make it hold the ball on the clip which if u bend over the light falls forward , this is not bright and very disa . on the quality , would not get again	-1
Clip broke putting on my keys for the first time . I do n't expect the swivel to stand up much longer . I think the clip is too tight . Would be tough to get on clothing , maybe jeans.I bought this to replace a Princeton Tec which had a hold-all-the-time button that I was tired of dealing with . The twist-on functionality seems a bit lacking as pressing down on the lens will also turn it on unless you are sure to twist quite far to the off position . I expect to see my pocket shining frequently , but may not be such a big issue.It also appears more durable to the eye than to the touch , but I imagine it will stand up to a pretty rough treatment anyway.In summation I think its possible to get cheaper , smaller lights that are just as bright/good . It should be plenty bright enough for any reasonable person though.I 'll write back if it breaks any worse than it already has .	-1
I 've owned eight Streamlight flashlights and only one still functions . My original Scorpion is still going strong after years of use as a Peace Officer . My Key-Mate quit after just a few months of intermittent use . Five of the eight Streamlights used LED 's and the electronic guts in them just did n't last . Do n't think I 'll ever buy another Streamlight LED flashlight ever again .	-1
I loved this flashlight when I first got it . But after the twist on/off did both in my pocket I 'd either have a flashlight on constantly or I 'd go to get change out of my pocket and come up with a small handful of button batteries . If it had a click-switch I 'd probably still be loving it .	-1
Purchased this in December and really liked it just as all the others mentioned however , while doing work in attic , it DIED . Just plain dead . Bulb wo n't work whatsoever . Talk about leaving you high and dry ... or in this case , high and blind . Own three Streamlights but really expect better performance from a $ 100 flashlight . VERY disappointing !	-1
I 'm using cleat flooring nails and found this tool completely worthless for setting them into hard maple . The tip is basically equivalent to a slot screwdriver , so it slipped right off of the nail head when aligned . I found a standard medium head nailset simpler and more effective .	-1
if you buy one of those cheap guns you will for sure need something like this . but save yourself some money , go to Lowes or one of those stores and buy a 3/8 or 1/2 '' cold chisel and then just grind a flat edge on it , you can get one for under $ 5	-1
The staple gun I bought ( the Bynford ) worked so well , I did not need this tool . I have an old screwdriver that works just as well .	-1
Spend a tenth of the price and get a regular nail set . This one slips off the cleat way too easily .	-1
I purchased a pair of Bessey KL13.008 KlikKlamps in 2005 looking for a clamp to fill a gap between Quick Grip one handed clamps , and traditionally styled F-clamps with acme screw threads . I tried them out in several different positions on a set of kitchen cabinets I was building at the time . I also used them on the edge banding of the laminate counter tops for line up purposes . I found them cumbersome to work with in any orientation other than the movable jaw placed in a vertical position above the work . Unlike my F-Clamps , they do not have a clutch to keep the movable jaw from sliding open when it is oriented below the work . This was the only flaw in an otherwise good design , but it is a major one . The only advantage they have over the F-Clamp is lighter weight . The weight advantage is more than off set by the lack of a means to preposition the ratcheting jaw , and have it stay there until you actually squeeze the ratcheting lever to tighten the clamp . If they did have a means to reliably hold the sliding jaw in position I would rate them 5 Stars.I put them on my clamp rack in 2005 , and they have been sitting there ever since . I actually forgot I had them until last weekend when I decided to remake my clamp rack , and found them covered with dust . I got them out and gave then another try on my drill press table . Unfortunately the clearance on the piece I was drilling necessitated orienting them with the sliding head in the down position . I finally stopped cussin , and picked up a 6 inch F-Clamp .	-1
junk tools , useless , the material is soft like noodle , only for light duty or DIY use , not for heavy duty .	-1
The quality of this tool is so poor , the little metal clips inside that hold the bit , stuck on me after 2 uses . If you want something to use with your zip gun like me , look somewhere else . It lasted 10 minutes in all before I had to beat my bit out with a chisel to free it .	-1
The Quick Connect sticks and the there is excessive wobble in bits when attached . Not for heavy duty work . Not sure if they want want you to use it , as it took forever to bust apart in pieces the the hard plastic packaging attached to it . Poorly thought out .	-1
These are great if you happen to get one that 's been manufactured/milled properly . I 've ordered 2 of these now from amazon , but am returning them . The 1/4 & # 34 ; chucks ( that go into the drill ) on both were milled out of square with the rest of the shaft . This causes the shaft to spin in a wide circle instead of a tight spiral . A co-worker of mine has one that was built properly and it works great ! I 've even used his to drive in heavy lag bolts . The metal holds up fine - it does n't seem to be soft , as other reviewers have stated.In short , they 've obviously got some quality control problems . Buyer beware !	-1
I boutght this and the 12 inch . The Quick Connect sticks and the there is excessive wobble in bits when attached . Not for heavy duty work . Not sure if they want want you to use it , as it took forever to bust apart in pieces the the hard plastic packaging attached to it . Poorly thought out .	-1
I order a refurbished sander and i got a sander that had a problem with the pad assembly .it is suppose to be adjustable and it is BUT it wont stay and moves . this damages my work	-1
I have had this nail gun for several years and it is junk , one of the worst tools I have every purchased . It misfires more times than it fires correctly -- double hitting , under hitting , you name it . You can disregard the reviews here for people that have owned the gun for 7 or 10 years stating they are great and made in the USA , because today they are made in China and done so poorly . That 's not to say that all made in China air nailers are bad and in fact I a 15 gauge to recommend that 's made in China . Just do n't pay a premium for this one assuming it 's in the upper range of manufacturing because it is n't . If you look closely at the nail guide and manufacturing , it seems a bit clearer why it performed so poorly . I also want to be clear that this was not user error -- it 's an oil free gun , I did n't oil it ; operated at correct pressures with an adequate compressor , etc . I finally gave up on it and bought a BOSTITCH BTFP72156 Smart Point 15GA FN Style Angle Finish Nailer Kit -- what a difference . It just about never misfires , the trigger point is amazing , manufacturing very tight ( yes made in China but well done ) , and very innovative and solid . Just a great 15 gauge nail gun that will speed your work . Whatever Senco was as a company a decade ago , you can forget about that when it comes to this gun . I bought mine in 2012 , so if they have improved since then , I would n't know .	-1
I have a DeWalt 744 tabel saw and I am very disappointed in this stand . The stand is poorly engineered to work with the DW744 so the saw does n't fit into the stand well at all.Rousseau suggests cutting the base of the DW744 as it extends beyond the table of the saw and they blame this for the saw not fitting in the stand properly . They then suggest trimming the base to fit . The idea that I would cut the base of a $ 500 saw to work with a $ 350 stand is ludicrous . Just design the stand properly in the first place . I spoke with two people at Rousseau and neither were able to assist.I was eventually able to cram the saw in the stand but it took a friend helping me ( along with a lever to gently push the base of the saw down ) . Unfortunately , this means the saw is pretty much stuck in the stand and if I want to take the saw anywhere I have to take this stand with me.The problems did not end here . Once the saw is in the stand you then have to use awkward bushings that are supposed to hold the saw in place . Guess what ? They do n't include enough bushings to level the saw with the top of the stand . Sure , it 's an inexpensive fix with fender washers but should n't all the parts come in the kit to begin with ? The next problem happens after the saw is sitting on the bushings . The bushings are impossible to position so they lock the saw in place because of a rounded bolt head preventing you from using two wrenches , which means the table saw can move inside the stand and we all know that the slightest movement means a poor cut . I 've temporarily fixed this by using some Irwin clamps and I 'm going to figure out a way to permanently keep the saw from moving but the idea that this is necessary at all is a giant disappointment . This stand is way too expensive for what you have to put up with . It 's probably worth about $ 250 all said and done.It may work better with other saws , but if you have a Dewalt , go elsewhere or plan on having to do some rigging to get it to work properly .	-1
They are no longer worth the money . Quality has gone down and parts prices have gone up . I have several of these , and every time one fails , it costs an arm and a leg to buy a new part . I have finally given up on DeWalt and just cannibalize another drill to get a part without going broke . DeWalt is useless in helping me with repair advice , and small parts are not available to the consumer . All they say is `` Take it to our repair service . `` Their battery packs are horribly expensive , too .	-1
B & D bought Dewalt to tap into the 'professional ' image market . The Chinese factories that make Dewalt are making Black and Decker side by side . Now that Dewalt has moved into big box retailers , they are focused on hitting the price points Big Box wants . Another annoying feature of Dewalt is that it does not provide torque ratings for its drills so that you can compare them to other brands . You can not compare a particular model Dewalt against Milwaukee , Makita , Hitachi , etc . until you actually use it . Fortunately , most retailers give you 30 days for evaluation . BTW , the DC759KA is the little brother to the more powerful DC720KA . As Dewalt finally follows the industry into Lithium Ion batteries , expect prices to drop for this older NiCD technology .	-1
Home depot sells an 8 piece set of Irwin clamps for less than half of the price of this 6 piece set . Both sets in clude 12 '' , 6 '' and 2 '' spring , but HD 's set also includes a pair of 2 '' miniclamp . HD item number is Model # 4935502 Internet # 202214073 Store SKU # 457896.You can get some real deals at Amazon.com , but this is n't one of them .	-1
I GENERALLY USE THESE BLADES FOR INITIAL CUT IN SHEET GOODS . WHILE THE CUT SPEED IS OK THERE IS A LOT OF SPLINTERING ON THIS PARTICULAR BLADE . WITH A PREVIOUS BLADE I USUALLY HAD TO FINISH TRIM LESS THAN 1/4 INCH . WITH THESE IT IS SOMETIMES UP TO 3/4 INCH . THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ON HOW MUCH YOU CAN GET OUT OF SHEET .	-1
This saw blade is the worst I 've ever seen about grabbing the stock and flinging it back at the user . It does rip cuts fairly well , but a cross grain cut using a miter gage turns it into a high speed projectile launcher . I assume the thin kerf design allows the unsupported end of the stock to rub on the body of the blade , turn , and get caught in the grooves between the teeth groups . It goes on a peg to be used for rip cuts only .	-1
Using this saw on my 12 '' Delta twin Laser for my rehab business , I have been dissapointed by it 's tendancy to burn and/or its durability . While it is certainly possible that I or one of my crew cut something we should n't have this blade has n't lasted as long as the two previous blades on my saw . Now when I try and cut anything wider than a 2x4 I get smoke , and If I am using the full crosscut capability we get so much that I need to open the windows.As I ususally do n't need a real fine cut , next time I will get something more durable and with fewer teeth .	-1
I was hesitant after reading some other reviews regarding blade deflection and reports of not cutting straight.However , I have been very happy with my other Diablo blades , and decided to give this blade a try for my 12 '' DeWalt saw.The blade is thinner than my others , so the kerf is smaller . I put in some scrap lumber and tried to produce the problems the other reviewers noted . I found with hard woods and thicker stock , if you push too hard when the blade enters the wood , it will deflect and produce the concave scallop just as the others described . However , if you allow the teeth to cut with less hand pressure , this blade cuts perfectly straight.So- keep in mind this is a thinner blade , and will deflect a little if you push too hard . Let the saw do the work.UPDATE : After several days of trim and finish work , I have found you really have to baby the blade in order to get a straight cut , and I am unhappy with that . In addition , a 45-degree bevel through a pine 1x8 was nearly impossible . Non-beveled cuts are much better , but I expected much higher quality.I will be returning this item and looking for other alternatives .	-1
I did n't need much range , just wanted to turn a vacuum on/off while I sanded my deck ( vacuum is connected to sander ) . However , the vacuum would turn off randomly as I sanded . I could press the remote to turn it back on , but it would eventually turn off again . When it turned itself off 4 times in a row after 10-20 seconds of being on , I gave up.This device is a great idea , but not reliable . It could be that the vacuum or sander actually produces some sort of EM that tricks the remote into turning off , since it seemed to happen mostly with the equipment running , which probably means the remote is using a really trivial protocol that 's highly susceptible to any interference .	-1
I bought this because its claimed range is 100 ' - more than many competing units . When I installed it in the fall , it never worked at anywhere near that distance - would work maybe 50 % of the time standing inside the house next to a window that 's about 50 ' from where the receiver is located ( outside in the yard ) .But here 's the worse part : as the weather got colder , the range decreased - a lot ! When it 's 20 degrees F outside , it wo n't work from more than about 10 feet away . Completely useless for my application ( trying to control outdoor lights from inside the house ) .I 'm an electrical engineer and understand the considerations with designing electronics to work over varying temperatures . Clearly the designers of this thing put in little or no effort in that area . For indoor use that might not be an issue , but outdoors = bad news .	-1
Turns off devices that do n't have a sleep timer . If the device does not require manual starting it will turn it on also .	-1
I bought two of these to control two supplemental devices to our security system ( a fake TV light and a fake barking dog ) . This was the only brand I could find that would turn on both devices ( located in two adjacent front rooms ) using either of the two identical frequency one-button remotes - each placed at two different exits in our house . Whew . Less complicated that it sounds.But sadly , these remote control outlets work sporadically even though the range we require from both remotes is less than 8 ft concurrently . One does n't get very good reception , so often one of our devices will turn on and the other wo n't - then they are out of synch and I have to unplug and reset the system . It 's a pain . The problem seems to be with the remote itself and I suspect things will only get worse as its battery wears down . I even had to replace one of the first units received because its remote barely worked at all.A bit surprised Skylink could n't get this right . I 've used their garage door remotes in the past without any problems and the technology seems rather similar . My needs were rather particular , but if you can get by with a higher rated model I would recommend it .	-1
I had great hopes for this remote switch . It did not have the power to work through walls as some had claimed that it could do . To bad , it would have been helpful . I returned it for credit .	-1
The unit was advertised to work at 100 feet as I walked up to the unit clicking it on after each step it finally turned on at 21 feet , totally worthless for my application , yes I 'm returning it .	-1
This is a typical nicad battery that is as lame as most nicads . I bougt it because I could not find a quality battery for my Milwaukee screwdriver and this was the only one available . Darn shame but next time I buy a screwdriver it wo n't have a nicad battery .	-1
Milwaukee makes great tools although they really blew this one . My 18v batteries have a life of about 6 months to a year and then they are complete GARBAGE . The battery cells go completly dead and there is zero life in the battery . I am very surprised at Milwaukee for having lousy batteries for their tools . I have other brands that the batteries last years and years , not this one .	-1
This battery is awful . Brand new fully charged will run on the milwaukee hatchet ( 6514 ) for may be 5 minutes . It runs even less on the cordless circular saw . It needs a sticker that say `` running hamster inside '' . What a joke !	-1
I have Milwaukee 18v tools and the batteries are dying one at a time . They will not take a charge . I wrote the comapny and all they could tell me was to place it on the charger overnight and give it trickle charge . Well I had them on the charger for a week and they are still dead . I have Dewalt 18v batteries and they have never let me down . I was out of the country for over a year and all I had to do was place them on the charger and I was good to go . I will not buy another Milwaukee tool again .	-1
The 18v NiCad was the worst of all . After it stopped getting charged , opened it , the cells had leaked and the terminals rusted . No hope of bringing it back . I am in the market for a new 18v cordless but no brand has impressed me yet . The three drills ( two 14.4v and one 18v- almost new as the two batteries died in about one year after I purchased them ) have been great but no batteries , the worst in the world . Bye Bye Milwaukee ! !	-1
Due to the inherent nature of Ni Cad batteries , Milwaukee , Dewalt , et al batteries , IME , do not hold up well . Fortunately there are companies like Voltman , and Batteries Plus , who will rebuild your old batteries with better , all though lower AH rated batteries . A lower AH rating should result in slightly lower torque , but I think that the 2.4AH batteries used by Milwaukee , Dewalt , etc. , must be over rated , because the 2.1 's used by Voltman and Batteries Plus are much better . Contractors who previously would share their batteries with each other , track and do not share their rebuilt batteries because they are that much better ! Some here say that Milwaukee is the only company with crappy batteries , but as far as I can tell and in my experience , they all seem to use the same crappy cells . IMO , rebuilding with better cells is the only solution to this problem ! Voltman charges $ 35.00 including return shipping , Batteries Plus , $ 49.00 , but they are a franchise , so even though more expensive , they may be more convenient for some folks . You can Google either of them . Batteries Plus may be in your yellow pages , and Voltman can be found on Ebay . I use a Milwaukee at home , and a Dewalt at work , neither , as far as I can tell , has good batteries , but the rebuilt ones are a BIG improvement , IME . While wildly more expensive , you can change over to Lithium Ion batteries which hold a charge for a year , and do not die if not charged monthly . For home users who only use their tools every few months , they are the way to go . Amazon has them listed as : Milwaukee 48-11-1833 V18 Multi-Pack 18-Volt and 28-Volt Lithium-Ion Charger with 2 18-Volt Lithium-Ion Batteries Combo PackThe charger must be purchased as Ni Cad chargers will damage Lithium Ion batteries . The charger in this set can be used to charge Lithium Ion and Ni Cad batteries though .	-1
I too bought the 18volt kit ... . about 400.00 if my memory serves me well . That was three years ago . I also got a third battery in the deal . After two years of minor useage the recip saw just quit . Then began the battery thing . I could not believe it . All three are dropping like flies . I have one left . These tools only were used in certain conditions not everyday . I have had 9 volt,12 volt , and 14 volt tools which the batteries work so much better and longer . I think the tools themselves are pretty good but just sorry batteries . What a shame .	-1
The bag is strong.Could be a little larger for the price.But im easy on my zippers.Mine unthreaded itself within 4 weeks use .	-1
I shoulda measured better . I thought I was ordering the bag that came with mt 4 piece tool set . Not so , this bag is much smaller , but very well made , not big enuf for portable saws but good for smaller tools like drills n hand tools . Dan Briggs	-1
This is junk . I tried it and it was worthless . The guide is awkward and I felt safer using a simple cutting disk . The plastic guard also makes it impossible to see where you are cutting . I tried it once and put on the shelf .	-1
Unfortunately this , like many Dremel attachments , is just too `` weenie '' for the job at hand . My mower blades wo n't even come close to fitting in the guide slot . Maybe a single push mower blade will ? Took off the guide and tried the stone by itself : OK if your blade is n't too nicked , and you have a lot of time . I 'm way better off free handing with an angle grinder . I bought my Dremel kit a few years ago , and am consistently disappointed with the tool . I have a LOT tools that I love , but this is n't one of them . I think it 'd be good for small craft projects ( which I seldom do ) , but for anything bigger there are better tools for almost any task - including sharpening mower blades . I also got sucked into trying the chainsaw attachment , but I get MUCH better results with a hand file .	-1
I love my dremel so this was a nice attachment to have and use . Well unless you remove the blade on the lawn mower it is difficult to use on the blade . As well as if your blade has any dings from rocks or nicks it will get caught up between the plastic guide and stone .	-1
I got one of these with my dremel tool . It works , but I really think a dremel tool is underpowered for sharpening applications . I spent some time trying to sharpen my shovel with it and finally gave up and grabbed a file and had it finished and a second shovel in less time and with far less noise . Let 's face it , neither shovel or lawnmower blades need to be as accurately sharpened as a knife and a file will work handily , cost the same and last longer .	-1
***UPDATE 2013***I may have a fix for those of you who have one of these that quit working . I opened it up and removed the spring inside and stretched it longer and then reinstalled it . My torch now works very well at this time . I ca n't say how long it will last but it has worked for the last 10 times I have tried it . ***Original Review Below****My experience with this torch is that it worked ok when new . Even then it had a draw back . The on/off switch does not stay put very well and if you have this in a bag or box with any other things ( tools etc ) in it , even if it is on top , the switch ends up moving enough to allow the button to depress accidentally and let out gas . This occurred to me while I was transporting it in my car driving down the road . This may not be a concern if it is in hour home on a shelf but I feel it is worth mentioning for those of us who need the torch in places outside the home . Lesson learned ? Transporting this is fussy and it needs its own separate box to be placed in.I use the torch sparingly , maybe 4 times a year . It seems the durability is not so good , because it failed to work after about 5 years . I paid top dollar for it at a big box retail store , and I expected it to perform commensurate with the price . I know I had it a while but I did not use it that often for any duration of time . I used it mostly for starting my pellet stove fire , not for soldering except the one time I transported it to a friends house to help with their water tank replacement . I guess it is subjective what we expect from a product , but I feel it failed too soon given the actual use.I am under the impression that the sparker part of it fails to make a spark and if it could be repaired , would probably work again .	-1
I purchased this item at a local big box store not from Amazon.Purchased this several years ago . It worked until last week , and has less than 300 starts . It no longer sparks and there is no way to open up the lighter to replace the flint.More than disapointing .	-1
Spend the extra money and get the upgraded model with an adjustable flame . It is very useful to have that adjustment capability . Also that model seems built better .	-1
I 've just spent the last 1 1/2 hours trying out the Bernzomatic Self Igniting 20,000 BTU outdoor torch . I 've never had a weed burner before but the magazine ads I 'd seen looked as though the tips on most were large diameter like a blow torch . Now I see why : This unit , at 20,000 btu , does n't burn off the weeds much faster than they grow ! I 've a not-too-long country driveway of gravel and I 'd like something that is more practical than Roundup or similar chemicals . We also have a 2000 sq ft vegetable garden and numerous rock-bordered flower beds ... all of which LOVE to grow weeds . I 'm sending this back to Amazon and ordering the Red Devil 100,000 BTU type . It 's reviews indicate that it 's much more practical for serious weed eating . However , if all you have are some sidewalk and patio cracks this should work fine . It has a fairly concentrated flame which would be good in cracks . I 'd still recommend you pay the extra money for Mapp gas cylinders rather than propane since it burns much hotter and will get each small weed ( say a 2 & # 34 ; diameter one a couple inches high ) in about 3 seconds . Just cook the stem part , do n't bother to disintegrate all green parts which will die to brown in a couple of days anyway .	-1
I have yet to figure out how to open up the band so that I can actually put it on my head . The color of the plastic is also confusing . I would not recommend this to anyone .	-1
It works well as a respirator but the blue rubber part leaves a tacky material on your face , It feels like silicon on your face.I washed it several times but it continued to happen.I stopped using it because it felt gross on my face and I bought a unit from North that does n't melt on your face.I kept it in my truck for an emergency and it turned to a gel , I had to throw it out .	-1
I bought this MSA Safety Works respirator and a MSA Safety Works refill cartridge from Amazon.com on May 1 , 2011 . My 49-year-old daughter uses it occasionally when she works with me in my hobbyist home woodworking shop . For a short while , the respirator worked beautifully . It then broke across the bridge of the nose . I knew nothing of any warranty , so , she has just lived with it . I am very disappointed . I DO NOT recommend this product . No warranty , no sale . Buyer beware ! As for me , I am old , so I just wear re-usable cloth masks . I bought them from a different seller . They work fine for me and I still have them . They did not break .	-1
That pretty well sums it up . Although it claims to be made in america the manual is so poorly written that I assumed it was an english translation of the spanish version of a manual written by the chinese .	-1
There is a lot , and I mean a lot , of assembly required on this product . There are twenty-one steps in the instructions , and thirty different components . This is n't a problem in itself , although I feel many of these steps should have been performed at the factory.What I really take issue with is the terrible quality of the assembly instructions . In one step , they use `` left '' and `` right '' both to describe things that are actually on your left and right , and also to describe things that are closer or further from you . I guess you are supposed to rotate yourself in between sentences ( and which way are you supposed to turn ? ) . In other steps they use `` lower '' and `` upper '' to describe things that are the same height . It 's a mess , with no consistent use of terminology or perspective.If you get frustrated with the instructions and try to call them , you 'll find that they only answer the phone between 8 AM and 5 PM , Monday through Friday . That 's not very useful for people with a day job.If I 'd bought this locally , I would have returned it out of frustration , but the cost of shipping such a heavy product makes that unattractive.Do yourself a favor and buy a different stand , or buy this one locally so you can take it back when you realize you 're going to spend several evenings figuring out how to put it all together -- and this is from an engineer , tool collector , and overall handyman . It 's just not worth it .	-1
I 've been struggling along with one of these flimsy , wobbly stands for about two years . I do major remodeling and use my miter saws a lot . The so-called convenience of this one was that I could roll it from place to place . Well , barely.Without going into all the things that are wrong with this stand , but one of them was the time one of the `` lock buttons '' failed to engage because the poorly-designed spring that 's supposed to push it out got cocked sideways inside the leg . With no warning , the stand collapsed , sending my new $ 400 Bosch tilt-slide saw over the edge of a deck . I could have bought the Bosch stand for what that cost me.Bottom line : I went to Home Depot and bought one of their Ryobi stands a few weeks ago for my litle trim saw . I had little faith in it because of the $ 97 price , but when I took it out of the box ( fully assembled ) , I was blown away . It is stout , well-designed , and the best part is that my huge Bosch saw fits on it perfectly and with the flip of two levers the saw can be comfortably carried to the truck so I do n't have to worry about rolling anything anywhere . I bought this stand to use under one of my small chopsaws I use for moldings and trim and ended up using it under my biggest saw . I 'm going to buy another one so I can send my old stand to the scrap pile , wheels and all .	-1
Stanley 60-060 6-Piece Standard Fluted Screwdriver SetWorth the $ 3 ... Poor quality metal will not stand up and last long . The wall mount is useless .	-1
6/3/13 UPDATE : The Phillips heads are useless . I have yet to find a screw that they 'll properly fit . Returning the set for this reason . END UPDATE.Stanley makes more than adequate products and Stanley makes cheap products . This screwdriver set falls into the cheap ... too cheap category . If these were n't sitting in my occasional-use drawer in my kitchen , I would have returned them . Had these been purchased for my garage , they would be returned . However , this set was purchased as a backup , emergency set for use in the kitchen and for that , I guess they 're fine.They are very lightweight and chinsy feeling . The blade heads seem flimsy and the Philips heads look ... weird . Like nothing I 've ever seen before.Not recommended . Even for $ 8 .	-1
you get what you pay for . I struggle to get them out of their holder , which does n't mount anywhere I can find in my apartment.Now , Sears Craftsman made a set of screwdrivers with a black , interchangeable handle , in a clear plastic pouch in 1980 , 33 years ago . That is still my go-to set of screwdrivers , even though a couple have evaporated . Too bad companies stop making the best products they sell . That 's the problem with the profit motive .	-1
These are some of the worst screwdrivers I have ever used . The Phillips tips do n't seem to fit anything , and are quickly ruined . The flat tips twist under very little pressure .	-1
You get what you pay for . I knew they were n't going to be a professional set but even after one use the phillips head screwdriver is already bent .	-1
I 'm done buying Stanley products ... They seem nice at first , especially for the price but I 've found out more than once with Stanley that you get what you pay for . As another reviewer said , Phillips bits break upon mildly more than light use and do n't seem to fit a whole lot . Which is the most likely cause for the early deterioration as I would assume . I 've used the flat heads much less often so I could n't say exactly how those are but if they match the quality of the Phillips I 'd invest an extra 10.00 into a much more decent set by another brand . For common light household use these might be alright . But any general automotive or outdoor use these are terrible . Just bought myself a 10pc set of Dewalt drivers at home depot for 20.00 with magnetic tips . I 'm absolutely sure these will hold up much nicer	-1
these came with a plastic holder but no box to pu them in . OH well , they 'll get the job done . descent buy	-1
It was way to late to file a claim when I noticed that the # 2-Phillips is simply missing , but this is disappointing nonetheless . In general , the quality is quite alright for minor everyday-fixes .	-1
I never had a chance to try the tape . Upon receiving the tape I pulled out a few feet to check the markings . I went to wind it back up and the winder fails to recall the tape . I 'm able to extend the tape but not wind it back up . I had to return this tape for a refund.Very poor quality control when the mechanism does not work right out of the box . Another piece of junk made in China.I 've come to accept that Stanley no longer makes tapes that last the test of time . I typically replace my tapes every couple of years when the winder invariably fails to unwind or wind . In contrast my fathers Stanley tape measure has been working great for over 30 years ! If anyone can recommend a tape measure they still make with the pride they made in my fathers day then please post a comment .	-1
The design is good but quality of workmanship is lower than the ones made in Finland . Should be good for a few runs . Fiskars should make more in Finland even at higher retail price.Edit : weeble wobbles . Do n't like this at all . Not representative of other Fiskars stuff , which are generally high value good stuff .	-1
Tried the Large , the hands fit but the fingers were way too long . Tried the Medium , the hands fit but the fingers were too short . I have never had trouble buying gloves before , so to me it is non-standard sizing .	-1
When I got these about two weeks ago I was impressed . They fit good and looked very tough . They are comfortable and the velcro strip keeps them on . I do a lot of outdoor work and was going through a pair of leather gloves about once a month so I thought I 'd pay a little more and get something to last longer . Big Mistake ! After only wearing these for about two weeks , and not a particularly hard two weeks at that , I notice they are already coming apart at the seam on one finger . There is so much stitching on these gloves it was inevitable that one would fail but I hoped not this soon . I would not waste my money on these again .	-1
Tried the Large , and the two fingers were too long . Tried the medium , and they were too short . Both fit in the hands . I never have had trouble shopping for gloves , so its just an odd fit .	-1
These gloves feel good and work well but lasted me about 2 weeks before a seem popped in between the thumb and fore finger.I work for fedex and use them for handling packages and driving . C'mon they should last way longer than 2 weeks.The smith and wesson shooting gloves I have used in the past are much better . I wanted to try these because the pinky and ring fingers are full length and I only need the other 3 exposed to handle my scanning pad and paperwork.Disappointed because they are supposedly designed for carpenter 's ? Waste of money unless you are only going to model them.The YOUNGSTOWN KEVLAR gloves are much better but do n't come in this open finger format.Also they make your hands sweat more that other materials I 've used and make your hands stinky .	-1
This heat gun failed to help me remove a thick layer of plasticized paint.The unit is built very cheaply , and the so called accessories look more like toys , than tools : made up of very thin tin.I would not buy this product again .	-1
It does exactly what a heat gun should , and it 's variable temperature . It includes lots of optional scrapers and attachment in the box.The only improvement I would ask for is a temperature scale in Fahrenheit for the American market. -- -- -EDITI tried to strip paint with it ( which it 's made for ) and it simply wo n't . Mine will run for 8 to 10 minutes then shut off and refuse to restart for 20 to 30 minutes . Unacceptable for a tool with `` Pro '' in the name.If you just need it for short jobs ( shrink tubing ? ) it 's cheap and will work just fine . If you want to strip paint , pony up for the Milwaukee , as it will run all day .	-1
Out of the box it was wonderful , beautiful ! Then , after six months , things went downhill . Issues:1 ) Aging : the power supply or gas became depleted : After starting the globe , the unit degraded to just a mellow blue glow around the center sphere , so,2 ) Support : I sent an email to Can You Imagine requesting information about 1 ) : Their reply : Your email is being forwarded to our Customer Care Department . One of ourCustomer Care team members will be in contact with you shortly to assist youwith the issue you are having.Regards , The Can You Imagine Service Team ( 800 ) 275-4624 ... .and they never replied , so I forgot the unit on my shelf , so,3 ) Glass : While moving a speaker wire , I hit the globe and it fell to the carpet . It made a noise like MMMPOKKKKK . I think that it imploded rather than exploded but the effect was to send glass shards ranging from 3 inches to microscopic over a radius of about 15 feet . This sort of thing happens but you have never seen a delivery system like this : The glass is extremely thin . Glass shards that end up curving into the carpet can not all be vacuumed and are just about invisible.What I finally did was put on hard leather soled shoes and vacuumed and walked around until all shards were broken into tiny fragments . Even then , I still get glass shards in my feet.Next time , I 'll get a lava lamp .	-1
I really drank the Kool-Aid with this purchase . The bag is severely cramped and the pockets are not laid out very wisely . If all you have to carry around is a few screwdrivers and some wood chisels it would be great , but I can not see it being practical for a professional trade 's worker . When a tool is placed in a rear pocket , space becomes limited in the front pockets . The interior top zipper pockets are a joke . All you can fit in those is maybe a carpenter 's pencil or a few jig saw blades . Both sides of the bag are the same also . It would be better if one side had pockets for pliers and screwdrivers , and the other side for more awkwardly shaped tools like a speed square , coping saw , etc . After a week I put all of my tools back into my old canvas bag . I could not even get all of my tools in the VETO Pro Pac `` XL '' . I wish I would have bought the Ergodyne 5815 . It might not be as durable , but it looks a lot more practical than this VETO bag . Now I have an overpriced bag that I ca n't use . . . . . . Maybe I can sell it on E-Bay .	-1
I 've had a couple of these bags for several months now . While they do feature heavy duty construction , nice handles and a great layout , I have discovered one serious flaw.The back of the rearmost , highest row of pockets are lined about halfway down with a thin , hard plastic liner . If this liner went all the way to the bottom of the pocket , it would be great.But this liner only goes about halfway down . And here 's the real problem : the bottom edge of this plastic liner is not glued or sewn down . As a result , if you stick any tools that are not tapered or smooth in these pockets , they will catch on the bottom edge of the plastic liner when you try to pull them out.I 've had this happen with magnetic pick-up tools , a specialized nail pulling tool and the new GearWrench ratcheting wrenches with two sizes on each end ( that stick out slightly ) . The wrenches were nearly impossible to remove and doing so left the liner permanently bent ( and therefor even more likely to catch on tools ) .Furthermore , there are many pockets that are the right size for pens , pencils , and things of similar size . But there are seams on the inside of the top of these pockets that create a lip at the top front of them . So , if you put a pen in with a cap , or something that has a ridge , it is very difficult to pull the items out . Caps from pens will get caught on the lip and come off in the pocket . You 'll then waste time trying to fish them out . Why could n't the seam be on the outside so as not to interfere with the items inserted in the pockets ? Also , some of the pen/pencil-size pockets could be a little larger . They 're all a little tight as it is.Obvious , easily-corrected flaws like this are unacceptable in a product of this quality and price . Even though I 'm aware of the problem , when I 'm concentrating on my work , I sometimes put tools that will catch in the back pockets.Did they even do any consumer testing with this bag ?	-1
I 'd give this bag 5 stars for the fact that it 's built like a brick SH , you get mucho durability for your money . But I returned mine . The shipping weight alone should have tripped a circuit in my brain - 8 lbs ! This is a heavy bag . If all you do is lug this from the tailgate to the jobsite - say 30 to 50 ft - you 'll love it . It 'll outlast you . But I work in NYC apartments and haul a lot of what I have to use to the site - and up many stairs . Plus , the design of this bag begs to be loaded with all the tools you have - even the ones you do n't need or use anymore . When it arrived , I had an epiphany ... I need 3 or 4 bags ( lighter bags ) loaded with specific tools for specific jobs - take what I need , leave the rest . If it fits your style of work I 'm sure you would n't be dissatisfied with the Veto bag - but it was n't for me . I wish the company made a bag that was to a 1/3 the size/weight . I 'd keep that one .	-1
I bought the drill 2 years ago.It was kept inside the house.I used it occasionally.It worked well.Now , neither battery will hold a charge.I am unimpressed .	-1
I bought this drill in Sept 2008 . It was billed as the best at the time - and it is a great drill as far as torque and quality motor/gear construction . My complaint has to do with the batteries ; they barely hold a charge now - and I expected better for a $ 190 drill . Replacement batteries are overpriced , so I have to replace the drill . I wo n't be replacing with a Panasonic .	-1
I was so pleased when I first got this drill , that I recommended it to my other hobby shop friends . But then the batteries did n't last as long as my cheap Craftsman drill , and now just 6 months after the warranty has run out , the motor caught on fire while drilling a dozen 3/16 '' holes in a 3/4 '' board . I 'm not a full-time tradesman , just a weekend hobbyist - this tool should 've lasted longer ! UPDATE : The manufacturer did a recall on the batteries and replaced them with longer lasting ones . Just for the heck of it , I reached into the bottom of my junk drawer , pulled out this supposedly burned out drill , plugged in a new battery that they shipped me , and tried it . It sparked , chugged , and growled for a spell , but then started improving . Its not like when it was new , but I have been using it for light duty work ever since .	-1
I bought this drill two years ago and I was a big fan of its excellent balance , weight , and build quality . The RPM 's were fair and the chuck was difficult to tighten , but it was a pleasure to use . I was also blown away at the lasting power of the 3.5 Ah batteries , that is until they recently stopped working after only 10-15 minutes of moderate use . Most reviews probably do n't capture this problem because most were written within the first year . I really liked the drill but I am extremely disappointed in the battery life . I am kicking myself for not following the advice from the few reviews that warned of this battery life problem . I no longer believe this was just bad luck .	-1
These were returned to the shipper because they were obviously made for a child . The quality looked good but I was unable to use . My head size is normal or just a little larger than the average .	-1
I ended up chucking them - they did act as a barrier to screaming in the middle of the night - possibly because of being prominently displayed .	-1
These are great earmuffs . They have great noise reduction , and I use them frequently for shooting . They are very comfortable and fit well.Update - after maybe 8 uses , these have already broke . There is a very cheap plastic `` c '' shaped fitting that attaches the earpiece to the headband . It has broke , so now one of the earpieces wo n't stay attached . In terms of sound reduction , these are still great . However , after light wear , they are already useless . Very disappointing .	-1
You ca n't tell from the photos because there 's no other object to give perspective , but these things are HUGE . Especially in the width of the ear cups . I mean , these things extending out more than you would ever imagine . It draws attention as if you have antlers . But even if I was n't concerned about appearance , I would not wear them because they are so width that they become a safety hazard by catching on nearby objects . Also heavier than I would like . I ca n't see these being practical in any situation . Get the yellow ones instead .	-1
I have used this for a couple years to monitor my usage on several appliances including a/c units , tv 's , stereos , computers and found it very informative and even educational . One day while using it simply as a voltage monitor in an unused outlet , I saw the reading begin to climb from 125V to 157V - I was able to confirm with several other meters that this was incorrect . There is no way to recalibrate the device - all the readings and measurement capabilities of the unit are worthless now . One could argue that I got $ 17 of utility out of the device ... . but then it really should have lasted more than 2 years of intermittent use as well .	-1
This device is alright but it 's really difficult to see at an angle . needs a light or light to see the display . You would think the designers of this would 've thought about that considering that this unit is going to be placed low , at the outlet , Does n't that just make sense ? Whenever I have to go look at this device i have to bring a flashlight with me ... . it 's kind of ridiculous . Also the kilowatt hour and time on should be integrated together .	-1
I am on my third one in a year , and it just died.Too bad . A little quality control would make it a useful product .	-1
I ca n't see why so many people seem happy with this unit.1 ) You have to be straight on to read the display.2 ) If you unplug it to look at the reading then it resets its memory.3 ) The buttons and display are difficult to read from above . Maybe all the other reviewers have their outlets installed at eye-level or above . Ours are are about 18 & # 34 ; from the ground . I thought that was normal.4 ) I have two replacement knees and I can not kneel easily . I was unable to enter or read any data.This device is a disaster in my opinion.Read the manual at http : //1drv.ms/1qbqYSI	-1
This was nice for the price , and gave me a good indication of the cost of my appliances . I would have liked it to retain a memory of the wattage by using a battery , even if the memory only lasted a few minutes because you find yourself having trouble reading the information on the device when it is in a hard to reach area.I bought this probably 3-4 months ago and now it no longer works , it cut the power off to the devices that were connected to it also . I would not mind paying a little more for a more reliable device .	-1
I bought 4 of these altogether , and found them very useful for measuring electrical loads . However , 2 of them have failed -- the LCD display goes blank . Fortunately , the device is passive , so that attached appliances continue to run , but the information is lost . One of my failed P4400s was returned to Amazon for credit , but another one failed after Amazon 's 30-day limit on returns . I wrote P3 International , but they never responded . Although I love the device , any manufacturer who does n't respond to a customer inquiry like this gets an automatic 0 stars ( 1 in Amazon 's system ) .Update -- all 4 have now failed with the same symptoms .	-1
This one does not calculate cost , you have to do that yourself ! The other one P4460 does . I did n't know there was a difference until I got this one as a second unit , so I returned it . The other is well worth a few more dollars more IMO .	-1
Died after 4 months of light use ( less than 300W draw at any time ) . P3 wants nothing to do with you if you need help .	-1
I like the Kreg equipment and do lots of pocket hole jointery , so this seemed like a great addition - but it is n't . The trouble is the clamp is very heavy , and is fitting into a small pocket hole . Clamp it too tight , and it blows out the top of the pocket hole , marring your workpeice - and the same can happen if you do not somehow support this heavy clamp . If you do get one , do n't use it on any surface that will ever be visable ( i.e . a hole you are going to fill with a plug ) and do n't use it in an area you do n't want marred . Pocket holes jointery is simple , efficient , and easy - this clamp is the exact opposite .	-1
I bought one of these Makita drills , took it out of the box , pulled the trigger and immediately saw that the chuck/spindle was misaligned . Put a drill bit in it and the tip wobbled all over the place . I thought Makita was better than this . Guess not .	-1
It 's really a bummer to be drilling along and have your drill start to catch fire.I was working outside in the winter at 10 below zero with a pair of heavy chopper mitts on so i did not feel the drill warming up until it started to pour out smoke . by then it was ruined and barely out of the warranty based on time . It was however only the second time I had used the drill . Garbage . I also see that several 2 star reviewers had the same problem ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I recieve this as a gift for x-mass . the sole is not flat - the front is twisted , the blade is not square will need alot of work to make even useable . spend more money and get a good one save you 're self some work	-1
While this Stanley Mitre box does the job , the materials used are on the cheap size and it does not have a sturdy feel to it . Would expect more from a product that Stanley puts its name on .	-1
It 's OK . It worked but when used to long the saw part slipped out ( I was cutting wood a 1/4 & # 34 ; or slightly less . ) When went to tighten up the & # 34 ; screw & # 34 ; It required a special pc . that ( hate to sat this - as a woman ) I did n't recognize .	-1
I bought just to have a small tape handy in the top drawer of my tool box at work . I used it a few times just to help draft out lines on projects , nothing abusive . After about a week the tape started to rip across at 2nd lug of the tip and fell off rendering the tape useless . I had my doubts about it and now know I wo n't buy another tiny tape like this .	-1
I thought this would be a good set to have , but it was a waste of money . Poor quality and fairly useless tools !	-1
This tool does n't lock at all . Still spins and still gets loose as you use even with it clamped down . Save your money .	-1
Mine do n't work any better than a regular wrench . I ca n't recommend this item . Buy a set of good quality box wrenches instead .	-1
Zero stars would be appropriate . I have an automatic waste can that uses `` D '' batteries . I bought these because they were out of Rayovac's.The `` DEAD '' batteries I was sent were in my waste can about 2 friging hours ( 1/12 of a day ) and they would n't even open the lid anymore.I sent these crappy batteries back and luckily they had more Rayovacs in stock . The first four Rayovac have been opening the lid for FOUR months now compared to the TWO HOURS for the Duracell.By the Rayovacs , they work and have power . They last for months compared to 1 Day for this crap . I have 40-50 Rayovac AA and AAA rechargeable batteries for many uses and they last for many years and cost about 1/2 the price of Bunny and Copper crap batteries .	-1
Now , these are supposed to be good according to the expiration date . After I replaced my fire detector battery with these the dead battery alarm started going off again in 1 day . I trashed the alarm knowing these were brand new with Exp date 2016 . Then I put one in a clock radio , no go . ALMOST trashed the clock radio but figured I better test the battery first . Sure enough , NO CHARGE on any of these !	-1
I have bought dozens of these over the years ( they get replaced because I misplace them ) . I recently ordered four more and the new design make it really hard to remove the main shaft from the handle . Almost impossible when you are in a hurry . The bits come out too easily too , so when you try to pull the shaft out , the bit usually comes out instead . No more Stanley screwdrivers for me !	-1
Should have read the reviews . They do not stick and I would not buy again , recommend or even gift . Bad purchase .	-1
I saw the poor reviews of this , but the price seemed good enough to take a swing at for a vent on the floor I needed to block . One of my vents blows extra hard in a space I have no use for so I wanted to block it with these vent covers . A single one of these covers could not stay on the vent , even with gravity assisting it . I ended up using all 3 on the same vent to use the weight to hold it down . The magnetic hold is very weak , I ca n't imagine these working on a ceiling vent at all .	-1
These do not work on vents that are on the wall , because they are cheap and flimsy and do not stay put . They also warp from the heat . What a waste of money	-1
I should have listened to all of the other reviewers . The magnets are not strong enough to hold these to a register . Your only hope is if the vent is on the floor and the air flow is blocked off some other way first . Even when the vent is closed , the small amount of air coming past is still enough to lift these off of the register..After discovering this , I thought that I would use these for another purpose . I cut them into strips and made magnetic labels for some metal shelving at work . However , the same problem persisted . They would only stick to the shelf as long as no one walked past them and brushed them with their sleeve.I do n't think there is any possible use for these . Sorry .	-1
While these do work , they wo n't stick to wall or ceiling registers . I knew that going into it given the other reviews , so I purchased a number of small neodymium magnets , and I use those to hold these on . With that addition these stay on well and work fine . Depending on where the lever is to open or close your register , you might choose to cut the cover to fit . The magnets I used are Magcraft NSN0802 1/2 & # 34 ; x 1/8 & # 34 ; rare earth magnets - they come in a 14 pack , which is enough for two to three covers .	-1
There 's a very cheap solution for this . Just use plastic wrap or aluminum foil . Remove the vent , close it and cover the rear of the vent . Then , replace it.This method seals the vent 99 % . It 's definitely better than any magnetic cover and will not stain your surfaces black !	-1
Attempted to use one on a ceiling vent , unfortunately these lack the strength to hold themselves up for any length of time ( & lt ; 10s ) Unscrewing the cover and putting it on the backside was pretty effective , but that 's little better than just a piece of cardboard .	-1
I found these covers stick to my refrigerator fine , but to a vent , NO . Finally removed the vent entirely and taped a cover to the back , which took care of the too-cool air blowing on my wet feet . But a waste of money ; I could have used cardboard and saved my money !	-1
These would only be suitable for a floor vent , so you would not have to depend on the magnetism to hold them in place . Their weight and the whisper of magnetism would hold them on a floor vent , but NOT wall , and certainly NOT a ceiling vent ! ! ! I thought the reviews might allow me to use them to cover vents under the house , but the only way they worked at all is by my adding some magnets at strategic points ! NOT worth much ! !	-1
Purchased this and it was delivered quickly . However , the product had a yellowed top cap with stress cracks . It had flashing that was not removed after manufacturing it which was all over it . Obviously no quality checking and the tooling is old . The company refused to replace just the top cap and wanted me to return the whole item for a replacement . That would waste my time and money , when all they had to do to make me happy was to ship a new top cap . But they did n't . The product does work well however , but we 'll see how it holds up in the winter . Plastic could be brittle .	-1
I have owned this product for about six months and I have tried several projects with it . It is , in a word , worthless.The biggest problem is the paint nozzle gets clogged up while I am spraying . I have used various types of paint including Kilz , and Bear . This was acrylic latex paint , white usually . I have even tried thinning the paint to make it work longer , but no use . It has clogged up after spraying for 10 minutes or so.This is not a cleaning problem . I spray thinner ( water in latex 's case ) through the sprayer until it comes out clear , and do the same with the priming cycle . When I am done there is no evidence of paint . I disassemble the sprayer and clean it , as well as the outlet valve . Everything is as clean as I can make it before I pack it away.Other problems : the gun leaks at the handle unless tightened to a max degree of force , cleaning the bin and cleaning in general takes an enormous amount of water , the spray is heavy at times and light at others , the hose is like trying to control a vehicle suspension spring as it is difficult to move ( it is not like an air hose - this hose is not flexible ) , the paint bin is hard to empty , the `` nut '' holding the outside part of the exit valve is a very large size and finding a wrench to take it off to clean it will be a problem unless you are an auto mechanic that works on diesel trucks ( the 16 wheelers ) , the cord to the unit is very short which means I had to use an extension cord every time I ran the machine , the unit pulls a lot of power and I tripped breakers more than once ... I could go on and on but the reader will understand by now.The paint crew is a poorly thought out and poorly assembled product that NO one should buy under any circumstances . I regret the day I saw it and I truly regret the day I purchased it .	-1
I would only use the thing outdoors or for large interior jobs with an unfinished floor -- at least that is where it would do the smallest harm . I spent much more time prepping and cleaning up after the thing than I would have spent doing my interior painting with a brush and manual roller . It springs leaks freely ( dealing with its messes during the job is like following after a puppy that is n't housebroken ) , oversprays ( even with ordinary latex paint ) , clogs easily , and requires rigorous flushing between uses to protect parts from rust and prevent clogs . I used the product primarily to repaint large interior areas of rough brick , but it performed poorly . I had to immediately follow with a roller to correct drips and ensure that the paint covered the mortar and indentations in the brick . ( I finished the rest of the job using a professional grade sprayer that I borrowed from a friend . ) The Wagner product would be of negative utility for an ordinary size room with drywall that can be painted with a brush and common roller . I bought the sprayer for $ 199 . I gave it away on Freecycle . I did n't think it conscionable to inflict it on someone who parted with cash .	-1
I still do n't understand what Wagner took a very good design , like the 1620 which I now have , and said `` screw it '' . The hopper on this machine is probably the dumbest thing in engineering I have ever seen . It makes it impossibly hard to clean this thing within a reasonable amount of time . I spent and hour and fifteen minutes one time just cleaning this thing . Even cleaning it thoroughly does not mean that it was cleaned thoroughly . You will have something left over in the machine which will destroy it . Even with this cleaning process after about 20 gallons of paint including drywall primer and kilz primer , it failed . I hate to waste 200 so I will get it working again only to sell it to someone else.Do yourself a favor . If you are going to paint anything either get a pro model 1420 , 1620 or 1920 or get one of those hand held sprayers . Do n't waste your time and money on this machine .	-1
This blade does not cut 12x12 or larger tiles straight . It flexes way too much for my liking and that obviously has something to do with cutting straight . It is also not possible to shave 1/16 '' or less off due to severe blade flex , it just makes a mess of the tile . This is the thinnest kerf blade I own . I now assume it cuts faster with low powered saws but it 's not a blade I would buy again as my saw has plenty of power and cuts straight with most all other blades .	-1
Blade cuts clean , but it is so thin it tends to curve during the cut . The other blades we have had did n't do this , and I 'm certain we will not buy this blade again . If you are cutting a great deal of small , 6 x 6 '' tiles or smaller , this is good , but not for 12 x 12 or larger .	-1
This tool never even made it onto the jobsite . Just testing in the workshop proved too much ! The chuck spun out of round , and the motor was taxed and stripped trying to run a 3/4 auger . Even a large Irwin speedbore proved too much . I am O.K with a drill not being able to spin a bit-I will back off and try a smaller size . But this tool just seems to strip the gears way too easily . I tried 2 of these , figuring I might have gotten a lemon , but 2 lemons ? The gears sound like they are cheaper quality . I think next time I will look at the small Makita corded or perhaps the Hitachi corded or cordless .	-1
I bought this to go with my cordless 20v Dewalt set of tools . This might not be so much the fault of the blade , as it is the fault of the reciprocating saw in the set . Since there is no adjustment for the blade guard , you will do all of your cutting at the same location on the blade , and wear it out faster than you would if you have an adjustable guard on the saw . If you have the same set of tools , or any recip saw that does now allow you to adjust the cutting location on the blade , then you will find that the blade wears out in the only location that you can cut with , and the rest of the blade is still perfect , but utterly useless.I have used other brands , with far better results , these are throw away blades , in my opinion .	-1
All the blades I normally use , in one place . Good quality blades , handy carrying case . Teeth hold up well under all conditions .	-1
no comparison to the Gecko gauges just cheap and flimsy ... if your a one time install they i guess you might get by with these but if your a two man crew skip the product and make facing gauges out of plywood . If your a one man crew get the Geckos instead .	-1
I needed these for installing LP SmartSide-12 '' width . The `` hook '' end of these were not wide enough for the SmartSide ( James Hardie is slightly thinner ) , and they would not work for anything BUT a 1 1/4 '' overlap.I have tried several brands with no success until I tried a brand sold here called SoloSider ( see my review for them ) .These , like most Malco products , are quailty built , but will only work for certain siding and a fixed reveal/overlap .	-1
I had this drum/thickness sander for over a year and thought it was really good UNTIL the table raising and lowering mechanism got out of alignment . As other reviewers have noted , this is a common problem with this machine . I spent around 14 hours of my own time trying to adjust everything properly following the instructions in the manual and gave up in complete exasperation . I took it to the warranty repair shop here in town and after working on it awhile THEY GAVE UP also . They had ordered some new parts and tried to get it back to functioning , but they simply could not get the table to raise and lower.Fortunately it was the X5 version with a 5 year warranty so in the end I was able to get all my money back and purchase a Jet/Performax 22-44 which I like much better . My advice , DO N'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THE DELTA !	-1
Was n't what i expected . Not as well made as my original 6 ' and 18 '' Stabila levels . The surfaces do n't look well milled at all and they feel bit cheesy to me . They do work and I guess thats what counts but I guess I got what I paid for . Not the great deal I thought I was getting.I might think twice before ordering Stabila products again . I ordered them thinking ALL Stabila products were as good as the ones I 'd purchased in the past . Not so ! I 'm considering purchasing a good small Laser level being that my DeWalt LL is just too big and cumbersome for my purposes at this point and thought about ordering Stabila 's but not at this point . I 'm afraid of what I might get .	-1
The so-called `` bi-metallic '' design of these blades refers to the fact that the blade itself is a different type of metal than the spot-welded plate the blade is attached to . It does not imply that the cutting part of the blade has two types of metal.It would make sense for any high-speed power tool to make the blade of HSS steel to withstand the heat . But these do n't . At this price , they could give you carbide-tipped teeth or at least induction-hardened teeth . Even Japanese HAND SAWS have induction hardened teeth ... why not these ? Profit . Not just an honest fair profit , but exorbitant greedy profiteering profit . That does NOT mean these are bad ; they are just overpriced.Do n't imagine they have you over a barrel though . The metal in these blades is soft enough that you CAN re-sharpen them ! I do that with diamond needle files . Even with youthful vision , you need high-power magnification and good lighting . Nowadays , I have to use magnifying glasses AND a jeweler 's magnifying lamp . It only takes a few minutes of careful filing and the edges come right back though ! One note : The `` precision '' Holz blade ( for wood ) pictured here on the right has a slightly different tooth-geometry than the other two blades . The others are very simple to sharpen , just like rip-cut hand saws , only much smaller . The `` precision Holz '' blade 's teeth are similar to Japanese crosscut teeth , so they are more challenging to sharpen . If you 've ever tried to sharpen Japanese saws , you will know what I mean . You can get small diamond files cheaply , but I have yet to find any file slender enough to file the `` precision Holz '' style teeth effectively.I know some pro-remodelers who swear by their Fein MultiMasters , but they go through blades fast , especially when cutting abrasive materials . That 's why I got interested in sharpening these things in the first place . I do n't have much use for the oscillating tools myself , so I do not have much experience with them . But I do know this ... Now that the patent has expired on this type of tool , Fein no longer has its strangle-hold on the market . You might have seen the battery-powered model that Bosch makes or the Dremel powered model . What you might not yet know is that you can get a beefy powered model from Harbor Freight tools for forty bucks and it is remarkably similar to the power and durability of the higher-priced competitors . It is n't pretty and does not have the nifty quick-blade-change feature of Fein , but it cuts exactly the same.Another money-saving tip ... The cheap tool does not have nibs to fit the star-shaped holes in these Fein blades . If you attach them with screw-pressure alone , they have a tendency to slip.No Problem ! Just dab a little Loctite screw compound on the blade , screw it down firmly and wait one minute . The blade sticks well enough to hold in place , but will come off easily enough when it 's time to replace it . Also , the replacement blades that Harbor Freight sells are substantially less expensive , yet are of similar design and quality ... which is to say , not great . But hey , if you just need the tool once in a while , it works just fine ... not Fein.. but FINE . ( Sorry , could n't resist ; - ) My buddy keeps TWO of these cheap oscillating saws on hand for renovating bathrooms and kitchens . Instead of switching blades , he switches saws . On one saw he keeps a metal-cutting blade for pipes and such . The other sports a larger semi-circular blades for tile and grout . At forty bucks a saw and seven bucks per blade , both saws and blades cost less than one Dremel or Rockwell version , and MUCH less than the good but expensive Fein . He keeps both saws plugged in and can switch between them faster than any quick-change mechanism can switch blades . He learned to sharpen some of these blades and does n't even bother removing the blades to re-sharpen them . He just clamps the whole tool to his saw-horse , or holds the thing in one hand while he sharpens with the other . He has been using those tricks for over a year now ... same blades , same cheap saws . No problems other than blade slippage , and the Loctite took care of that ! So ... bottom line . If you are not a pro and do n't need the quick change feature of the expensive Teutonic tool , get the cheap one and the cheap blades . Use Loctite Sumu-glue or Loctite Red thread-locking compound to hold blades securely.If you are a pro and must have the superb Fein tool and expensive blades , get a set of cheap diamond needle files . They will work on most of the blades and you can save a ton of money on blade replacement .	-1
What can I say exept this thing really needs more development . Sound waves seem to be very unpredictable . After almost screwing up an important carpet cut I decided I ca n't trust the straight line . I immediately returned the straight line . Now I 'm shopping for a true Laser Range Finder .	-1
... this is a good example of `` you get what you pay for , '' I suppose.This alleged `` laser tape '' actually uses a sound wave to take its measurement , the laser beam is there mainly for underhanded marketing purposes to mislead you into thinking that you 're buying far more advanced technology than you 're really getting.Of course , sonar is notoriously unreliable for this sort of application , and therefore it is hardly surprising that it delivers kinda-sorta accurate rough measurements in all of maybe 3 out of 10 tries . All sorts of environmental factors can easily throw it off : the color , texture , and shape of the object you are pointing it at ( flat 90 degree white walls seem to enjoy about 60 % efficacy , the highest I ever got with it ) , exterior noise conditions , how much open space there is around you , etc.Really the only thing this sonar tape really does well is serve as a bulky , clunky and noisy ( it makes a clicking sound during operation , which I wish I could disable ) laser pointer -- -the 9V battery does last a bit longer than the tiny little watch battery that most pen-size laser pointers use.Thank God the home improvement warehouse I bought it at has a great return policy !	-1
This is not a `` Laser Tape '' . It 's an ultrasound distance estimator ( based on the same wildly inaccurate echo technology used in those old Polaroid cameras ) with a laser sight attached to it . And just like any ultrasound distance estimator , it 's inaccurate to the point of being worthless . The laser is essentially a laser pointer slapped onto this contraption , apparently for no other purpose than to be able to print `` LASER TAPE '' on the packaging , misleading the unsuspecting customer into believing they were buying a laser tape . Not quite : it 's an ultrasound `` tape '' with a laser attached to it . In other words , it 's twenty bucks flushed down the toilet.Spend the money and get a proper tool such as the Stanley TLM11 FatMax . It 's amazingly accurate and will really save you time and effort . Or , if you ca n't justify the expense , just stick to your old tape . You will get nothing but frustration from this `` Strait-Line '' piece of garbage .	-1
This thing is little better than a toy . The accuracy of measurements is accurate but only some of the time . I often get a reading of & quot ; Err & quot ; when trying to check distances . And other times I 'll get wildly varying readings . I 'll probably be returning this as defective .	-1
I got this tool because I LOVE the laser level and it works so well - NOT so with the laser tape ! I guess we need a little bit more technology before something like this can be very useful as a household tool . When its low on battery especially , it gives wacky numbers that are nothing close to the actual distance ! It also does n't work well if you have patterned wallpaper - it needs a solid surface ! When it does work , it only measures to the closest inch - anyone who has done home repairs knows that is n't nearly close enough ! An inch might as well be a mile ! I do n't recommend this product .	-1
I received this as a Christmas present from my daughter.Unfortunately this expensive trinket is worthless.Measurements are inconsistent and inaccurate . The tool is also a pain to use . Do n't waste your money .	-1
The main reason I started buying Bostitch tools last year was for the 7 yr warranty . Now I know why they have to offer it . I bought a floor nailer -- broke the first time I used it . I bought a coil siding nailer . It 's still working OK ... only been about 18 months and I do n't use it much . Bought a Bostitch framing gun ... and it 's been OK as well.The Bostitch roofing nailer I bought last year has been a disappointment . I 'm not a professional roofer so this does n't get heavy , daily or weekly use . I 've used it to put on two roofs so far -- neither of which was particularly large . On only the SECOND roof , this gun started mis-firing and jamming up . So , I bought a Milwaukee to finish the job and it 's been working fine so far ... though , again , not heavy use yet.Sure , Bostitch has a 7 yr warranty . I have n't had time to drive the THIRTY MILES to the closest authorized Bostitch repair location ( strange how they chose a place that is 30 miles outside of one of the largest cities in the country ( Houston ) , instead of a centrally located place like Circle Saw ( who does factory service for many other major brands ) ... . I guess if you make it inconvenient enough to get your tool serviced , you save a lot on repair costs.7 yr warranty or not , if I ca n't rely on the tools , I 'm not buying any more of them . I hope you 're reading Bostitch ... because you 're taking the same road to the bottom that has destroyed the Maytag brand ... .	-1
I have a Jet 14DXPRO and it will not fit . I wanted access to tension release from the front on the right side and it will not fit in the saddle as it is not wide enough for my saw . It apparently fits a General what ever brand that is but it will not fit the 14DXPRO	-1
I 'm an aging finish carpenter . My younger colleague showed up with this cute compressor to run his pin nailer for a kitchen cabinet crown installation and it seemed to do fine . So I bought one to save my aching body some of the pains of portage . I figured that since I 'm a guy whose colleagues have always teased about & # 34 ; doing damn nice work -- -and not much of it , & # 34 ; it would be perfect for my slow pace and intricate work.However , handy as it was to lug on site , it did n't seem to keep up very well , possibly due to a leak I could not locate . It also seemed to make a very tinny sound when running -- - I kept feeling like I 'd discover a loose fastener somewhere in the motor ! Anyway , I did n't spend the little money involved for the privilege of doing detective/mechanic work , so I returned it and looked into other options.Glad I did ! Bostitch offers a similarly designed model with only slightly greater size and weight , but twice the technical specs across the board . I bought Bostitch Trim Air ( model CAP1512 & # 8209 ; OF ) for about $ 120 at Menard 's . ( Oddly , this in-store price was much better than any I could find online ! ) Absolutely great little compressor , readily keeping pace with my pin nailer and my Senco Finish Pro 41 finish gun . These little compressors kick on a lot by design ( tiny tank ) , but this one really gets the job done.BTW , the young guy who bought -- - and is generally happy with -- - Senco PC1010says he wished he had found the Bostitch before he bought the Senco . And FYI , this current review is from a professional carpenter who has stuck with Senco for all air guns for four decades . BUY BOSTITCH CAP1512-OF .	-1
I have these installed in a garage door opener . In the cold winter they do turn on instantly but take forever to get to full brightness and at full brightness I do n't think they are any brighter than the 60-watt equivalents they replaced . Will not buy again .	-1
These bulbs are very dull in color.Not the same soft white as old Incandescent bulbs.The Color Temperature on these bulbs is 2700 Kelvin.Way too dull for my taste.I changed these to bulbs to 5000 Kelvin , giving off a brighter white.This is not GE 's fault by any means , I simply prefer a Brighter 5000 Kelvin Bulb .	-1
As I am a professional handyman/remodeller , I 'll use a reciprocating saw several times in my typical week . I purchased my Porter-Cable 9750 from this site about five months ago and by now I have used it for many common tasks such as demolition , hole cut-out and edge trim-off , pick-up framing , pipe cutting ( all kinds ) , and much more.Before owning this saw I owned an orbital-action Milwaulkee Sawzall which I broke after 3 years of use ( and abuse ) . I was swayed to purchase the Porter-Cable by the glowing reports of 'impossible ' angles you could cut ( see reviews below ) . Several times a year , I would run into just the sort of cutting problem this baby seemed designed for . I just could n't wait to give it a try ! Well , by now , I 've found the saw has much-too-much 'chatter ' to ever be pleasant to use . Even in its 'straight-body ' ( normal ) orientation the saw uncomfortably vibrates in your hand , and the neck feels 'too wide ' to hold securely for long periods ( in my admittedly small hand ) . When you twist the nose to get the odd-angle cut the vibration goes from 'not so good ' to just plain 'pretty bad ' . In my 5 months of using it I have *always* found it difficult to start any cut cleanly . To do so I 've often had to resort to hand-sawing a pilot groove - something I just hardly ever needed to do with my Sawzall.Demolition work is a drag with this saw . Due to the vibration and relative nose-heavy feel 2 hours with it will tire you as much as 6 with a Sawzall.Do n't want to make a deep cut ? Usually you put in a short blade and extend the shoe . But the shoe extension in the Porter-Cable is pathetic ( just over 1 '' ) - about half of what a Sawzall 's extension will do ( that one is too short also , just much less so ) .I do n't like the Porter-Cable 's plastic case as much as Milwaulkee 's either . Oh it 's sturdy enough , but there is not as much room inside for the power cord , extra blades , or what have you.And finally , what about that vaulted odd-angle cut feature ? Well I found that many of the odd-angle cuts I wanted to make I could n't , even though I did manage to get the saw positioned . Whenever I was reaching out and could not use both hands firmly on the saw the rough startup action would cause the blade to just jump & poke all over the place - completely useless . That said , there were some cuts I made which did save me 1/2 to 1 hour ( or more ) of time vs. the alternate ( manual ) approaches.Would I buy the saw again ? Not likely . If I had money for only one recpricating saw , I would definately NOT buy this one , but instead go back to my familiar Milwaulkee Sawzall . Using an uncomfortable saw 100 % of the time just because 2 % of the time I might need it 's special feature does n't make sense to me . On the other hand , if I already had a conventional reciprocating saw and found that I -- repeatly -- was needing that odd-angle feature , then I would buy it again .	-1
When I saw this tool I knew I had to have it . Before I used it I was really impressed with the build quality and various positions . After my first use , cutting thin angle iron , I was very happy I bought this saw . I was able to use the adjustable head on my second use , cutting plywood from the attic , and still very happy . On my third use , I could n't get the blade to stay in , and that 's when I noticed that half the shaft was gone ! The saw had less than 5 minutes of use ! Looking at what was left of the shaft bothered me . The part that broke off did n't look like it had much metal holding it in the first place . I do n't know if mine was defective , or if excessive blade vibration can damage the shaft , but now I am scared to get another one , though I wish I could and feel comfortable . There is no other saw like it !	-1
Too small . Not what I wanted . Just did n't want something this little . Wish I 'd checked the description closer before I ordered .	-1
I used the Trim Loc tool for the first time to trim out a door casing . What I found as the tool 's only useful feature was how much quicker it was to mark the reveal line ( vs using the combination square ) . I tried to use it for the measuring and either the tape kept falling out of the tape hook slot or the Trim Loc moved off the stock . I guess in theroy it works better if you use the tack holes but how is that a time saver . I 'm sure mine is heading to the dusty bottom of drawer # 3 in my workshop .	-1
This might be useful for a DIY newbie , but any pros thinking it 's something a tool junkie needs to hang trim- forget it . Just another solution looking for a problem .	-1
This is a gadget . How much it will help you probably depends on your skill level . I do not know of a single pro-trimmer that uses this thing . Most pro-trimmers do not even use a tape measure for installing casings anyway , so this `` toy '' only adds a step . I highly doubt it will give you `` perfect miters every time '' so do not expect it will . Perfect miters are elusive to the best of us at times and it takes experience , skill , an accurate saw and a good blade , and a few installation tricks to to get the `` perfect miter '' that wo n't open up . Given that this tool ranks # 4 in sales must mean something , but I would not expect it to deliver on all it claims it can do for your casing work . Bench Dog is makes some excellent products but I am not so sure of this one .	-1
Not very useful even for the money . If I 'm going to nail it to a bench , I 'll use the jig I already have thank you . I do n't need to measure the jamb , just measure inside to inside and add your reveal ... I was looking for a quick way to measure the inside to inside trim itself . I wanted to mark 30 '' on the trim , slap this thing on each end and it automagically add the reveal as I drew the 45 degree angle . I can find no way to get it to do that .	-1
This adapter will not fit 2 1/2 inch hose to the 35mm port as described.It is not supposed to adapt a shop vac to the miter saw , it is supposed to connect a 2 1/2 inch hose from a dust collector to the miter saw .	-1
I 've used quite a few polishers and would never recommend this one . If you really must have a cheap waxer/polisher then this might work for you.However , it has some serious drawbacks . It vibrates , I mean it really vibrates and will probably put your hand/arm to sleep if you use it for an extended period . You can not turn it on/off with the same hand you hold the polisher with unless you have very big hands . The grip is plastic and that makes it difficult to keep a solid grip on this waxer/polisher with amount of vibration it has . A few pennys more and they could have added a cushioned rubber grip that would have made it easier to grip and maybe absorbed some of the vibration.I would not recommend using the supplied bonnets on a vehicle that you care about . If you are going to wax your car/truck then buy some quality micro-fiber bonnets . After applying the wax , I would not use this waxer/polisher to remove the wax but just use a good micro-fiber towel instead . It will be just as quick.I will probably just use this to wax my lawn tractor , it will be quick enough that my hand/arm wo n't fall asleep from the vibration . I will probably also glue some rubber on so I can have a better grip.You get what you pay for and in this case you get a barely usable waxer/polisher that I would never use on a good car/truck .	-1
I 'm mindful of the positive reviews posted here , but as an experienced cable installer this tester is missing a critical feature required for getting the job done without wasting time and RJ45 plugs ; amateur or pro . This product does NOT do single end testing . Unlike other testers I have used ( like the Test-UM TP 500 and 600 ) you can not test your first crimp to be sure it 's good before crimping the opposite end . You must crimp both ends and then test . But guess what ? If the test fails you can not be sure which end needs to be re-terminated . This tester does not divulge such information . It 's a guessing game as to which end needs to be redone.With a tester that allows for `` pre-testing '' you can terminate one end , plug the end into the tester , and get a `` pass '' ... or not . Then when you terminate the other end and use the remote to test the entire cable , if the test fails you know it is the newly terminated end that is likely the culprit . If I am missing something I hope someone who knows better ( really knows ) will flail me . But I can tell you this for sure ; As a test for this tester I first crimped one and tested just the one end . I did get a reading . I then cut off the connector and scrambled the wires , re-crimped , and retested . The tester gave the exact same results.I suspect most of the positive reviews are from folks who had good luck with their crimps ... and this tester told them so . Cool . But if you are a lamo like me , and screw up your terminations once in a while , you really appreciate a tester capable of telling which end needs to be re-terminated . Here is a link to the testers that do single ended testing : Test Um TP500 LanRoamer CAT5 Tester , LANROVERPRO CAT5 TESTER-CAT 5 TESTER W/ 1 REMBTW - I am a big fan of TrendNet switches . Never a bad one !	-1
This is not the stool you saw @ your Grandmoms house , what a let down ...	-1
This step stool is not worth it - the steps that are shown extended in the photo connect only via a plastic groove in the red plastic cross bars shown on the legs of the stepstool . Therefore , when you move the stool , the steps flop along . You have to move them out yourself and put them back in yourself . They come off too easily so you are having to place them inside the groove whenever you move the stool/chair . The stool itself is very small and while this is OK for a stationary perching stool , it is NOT good for a step stool and too small and uncomfortable as a seat .	-1
Why are so many people buying an RA175AR ( reconditioned ) .Is it because so many RN175A are bought and returned almost new ? Now , why would that be ? I thought I had done my homework and was getting a descent deal on a roofing nailer with the Porter Cable . Well , I saw that a large percent of the nails were not struck in the middle , but off center , which bent the head . A blow with my hammer would make the bent head cut the shingle . No hammering meant the head would be cocked up to maybe cut the shingle on top of it . My NR175A is now on it 's way to becoming another nice looking RN175AR and I 'm on my way to pick up a Bostitch RN46 , or a DeWalt D51321 , or a Hitachi NV45AB2 , or a Makita AN451 , or a Max CN450R , or a Senco 455XP , or maybe a Ridgid R175RNA .	-1
BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT . IT IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE BY DESIGN . IT CAN NOT BE TURNED COMPLETELY OFF ONCE PLUGGED IN . CONTROL IS BY THERMOSTAT ALONE WITH NO ON/OFF SWITCH . SO IT CAN COME ON WHEN TEMPERATURE DROPS WITHOUT BEING ATTENDED . IF SOMEONE MOVES IT WHILE OFF IT CAN STILL COME ON AND CAN THUS CAUSE FIRE . AIMED AT FLAMMABLE OBJECTS WHILE OFF THEN TURNED ON IS THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF THESE STARTING FIRES . BEWARE . I CAN NOT SAY THIS ENOUGH . THIS UNIT IS SO POORLY DESIGNED AND THOUGHT OUT THAT ITS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE DIES USING IT . THIS COMPANY IS SUICIDAL MAKING SOMETHING LIKE THIS . VERY UNSAFE .	-1
This Patton heater is a made in China copy of a Titan heater and although it looks good it 's too noisy . Even on the low power setting the fan runs fast . Since I have one of the original Titan 's I can make a direct comparison . The noisy fan and what I judge to be an under size power cord were reasons enough to return it . Amazon has a good return policy so all I 've lost is the shipping costs . Still I wish the heater were good enough to keep .	-1
Since I have had this item , I have continually blown bulbs on the right side of the unit . Regardless of the cost of the replacement bulb , they all blow - just on one side . There is a defect in the contact spring assembly that retains the bulb and I think this is why the right side keeps going out . The left side contact spring is tight and does not burn out bulbs .	-1
Usually the remote chime is only heard if someone presses the doorbell twice or holds it for a long time . I need it to work if someone presses the doorbell once quickly , which is what all the delivery guys do .	-1
My old battery operated extend a chime finally died after 5 years ... saw the great reviews on this one and just installed it ... Well it does n't travel far enough like the old one did . And it appears you have to hold the door bell button in for a half second longer to work at short range . What 's funny is my old extend a chime has horrible ratings on Amazon . Shoot looks like the seller is not Amazon . Hope I can get my money back .	-1
The installation seems straight forward . Connect three wires and you get front an back chime . I did just that and the chime began chiming non stop . In the instructions there is no troubleshooting for this other than stating `` it might not work with melody bells '' . In reading the reviews of others , it is mentioned that it does not work with lighted buttons ( no mention of this in the instructions ) . So removed the button to test and still was ringing non stop . Other review said to connect the wires in reverse , did that and it stopped ringing . So if you have lighted buttons , you need to change them to unlit ( I removed the light from mine ) and if your door bell does more than a mechanical ding dong you need to connect the wires in reverse . Bottomline it works , but I do not think is worth the effort . You lose lights in the buttons , can do only one door because of reversing the wires and the sound is sooo low even at hight that it almost beats the purpose . I will be running a wire soon .	-1
I was Tired of The High-tech stud finders from the Zircon . Tried this Stanley , and it can not find anything magnetic . This Stanley will not indicate over the metal corner bead- which is basically right below the surface of the wall at the corners- and makes the StudPop almost fly out of your hands . Go get the StudPop for 9 $ it works great ; very sensitive . My Application is a 1962 California home : Button board gypsum with a plaster surface coat , staples and nails in the studs . The Stud Pop device has a super strong magnet and the indicator gives a great indication- pointer moves around as you pass over the metal fasteners . I have 2 old zircon electronic devices , false indicate and they could not find anything in my last home which was 1950s lathe and plaster . Stud Pop is winning the game with me so far . Soon I will put both of the bright yellow electronic and the Stanley stud finder under my car tire and see if they are crushed . I mapped the wall for an air- conditioner installation and found all the studs and got the air conditioner installed . # 2 test was looking for studs to install a double electrical box . Studpop A+ : Stanley gets an F and needs summer school and tutoring .	-1
I used this Remote Dimmer for about 2 or 3 months before it quit working . When it worked it was great but it should have lasted longer than a few months .	-1
It 's a nice little unit and there 's no annoying LED light on it to show power is off , which is helpful in some situations , but when the switch is in dim position it emits a low buzzing noise audible if seated within about 3 feet of the switch . Depending on the environment this can be a deal breaker . I got 2 units with the same problem and eventually purchase the Leviton TBI03-1LW that did not have this problem , and though it has an LED it is quite discreet recessed little green light that I can live with ( some other models have a quite bright red LED that bulges out a bit and is harder to mask ) .	-1
( See update below ) This is a very nice dimmer -- we use it to control a hanging lamp in our dining room . The design on this one is great , in that the female plug is on the outlet , and the control is used as a `` remote '' . Easy and cheap ! UPDATE : Less than a year later , it 's stopped dimming , and did so with very little use -- we adjusted it maybe once or twice a week . I adjusted my rating accordingly , I 'd probably look somewhere else for a dimmer next time , although I still like the design .	-1
I have owned this planer for a couple years , but only use it occasionally . Recently I was using it on a door finishing project , heard a clunk , and after that the motor started to bog down . I took it back in to the workshop to check the problem out , only to see chunks of the motor brush contact pads drop out of the venting . I did n't have another and needed it to at least finish the job before it died , but when I fired it back up the RPMs were way down..then give off that familiar smell ... then it began to smoke a bit , then it quit all together . I had to run to the hardware store to buy another just to finish the job.In my opinion a product like this is n't supposed to be like the tools that grandpa used and have a predictably short life . In this case , this tool did n't have enough hours on it to constitute tool puberty . It 's not like I 'm surprised , just disappointed .	-1
NOT for use planeing a door jam or something close to another object . The big black & # 34 ; power pack & # 34 ; ( I think ) on the side shown in the photo keeps the planer from getting close enough . It keeps it 1-2 & # 34 ; away from the edge . Had to return for refund .	-1
I dont like rating items until I have truley tested them . This screwdriver has served me well . The ONLY concern is that the battery died and I cant replace it , as I have to now buy another electric screwdrive i will think twice about buying a B & D ; one.Sorry but thats how it is .	-1
I was looking for something that could be stored in a kitchen drawer to use when I only needed to install a couple of screws or drill a couple of holes , in lieu of pulling out one of my impact drivers or a drill . This self proclaimed `` power tool '' is a complete joke , regardless of the price . If all your doing is installing a few electrical cover plates on switches or receptacles , this screwdriver should fit your needs just fine . But if you need to drill a few holes and install some wood screws , such as for curtain rods or an electrical outlet box , fagetaboutit . This tool could n't twist itself out of a hula-hoop . And for the large size of this thing , you might as well pull out your tried & true DeWalt drill and/or impact driver . And if you need a screw driving tool that has a 90 angled head , such as when hanging cabinets , I would recommend the Ridgid R82233 right angle impact driver . It EASILY drives and removes wood screws up to 2 & 1/2 '' with NO stripping of the screw heads .	-1
While the 6 volts of power are very welcome I would have preferred a more durable product . My PD600 is almost one year old and it will no longer hold a charge . I used the power screwdriver for about an hour or two about four days a week . It worked great until three days ago when it ran out of muscle . The battery ! For the money I want the tool to last more than a year . My back-up is a VERY old Skil power screwdriver which has never let me down in over 10 years . The Skil lacks torque but is almost perfect .	-1
Waist of money the handle does n't bent all the way down as it shows in the photo so it 's hard to get in tight places .	-1
Lacks torque - only has 5 nicads so the voltage for the motor is very low . The switch for changing from drill mode to driver mode can easily be nudged out of driver mode .	-1
When it was working this was a fantastically handy tool for light to medium jobs . It functioned very well as a screwdriver and drill , perfect for when it was not worth the bother of getting out the big guns . This is exactly what I wanted and expected.The bad news is that after very few months the batteries would no longer hold a charge . Even after providng a full charge it would work for only a very short time . If not used at all after charging would not work at all the follwing day.Hoping to salvage this useful tool I searched in vain for replacement batteries . Too bad . Now I am searching for a suitable replacement . It will most certainly not be another of these . The idea was/is near perfect . The implementation ruined it.I consider this a waste of money and could not recommend it to anyone for any purpose . Too bad.Follow up - 2 years later : A few weeks after writing this review to replace it I purchased a refurbished Hitachi DB3DL for less than twice the price if this unit . This seemed like a good price as it came with a spare battery and a separate charger . It was indeed ! The Hitachi is everything this tool should/could have been and it is still going strong after 2 years of use and abuse ! Hitachi DB3DL 3.6-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless ScrewdriverI see now that price of a new one is 3 times the B & D ; but even at that it is probably worth it . I also see a new version , DBDL2 with a higher list but the similar specs and a lower retail price , about twice the B & D . ; If you really want/need one of these , spend the extra money and get something that not only works but will keep working . I would strongly recommend the Hitachi .	-1
I strongly urge you NOT to buy this product . I have used it one time and am taking it back to the store tomorrow . It is very poorly made . It has 2 built-in , white LEDs to shine on your workpiece . They are very nice , but they do not stay on . They flicker on and off . Also , the bases are very poorly-made cast aluminum . The one had a huge grinding in it so the motor could fit on it . Also , the plunge base sticks , meaning that , as you want to come up from your workpiece , you have to lift the whole router off . That does n't sound like a problem , but when you 're 1/16 '' off the wood and the springs decide to work , you mar your workpiece . Also , the plastic body is very flimsy and wo n't take long to break . Spend the extra $ 50 to $ 100 and get yourself something good that 's made in America . I 'm going to buy the Milwaukee .	-1
I only had one problem with this router , which I bought to replace a Ryobi router that was not a plunge router and only had a quarter inch collet . The problem was that for whatever reason , the interchangeable bases did n't clamp down securely to the motor ... this made getting a precise and consistent cut pretty much impossible . Even a minute shift will ruin a cut . I ended up replacing it with the Bosch combo at something like twice the price . I wish the Bosch had the little light that the Skil has.I would recommend checking this router out in person , maybe at a big box store if they have one out , before laying out the money . If you buy it through mail order , make sure everything will lock down solidly , and if it does n't , send it back , because if that problem ca n't be corrected , you 're not going to be happy with it.It 's entirely possible that I got a defective one , which is why I say go ahead and try it out ... it 's a great deal for the price if everything works as it should .	-1
Our cats claws got caught in the seams in the grinding pads . It may work for dogs but it is of zero value for cats . The seams are visible in the product description . There is little or no mention of use with cats in the reviews ... I guess a red flag . I have n't tried the other grinder with aspecial attachment but I 'm not going to after trying this similar product .	-1
I ordered this `` pet nail trimmer '' because I did n't want to spend the additional $ 25 for the more powerful Dremel . I just needed it for my small dog 's nails . It 's battery powered . Even with my very first use and brand new batteries -- it bogs down and does not get the nail ground off . I 'm disappointed because now I 've wasted the cost for this , and still need a nail trimmer ! I would not recommend this unit . Go ahead and get the more powerful Dremel that 's rechargeable and multi-purpose .	-1
I had this item for now 3 months , i have 2 standard Poodles , let me tell you this : With new batteries install you can stop the spinning on the dogs nails.Batteries wo n't last . I can do the 2 dogs and then i need to replace the batts . I 'm going now for the rechargeable version that also has more power.I will say , forget it ... hope this helps folks .	-1
We tried to ease our dog into liking her nails trimmed but this set us back considerably . Before she did not like her nails trimmed and would only whine when we did . After touching just one nail with this , our dog is now possessed by satan when she sees the old clippers . I would steer clear .	-1
I have to let everyone know that as a professional groomer & a dog trainer , I can tell you that these Dremel `` Pet Grooming Kits '' do n't have the power to do a good , quick ( emphasis ~ QUICK ! ) job on sanding/grinding pet nails.Like Pedi-Paws & other products like them that are packaged & geared towards pet owners , this is actually a little better than Pedi-Paws which REALLY bogs down . The motor is not strong enough to really work well.In my opinion , this product is n't either.I bought a regular Dremel that is sold in the hardware dept . The model I bought was ; `` Dremel 7700-02 MultiPro 7.2-Volt 20,000 RPM Two-Speed Rotary Tool with 50 Accessories '' , which works like a dream ! It 's powerful enough to do the job quickly without putting the dog thru the torture of holding them there while these inferior ( my opinion , again ) products that do n't have strong enough motors to do the job quickly & well.I have 2 Jack Russell `` Terrorists '' , one HATES having her feet handled & the other , who 's been very fearful of anything new since she was 12 weeks old . After introducing them to the Dremel I mentioned , my JRT who hates to have her feet handled , will now let me use the dremel I have to do her nails , ( she still does n't like it , but she now lays still & lets me get it done . ) If I get the old fashioned nail clippers out , she runs for the hills . My other , fearful JRT loves it ! Once she got used to it , she now lays on her back & actually falls asleep while I 'm grinding away at her nails ! The model I bought , came with a carry case too . I love it , because I can also keep combes , hemostats & lots of other `` doggie '' items in it.It 's become my `` Doggie Doctor Bag '' ! I got my Dremel at a local hardware/home improvement store & it 's much cheaper than the `` Pet Grooming '' Dremels I 've seen here . Because it comes with lots of extras , especially the case , which is worth it 's weight in gold ! I was looking for a replacement battery for my Dremel & saw all the other Doggie Nail Grooming products & just had to let all of you folks know that you can save money & get a BETTER model Dremel or about the same & sometimes , LESS money than the inferior ones that are just packaged differently to draw in pet owners ! They get the job done better , much quicker with a faster RPM that wo n't bog down & most dogs will happily tolerate , because it takes less time ! ! What I did to get my dogs used to these , was ( BEING PATIENT WITHOUT GETTING ANGRY IS THE KEY HERE FOR SUCCESS FOLKS ! 1 . When I first brought it home , I attached the battery & set it on the floor , to let the dogs `` approach & retreat '' at their own pace . Dogs always use this method when they are unsure . They will approach something new & then retreat , checking to see if it 's safe.After the first couple times of approaching it & they actually started to sniff it , I used a clicker , but you can also say `` Good Dog '' AS THEY ARE SNIFFING IT ! ( Timing is SO IMPORTANT ) then treat them . Do this as many times as you need to , until they get more comfortable & get to the point that no matter WHERE you set it on the floor ( put it in a different room on the floor , so they will get used to it in different rooms . Dogs do n't generalize well . ) Do this until they get to where it does n't seem to be such a `` weird '' thing to them when they see it . You 'll know when , they will start to pay less & less attention to it . VERY IMPORTANT ~ DO N'T turn it on yet ! 2 . When they are used to seeing it sitting on the floor around the house & seem to be OK with it . ( You 'll know ) , they 'll pay less & less attention to it . It 's become a part of the 'scenery ' . Now pick it up ( STILL DO N'T TURN IT ON ! ! ) and rub it on their bodies . Just for a second or so & if they are calm about it ( they can look at & sniff it , which is GOOD ) , praise them I give them a treat . Then work on lengthening the time you rub it on their bodies ( with the side of the Dremel ) & treat each time they are calm about it . If at ANY TIME they seem stressed or try to run away , back off & go back to shorter contact times . Make sure you stay calm yourself . Use a 'sing-song ' or happy voice when talking to them & DO N'T FORGET REALLY YUMMY TREATS ! ! Next turn it on in another room . Sit on the floor & hold it , LETTING THE DOG APPROACH YOU ! NEVER go towards them with it , drag them to it , or hold it out towards them ! When they start coming a little closer ( remember , this is a new sound , so they will keep their distance , but if they do n't run away , toss a nice yummy treat to them that they can get without coming closer the first time . WAIT & LET THEM APPROACH YOU ! It 's a good idea to have the best , smelliest treats that your dog loves with you ( Make sure they know you have treats before you turn it on . Let them get a good whiff of the treat too . As you toss the treats to the dog , try to get the dog to take just one more step a little closer by tossing the treat so it lands a little closer to you each time.This takes patience , but BELIEVE me folks , the benefits outweigh the time this takes initially . But in the long run , you 'll be SO GLAD you did it ! When you can get the dog comfortable enough to come close , let the dog smell it . Maybe rub something nice & smelly on the outside casing , like a hot dog or some other food your dog LOVES ! . ( Keep the sanding band away from their body & do n't let it get tangled in any long hair ! The goal here is to get the dog to come close to you WHILE the Dremel is running , on his own & eventually , rub the Dremel housing on the dogs body while it 's running.It 's helpful to have someone to help you & feed GREAT treats while you are doing that . The dog will develop GREAT associations with the running Dremel , which is your goal ! After a time & your dog will let you know when he/she is ready , to use it on toe nails . Quickly take just one `` swipe '' over the end of ONE NAIL & immediately let the foot go ! Praise your dog like he/she just won you a million dollar lottery ! Then feed some AWESOME treats & give MORE PRAISE ! ! Many dogs are too intimidated still to lay down & let you handle their feet with the dremel running at first . That 's OK . Pick up a paw & just barely do the end of one nail at first . Work your way up to 2 nails , eventually doing a whole paw at one time . Make sure to reward LAVISHLY ! You know your dog , so if you think that he/she is ready to try to do more nails at one time , go for it . Just do n't push for too much too fast ! I promise you , the patience will pay off ! It WILL work if you invest the time to intitially introduce them correctly , WITH OUT FORCING THEM at any time . The years that will follow that you are able to get the nails filed down well in a very short amount of time , because you are not fighting with a dog pulling their feet away from you constantly , it 's WELL WORTH HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES ! ! Believe me , I KNOW it works ! My JRT was a very fearful puppy when I got her at 12 weeks old . I 've NEVER had a dog , especially that young , that was so afraid of EVERYTHING ! She 's going to be 3 the beginning of November & I 've very patiently gotten her over 99 % of her phobias . She was afraid of EVERYTHING ! Sheesh ! ! ) If anyone needs any other advice or help , please feel free to leave a comment . I will be notified of any comments left on this post & I will respond . I 'll GLADLY HELP IN ANY WAY I CAN ! ! This is a super over-simplified version , but I think you get the idea.Good Luck Everyone ! !	-1
Dogs hated it . Needs to be corded . Batteries do n't last .	-1
This is the worst product I have every bought . The high pitched noise the machine makes scares the @ # $ % out of my dog . Atempting hold my dogs paw and trying to grind down his nailS is impossible . I now have this dremel sitting on my computer desk as a paper weight , in the future this Dremel will remind me of the wasted money , whenever I have the desire to purchase a product that I have not seen or used .	-1
The batteries die while being stored within the device , to lengthen battery life . Remove when not being used ! !	-1
I ordered this item and the first time I used it , it worked great . I liked the fact that it gave great light and no appreciable heat . Then winter came ( my primary use for this was working on my cars ) and I did not use it for approximately 8 months and when I went to use it again , it did n't work at all . I was so disgusted , I threw it into the trash .	-1
This is cheaply made and not as bright as one would think . Also the bracket is totally plastic . Not recommended .	-1
I do handyman work and needed a light for working in those recessed areas . I was tired of burning myself with the halogen bulb type . I have had this light for more than a year now . It is cool but has serious drawbacks . I must admit I am hard on things so maybe for a more careful person this is the ticket . But when I accidentally knocked it over the bulb fell out of their sockets . To replace them you have to take the whole lamp apart . This light was not cheap . Now with the new LED work lights that are also cool to the touch and pretty much indestructible this light is obsolete .	-1
I have the Craftsman equivalent to the one here . It is identical to this light , but the Craftsman one is red in color.I had two of these work lights go out in 2 years . Both with the same problem , the internal fuse blew because the board had a short somewhere.I bypassed the fuse and one of the components started sizzling and smoking . Aint worth my time to buy a replacement component . Better to go into the trash bin .	-1
According to wikipedia , ionization smoke detectors are cheaper to produce , have more false alarms and less give less time for evacuation in the case of smoldering fires . The wiki article on smoke detectors indicates that the difference is important and cites a court case against First Alert . I did n't look up the case . I hope someone will.A jury in the United States District Courtfor the Northern District of New York decidedin 2006 that First Alert and its parent company , BRK Brands , was liable for millions of dollarsin damages because the ionization technology inthe smoke alarm in the Hackert 's house wasdefective , failing to detect the slow-burningfire and choking smoke that filled the home asthe family slept.Kidde markets or owns First Alert , apparently. > > > There are better First Alert smoke alarms with both kinds of sensors : > > > First Alert SA302CN Double Sensor Battery-Powered Smoke and Fire AlarmIt is a mystery to me why they do n't drop the inferior model for the good of the public.The following quote is especially evil : This alarm uses ionization sensing technology . Ionization sensing alarms may detect invisible fire particles ( associated with flaming fires ) sooner than photoelectric alarms.The difference in favor or ionization , according to wikipedia , is very small and completely overshadowed by the safety advantages of photoelectric sensors.Kidde itself , here on Amazon states : '' Kidde strongly recommends that both ionization and photoelectric smoke alarms be installed to help insure maximum detection of the various types of fire that can occur within the home . `` I apologize for the incompleteness of this , even though long and over-thought . I hope someone will do a better one . I 'm returning 5 alarms and buying photoelectric ones , and it looks like from the same company I find so reprehensible in this matter .

I recently had an energy audit on my home . The auditor found that the weatherstripping on my patio door was worn out . I have a huge patio door , my entire patio basically runs the length of both my living room and dining room , about 8 feet long.I purchased this product thinking it would help to make my house less drafty , but this product is more like mailing tape , not any thicker , so to me if you buy this product you also need to buy some kind of covering or something to use this product with , otherwise it 's kind of useless just using it alone.It seems like an expensive roll of tape , which is what it basically is . Now I need to buy some kind of weatherstripping foam , or something like that to use this tape with . I did n't read before purchasing this product that you also needed to buy something else , for it to be effective . Live and learn !	-1
Put it in the kitchen to replace a 20-year-old ion-sensor model which was too sensitive for kitchen use . However , this photo-sensor model did n't go off even when we had an oven fire and the kitchen was billowing with smoke.The test button works , and I verified that it sounded when I blew out a smoking match under it , but I 'm not sure if it would sound soon enough in a real fire versus the ion-sensor models since it seems to require a lot more smoke to set it off .	-1
What can I say , I 'm hoping it will perform but have n't had a fire yet . I ordered 4 of these when I heard on national TV that photoelectric sensors are the latest technology and supposedly detect smoke earlier.Update : 1/31/2014Lowered my rating from 5 stars to 2 stars . We purchased 4 of these units in Nov. 2012 . But one of these started malfunctioning Nov. 2013 ; started with just one beep every few minutes so I tested battery which was OK but replaced the battery anyway and cleaned the unit . Then started again about a month later , then stopped and started again every month or so . About drove us crazy so discontinued using it .	-1
I saw this at a local store and decided to try it for when I was out in the field with my RC stuff . The bottom sleeve that covers the tank keeps sliding off and if I could get any butane into it , it would n't be there a week later when I go to use it again . You really have to watch the side port when soldering , too . Otherwise you may end up with collateral damage . I was very disappointed in this product and ended up throwing it away before someone was hurt . Definitely not up to par with the larger Bernzomatic stuff I own .	-1
All the pictures and writing lead you to think this is self lighting . Benzomatic even puts a trigger on unit . You will still have to carry a lighter . I returned item probably lost more returning than keeping . Its really sad . I wish some one would refund my pain in this purchase . BUYER BEWARE !	-1
I have an older husky version , which is the same as CH , and the older models were way better 10 yrs ago . Now though these newer CH and Husky ones that R identical barely do anything . plus the way the water comes out the resevoir in these new models you can never get rid of all the water in them , because the valve sits about 3/16 inches above the bottom of the resevoir , thus , water is always left in it . I suggest getting a better filter . By the way I live in dry Phoenix , AZ and a lot of moisture gets past the filter . So if you live some place with a lot of rain or humidity then definitely get a bigger better filter .	-1
As a marine mechanic , I would steer you away from this micro torch . It does do a nice job soldering , and , sure , it shrinks electrical terminals without burning them , but only when it feels like igniting . Some times the gas flows upon switching the butane switch on and sometimes it does n't . Very inconvenient when shoehorned into an engine compartment . Lately , I 've been wondering just how well this torch kit floats .	-1
This piece of junk never gets hot enough to melt solder . It looks nice but does jnot work . I wasted my money on this garbage , I hope you do n't .	-1
Pro : Price , SizeCon : Does n't fill easily . About 20 % of used butane goes into torch the rest into air.Not that easy to start . Goes out oftenWith solder tips side ports vent hot flame into work areaSolder tips do not seem to heat . I needed to use flame for soldering with resultant burning of adjacent wiring insulation .	-1
I have been using caulk for a long , long time and I can honestly say this was the worst experience I have ever had . It was used to seal a window . First off , minimum set up time is 7-14 days , ( despite DAP online instructions stating it sets within hours ) ridiculous . After that , it is supposed to remain somewhat flexible like silicone , it does not . It is gummy and easily punctured with indents appearing randomly even after your smooth bead has begun to dry weeks later . Second , it shrinks more than any other caulk I have used . Supposedly the clear shrinks more than the other colors , but I would never use it again anyway so I do n't know . What I do know is that it sets into a thin , and I mean ultra thin layer that is very difficult to get scrape off , which you will most likely do once you see how much it shrinks . I even set up a dehumidifier to help the curing since it was used for a basement window . ( Two of the uses written DIRECTLY on the tube ) . The instructions on DAP 's site are incorrect about set up time , so I have read of people getting refunds do to this . That still does n't pay me for my time of having to remove this junk and start over with another caulk .	-1
Just bought a tube of this thinking I was buying a 100 % silicone sealant- at about $ 5 a tube that 's what it should be , latex is usually $ 2-3 . Looking at the package it does n't say LATEX anywhere , it says PREMIUM indoor outdoor sealant which in my experience means 100 % silicone.Latex sealant for outside , to hell with that . DAP , shame on you for being dodgey about what your product is.Edit : seeing the non helpful votes I figured I 'd revisit my review and up it to two stars as apparently I missed the part of the label where it said latex when I took it off the shelf . Still it is marketed as a '' premium '' sealant and priced nearly as high as other makers full silicone products so I believe the intent by DAP was as I described though had I scrutinized the product maybe I 'd have caught it.If users want to pay nearly as much as a full silicone sealant for latex and and are happy with its performance I do n't agree the slight cost difference is worth it . I 've seen latex fail far too many times . YMMV ! Hopefully at least this edit is more fair to DAP .	-1
Lots of stuff I really did n't need to get a few basic things I did need . Wish it came with hose .	-1
Campbell Hausfeld MP2847This kit looks like a great deal , but the blow gun has very thin walls especially at the air inlet port . I thought I was going to crack the metal while tightening the fitting . The safety valve adapter for the tapered inflator and needle inflators makes it practically worthless as any air pressure tends to vent out these holes . I don & # 8217 ; t recommend buying this kit and to look for one that does not use a safety valve adapter.Overall : 2/5 stars , low quality with a safety valve that prevented me from getting the job done .	-1
I received it as a gift and it was great for laying out the footings for my house . A few months later when I went to use it again , there was a big black blotch on the display making it unusable . I emailed Calculated Industries and they told me the only way that could happen was if I abused it or it froze . Neither was the case . They did n't even offer the courtesy of letting me send it in so they could look at it . It still looks brand new except for the blotch on the display . By comparison I have an HP that has literally traveled around the world with me for 14 years and still works great . I wish HP made project calculators ! I would not buy anything made by Calculated Industries . Their products do n't last and the warranty is absolutely worthless .	-1
I had occasion to use my DeWalt portable vacuum the other day to clean some concrete dust out of my car . It works , and is better than nothing , but I 'm thinking for $ 100.00 think of how many times I could go to the do-it-yourself carewash and use the powerful vacuums there that really work . I have had it for several years now , and I rarely use it because I know it simply will not do the job.What a real vacuum , or shop-vac would do in seconds , it took me many minutes to do with this vacuum . I have to say that I am not happy that I bought it . At the time I thought it was the perfect solution for my car and portable cleaning , but under battery power the device is even less powerful than when the cord is plugged in.It is handy , and it better than some of the cheap vaccums you can buy for your car , but the thing is , this appliance does not do the job . This is a product that really should not exist . It costs a lot of money and it does not work like a good expensive vacuum cleaner should , it just doesn't.I 'm very disappointed and would not buy this or anything like it again .	-1
I have 12 assorted vacuum cleaners around the house of various shapes and sizes , both corded and cordless . I needed something for my garage other than my big shop vac to haul around . This $ 100 vacuum was a good size and worked fine the first year . I is handy to have around the house for those quick wet or dry pick-me-ups . I purchased the $ 100 battery pack because it did n't come with a battery or charger . After a year the circuit board that allowed it to run on AC current went out . I was told it would cost another $ 50.00 to replace . I tried to run it on battery for a few more months but I was constantly charging the thing because like all my cordless tools , every time I tried to use the thing it was dead . I finally took the thing to the Goodwill and kept the battery and charger in the unlikely event I should ever buy another Dewalt tool .	-1
This product has less than sufficient power to clean common construction debris . Our firm purchased this vacuum to provide a portable and convenient option on the service vehicle/s . It has been used and rejected by every technician ; they 'd rather drag a cord out for a bonafide shop-vac than spend the extra effort to get even small debris picked up with this particular cordless . It simply does not have/provide the suction needed to do the job .	-1
This is a handy tool , but the suction is very weak . It is suitable only for small job and light weight dirt . For the most part , its a waste of money .	-1
I bought one of these . What a piece of junk . But it 's the best looking piece of junk I 've ever purchased . And it comes with a real nice case . Regular belts did not last more than 60 seconds . The expensive ones lasted a bit longer . I 'm just a hobbyist , not using it for construction . I tried an expensive belt on a flat piece of plywood to see if it would tear those up too . It did . Adjusting the tracking knob just stretches the belt on one side . If you 're rich , buy this thing and throw the sander away and keep the cool case . I returned it .	-1
Well , seeing all the reviews here says it all . I 've had one of these for a few years and only needed it once in awhile . Seemed fine until now . I was just out in the yard cleaning up some 2X6s for decking and it started smoking and now it 's dead .	-1
Well what can I say ? I like most of the Dewalt line of tools , but if they made the rest of their tools like this one , they would go out of business quick ! The tracking was eratic , vacuum dust control does n't work at all- ( unless you hook a shop vac ) .And for the real clincher -- -the back drive wheel shaft started wobbling and vibrating after about three hours of total run time.I checked for a loose bearing or bolt but the wheel would n't move by hand , no play at all , which shows that the run-out was caused by the axle shaft bending-most probably due to poor metal quality . Took it back and got a porter cable 352vs -- which so far has performed great after many hours of use .	-1
First off , I own a bunch of DeWalt tools.I bought this sander and used it for about 3 hours before returning it . This is a heavy sander and requires a bit of work to use ( seems like I 'm fighting with it ) . The top front wheel sets up frequent vibrations which cause the sander to do tiny hops which leaves marks in the work . The dust collection seems to work , but the cooling vents seem to blow dust all over the place ( not good for working in the house ) . This sander seems to go through sanding belts with little to show for it ( do n't know why ) .I switched to a Bosch 3x21 inline sander and it is a world of difference . No great effort to use ( less fatigue ) no cooling ports to blow the dust around , seems is use less belts for the same job , a whole lot lighter and does a better sanding job .	-1
I had the same experience as Donna M. Freeth below . Something came loose inside the motor and the motor revolutions increased to frightening speed . I opened the yellow top and discovered 3 pieces of what used to be a black ring . I 'm pretty sure it 's the variable speed control for the motor because it sits right below the top bearing and in front of the speed control module . So much for buying quality for peace of mind !	-1
I really wanted this to work for furniture I am making but I did n't get that far . This think sucks bordering on junk.The plunge base housing is bent almost like someone took pliers and pulled the metal strip causing it to be to tight scratching the motor unit . It is too tight and the motor can not be put in straight down . You have to hold it at an angle and force it in sideways and push the metal flush with the yellow plastic opening to get it in then force it straight down . I tried the different bases and they worked but not the plunge base . The motor unit is all scratched up from forcing it in and out . I wanted to baby it and be cafeful and not man handle it but the metal is very soft like aluminum not steel and the fit was very skewed . The metal housing looks ugly sticking out misaligned with the yellow plastic shroud . It 's sloppy . With continued use the motor unit made of some soft alloy will strip and be too loose causing lack of rigidness making it wobble . Not good for a supposed precision and low vibration tool . The controls are stupidly placed in the worst points possible . The speed setting wheel is obscured by the plunge spring unless you do n't seat the motor completely which no one would do since it would cause wobble . Adjusting the speed for the recommendations they list for various shank diameter , depths and woods would be difficult . Common sense would indicate putting the speed setting on the same side as the power switch like every other tool I know including a $ 20 Ryobi sander I own . They know this . This makes it so you can not put the motor in another way like you can the other to bases . The depth setting is blocked by the adjustment rod so you ca n't see clearly and have to view it at weird stupid angles . They thought ahead to see what would work then blatantly did the opposite . The instruction manual folds out like a map and is rather hard to read because of all the multiple languages and oddly placed sections . A pamphlet or regular instruction manual would have been better but I guess they were too poor to afford staples.The d handle is stupid and unnecessary . I realized it was a luxury and unneeded but if you can make a better tool why not . It works virtually the same as a fixed base so no improvement . I figured if everything was legit put the fixed base mounted under a router table and then use the d handle for portable use . With the quick change supposed to be nice fitting easy adjust system that should have been convenient , well built and ideal . Well it has a trigger design that is sticky . Very cheap auto lock feature found on tools I would pass on just because it uses that plastic pin that always jams . There are better versions of plastic auto locks for tools or whatever that either use one that is error and maintenance free and ones that are garbage and not worth settling for . Point is it is easy to make a cheap plastic auto lock that works correctly and Dewalt foolishly choose to use a system that they know is prone to error that everybody hates since it is a pain to deal with but will accept ignorantly because of the fact the micro adjust offers precision in routing which is what they want and the branding of Dewalt tools as a premium product . Motor slides in easily in this unit as expected which means nothing because I promised myself along time ago that I would never settle for an auto lock that was this flimsy . It click and clacks in and out I 'm sure it will either get stuck or who knows what will snap off inside . And they want $ 80 for this thing ? ? ? It sitcks every other time so when using and you have to turn it off you ca n't or you fiddle it and botch a cut . Why does Dewalt hate woodworkers ? The fixed base uses a plastic black thing to move the unit up and down to 1/64 '' increments . I was wanting something like this so I could use a tool that handled and functioned well . As comparison my Ryobi fixed base 1/4 '' collet 1.25 hp router is too crude for fine adjusts with the metal too tight on the machine so when adjusting have to turn knob and force it down or even harder up with no assurance it is set where the markings tell you . Only the truly clueless would buy tools they do n't trust . Even with the clamp fully released you have to shove it in and it scrapes the black plastic body . I bought it for $ 100 with router table at Home Depot so the router is $ 60 and the table $ 40 . I should have returned it to home depot since I realized as soon as it was out of the box my Ryobi would not offer precise adjustments and I would have to build my own table . The Dewalt ads promised me a smooth adjustment up and down and with more horsepower for oak which was what I was in the market for . Dewalt promised quality but failed to deliver . I do n't think I can trust the quality of Dewalt . The fixed base works the best as it 's so simple but the adjustment ring has two pieces . The black ring you turn by hand and a yellow ring with markings . The black ring turns smoothly and it perfect compared to knobs on other routers but could be a little bigger sized for better grip contact . It appears to be too slim fit on it and hard to turn which leads too the next issue . The rings on the motor slide so smooth , when you can grip it , just like it looks it would but the yellow marking ring is n't permanently attached to the black ring . What happens is obvious , you turn to black ring to adjust everything precisely set saving you time and then the yellow ring moves making you lose your setting mark and having to readjust making setup times longer wasting your time money and patience . I am not in the market for tools that I have to tinker by using Loctite , duck tape or some silly other quick fix . This is a downgrade of standards previously demanded by American consumers . These are not little details but represent serious compromise in quality.I tried using the fixed base again and now it is making a scratching noise and is wobbly with the black ring getting chewed on the motor base I assume from the motor being scratched up from being put in the plunge base . The one thing that worked mechanically has failed . So my using it in any off the three bases will ruin the bases and the motor unit making it hard to put in take out or adjust and make smooth cuts . Dewalt makes expensive Chinese made garbage that does not last . They seem impressive but the quality in not there . I want tools that look as good as they function.There is so much wrong I have to return them , at first thought it was defective but it is just engineered improperly.I really liked the idea of how nice Dewalt cases that hold everything and match and look nice and easy to organize so my garage did n't look messy or it was hard to find tools . I liked it so much I was considering making a special unit to house the cases in my garage as part of my custom workplace I 'm building . Currently I am in the process of making garage cabinets and furniture so I need tools that work , are reliable , and have easy organization . I am building a roubo work bench plus wall cabinets and tall 6'4 garage cabinets and drawer cabinets similar to the Ultimate garage system . I looking for the best tools to upgrade to for the best results and the tools I buy will have an influence on the garage I design . I like to buy once not twice so want the best tools available . The current offerings of tools are junk.The dewalt mini router has more features such as led which was a long awaited improvement and has plastic covering it with built in vac attachment . This has no L.E.D.S . and no dust management just a sucky blower that makes a mess where your working . You ca n't be stupider than that . This is not a precision tool but rather junk made by a buffoon.So I guess I want leds , true vacuum/dust management that I can hookup to a shop vac with the clear plastic pieces holding the wood shaving in , a better lock on the d handle trigger , a locking lock on the collet not push and hold lock , the bases to work as they are advertised not hit and miss with bad quality control , The speed adjustment easy to use when in the plunger base , and the plunger base rod not blocking 100 % of the gauge behind it.This tool is backwards not forwards . I was going to buy a dewalt planer , worm drive saw , sander , hammerdrill , maybe impact driver , grinder , cutout tool . I wanted them all corded in hard cases not nylon bags and make my garage look nice like I care . Neatness and presentation is important to me , if not I would not be spending so much time finding and buying the best tools I can to fix up my house . If I wanted my house to look shabby I would n't buy any tools at all.I am going to buy a $ 25,600 Felder table saw and boycott freud , dewalt , porter cable , triton , festools , black and decker , rigid , Powermatic , delta , and anybody else I forgot about . They do n't care about America or Americans improving there homes or quality of living . They are jerks.This tool looks bad compared to the triton 3hp . It uses a single base for plunging and routing which makes sense but I would rather have a base mounted to the table and a base for portable use . I guess I would have to buy two or three routers since no tool maker wants you having one tool for three different purposes . Greedy international tool cartels that make junk tools overseas them try to get you to buy three when one made right should work.Just out of spite I am going to build a tool company to put them out of business . I would sell for less then cost just to end their tyranny . Once they go out of business them jack up prices so I can recoup my loss or at least stay buoyant . They made a business rival they should n't have .	-1
worked for the first 5 boards ( 6 ' long doug fir , approx . 50-100 years old ) and then it stopped feeding reliably . looked on here and found that others had the same issue . unsure of the cause , but the bottom line is that it was n't feeding properly . tried calling dewalt , they were closed on the saturday . tried feeding to different parts of the table . tried feeding with less or more depth being taken off with each pass . tried to make sure it was being fed level and getting support along the way . nothing seemed to work.ca n't recommend this planer . while it worked great at first and seems to have a good build , it did n't feed correctly and there was a crack that i noticed later in the plastic motor housing , right above the `` e '' in the dewalt logo on the front .	-1
Being a professional woodworker since 1985 , I gave it one star because out-of-the-box it did a great job and the 3 M2 laminated steel reversible blades are superior to the HS steel , hands down . I could n't believe how much antique heart pine I planed in one blade change . Then came the blade change : Oh , boy ! They should have never used an aluminum head to house blades . ( A definite no-no for a company that advertises it 's tools as `` industrial '' . ) I stripped a head out of a supposed hardened steel blade bolt with the dinky little hex-head hand-jobber wrench supplied with the tool . The wrench is designed to keep us from over-torqueing the bolts when we change the blades . But that did not prevent the boys in Taiwan from over-torqueing the cheap things with their air tools before shipping . Not a cheap fix , nor a quick one . If DeWalt would have given me a steel head for this thing and some good bolts I would have kept it , but me and my business can not afford the wait ( or the `` hurry-up-and-wait '' ) . I guess if the U.S. Army can not get good steel , then good hardened steel bolts are also too much for me to ask for : '' You were n't sent to work with the tools that you need ; you were sent to work with the tools that you got ! `` We definitely pay for what we get as American `` consumers '' .	-1
I have had this machine for a year and I automatically charge all my custom in build cabinets and furniture a $ 25 dollar surcharge for blades , this planer is faboulous for about 30 board foot of lumber , a typical project . Then you can flip 'em over and do one more project . It would actually be cheaper to let my hardwood supplier surface two sides that to run this very expensive planer . Dewalt , listen up ! ! ! You may have the DIY and weekend enthusist blinded by your fancy marketing and race cars but professionals are starting to grumble , put your house in order , include the accessories to achieve the best results !	-1
If you enjoy buying High-Priced Ink Jet Cartridges for that low-priced printer , then you will love this planer.I 've had my DW735 for two years now and I 've spent more on replacement blades than the original cost of the unit ( including the side tables ) ( ca n't believe those cost extra ! ) I plane a lot of White Oak , and smaller quantities of other hardwoods . I 'm really lucky to get 2-3 hours of planer time before nick marks start showing up and the blades have dulled out ! ! ! ! ! ! Also ... the inside of the unit is all formed abs plastic , and hairline cracks are showing up , so it probably will not last much longer . Kind of like Dewalts ' Random orbit sanders that typically last me about 7-8 months ! Sure has become a disposable tool market ... nothing lasts anymore !	-1
I have the same experience as others . The planer stated to produce raised lines after less than an hour of use . It does n't feed wood of any with or thickness well . The features are appealing , but the planer just does not work .	-1
I would be glad to review this product , however I never received it . It was on a special at Amazon for $ 113.00 free freight . Never got sent according to Fedex . Now to reorder it the price has gone to $ 147.25 . I have tried to call Amazon , and got some foreign speaking person , who I could not understand very well and all she could tell me was they will issue me a credit . Told her I do n't want the credit , wanted the DW7350 Planer stand as advertised . So this was ordered on 6-17-10 , as of today 7-20-10 , I still do not have the stand or my credit . I never had this kind of service from Amazon . Very dissappointed.Mike L.State College , PA	-1
Horrible , simply horrible.I ask that you consider in the very beginning of this review that I am an engineer by training and a highly experienced one at that . I have rebuilt the engines and transmissions of many cars , I 've designed and tested safety critical ( your life likely depends upon such ) automotive brakes , ABS , traction control and stabilty systems . I therefore know well how to design something as simple as a stand to keep a tool from falling upon the ground . I know that certain bolt sizes should easily withstand 25 ft-lb. , while experiencing Dewalt supplied bolts of that size snapping at a third of that number.If you doubt this , please read the reviews of this product on Dewalt 's own website . You will experience continuity with what I have been through , though it is clear Dewalt does not puplish all reviews they receive of their product ( for example , mine ) . Even with their filtering the reviews are pretty darn negative , for reasons similar to mine.I had a completely opposite experience recently when assembling a Bosch Router table . The directions were superb , the parts all there and presented properly and I knew I was working with a quality product.Please do not be suckered in by an artificially created brand name undeserving of elite recognition . Be your own person and send a message to Dewalt , which would be simply this : I pay for value , for quality.Thank you	-1
DeWalt is apparently challenged by the daunting task of producing accurate and complete assembly instructions . Maybe one of the boys could take a look at their own docs while having their back rubbed in the corporate G6 en-route to DeWalt Racing.1 . Hey guys , how about something as simple as organizing fastening hardware instead of throwing everything together in one bag ? Oh and , the nuts that were supposed to be the same size , WERE NOT.2 . Only 1 base screw attachment for each leg : that 's a personal injury , and lawsuit waiting to happen.3 . Instructed to attach wheels only later to DEDUCE ( because there are NO INSTRUCTIONS ) you have to remove it to assemble the leg support.All this makes me wonder if the same geniuses designed the 735 planer I bought ... with blades rotating at 10,000 RPM . OH BOY ! No , I am not a paid basher or otherwise have any interest in competitors . Just a regular person like you who would be embarrassed as he @ # if it were my product.All the above is just my opinion ...	-1
DeWALT 's 13 '' planer does need some kind of infeed and outfeed support , but these extension tables are not sufficient . They are formed of thin sheet metal , and easily deform/bow in the middle when planing anything stiff enough to need the tables . Both are made to fold up out of the way , but only the one on the infeed side can physically be folded up . The outfeed table will hit the planer if folded . Neither is made to be secured in place after folding up . However , both can be easily removed without tools . Also , adjustments are easily made with screws that use the planers integral hex wrench .	-1
I was so unhappy with these knives I almost gave up on my DeWalt 13 '' planer . The planer itself does just what it is supposed to , but these replacement knives dull almost immediately , they have only one side , and ca n't be sharpened . I did a frantic internet search and found Infinity Tools , which carries their own 13 '' replacement knives for this Dewalt planer under `` Specialty Planer and Jointer Knives . '' They are two-sided , resharpenable and last a very long time . I had to slightly overbore the set pin holes , but that was no big deal . I brought that little defect up to the folks at Infinity and they admitted they 'd heard the same thing from a couple of other customers , but said they sell a ton of them so I guess everyone just makes that little adjustment and gets back to working wood . I do n't know if Infinity has started offering replacement knives for the 12.5 '' planer , but I could not recommend the DeWalt 13 '' model if alternative knives were not available . DeWalt is doing their product 's image no favors with their name brand knives . It is a good little planer but the aluminum foil quality of the DeWalt replacement knives is horrendous . I do n't know what MBA ( and I am one ) did the cost benefit analysis , but I ca n't believe they sell enough of these flimsy replacement knives to offset unrealized purchases of the planer they lose due to negative word of mouth . Buy the planer , not the knives .	-1
I only recently purchased the DeWalt 735 planer and have n't used it enough to wear out the OEM blades . They 've done fine for the limited use I 've put them to so far , but I bought it with fairly low expectations re : knife wear . Infinity Tools sells a set of HSS replacement blades that can be resharpened and every comment or review I 've read in various woodworking forums says they hold their edge much longer -- usually 2x-3x as long . I have a set of the Infinity knives to use when the DeWalt blades are worn.As I understand the problem with these knives , they are thinner than other knife designs . That is apparently part of the design for the 735 , which is a very good portable planer , but does leave the user with the problem of continually replacing the knives , and also contributes to the problem with not being able to sharpen these knives . I was told that the DeWalt knives are 1/16 '' thick , whereas most planer blades are 1/8 '' thick . The thinness of the blade is why there are no carbide versions available.With DeWalt having to be aware of the short blade life , they would have happier customers for the 735 if they would either make their blades out of better steel or price them where it is n't so expensive to replace them frequently .	-1
Its the same story as others have said , 200 BF of hardwoods is all you will get out of these chinese blades . I guess the china men have n't perfected sheffield steel yet . I just bill my customers 50 bucks a project for the cost of me being stupid enough to buy another dewalt product/ .	-1
The concept behind these pipe clamps is great , but I had exactly the same problem that Dana Vogel did ( we 're not related ) . Specifically , the clutch plates on the fixed side were installed upside down so that the long tabs point down . As a result , the clamp can not lay flat , which completely defeats the entire purpose of these clamps . There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of obvious mistake , and a company with a reputation like Irwin should never , ever have allowed this to happen . The fact that another person here experienced the same problem leads me to believe that Irwin has enormous quality control problems . I will definitely be returning these . I plan to replace them with the similar ones recently released by Rockler even though the Rocker clamps require a threaded pipe .	-1
... the `` Sure-Foot Aluminum Bar Clamps [ from Rockler ] are vastly superior [ AND CHEAPER ] . No more heavy and clumsy piping for me !	-1
Well , since my first review I ordered ten more of these clamps and wow what a let down . As I expected reading the fine print on the back of the packaging revealed all the evidence I needed & quot ; Made in China & quot ; . The clutch plates on the fixed assembly side were installed improperly on all clamps with the long tab pointing down , this would not allow the clamp to lay flat on its back causing them to lay over on their side . In addition to that problem some of the holes bored in the floating assembly were out of line causing the floating jaw to jam on the pipe and become difficult to tighten . Irwin should inspect their products more closely especially when they are charging more than the American made Pony clamps .	-1
Bought two , the faces are n't flat on either of them ( one almost looks like an `` S '' ) , returning and going for Pony or Rockler	-1
Update to paragraphs below : I DID get an excellent response to my email , and they gave me an 800 number for future use . Their number should be more available , but because their email support was excellent , I 'd now rate the product a 4 . ( Their 800 number : Technical Support Hotline at ( 800 ) 528-5880 , M-F , 5:00 A.M. - 6:00 P.M. and Saturday , 7:00 A.M. - 5:00 P.M. Mountain Time . ) After reading all the positive reviews I bought and installed one of these . The manual is good , installation was easy , and operation is quiet.But I was unable to reprogram a supposedly compatible remote control and I tried to contact customer support . There is no way to reach a human being - so if the on-line hints and the manual do n't help , you are out of luck . ( There is an email support option which I did n't try ; but has anybody EVER seen email support work ? ) I 'm not sorry I bought the product ; but when it fails , I 'm going to be really angry since there wo n't be any way to get support .	-1
I tried to turn it on and off a couple dozen times by clapping and was successful only 3 or 4 times . I tried from different places in my bedroom , from 6 to two feet away . I clapped so hard and so often my palms hurt . It made no difference so I returned it and am waiting for a refund .	-1
The new clappers I bought have a switch for the setting . It 's basically high and low . Low is high and high is ridiculous . The old ones had a wheel to adjust the sensitivity and you could get it where you needed it . Even after putting layers of tape over the opening to try an muffle the sound my light is like a strobe sometimes while watching tv or even closing a door . I do not think I can recommend these anymore until they fix this issue .	-1
I use to have the old one for over 2 years and they work great for meI was able to turn off/on my lights across the room with out going to the lightWhen it die i just reorder it and I got something ( also from clapper ) Different from the photo.I thought ah a newer ver as long as it work is alrightbut the clapper i got the senser is weak , I have keep on clapping and walk closer to it so it will work with the old one it work as soon as I enter the roomnow i have to walk pass 1/2 way so the new one work .	-1
I bought believing it would torque at 55lbs . It will not . It might be ok if all you want to do is spin a bolt . If you use a ratchet regularly do n't waste your money . Price sold me . To me it is worthless , I 'll never believe a cambell hausfield rating again .	-1
After 3 weeks they still have not sealed . Also just barely open long enough for a flush even fully adjusted downward with the yellow marshmallow . Probably going to try a light sanding . Kohler Wellworth fixture .	-1
Gone are the days when Porter Cable made quality power tools . This router is made in China and it is not up to the quality that Porter Cable used to make . I have four other older Porter Cable routers , and I will never get rid of them as long as they continue to operate . This model 892 router has so much run out on the spindle that it vibrates my router table . Do n't waste your hard earned dollars on this piece of junk . You would be better off buying a used older model 690 or 691 . I used this router for one day , and will end up selling it for a fraction of the cost on ebay .	-1
I purchased this router in July of 07 and have never been able to use it . I have sent it in for repair three times and have received three seperate new motors . All of them have un acceptable runout . .060-.090 or more . The runout is so bad that the router actually shut off when I tried to turn a panel bit . You can visably see the wobble if you put a large 1/2 '' flush trim bit in it . I even went through the trouble to video tape my tests using a dial indicator , i clamped the motor to my cabinet saw and placed a 1/2 straight bit using the shaft as a referance and received almost a 3/4 swing on the indicator , I then moved the same collet and bit into and old PC router ( rockwell ) with results of .001 in runout , very acceptable in a 10 year old well used router . I sent them the videos and they still say they are finding no problems ... .. Basically if you bought a PC tool 10 years ago you will love it , if you buy a current model good luck , it is imported garbage , I have also burned up about three PC sanders over the past two years . I now buy Festool , the stuff is exspensive but perfectly engineered and you will not have to replace it . I have a friend who has a 10 year old Festool sander that failed and they rebuilt it for under 100 bucks and had it back within a week . That is customer serviceDo Not Buy This Router ... ... ... ... . Porter-Cable is not worth the aggrivation.PS I own a high end Cabinet shop in Colorado , I know tools ... ... ..	-1
I purchased the Porter-Cable 895PK Fixed and Plunge Base Router Kit to supplement an 30 year old Craftsman router I have.Despite the mixed reviews of this router I decided to give it a try and purchased one at a local woodworking store . As soon as I opened the unit it was obvious I made a mistake . Due to the lack of quality I returned it immediately ( without even bothering to plug it in ) .The biggest problem with this router is the gear mechanism to raise and lower the router is really poorly designed . On the new unit I purchased there was a full 3/4 turn of slop in the gear train . Meaning you could turn the dial to raise the unit a full 3/4 turn before the gear engaged . This is totally unacceptable and makes fine-tuning a cut impossible . The other problem was the plastic base on the bottom of the router was off center , again unacceptable for a `` precision '' tool.One of the great things about Amazon is the reviews entered by people who have actually used the product . I know based on this experience I will heed other reviewers comments more.So what router did I end up with ? Based on the research I did on-line , including here at Amazon . TheMilwaukee 5616-24 2- -Max-Horsepower EVS Multi-Base Router Kit Includes Plunge Base and BodyGrip Fixed Baseseemed like a good bet.I must say so far I am not disappointed . The Milwaukee router is light , well balanced and smooth in operation . The fit and finish are excellent and the height adjustment mechanism works flawlessly - no gear slop what-so-ever . It makes the Porter Cable unit look like a total piece of junk ( for $ 50 less ) ! Bottom line - if you want a tool that will allow you to do `` precision '' work look elsewhere . Unfortunately Porter Cable 's current breed of routers are nothing like the quality they use to make .	-1
I own several routers ( 5 ) and this kit is very disappointing ! What were the engineers thinking when they designed the placement and design of the On/Off switch ? It is poorly positioned as compared to say , a Makita , where I can still hold onto the router handles with both hands and flip off the machine using one finger.The Plunge Base Vertical Adjustment is cheap and cumbersome ! I own several other Porter Cable products and they are absolutely great ! Biscuit Jointer , Belt Sander , Nail Guns , etc . I wish I could say the same for this router kit ! After many years of satisfied use of Porter Cable products , both professionally and as a hobbiest , it pains me to write a poor review of a Porter Cable product .	-1
came out of the top within one hour 's use . They call it a 2-1/4 HP router , but it does n't have the guts of the classic PC 1-3/4 . Between going to buy it , and driving back to return it , I spent more time on the road than the router lasted . I 'll rate this a one , because I ca n't rate it negative 4 .	-1
The design of this is flawed : Once you put items in the front positions , it is a pain in the neck to get to the tools in the back . You end up pulling things out overhead and the handles of those items invariably knock the front items out of their positions . Opt for a wall-mount or bucket system instead .	-1
I picked up one of these Rubbermaid racks at a local home center just this past summer . Its sturdy enough and well made in my opinion . And for what Amazon is asking for it , its reasonable enough for what you get . However , there are two things that I feel one should consider as to this units design before ordering . The first is to take note that this is a corner unit only . It can not be placed in a shed or garage against a flat surface without it sticking out and taking up needless room . Make sure you have a corner in mind or planned for it . The second thing to consider is the units low profile that pretty much prevents it from holding and storing the very tools that it is pictured with . This unit is under two feet in height , making it very inefficient and unsteady for storing tall rakes and brooms with heavy heads on them like the ones pictured . Fill this rack up with just what is displayed and you would be just fine . As long as you do n't ever go near it or touch it . Then it will tend to spill and fall over on you . The unit comes with a hook that is supposed to `` anchor '' it to the wall . Anchored meaning it is merely held to the wall , not screwed or bolted to it . Anchoring this unit as suggested with an S hook makes it no where near secure enough to handle the tall heavy tools that it is pictured with . It will still manage to move , bend , twist around , etc , with every removal and replacement . Its very corner design makes it quite difficult to solidly attach it to a corner wall or floor . This rack is a good choice if you have a corner for it in mind , and if you have a series of low profile yard tools and such that would not tend to overload it . The S hook anchoring system is efficient enough for that . ( I found enough tools and implements that fit that description to make it worth keeping ) . However if your collection of tools are similar to the ones displayed in the photo here , I would suggest seeking out a higher profile rack . This one is unfortunately just not high enough for what the picture suggests in my opinion ...	-1
We purchased this to hold tools , just like ones shown , in our shed . Problem is the base is made of cheap plastic , with no way to connect to shed wall or any other solid structure , and everything went right over . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I agree with the other reviewers . I purchased this tool because of the Starett name and was deeply disappointed . The scale was definitely off . When you completely fold up the tool it is blatantly obvious . I e-mailed Starett and they said to return it to them for a replacement . I was not too confident that the new one would be any better . Starrett also stated they were changing the name of the tool to remove the word `` protractor '' because they had received so many complaints . In my case , I simply printed a `` red '' arrow on some sticky label paper and then cut it out and overlayed the decal on the tool . It 's not pretty but the scale now reads accurately . I would not recommend buying this until this defect is corrected .	-1
I 've been wanting a Starrett 505A yet never purchased it until last week , because I read and heard so many complaints about its inaccuracy going back to 2004 . I also understand Starrett was made aware of the problem 4 or 5 years ago and therefore I made a presumption that the inaccuracy was fixed over the period 4 to 5 years . I think I 've stumbled on the problem.and hope it will help someone.Depending on whether you open the levers with the Starretts Label to the right or left makes a huge difference.If you swing the Label Arm to the right ( clear aluminum to the left ) the reading on mine is . ( At a 45 degree Miter cut reading ) , the Zero to 90 reading is off , that will be the reading of the wall angle.The net being 1/8 inch per foot inaccuracy . [ visa versa at a perfect 90 degrees the Red Miter Arrow is off by 1/8 of an inch.To the contrary when you swing the Label Arm to the Left & Plain Alum to the right -- I get a near perfect 45 degrees . Wall measurement 45 ( red ) to Zero ( Black ) and the Miter arrow points to 45 ( red ) .Do n't ask me why . I tested this a good 10 times , each with the same readings . It 's just the way the dial label was made and doubt Starrett will change it.NOTE : An easy way to remember -- always point the `` BLACK Zero '' `` 0 '' into the corner of the wall , irregardless whether taking an inside or outside measurement.I gave it a 2 Star because Starrett could have saved me a lot of aggravation if it had instructions for that . Also , that piece of aluminum is expensive enough that they could have added a scribe or a label Ruler to one of the arms . It could be made thinner , as is , it is 1/2 inch thick and weights over 1 lb . ( Est . 1 1/2 lbs ) I can see the potential to make this tool do more than just find an angle , that carpenter can carry in his pouch to do more and weigh less .	-1
If you are looking for accuracy , look elsewhere . This scale is off by 1-2 which is unacceptable for anything but rough framing perhaps .	-1
As a stamped aluminum bevel without lock this thing is adequate . As a protractor it 's an embarrassment to the Starrett name . The scale if off by a full degree at various angles , apparently because the thick plastic decal is not die cut concentrically with its printing . That 's very poor quality for any measuring tool , and completely unexpected in a Starrett product .	-1
Just got my new 505A Protractor . With a name like Starrett , and the $ 50 advertised price , I figured I could not go wrong . Well I did . This is a great tool but not too well built . Oh it is heavy enough , but for the money 90 degrees should be just that , not 89.5 or 90.5 and yes , all the other angles are off by a half degree too . I have cheap plastic protractors that are dead on . There is no excuse for shipping these things if they are not dead on correct . I paid for a quality protractor and got an expensive T-bevel . Shame on you Starrett !	-1
The scale was off by almost two degrees . I contacted Starrett and thoroughly discussed the problem with them . I sent the Protractor to them and they sent another one to me which was not correct either . I called Starrett again but could n't get a guarantee that if I sent the second Protractor to them that I would receive one which was correct . The scales are a self sticking plastic that can not be correct if they are off center when put on . This is another nice idea that has n't been thoroughly thought out for production .	-1
Bought this and hung on the wall . The shape of this is a bit like a claw . I think that Moen has other hooks that are much more attractive than this one .	-1
There were two screws missing , so it was return . It looks very nice but could n't keep it . Back it went	-1
First the good ... the paint is nice , and it has a nice appearance . Then the not so good . 1 . The screw appears to be defectively turned , and will not close the vise , leaving it about 1/2 & # 34 ; open . Some people put wood inserts into their vises , but I only do when doing fine work . I did n't expect that I would have to just so that I could close the vise . 2 . The screw was very stiff after the vise got 1/2 closed . Oil did n't help . It turns out that the guide rods are not parallel , and the vise is binding up as it gets closed . Take the guide rods off , and the vise closes up to the last 1/2 & # 34 ; 3 . The vise is a & # 34 ; V & # 34 ; opening . Normally vises close first at the top , but this one is closing first at the bottom . So if you place a 4x4 in the vise , it closes on the bottom , and leaves a 3/8 & # 34 ; gap at the top . Summary : I have an unusable vise , and for several reasons . I will contact support for Shop Fox , but this was bought as a Christmas gift ... and now that the bench is together , the vise I got will not work , and I still have to find a vise that will work . I hope you have better luck .	-1
This is my first Grizzly power tool , which I purchased based on the rave reviews . Out of the box , I tried to plane twelve-inch maple wide for shelving . The first few passes using small incremental cuts resulted in the wood jamming , getting marred with paint and grease , and a few tear-outs . Not a good start.The jamming was caused by poor manufacturing . In the outfeed of the unit , there are two metal studs that seem to hold the board down as it exits . On my planer , one of these studs was 1/16 '' longer than the other , causing the jams and cutting into the wood . Had to file the stud down just to get the wood to pass through . I still have problems with the wood getting stained with green paint and gouges.Not sure what to think of Grizzly power tools . I should have payed more for a better unit , probably not a Grizzly .	-1
11/05/10After almost 3 years , I 'm sending this piece os $ % ^ & to the landfill . It worked well at first but it must be wearing out . I do n't use it all that much either . I can no longer get the wheels in plane . The cut drifts quite a lot on re-sawing anything more than 3 '' high . I have spent hours attempting to make it right again . The guide bearings need constant adjustment . Every cut requires several test cuts and adjustments.CRAP ! Too bad , it 's the only Grizzly tool I own that has any real issue . My table saw is 5 years old and has been the workhorse of my shop . I just checked for blade runout for the first time in a year . There was none.I will be purchasing a new Rikon model 10-325 14 '' bandsaw from Woodcraft . All the reviews are very good . They have it for $ 699 this month . With tax , that 's $ 748 . Would cost $ 829 to have shippped but I live 10 miles from a WC store . Amazon will sell for $ 744 with free shipping but it 's easier to return to the brick and morter if I have to.Update : The trunions are kinda cheap aluminium . They are held by bolts . After re-adjusting the table several times , the bolt washers were cutting up the trunions . I replaced the bolts with studs and nuts . much easier to adjust.I have resawed lots of cherry to make bookmatched door panels . I would buy this saw again but I would prefer cast trunions for more strenght and stability.I have a Grizzly table saw , Grizzly 2 hp chip and dust collector , Grizzly baby drum sander , and a Grizzly miter saw stand . They all work flawlessly . My jointer is a Jet and my planer and miter saw are DeWalt.Since this is my first bandsaw , I have nothing to compare against.Out of the box and assembled , it ran fairly smooth but had some vibration . The setup was fairly easy except for getting the table parallel to the blade . I gave up on that for now . The practice blade cut ok for crosscutting . Ripping wood caused the blade to wander slightly . Resawing wandered a bit also . But not bad for a cheapo blade.Since I purchased the riser block and upgraded resaw fence , I decided to get it all installed and work from there . The first issue was with the riser block . The pins were out of allignment with the bottom of the block . I filed them to make it work . I attempted to set things up and noticed the wheels were out of plane considerably . I started the moter . It vibrated more than a vegas bed . I attempted to resaw . Disaster . The blade tracked so much it almost broke . Shimming the bottom wheel out would be an exercise in futility . Hmmm , the riser block ! I removed the block and cut off the bottom pins with a hacksaw . Took about 30 seconds . Replaced the block and rather heavy and awkward top . Used a wood clamp to hold it on while I popped in the bolt . Tapped the whole top unit over about 1/4 '' or so to bring the wheels into coplane to within 1/32 '' or so . Tracked the blade , set the blade guides and decided to try a little resawing on some cherry . The blade still tracked badly and it started to smoke . It was ruined . I then purchased a 3/4 '' wood slicer , set up everything by the book , and did some more resawing . Sliced like butter ! Still a bit of vibration . The rubber tires had some flat spots . Replaced with orange urethane tires . $ 25 for a set of 2 from Rockler . Best price on the net . Vibration all but disappeared.The saw is solidly built , has a strong motor , and options that much higher priced saws have . The stand is very sturdy and rolls around nicely with the addition of some 2 '' wheels . The fit and finish are not nearly as nice as the Jet but I did n't buy this saw to drive to car shows . I bought it to resaw hardwoods.I expected some setup issues and was not disappointed . Definately worth the time . Would have cost about twice the cash for a comparable jet or delta.This is a nice addition to my shop . Grizzly does it again !	-1
Just thought you would like to know , I just tried to replace a disk and the glue/adheasive seems to have dried up ! I 'll be looking for another vender . Terry	-1
I have just received and used these Steelex tapered bits . The results were poor . The bits do not cut , especially into hardwoods like oak . Even in soft woods they do not cut without a significant amount of pressure on the drill . Other , more expensive , tapered bits I have used worked well . In addition to the foregoing problems the bits would spin in the drill chuck . I tried them in two different drills , both well known brand name drills which have not had any chuck problems before , and neither would hold the bits well . I do not recommend this product.AD2	-1
I love the Steelex casters , so I figured I 'd give these a try . Wow , these are poor quality . The screw is almost useless and the countersink is nigh near impossible to prevent from slipping on the shaft . I do not recommend these Countersinks . I gave them 2 stars because you get a wooden box to keep them in and I really like the Steelex Casters.Steelex D2610 4-Inch 275-Pound Swivel Double Lock Polyurethane Plate Caster	-1
I purchased this set because the idea of a countersink , with a correctly sized tapered pilot hole in one step seems like a time saver . The set delivers on these points as long as you do n't need to move the countersink towards the tip to accommodate a shorter screw . The set screws that hold the countersink in place have very little to take purchase on when it is moved onto the flutes of the drill bit . Thus , the countersink has both slipped and wobbled . This set will go in the trash when I receive the 3pc Pro Countersink Set from Rockler . This system uses a much longer sleeve between the countersink and the drill bit allowing you to move the drill within the sleeve and having adequate purchase for the set screws of the countersink .	-1
It 's interesting to someone who has owned the original American made Dowl-It for many years to see all these cheaper copies pop up in the last few decades ; the Dowl-It patent or copyright must have expired.The Dowl-It has been made in America since its inception in 1947 . After having used this bullet-proof original for so long , which not only does a perfect job but just wo n't break , I do n't think I would ever buy a copy .	-1
This is a peace of junk . The cutters are glued in or something . I took out all of the screws and I still could not pull them out of the wood block .	-1
Where to start ? I 've got some finicky , old tools that I absolutely love tinkering with to make them perfect . Who does n't like fiddling with their planes ? Even those crabby ancient bailey 's that take a bit of finesse to make 'just right'.This thing , however ... Poor manufacturing has left me with a tool which just barely does the work that it looks like it should.This simple tool takes far to long to set up . The iron sucks in , drops down and moves left and right as well as turning while tightening the set screws . This one issue alone is more frustrating than the tool is worth . Once `` set up '' it does a decent job at what it is made for . After trying to get the thing right on about 4 different occasions I find that I still grab my block plane before using this even crosses my mind.The brass track needed attention . Out of the box it was leaving a clear mark on the work as the edges of the track are too sharp.The maple body is covered in wood filler . Even at key structural points , such as at the mouth of the plane and around the set screw holes , there is wood filler vainly trying to compensate for shoddy craftsmanship/manufacturing.As the wood rolls up the blade , while planning , the shavings get jammed in the blade seat , making cleaning this tool difficult.It does all right . Not great . Definitely is not replacing my block plane for rounding and chamfering edges on my nicer projects.I would , however , recommend this for someone doing laminate work where grain run is not an issue . This thing just does n't want to stop chattering and tear out happens almost as a rule , it seems.I might also recommend this to someone who has a large volume of corners to round over . It could very well be valuable in a fast production environment . Probably like the environment this thing was produced in.Bottom line , this is not a tool that I would recommend to any one doing fine wood working . It will , more than likely , sit unused next to your nice tools which you love to use and which give you more joy than frustration . Unlike this thing which is remarkably frustrating to own.But hey ... it does n't cost much does it ?	-1
My Grizzly air filter arrived today . Unfortunately , like others have stated the machine arrived with loose parts inside . 3 of the 4 bolts holding the blower to the cage had fallen out and one one still in place was extremely loose . Given , it was not terribly difficult to put everything back together but I should n't have fix something right out of the box . I would expect much more from a product that cost me over $ 400 after tax . I still have a 2 inch bolt and corresponding nut that was loose inside the case that I 'm not sure where they go . The machine was packaged fine and there was no sign of damage on the packaging so the issue appears to originate during the manufacturing process.Once I re-assembled everything , it appears to work fine . I will put it to the test tonight.I am a big fan of Grizzly products . I used to live very close to there headquarters in Bellingham , WA and have purchased many items from them . This is very discouraging .	-1
Nice looking . The pad has a surface film of some slippery plastic and does n't grip anything . It may feel like you have a grip on the wood but when the wood reaches the blade it turns out this push block has no grip on the work .	-1
Does not fit the Ridgid TS2400LSI ordered these via Amazon after looking at the Leecraft siteto see if they listed my table saw . They did and I foundlisted the Ridgid TS2400 that the CR-1 plate was supposed to fit.Well , it does not . The plate is missing a critical locking tabbut what is worse it lacks the proper thickness to fit the openingsafely . The dimensions match the oblong hole just fine however it is thethickness and built in offset panel on the plate that I could not work around.I pondered attempting to modify it but could not see a way to safelydo so . It would be easier to buy blank mats and make my own with a router than fool with that.Overall the item looks well made but they have incorrect information on theirsite regarding this plate and the Ridgid 2400 table saw.Perhaps there is some difference between 2400 and 2400LS but if that is so theyneed to make that clear on their site.It is for the incorrect description on their site ( leecraft ) that I rated this a 2.If I could rate Amazons return policy separate it would be a 5 for their service .	-1
At first glance , this looks like a nice design , however , it has two significant flaws that can be annoying and can make it unsuitable for many applications.The design : Wedges inside the inverted U-channel aluminum bar expand both sides of the bar . Adjusting screws flush with the top surface pull the aluminum wedges up against the matching sloped inside surface of the bar 's sides.Problems:1 . This design expands BOTH sides of the miter bar to make it fit snugly in the miter slot . Unfortunately , that means that the `` Miter Slider '' has no fixed reference edge . Since most jigs depend on a fixed reference edge , e.g. , from one edge of a miter slot to a saw blade , any adjustment in the `` Miter Slider '' will ruin the initial setup , require the jig be re-calibrated , and possibly ruin the jig . Jigs that use two parallel miter slots , such as a table saw crosscut sled , will also be affected , since the distance between the `` Miter Slider '' guide bars changes when one of them is tightened or loosened.Examples I 've experienced of the need to adjust the snugness of the `` Miter Slider '' after the initial fitting include ( a ) loosening a bar that , in retrospect , is a little too tight or too loose ; ( b ) tightening the bar after it wears in to better fit the shape of the miter slot after a few dozen passes and becomes a little loose ( it 's an aluminum bar frequently in a cast iron miter slot ) or simply becomes loose with wear over time ; and ( c ) loosening the fit of a bar that was snug when it was cool , but has expanded with warmth to be too snug.Other designs use adjustable plugs , or other means , to adjust only one side of the miter bar . This leaves the other unchanged edge as a reference edge.To its credit , the Miter Slider 's design results in a smooth transition at the point of the adjustable width , while the first adjustable plug on other designs will sometimes catch on the side of the miter slot.The Miter Slider design is fine for jigs that need only to slide , and do n't depend on a constant distance from the miter slot to the saw blade.2 . There is enough friction between the wedges and the matching sloped inside surfaces of the bar sides ( both aluminum ) that they do n't release smoothly , resulting in significant backlash -- as much as a half a turn of the adjusting screws . This means that if you overshoot even slightly ( such that the bar is too tight ) , you can not just back off a little . You have to back off significantly and start over . I adjust bars by sliding them through the miter slot as I gradually tighten each adjustment screw . If it 's nicely snug at one point in the slot , it may bind in another point in the slot , but you ca n't just back off a little , you wind up backing off significantly before the wedge slides free . A little tapping on the Allen wrench might help free the wedge . This significant backlash in the adjustment is annoying , but is n't a fatal problem since you do it rarely . A little spray wax or lubricant between the wedges and the side walls might resolve this issue .	-1
Was not happy with this clamp , since it broke after the first use ... the tension snaps are positioned and function poorly and I ended up smashing a finger ... oh well .	-1
I have purchased four or five of these containers . EVERY one of them has gone hard and dry in spite of properly sealing the container after use . I contacted the manufacturer to complain about the early and quick demise of their product and request a replacement . They refused . They told me to contact the selling store for a free replacement and that the mfg has a replacement agreement in place with retailers . The manager of Ace Hardware innitially told me he has never heard of such agreement . Ace however DID exchange the can for me at no charge . The manufacturer also told me that the container is a `` TEMPORARY CONTAINER '' ! ! ! They advised me to transfer remaining product into an air tight container ! It is a little too late for that now it appears . I 'd ONLY buy this product if I intended to use it ALL in one day . It works fine when the can is first opened .	-1
My lid was not cracked . I got about 3 uses out of this but after a month it turned into a gummy mess and had to toss it out . I guess I should have put it inside the house instead of leaving it in the hot garage ? Even when it was brand new , I found it to be messy and difficult to work with , never was able to get a clean finish , always messy looking	-1
I bought these because I thought they would fit Pony 50 and Pony 56 clamps that I ordered . They were the wrong size and were made for much smaller clamps . Even if they had fit I probably would have sent them back anyway because instead of being made of rubber they were made of cheap plastic .	-1
I bought these as throw aways . The bristles look like they where trimmed with a meat cleaver . I take that back , perhaps they just run a lawn mower over them . On top of that the fibers are as stiff as a hair brush .	-1
I ordered these a few weeks ago and still have n't gotten them yet . I went online to check why and saw that Amazon has them as `` Usually ships in 1-4 Months '' . They are n't natural bristles so it 's not like they have to wait for the hair to grow and for some elf to carve each handle by hand . I 'm a huge Amazon fan but they let me down on this item .	-1
I unfortunately waited until the return period had expired before I used these , and they 're terrible . They just do n't cut . I 'm not saying they kinda work , but make shoddy holes , I 'm saying they do nothing but leave a circular burn on your work ( see pic above ) .Go for a different set .	-1

I bought this for light touch-up on planer blades between sharpening ; It did n't do much . I think for this to be effective , it needs to include some sort of attatchment for maintaining an angle against the cutting blade . It is supposed to work by just putting the edge of the plastic against the cutter knife , and sliding back and forth a few times at the appropriate angle . Well , unless you 've got robotically perfect arms , you 're not going to be able to keep the angle correct . If you could maintain that angle , you might be able to touch up a micro bevel , but nothing substantial at all . They were relatively effective when removing the burr created though . That aspect was pretty foolproof . They cost me less than a professional sharpening , so I figure I 'm not out too much , but I certainly would n't recommend them to anyone .	-1
I have a Delta saw with a 4 inch sawdust outlet and I have not been able to find anything that will allow me to size it down to a Craftsman vacuum hose size . I thought this was made smaller on each end to accommodate a 4 inch hose connection ; thus , I could attach another device to this one to size down the saw outlet.Wrong . This is exactly 4 inches in diameter . Another fitting that is also 4 inches will not fit it.Guess I am stuck . I do n't see how this would make anything into a quick disconnect unless what it is attaching to is more than 4 inches in diameter.AD2	-1
The stone arrives with a big chunk broken . It works fine to sharpen but I wasnt very happy about receiving a broken product .	-1
I wish that I have found this product in a store prior to my purchase . That would have saved a very expensive mistake . This sander has a number of design flaws that should not exist in a $ 500+ product . For one thing you have to remove three screws and the dust collector pan under the belt sander just to change belts . The miter gauge is useless on the belt sander because the bar collides with the guard on the back of the disc sander . You have to use a special long Allen wrench to move the support rest from the disk sander to the belt sander . You also need 12mm and 14mm wrenches to adjust the belt sander angle and small belt sander support rest . The instruction manual is the WORST that I have ever seen . The dust port on the belt sander is 2 inch diameter and the dust port on the disk sander is 2-1/2 inch diameter . Why the difference ? Be prepared to buy adapters for whichever size dust collector you are using . Lastly , the sanding belt that was included was absolute junk . The seam in the belt was a lap seam which causes the piece that you are trying to sand to bounce off of the seam every time it comes around to the object that you are sanding .	-1
it serves both to bigger dust collection and smaller dust collection . there are many diameter options at our hands . i needed the 6 '' to 5 '' and 2-1/2 '' to 2 '' reducers and did not have to buy two of them so i saved money . a must .	-1
If I had read the reviews more carefully I would have realized that this is a heavy , rigid plastic rather than being somewhat flexible like others I 've bought . For the price I 'll hang on to it for possible future use but it 's not something I 'd buy again .	-1
My marking wheel will not stay screwed on the end . This is not a defect and I think this is just a cheap tool . Now I have to buy another marking gauge because this one is so bad . I have it 2 stars because it does work as long as you keep tightening the screw that holds the wheel . The most expensive tool is a cheap tool !	-1
I did n't actually buy this tool , a friend of mine gave it to me . I was happy , he said he had two . I took it into the shop and what a disappointment . It is sad that companies get away with selling this low quality merchandise on the market . But sadder still , my beloved Amazon , in whom I have become a firm supporter over ten years SELLS the stuff . Is there nobody who examines this merchandise before they begin to sell it ? You would think that there would be quality assurance departments staffed with people knowledgeable in their fields with certain kinds of tools . Or send ten out to carefully selected `` experts '' who would try them , evaluate them , and send them back to Amazon with a critique . I have to admit , I 'm scared of what I see happening with Amazon over the last few years . Walk away from this one .	-1
Like many items that come out of China , it LOOKS like a marking gauge , but sadly it is not . I really am not sure what it is . When I got it , the package was open and the item was rolling around in the box . After examining it , I notices that the cutting wheel part was not only dull ( and I mean so dull it does n't look like it was meant to ever cut anything ) but it had scars and chips across the edges , as though someone had either already tried to use it , or just gotten exasperated and smashed it down . Upon trying to use it , I found the marking wheel so dull it would not CUT a mark , it merely DENTED a mark . When I took the wheel off to examine it , I was unable to screw the wheel back in again due to stripped threads . Wow.Do n't waste your money . This thing is not a marking gauge .	-1
I read the reviews before I ordered these . I was worried because it seemed many of those reviews were written by professional cabinet makers ... it is my experience over many years that people doing things for money have different priorities than someone working on their own home , which is me.And , for the record , I am an accomplished DIY'er and once owned a cabinet shop.1 . These things are incredibly unforgiving . I mean , a 1/16 '' off means they wo n't work worth a damn . For DIY'ers retrofitting existing cabinetry that has been used and abused for years and years ( my situation ) , a 1/16 '' tolerance is damn difficult . Hell , I bet installing these one most new cabinetry would require shimming one 's brains out.2 . Even when precisely installed ( and by precisely , I mean re-building the sides of the cabinets to exactly meet drawer width plus slide width as opposed to cheap ass shimming ) , these things require more than a little effort to slide . Now , perhaps the effort required to open and close will lessen over time but I like my cabinets to work with a touch of a hand and I seriously doubt these will ever meet that criteria ... possibly a necessary trade off to get 100 # capacity , or perhaps a cost issue , but I have n't worked with other brands so I do n't know.Bottom line , if I had it to do again , I 'd live with the worn out slides I had or I 'd try another brand or a different type of slide ... I just do n't like the way these go in nor the way they work once in.Edit 11/12/13 : Had these a while now , use the drawers several times every day . Still do n't like them . In retrospect , I think these are designed for industrial applications for oversized and heavily loaded drawers . As such , they do n't belong in the normal kitchen . By way of comparison , I installed two new pull out pantry slides from another manufacturer with a load capacity of 300 # per . They slide , when loaded , more easily and more evenly than the slides being reviewed when installed on small , single drawers . In other words , my new pull outs , which are 3 times the size of a normal kitchen cabinet drawer , operate more smoothly than do these single drawer slides . Both installed by me . Both installed in existing cabinetry . Bottom line the same , I do n't like these .	-1
First , this is partly my fault . Normally I buy KV brand slides . Because of that instead of hunting for them on Amazon I just went to my list of purchases and typed in & # 34 ; Slides & # 34 ; in the search . The slides I have purchased in the past popped up . I clicked on one of them and it took me to the slides that I bought the last time . This time I needed 26 & # 34 ; slides so I clicked on the box offering the various sizes . I verified that I was ordering 26 & # 34 ; slides and added them to my cart . I did n't pay attention that the brand had changed to & # 34 ; Shop Fox & # 34 ; so that 's what I bought . UGH ! When I first opened the package I realized that there were no screws . Not that big of a deal , I have plenty so let 's move on . There are no instructions so if you are an inexperienced installer , that may be a slight hinderence . Next up I took them apart and installed them on the drawers and cabinet . When I went to slide the draw box in the drawer on the right gave me a hard time . I built the cabinet and was positive my measurements were accurate but hey , let 's double check . Cabinet dimensions are the same for both drawers and draw boxes were the same for both . WTF ? I switched drawers and again the right side would not slide in . It would enter the opening on the rails but stopped way . I did n't get it . There are no screw heads in the way and the openings were correct . After an inspection of the slides I removed the cabinet half of the slides , swapped the openings and reinstalled them . Now the left drawer would n't go in . I took the left slides out and tried to slide them onto the drawers . Aha ! One of the slides themselves was the problem . As I removed the cabinet part of slide from the drawer box I heard the sound of ball bearings hitting the floor and bouncing in every direction , then the retainer plate hitting the floor . That 's just great . I recovered all but one ball bearing . I put the slide back together and reinstalled it with one bearing missing . I carefully reinserted the drawer and it has been working . I 'm going to leave it alone for the time being but I 'm certain that one day I 'll hear my wife tell me & # 34 ; The drawer in the laundry cabinet is stuck and I ca n't move it . Save yourself a ton of grief . Be careful and buy KV 's .	-1
Well you get what you pay for ! One part of the product description is false . They can not all be used in combination . The big one has a different thickness . Also forget about any of them being square.Oddly they are all just the same amount off . I guess I 'll give them to my 5 year old to play with . Lesson understood ! J. Maier Houston TX .	-1
Received these this morning and checked them against my reference square from Incra . None of them matched the reference . My Incra matches my Starret square so I trust it . These are not far off , but the reason for owning them is accuracy . Will be returning these to Amazon .	-1
Out of the box : held one square against the other ; these two look to be about a 1/64 & # 34 ; off . These are n't tools , they 're child 's toys . Sending them back within 5 minutes of opening . Save your money and buy the real thing	-1
These are probably square enough for most people , but not anywhere close to true square when compared to a quality machinist square .	-1
I do n't know if it was this particular one or if it 's through the whole line but this thing did n't fit the Grizzly G0555LX bandsaw . The pins did n't match , and when I got the pins/ holes as close as I could the riser block was offset to the frame by a good 1/4 inch . Since I have over 20 years in the powersports industry there was no way I was going to attempt to force it . If any of you are thinking on buying it , please keep in mind that you may have to return it due to the same issues that I had	-1
Should have updated this years ago . I could never get my blade to cut straight with this piece of junk attached . I removed it and trashed it.It works after some hacksawing . The holes drilled into the block do n't match up with the little tabs on the saw . Had to file them . This block caused my saw to vibrate like a vegas bed . I cut off the tabs and now the wheels of the saw are back in plane and the vibration is gone . What else can I say , it 's a 6 '' riser . It does what it needs to do after some re-engineering .	-1
I ordered this set because of awesome reviews on it . It had 4.9 stars ... seriously ? The set of files I received is poor made . Retail packaging was not damaged but `` Round file '' was bend and useless now . Handles are also poor made . I saved pictures but do n't have an option to attach them . I do n't want to keep those files even if the price would be a dollar per file or $ 6 per set . Disappointed & have to return the order.P.S . I wish an option from Amazon to attach at least 1 picture of what customers do n't like about the order.Read comments below for PICTURES :	-1
Ordered three of these pencils and none of them came with lead . Just go to to your local store and buy a mechanical pencil .	-1
It 's stupid . I do n't know why I bought this . Just go to staples or use a # 2 pencil . NO , there is nothing special or woodworking related about this .	-1
Nice , sturdy , well made bag . As an industrial electrician , I carry a lot of screwdrivers , flat , phillips and hex head to name a few . Not near enough screwdriver loops for my needs . I have gone to another style bag .	-1
For twelve bucks you get one adapter and a bolt . Rockler dot com ( which I think bought Bench Dog ) has a `` Miter Slot Hardware Kit '' with two adapters , each with a bolt *and* a knob , and costs $ 7 . They are perhaps not the same material , but appear to have the same purpose , and cost less than a third of the price .	-1
This mobile base does function to a point.You crank , crank , crank on the two feet to lock it down so it wo n't move , then crank , crank , crank again to bring the feet up if you want to move it.It is so much of a hassle and difficult to get to where the feet are around the saw that I put this mobile base on three years ago and have not moved my saw since.Thankfully the wife has given up on being able to park cars in our garage now .	-1
I bought this to use with a G0593 jointer . Installation was pretty straight forward and the base looks good . The problem is it just does not work ! The only way you can move this base is by pushing it hard enough so the casters will slide on the surface . The swiveling casters always tend to lock to prevent the base from moving and the other ones do n't rotate very well anyway . The base seems pretty sturdy for the 400+lbs jointer but the casters are just of cheap quality . Of course it 's hard to return now that a heavy machine is on it . I would NOT buy this or recommend it to anyone .	-1
Purchased 2 of these batteries as a replacement for my original that finally died and I am not impressed with the quality . I do n't know what the difference is between the battery that came with the tool verses these replacement batteries but they do n't last long at all after a full charge . Definitely not worth buying .	-1
battery 's did n't last I do n't use the unit anymore one was ok the other did n't hold a charge my money was good	-1
Have not been able to incorporate this tool in my activity . It seems too instable for precise application . I think the Shaper/Router will be more useful .	-1
got this and one of the bars were bent that let you router in a straight line or cut in a straight line.. but for me this is ok , cause I will not us this feature much at all ... . but actually this is piss poor craftsmanshiip on this product , not like I am used to getting from Amazon ... they dropped the ball on this one ... ... I would not recommend this to anyone else ... .	-1
It works fine if you use it over wood that does n't will be the final side or you will need to sand it again , because the plastic base makes scratches on the wood.Another problem was that when I received it , the nut that holds the rotatory tool was kind of crashed ; it works but I think it will last only a few months and will be broken..	-1
Let me start by saying I am a happy owner of several Dremel products . Generally their stuff is great.That being said , do n't waste your money on this plunge router accessory . It is very poorly designed . The whole purpose of buying a miniature plunge router base to use the Dremel as a mini plunge router is to achieve a higher degree of accuracy than what can be achieved using a standard size router . This is not possible using this tool . The major problem with this thing is that it is 90 % plastic . This becomes a problem when setting and attempting to maintain an exact depth . The depth is held on only one side by tightening down one of the handles . The other side does not tighten and still has a ton of play ( up to 1/8 inch up and down ) . Unacceptable ! They should have made it tighten on both sides . In fact , due to the play on the one side , it does n't even sit level when pressure is applied to the springs . Tighten down one side and the opposite side is slightly higher due to the upward pressure of the spring.Dremel should scrap this design and start over .	-1
I bought the Dremel 10.8v rotary cordless drill for the purpose of removing tile grout . At first it worked well . But , the battery only lasted 45 minutes . Then the problems started . The 1/16 inch grout bits only lasted a few minutes then broke . I had better luck when I was removing 1/8 inch grout because the 1/8 inch bit lasted for hours before it started getting dull . Since the grout bits are not well made , I found another brand that cuts much better , much cheaper in price , and last longer.I HAD to get the grout removed and this was the only tool I found that would do that . But , after a few days the Dremel broke . I still had grout to take care of , so I bought a corded Dremel to continue the work while the cordless was sent in for repairs . To the credit of Dremel , the cordless was promptly repaired and returned along with a free accessory for my trouble . I started using the cordless again and it stopped working again . This time it just stayed on fast speed . So , off it went to the post office again to send in this thing for repair . It is repaired again , but this time I am using the corded Dremel.I also tried the tool on other jobs such as removing paint from a window frame , sanding a small section of wood , drilling a pilot hole for a screw , and cutting off a screw that I could not remove . What I found was that the Dremel did a fair job if you have a steady hand . However , some of the accessories either break easily or grind down quickly . And these accessories are not cheap . You can easily spend 3 times the price in bits and accessories than what you pay for the tool itself.The bottom line is , this thing is mostly good for small work such as crafts . But , can also come in handy when a large drill or sander just will not fit . Just stay away from the cordless .	-1
I had wanted this Dremel for quite some time but I found this one to be much too delicate for my use . This particular Dremel Tools ' ( and perhaps all Dremel motors ) use of what would seem to be plastic internal gearing make it unsuitable for tasks such as cutting a single thin wall tile -- even though Dremel sells bits claiming to be designed for this purpose . I mention plastic gears although I have not disassembled the tool to confirm this suspicion but regardless of the actual material used this item is too delicate for some uses that Dremel claims it is capable of . Caveat emptor !	-1
I have been using a Dremel tool for a long time , the old ones had great ball bearings and powerful motors . Today , both the cordless nad the corded units are mass producted and the quality is fair at best . I have gone thru three of these 10.8 volt cordless . As soon as it heats up during normal use , it shuts off or starts to smoke . Once they smoke they have had it ! Buy a new one . Customer service is great , but the tools are not what they use to be .	-1
This can be very handy when you need a Dremel tool but ca n't or do n't want to get out the extension cord . Biggest drawback is that it Stalls way too easily and that trips the internal circuit breaker . Then you have to shut off the tool , wait a few seconds , then you can turn it back on . That means that a lot of simple quick jobs are going to take a lot longer than they should have . Only option is to be very very careful not to Stall the tool but then it will still take longer to finish the job . I 'm not using this tool anywhere near what I had hoped to , instead I 'm getting the extension cord out and using my regular Dremel . Other drawback is that the Battery Packs are very expensive considering their size and power . I would still buy it but overall I 'm disappointed with this tool and will continue to look for an alternative that does n't have this tool 's problems .	-1
You know , it looks great in the video , and it does what it says , but honestly , I never use it . I can do the same thing with other tools I already have on the job , and none of the guys are used to working with this . The attachments are a pain to swap , and easy to lose . A drill , a grinder , a sawzall , and a handheld drywall saw are always on site and in use anyway , so this stays in the shop . Also , it 's a lot harder to get nice straight cuts than it looks . If all you were doing was cutting circles in drywall for two days it might make sense to break this thing out , but in reality , it 's more of a pain to bring an extra tool , and switch over , for the few things this might actually do better than another tool . If you do n't have other tools maybe this is of more value to you than it is to me , but I would not buy it again .	-1
Do not apply any pressure to this when in use , it stops the blade . older models work better . Not happy with this at all . Ca n't even cut through thin pine . Good for the accessories and that 's it .	-1
Just a month beyond the warranty expiring , one of the brush springs broke . There are no parts available for this tool . For lack of a 5 cent spring , the entire kit is now scrap metal . Unacceptable !	-1
I usually will rate my entire customer experience with the product ... including purchase and delivery.Great sale price at the time ... however , once again , Amazon lives up to form with respect to shipping . I wonder if it is possible for me to ship them a roll of packing tape for usage on all of my orders ? ? The box arrived last night ... with parts taped to the outside . It seems that the Amazon shipping department STILL has n't learned what a roll of packing TAPE is yet . BOTH package ends were ripped open since it was shipped in its native packaging and there is quite a bit of weight in the box . At least UPS managed to get all of the parts delivered ! There are some scratches on it , and I will be calling Amazon after I write this review . At least all of the pieces managed to arrive.Documentation is poor ... there is no included documentation , ( at least that was delieverd ) ... the documentation is on the outside of the box , which is a total diaster with all the tape that UPS used to tape the pieces to the outside of the box . Just some tape from amazon around the ouside ends of the box would have prevented this problem.Functionally , I have n't mounted it yet . When I do , I might come back here and rerate the product , but for now it being rated at 1 star.Call after call , and complaint after complaint to Amazon NEVER seems to improve their shipping problems . I can get a large roll of THICK packing tape for $ 1 at the dollar store ... I am SURE that Amazon can get it for even cheaper . If they use the right size boxes for items they ship AND use more that one strip of THIN packing tape ( when they use tape at all ) , they would have less shipping costs AND make customers like me , even more satisfied.Oh well ...	-1
This unit is comprised of a timer which is worth maybe $ 3 and a 120 volt to 12 volt transformer , maybe another $ 3 in a plastic case , maybe $ 3 WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN since Intermatic put screws in with heads which are impossible to turn . I broke mine open SIMPLY TO RECONNECT A LOOSE WIRE which corrected the problem . Both Intermatic and Malibu are has beens and I would not recommend any of their products where there are alternatives to purchase .	-1
We purchased this item to replace a similar unit in which the timer had failed . What we recently discovered is that the timer does NOT control the power to the transformer . The timer controls the low voltage output to the lights ; which may put less stress on the timer , but otherwise is unsatisfactory . The transformer hum is much louder than the previous unit . Our timer is located in the front hall closet which should prolong the life of the unit , but the transformer hums day and night , no matter whether the timer is on or off . This is not only irritating is also not efficient from an energy-saving perspective . We should have paid more for a better model .	-1
I have had both a Malibu 200 watt and 121 watt transformer for over 10 years with no problem with either of these . I decided to replace my halogen landscaping lights with much more efficient LED lights as a way of reducing my electric bill . Since that also reduced the demand on these transformers , I thought it would be a good idea to replace the 200 watt transformer with this 88 watt model ... .also thinking I might want to replace both ; but fortunately I only replaced one to see how well it worked ... .in short , it was a very bad decision to replace either of them.After measuring the actual watts used by each of the transforms , I discovered what reviewer `` Dinoz '' discovered : `` ... the timer does NOT control the power to the transformer '' like it does on the Malibu models . What does this mean ? Well , assume you want your landscaping lights on for 4 hrs each night , and off for the remaining 24 . The transformer alone draws about 36 watts of power , so at 10 cents/kw-hr , you would be paying an extra $ 26/yr for this transform to be unnecessarily on for the remaining 20 hours/day ... eliminating or significantly reducing any savings by switching to LED lights . I also discovered that as long as the total load on the transformer was greater than about 40 watts , the difference in power requirements between the 88 , 121 and 200 watt systems was very minor and I should simply continue to use my old transformers . I do n't know if Malibu 's 200 and 121 watt models are still available , or have changed in the last 10 years ; but anyone would be wise to pay more for a model where the transformer cuts off with the lights , even if it is rated at more watts than is needed.Update : My older 200 watt Malibu transformer failed and I replaced it withIntermatic ML121RT Low Voltage 121-Watt Power Pack with Timer , Blackfor less than $ 22 on Amazon . This is the same as my 121 watt Malibu model , where the transformer cuts off with the lights , only drawing about 10 watts to run the clock . This is a much better transformer , and a bargain at this price !	-1
This is not a review of the timer/transformer , just a way to use the transformer after the timer stops working . I to have had problems with the timer/transformers for the low voltage landscape lighting . As stated , they are costly , but the part that costs the most is the transformer , the timer is the least expensive part , so what I did when the timer did not work anymore , I bought an outdoor timer , ( about $ 10.00 on Amazon.com ) and plugged that timer into the elect . outlet and than set the timer/transformer to the on position and let the new timer turn the transformer on and off . Another option is to get an outdoor remote control and plug the timer/transformer into that so you can turn the transformer on and off from a remote location ( inside the house ) , etc .	-1
I bought a few of these and was disappointed . I tried to use these to dim accent lighting on my bookcases , but they make the lights flicker and show a very uneven current being transmitted to the lights . When I use a different dimmer , the lights do not flicker , so I know that these dimmers are at fault . Expected MUCH better from Lutron .	-1
Most reviews are positive , but mine came defective and I 'm sending it back to Amazon for refund . Might have been an isolated case .	-1
I started using this a couple of months ago and it was great -- - dimmed incandescent bulbs and had a nice little red light on it which made it easy to find in the dark . Today , it died ! The bulb had burned out and the dimmer would not work after putting a new bulb in the lamp .	-1
I 've read dozens of reviews about the unit giving out after a short period of time and I 've had another Lutron ( exact model but white ) that failed on me in less than a month . That should have been a tip-off , but nooo ... ooo I had to walk into this one -- again ! Shame on me ! The dimmers had not been abused and had simply been used to dim 60W incandescent lightbulbs . -- and this IS the model for dimming incandescent/halogen lights ( there are other models that dim CFL/LED lights ( No , thank you ! ) such asthis one ) .To be fair , I have anotherLutron ( without the LED pilot light ) that 's still working after a year . Could it be that the LED version is defective ? Lutron , this is not an isolated case . There are dozens of customers with the same problem . Look , on this page of reviews alone , there are three other customers with the same problem . Looking at the earlier reviews , I see that it 's a problem going way back . Is it REALLY so hard to make a working dimmer ? ? I contacted Lutron about the problem and have not received a response.Simply . Not . Acceptable .	-1
I bought two of these . Within two weeks , one of them stopped working completely . The other one works fine , except sometimes it will lose its luminance setting and you have to mess with the slider to get it to `` wake up '' again . Honestly , the shoddy quality is not worth the price of the product . I would recommend instead getting a cheap `` in-socket '' dimmer . Those are a lot more reasonable in price , and much more sturdy in the long run .	-1
This product takes a long time to perforate the paper enough to get remover through the paper . You should scrape off the vinyl first and just use a utility knife . There is no way to extend your reach with this tool either . Waste of money .	-1
I had to remove 30+ year old vinyl wallpaper from two bathrooms . I bought this unit at Lowes . It broke almost immediately . I jury rigged it and used it on one bathroom . It deeply scored the drywall under the wallpaper , which would have been OK if I was going to repaper , but not if I intended to paint , which I did.I found that ripping off the vinyl layer and completely wetting the part which remained on the wall equally effective - this worthless plastic gadget really made no difference . I did not use it on the second bathroom and the paper came off easily with no damage to the drywall . Used lots of water and re-moistened with a sprayer . Allow time for the water to soak through and keep the surface moist . Search Amazon for Griots 11022 sprayer for the best sprayer.I returned the unit for a refund - it truly was a piece of junk . I also suggest doing some research before you start - know what kind of wallpaper you have and how to best remove it . Be prepared to wash all the residual paste off after you are done - there will be lots left on the wall . Warm soapy water and a sponge will do the trick .	-1
For us , removing wall paper that had been pre-wetted and scraped off , this tool really did n't help at all . In fact , it made it worse because at times the paper came off in a perforated pattern and in a ton of pieces .	-1
at first i was disappointed in the flimsy nature of the product . i figured it should be intuitive and easy to use . not so . it seemed the product was broken as it would not work . so i had to make a long distance call at my expense . there after three attempts , someone told me they had a problem with the product they had not anticipated . they were correcting it by including instructions . so the person told me the 'secret ' of how to make this foolish thing work . i followed the cumbersome instructions and got it to -just sort of work . but it is a very awkard procedure and even then sometimes it does work and then again it will just not . this item sure is not worth the money , not worth the hassle , and not worth having to make a toll call . all it is good for i think is as a straight edge ... foregoing any plans to have it clamp easily to wood and guide a saw . never would i have bought this ahd i seen it beforehand .	-1
Title says it all . If you want an angle cut , this and most others of the single clamp type , are useless . Only good guide system needs a clamp on both ends .	-1
I got this clamp to use as a straight edge with a saw but it does not clamp into place worth a darn . It 's not worth much more than a paper weight . As soon as you push up ageist it , it will move .	-1
Not horrid but without theAll in One Clamp # WJ Wide Jaws Fixture for All in One Clamp ( 2-Pack ) for another $ 17 per clamp , the clamp faces are too narrow to make contact with anything but flat boards . The T track is of no use as its a peculiar size so they get to sell more accessories . They do work OK as a straight edge but not nearly as good as the Bora 540950 50 Inch Aluminum Guide Clamp Edge , they make a bunch of sizes . I thought I was getting a good deal from Rockler on a blow out set of 24 '' , 36 '' and 50 '' . Turns out to not be a good deal after all . I see now why they are getting rid of them cheap.BTW I thought that the marking tape was a good idea -- NOT ! It is hard to align accurately and even that is dubious . Maybe OK for rough framing but not otherwise .	-1
Unless I 'm doing something wrong , this clamping guide is n't all it 's made out to be.Here 's my story : I already have a very nice table saw that has rails long enough to cut a full sheet of plywood in half , though that does n't mean it 's something that I like to do while I 'm alone . That being said , I like to use the circular saw to make the panels more manageable in size before putting them on the table saw . This guide will certainly do this , but do n't expect your cuts be to square . I even bought longer 'guide feet ' ( not sure what to call them ) , which are supposed to create a larger surface to square against , and this too does n't really help. [ ... ] If you 're going to use a clamping system you should be able to have precision and accuracy when cutting and this does n't fulfill the promises of the manufacturer . Good luck .	-1
the clamp seemed first off to be on the thin side . i tried to get it to clamp on A table and could not . so wrote customer service and got an arrogant , patronizing , rude response laying blame on me for being less in ability than one should be . it went on saying to view their online video to see how to make it work . guess working with wood for 50 some years does n't count . i tried to use other clamps to hold it down and check what other reviewers said about the 'give ' in the middle . true , esp when using a router . anyway needing an online video tells me something ... when it should be easy and intuitive.i finally called them . was disconnected the first time , on hold the 2nd ... gave up ( their package does not give a toll-free number-so at one 's own expense ) . caled again the next day and got thru ok. the guy said they had experienced a problem and were including instructions on newer clamps explaining how to set the traveling end clamp . FINALLY i was able to use the thing . i ; d give it a three-star , but based on that email sent me from their customer service , it will be two . i guess those types have to make others feel less , esp when they have a problem of their own.hopefully others who risk buying this thing will fare better when they get adequate instructions ,	-1
I have a pair of these kneepads ... ..ouch ! ! The straps cut into the back of my knees so bad that I have to take them off after about 45 min . Buy something else . I wish I could get my money back on these .	-1
I wonder if people realize that this item is ONLY for a set of wide jaws and NOT for the clamp ! I do n't own this , but see it atop the best selling list ( at this time ) and after a couple of minutes of looking at it I realized that this offering was NOT for the clamp ... I would wager that most purchasers thought it was for the clamp ... the product page is a bit misleading .	-1
ALL of this manufacturer 's clamps are badly designed . The jaws are too shallow to work as a clamp effectively . The wide jaws add about 1/3 '' to the depth and substantial width . They are quite effective although in the last analysis they should not be necessary . They salvage an otherwise nearly useless straight edge so it is a bit usable as a clamp .	-1
I was hoping the larger jaw would help the guide sort of self-square , but that 's not the case . Since you still have to fiddle around moving the these wider jaws just get in the way and really do n't clamp things any tighter .	-1
I 've been wearingYoungstown Glove 03-3110-80-L Carpenter Plus Gloves , Largefor years.I thought I 'd give these a try.The pair I had could not stand the daily wear and tear on commercial and industrial job sites . It was n't long before the seams started coming apart . It took about 2 months and they were a safety problem because they were catching on everything . Into the trash they went .	-1
I 'm a carpenter and had been looking for a replacement to my Makita pouch that came free with the last circular saw I bought . The belt was too loose , and the speed square was constantly falling out , and the pouch would pull my pants down . Finally the rivets holding the hammer loop broke out and it was time to replace it.So I really wanted this rig to be the solution . Alas , it is not.These things always seem to be designed for the ultimate fat-a $ $ , and this one is no exception . It says it will fit a 29 '' waist but I wear a 32 and the last holes on the belt are still not tight enough for me , unless I 'm wearing a sweatshirt . Strike one.The suspenders are just about useless . I 'm 6'1 '' and I actually wanted to tighten them , but this is not possible without the shoulder pads winding up on your shoulder blades . Also , unless you are essentially standing still and upright , the shoulder straps will slide and fall off with any kind of lean . The rig would benefit greatly from a horizontal strap across the chest , keeping the shoulders straps in place.So , even with the shoulder straps too long , the pads do not stay in place . I was constantly having to pull them back up onto my shoulders after any kind of movement . Strike two.After only one day of use , the material around the belt holes I 've been using is already fraying significantly.The tape measure holder : very hard to get the tape measure IN , yet the tape falls off coming down a step ladder , bending over , etc ... Strike three ! Now , there are a few things I actually like about the rig:1 ) Deep pockets . My speed square does not fall out . Quality of the actual pockets seems nice.2 ) Dual hammer loops . Well , I 'll rephrase that to say I prefer to wear my hammer on the side and NOT in the back , so it 's nice to have the option here . Although the one in back is NOT removable , and chafes my lower back in an annoying way.3 ) A spot on the shoulder strap to clip my utility knife onto.I do n't see how I can continue using this product . I 'm not sure I can return it at this point so I 'll probably give it away and keep looking for something .	-1
DO N'T BUY THIS GUN UNLESS ALL YOU USE IT FOR IS PUTTING DOWN SUBFLOORING . REALLY AWFUL ON VERTICAL WALLS , ECT .	-1
Clamps are great . Small issues with a few but nothing unexpected . That is until you realize that the standard shipping alone is more than the product cost . $ 7.70 to standard ship a $ 6.99 product ? This bear bites ! ! READ THE FINE PRINT FIRST ... ..	-1
Grizzly seems to be a good buy , and sometimes it is . But not always . When they sent me the wrong part , I had to pay shipping both ways and a re-stocking charge . I bought a set of supposedly precision screwdrivers . The tips were not even machined . To return them , I had to pay shipping both ways and a re-stocking charge . My advice is to shop for deals on name brand tools . The only time I buy from Grizzly is when I can not obtain the item anywhere else .	-1
I 've had this nailer about 2 years . I 've used it regularly but not heavily . Just home shop type use . It worked OK , though with too many dry fires , until last month when it quit working altogether . I 've taken it apart trying to figure out what the problem is . I think it 's in the trigger/valve mechanism - not much I can do there . $ 39 is n't bad for a couple of years use I guess but if I 'm going to spend it every couple of years I might as well spend a little more up front and get a better quality product . I 'm shopping for something else now .	-1
I 've been installing blue stain T & G ; in a family room and decided to try this gun . It started jamming after about half a dozen boards and the air hose connection threads leak.Maybe it will operate better with Grizzly brads , which I did n't use , but I switched back to my PC and finished the job.This gun is n't worth sending back for a refund , because I do n't want someone else to get stuck with it !	-1
I used this drill bit set a couple of times and really do n't like them at all . The bits grab into the wood way too fast making a very rugged hole . I used them today drilling holes in treated , outdoor lumber and the bits would grab , get stuck , forcing me to constantly reverse the drill and back out . Even with soft pressure , they want to force themselves into the wood way too fast jerking the drill out of your hand . The holes were all chewed up and ragged , just awful ! I ca n't imagine using these bits in metal ! ! !	-1
They are high quality , idiot proof to use and will drill steel nicely , but they ca n't be re-sharpened ( well mabye ... ) . I 've tried by hand but there are to many angles and surfaces to deal with to get them right in a timely manner . Sharpening a regular drill bit is hard enough . If they would make a bit sharpener that would sharpen these ( and not cost way more then a drill doc ) I would continue to use them all the time and not have to buy new ones . Now I only use them when I 'm drilling something vary rounded or when I ca n't find a small bit to make a pilot hole ... not worth the money if buying for a long term use in hard material .	-1
After drilling the pilot , the main part of the drill grabs the work piece . With a portable drill , the drill is wrenched out of your hand . With a drill press , the work piece had better be clamped down .	-1
Original Post 2/05I would never buy this product again , at any price ; Waist of Money ! It might remove some surface rust and provided some lubrication BUT do n't expect to do any more then that . I tried it on a table saw with cast iron top , framing square and handsaw . None of the items looks any better after using the TopSafer , still RUSTY . I have to say I only used the 1.5oz bottle that came with `` Empire Manufacturing TOOL-12D The Complete ToolSaver System '' kit ; but I truly feel that it would not matter if I had used a gallon of this stuff.FYI , I also used the BaldeSaver and was n't impressed.UPDATE , 10/25/06It seemed to work as a rust inhibiter . The table saw top has n't gotten any worse since I tried to remove the rust from it with this product.I would rate it for rust removal 1 star rust inhibitor 4 stars	-1
I read all the reviews here before I bought this product . It is also very highly spoken of on the Woodworking forums . I bought a brand new Unisaw and set it up in my garage shop . Within one week the top started showing some light rust . I pulled out the TopSaver ( TM ) to come to the rescue . It worked great at removing the rust ... a bit of elbow grease required but it did come off . I followed the instructions to a `` T '' . Now for the interesting part . I applied it while it was cold out . About 1-2 days later it warmed up and some precipitation formed on the cast iron tables . By day three the top was completely re-rusted - I would say worse than it was before the Topsaver was even applied . THREE DAYS ! That 's it . Wy wife came home through the garage and said to me - and I quote `` You should have used that stuff you bought to keep the saw from rusting , it looks terrible . '' Three days.Now granted , I live in Southern Vermont , in a valley , and it can get very humid here . Also the saw is in my garage and not a climate controlled workshop . So this is worst-case-scenario conditions for testing this product . But under those conditions I can tell you with 100 % certainty - it just does n't work . Maybe the positive reviews are coming in from people who are using it in climate-controlled , dehumidified indoor workshops and probably do n't even need it in the first place . I ca n't say . I can say that I might use it to remove the rust and then cover with a wax or synthetic auto sealant.PS - If you are going to use this product to remove rust , I would recommend applying with a random orbital sander . Just attach a Scotch Brite pad to a hook-and-loop backing plate . This will save you tons of time over applying by hand . I would also remove as much rust as possible with steel wool first to save on costly Topsaver - otherwise you will be reapplying multiple times needlessly .	-1
Chuck was frozen shut , overheated with first normal use , too hot to hold , scary as in electrical or fire , the bearings whined very loudly when turned on for the first time . Got it because of the 3lb weight , have Makita lithium and Dewalt corded . Will Never even consider a Hitachi product again . Darn , but the features & # 34 ; WERE & # 34 ; nice . Stay away for your own good . USAF Electronics Nam , Tech Instructor 35 years .	-1
I am having the same problem that others reported . The chuck will not keep the bit centered because the teeth are crumbling . Of all the things to go wrong with a drill I guess I am amazed that is the problem . HItachi really should be providing warranty support to fix this problem . Once again major companies get away with ridiculous customer service and there is no recourse for consumers .	-1
I wanted to get a corded drill because the battery was always dead on the cordless when I went to use it . This drill was heavy and noisy . I have to return it !	-1
This is a pretty complete set of taps and dies , metric , sae , regular and fine thread , and very well made . I had a seperate metric and sae set , which each piece snapped into place in the case . This case needs gravity to hold the pieces in place , aided by a chunk of foam over the top of the whole deal , which I 'm certain will be lost one windy day.Very good taps and dies , very crappy case .	-1
First thing to go was the case , and then the bits They do not stay Sharpe long and I 'm talking about just using them in pine boards .	-1
I picked these up at the local HW store based on owning a few older made in the USA spades from Irwin that 'were okay ' but nothing special without checking to see where they were made . They are the worst quality steel I have ever seen in my life even for made in Chinacom inc they are worst . They could not cut soft pine , over heated very easily , even when kept cool with water and simply refused to cut or worse bound up and nearly took my arm off . So these are dangerous spade bits . I went out and purchased some high quality made in the usa auger/spade bits , finished the job 4x faster and did not even need to cool the bits off through soft pine which how things used to work in the USA . I would not wish Irwin spade bits off on my worst enemy . Their standard drill bits are no better . I have had excellent luck with Montana Brand ( made in the USA ) and Snappy Drill bits ( made in the USA ) which you can get from Amazon and the Champion made in the USA , spade , auger and drill bits . If I could give these a negative star for nearly causing a severe muscle pull I would . These are not prograde but 'hospital ' grade spade bits . You bet I did . Maybe if you hand turned them slow enough they might cut soft pine , I do n't know I did not try an old fashioned hand drill that I got from grandpa back before they had power tools . You will regret these bits especially if you nearly cause a $ 2000- $ 10000 muscle repair for a torn arm ligament and have to sue Irwin for your injury or your self or uninsured or have to work for a living with your hands . These are not even good bits for a one off job to throw away as you might never get through it , like I gave up after 3 crummy 1 in holes . I can only imagine what the largest sizes cut like . There is a reason China has 5.4 Trillion in USA dollars cumulative trade balance with the USA . That ca n't go on much like the Irwin Spade Bits . Check Montana Brands , Snappy and Champion made in the USA out if you want to get through your job without ripping your arm off or causing a fire in your pine wood . Ha , ha they might make a good fire starter . I should make a youtube video of 'Irwin Spade Bits ' use to start a fire quickly in softwood . And yes , I have a high quality electric drill with an electric clutch . No speed works with these these spade bits . Truly it was amazing experience . When I see 'Irwin ' now I cringe , years ago when they were made in the USA they were good enough for one off big jobs , not any more .	-1
... .as in way , way too big . It does work , and that 's about it . Returned it and bought the Woods 13568 Indoor Remote Control which is smaller .	-1
I did not purchase this product through Amazon . But I bought the exact same device ( Super Switch Brand with three outlets and one remote control with three switches ) from a Harbor Freight Tool Store . I experienced the same problem described by others in the reviews involving short range which kept getting shorter and eventually did n't work at all after about a week . I purchased a skylink wireless remoteSkylink WS-100/WS-100N Wireless Remote Control , Channel A ( Single switch and outlet ) using Amazon and it has been working perfectly for over a year now .	-1
This pulley removal tool fits very sloppy on the harmonic balancer . It is so sloppy in fact , I had to hold it in place until I put some tension on it to stop it from falling out . it was able to get the job done , but someone did n't measure properly for this tool when it was mass produced .	-1
I have not yet used this to replace timing belt on my 2004 Honda 3.2TL . In the image , the tool looks like it 's made of some resin but it is heavy steel . The hole inside is large enough to allow heavier-duty impact gun socket ( 19mm for the TL ) . I checked the Honda SST and it looked almost identical . I will update when I 'm done with the job.When it comes to tools , I want made in USA/Japan but this tool is made in Taiwan so I removed one star.P.S ; after having used this , I have noticed that this does not fit snugly on 2004 TL ; there is a slight play and it marred the corners of the crank pulley . The actual size seems to be 55mm . Genuine Honda tool comes with an adapter & a LONG bar ( longer than my Snap-on 3 ' beater bar ) .	-1
Product was probably defective but was awkward and dangerous . The movement of the blade was faulty .	-1
Saw arrived with stripped screw holes where saw attaches to base . Saw is held to base with 4 screws that thread into plastic ONLY . Returned .	-1
The rip fence is absolutely useless , your only chance to get a good cut is to use a square and manually hold the square or clamp it down while you push the tile throughthe motor mount is not a clean 90 degree angle as well , the weight of the motor bends the frame and the tile blade is not perpendicular to what it is cutting and bogs down because of too much friction and a lack of motor powerI was so frustrated with this saw that the same day I drove to Lowes and bought a real tile saw for $ 300+The only reason I am giving the tile saw more than 1 star is because it is a fair price for what you get , for the small tile saws under $ 150 it is typical , my advice is to avoid all these low end saws where you have to use your hand to push the tile and get a tile saw with a tray or a moving bridge , if you must get a cheap tile saw get one where the blade is under mount like a table saw	-1
Unfortunately , I purchased this item and did n't use it within the 30 day return window , ... ... .my fault . The first time I tried to use the # 6 unit , the barrel did not bottom out and stop , but went up into the body of the unit and stuck there . I had to open the item and pry the barrel out . It appears the tolerance of the flare for the centering barrel is not all that great . I have now purchased VIX self centering bits and hope they are built with more precision . My lesson is to now open and use items I purchase before the 30 day return window closes .	-1
Not impressed by the materials or workmanship of this countersinking set . The drill bits they use are made of soft steel and bend very easily . And the counter sinks were not sharp and left burrs around the hole from the get-go .	-1
These drill bits may be of good quality , I never got a chance to find out . The drill bits arrived just in time . I broke a bolt changing mower blades . The screw extractor required a 7/16 & # 34 ; drill bit , and I had broke my old 7/16 & # 34 ; bit . I ran and grabbed this new drill bit set , along with my new Bosch corless drill ( ordered and delivered the same time ) . To my supprise , the 7/16 & # 34 ; bit was skipped in this set . I do not remember what I paid for this set ( $ 30.00- $ 40.00 ) . After just buying this drill bit set , I had to drive to a local store to buy a 7/16 & # 34 ; cobalt bit . There is not even a place in the case to hold the 7/16 & # 34 ; bit I just bought , so , to me , this make the case worthless also . I am not going to buy a separate little tool box to carry a 7/16 & # 34 ; bit ( or any other main size bits that may be missing from this set when needed ) . I do not expect all of the 64ths in an 18 piece set , but to skip the 7/16 & # 34 ; is crazy . To save money , this set has ( 2 ) 1/16 & # 34 ; , ( 2 ) 5/64 & # 34 ; , ( 2 ) 3/32 & # 34 ; and ( 2 ) 1/8 & # 34 ; . There may be someone who might need a drill bit that small , but the 7/16 & # 34 ; is a main size . I know 1/8 & # 34 ; is useful , but you can go to any hardware and buy a whole pack for nex to nothing . There is no reason to have more that one of these little bits in the set . I know the 7/16 & # 34 ; is a larger and a more expensive drill bit , but to screw up the set for a couple dollars is ridiculous . I would gladly pay a couple dollars more for a usable set . Now what do I do with this set ; even the case is wothless to me . I guess I will either buy another case that will hold this set with the 7/16 & # 34 ; or buy another set , and I could use this set to replace worn or broken bits on a another more usable set of drill bits .	-1
not very strong bit , the 1/4 inch has already become rusted but for boring not manageable but not the best bits especially that it has the Bosch name on it could do better	-1
I bought this masonry drill set because it was the recommended Amazon bundle with the Bosch PS130-2A electric drill that I purchased simultaneously . However the drill bits are very long and wiggle around creating much bigger holes than needed . Also they have special indentations ( SCS system ? ) which does n't fit the electric drill chuck . Get shorter drill bits with either non indented ends ( best ) or else 3 or 6 sides so that they match the 3 protrusions inside the electric drill 's chuck .	-1
States & # 34 ; three Flats Shanks & # 34 ; does say ONLY A FEW ARE THE MAJORITY are round , not you know why they were on sale ...	-1
I have not yet used this product but was extremely dissappointed to see that it was made in China . It will forever taint my opinion of this product and Bosch . Unfortunately there is no way to know before buying it . It would have definately influenced my decision . Everytime we purchase something made offshore we are endorsing the manufacturers decision to not invest in America . We as purchasers need to begin demanding the place of manufacture to be prominently displayed in all advertising .	-1
Bits break with the first use , even in soft woods , And , no ... the drill was not held improperly or twisted , plumb and level ... and I am not speaking of the smaller diameters . These bits are , basically worthlessand should be sold , solely , at Harbor Freight.I take that back , even their Chinese junk is not as bad as this Chinese junk.I have long been a Bosch fan , I have their 12 inch slider , several of their drills/impacts , jobsite radio , cordless oscillating tool , Colt palm router and many of their 12v subcompact stuff . Perhaps , they 're not Festool quality , but they 're OK.These bits ? Described above ( worthless ) and a huge waste of your money .	-1
Tryed to drill out a broken GM starter bolt in an engine block and these drill bits were destroyed . The bolt had less material missing than the bit ... good for aluminum or wood .	-1
I bought these gloves to ride my motorcycle in the the rain . Within 30 minutes of riding in a heavy rain , my hands were wet and cold .	-1
I have n't used these yet so I ca n't attest to their waterproofness or longevity . But I can say the inside liner is very annoying . It 's one of those pairs of gloves where the liner is not attached to the glove except at the rear where you put your hand in , so it slides all around inside and gets twisted in the fingers . My pair also felt like the inside liner did n't match up in size to the glove , which was not cool . I would n't buy them again .	-1
The offsets are not nice whole or rounded fraction , sort of like that tape measure that says to add 2 7/8 to the measure . Could be better.No directions , only a template showing all the strange offsets	-1
I bought two of these . One for my Trek 5000 carbon racer which is really light . The rack holds it well.The second is for my sons older Raleigh clunker . It 's heavier but not super heavy . It rips the rack out of the wall . I have both mounted into cinder block using number 1/4 & # 34 ; plastic anchors and a number 14 screw . The leverage on the small securing plate is extreme . Why did n't Racor make the plate longer ? or use 3 screws ? or have a supporting bracket at 45 degrees from the rack to the wall ? The pressure on the top screw is immense . I will try a lead anchor to see if that will hold.So if you are going to screw this into wood , make sure you have a very secure anchoring spot and a light bicycle , or get a different bike rack that distributes the weight better .	-1
I have three of these racks in addition to several others from different makers . While I do use these , I only put one bike each on them and they 're just not ideal for my purposes.First , I find that the `` hump '' in the holder , where you would typically put the first bike , is too far from the wall . All my bikes are drop-bar road bikes and if I put the bike here the wheel turns about 45 degrees from the wall and causes the wheel to stick out . I 've personally addressed this by putting some padding over the `` shelf '' area of the rack and sliding my bike all the way in against the wall.As far as putting two bikes ... with the first bike mounted all the way in as I 've described above , I could mount two bikes . With the first bike mounted where it 's `` supposed '' to go I can not . First is the turned front wheel issue . Second , is the fact the bikes are too close together and end up touching.In summary , the rack is n't ideal for holding one or two bikes . I will concede that most racks of this kind are n't really suitable for holding two bikes without crowding , but the distance from the wall problem is worse than the other brands I own .	-1
I returned this rack . Its design is questionable for the long-run . The materials are pretty light and its attachment point way too small to resist the continuing torque or twisting motion that comes with loading and off-loading a 29 # or heavier bike . It 's price is attractive , but over time it will likely disappoint . I substituted this rack : Feedback Sports Velo Wall Rack ( Black ) and have been very pleased with it . I reviewed that rack on 9 June 2012 .	-1
I bought both Rigid and bosch at same time and could not compare apples to oranges . Rigid is Way better and made in Germany compared to Bosch ( not sure but it seems it is made in China ) .Rigid is a high end sander at low price and I felt I paid too much for bosch..Try Rigid 6 '' and you will be lot happy for flattening joint boards , panels and lot more..	-1
read all the wonderful review on amazon about this ladder so thought i 'd buy it - have to say yes it 's a good built ladder and it 's VERY heavy , which is my biggest bug bear just for little things around the house , outside i 'm sure it 's good but it 's a mammoth to lug around i have to say .	-1
This is all I can really say here about this ladder . It is not a bad value if your looking to save some money and not use it regularly . This is my second one of this type of ladder , first was the Gorilla Ladder from Home Depot , which was much better quality than this one , but heavy . The Werner is simply a homeowner grade ladder in my opinion , and does not even come close to the quality of the Little-Giant . Which is ok , you just have to understand that at this price point , you are not getting an incredibly sturdy , easily functional piece of equipment , like it 's competitor the Little Giant.I personally do n't think this is an area where one should try and save $ $ , since it is literally your safety you have to take into consideration . And ladder accidents are quite common.Things I did not like about the Werner ladder : -Overall build quality is not that great , feels a little chincy , loose , and steps are riveted with no plastic protection over them . Which could lead to getting something snagged on it.-Locks that go into each of the rungs do not slip in easily on their own like other ladders , one really has to jerk the ladder to get them in , or do it one-by-one . All of which can lead to finger crushing.-No Wheels ( ca n't even buy as an accessory ) -No Platform-Felt unstable at the maximum STEP ladder height , which made me feel really uncomfortable-8 Pounds heavier than Little GiantThings I like about the Werner : Easy to usespace savingOverall you just have to keep the simple fact in mind that this ladder is half the price of the Little Giant , and with that price difference you are inevitably sacrificing some quality and ultimately safety-your own . You are also giving up some very nice ( back-saving ) conveniences.I am not saying this ladder is not worth purchasing , for some it may be a great buy . But if you have done your homework , know thing or two about these ladders , then you should adjust your expectations when looking at this products because it NOT as good as it 's competitors .	-1
This is a mighty poor extension ladder . Much better off buying a much lighter much more useful step ladder + extension ladder.I found that without another person it was very difficult to get the ladder fully extended and where it had to be . If you 're working alone , you need to brace the foot of the ladder on something and TRY to walk it up . That takes a lot of space . Then you have to move it to where you actually need it -- fully extended and straight up ! VERY HARD TO DO . Mine stays in my basement . I have borrowed a stepladder and an extension ladder . This thing weighs about 3x what a stepladder weighs and probably about 2x the weight of an extension ladder . So it 's always a pain to use even when it is possible to use it . If you only have room for a single ladder and you have someone to help you use this - and you do n't need a ladder to often , MAYBE you could consider this.There 's an infomercial for a competing multi-ladder that `` demonstrates '' a small woman bringing the fully extended ladder to vertical . They hide the fact that another person is bracing the base of the ladder with his foot behind the `` CALL NOW '' banner . You can see it for half a second when they take the banner away.Unless you 're 7 ' tall ( and are pretty strong ) this is just a VERY HEAVY stepladder .	-1
My order arrived today and the ladder itself appears to be well made.My only disappointment was the adjustment knob ( blue knob ) was broken on arrival.The ladder was either dropped or damaged on the truck.I was shocked to find out the inside of the blue rubber covered adjustment knob was made of PLASTIC ! Does n't make sense to me.This well made ( heavy ) ladder and Werner used plastic for the most important part of its assembly.To top it all off I could not even find a replacement knob for this ladder.Looks like I am going for a refund .	-1
Used one of these ladders , love Werner products but not sure about this one .Extended the ladder , did n't give you a feeling of security . Then when I lowered it must be the pins were n't all the way in , it fell down on my fingers breaking 2 of them . Been a very painful experience , will never use again .	-1
Save your $ $ $ $ $ and but the 3 bay Lith Ion charger instead ! ! It does a better job on the NiCads and servers the dual purpose for NiCads and Lith IOns , which are way better than the ni cads .	-1
I ca n't actually say I 've used these ... which is sort of why the rating is low . They are n't particularly & # 34 ; substantial & # 34 ; in nature . You have to use a tiny screwdriver to open the compartment for the batteries , and the point of the wedge is pretty & # 34 ; fat & # 34 ; ; it 's only going to fit under a door where there 's enough of a gap . That being said , the bottom of it has sort of a nonskid pad on it , so when a door is forced , the stop will slip back only a bit before it & # 34 ; locks & # 34 ; in place . However , it is the & # 34 ; fatness & # 34 ; of the point of the wedge that makes these unusable for me . I suppose if I had given that some more thought ( ie , that the cracks under my doors are n't substantial ) I would have reconsidered . I 'd also prefer not to have to install batteries with a screwdriver . I 'm sure if you do n't mind the screwdriver part and the openings under your doors are fat enough , these will work fine ( they 're GE ) .	-1
Was n't able to use the 4-5 units I bought . My doors at home does n't have much space below for this device to fit.The sound is loud though and the product finish is nice . Too bad I ca n't use it .	-1
When this works , it 's great . The alarm is very loud and would startle anyone . The trouble is , it does n't always trigger the same way . One time the alarm sounds with little pressure . The next time it has to be pressed to the max to sound the alarm . Considering why one would purchase one of these door stops , the inconsistency makes this fairly useless . I do not recommend .	-1
If you press it , will sound . Ok , but , in order to do that , it have to stay firmly in place and it does not . The door most of the times will push it away . Also , it sounds only while pressed and stop right after the pressure stops . Which does n't makes sense . It should keep sounding till you reset it	-1
These are a cool idea . However , there are 2 flaws in the design . One , the ramp device does not meet the floor flush . There is basically a gap . My front door is very close to the floor so it would hit this unit too low and would n't press the ramp down ( which is what initiates the alarm ) . Also , the device has rubber on the bottom to hold it in place via friction but it is n't grippy enough for my hardwoods so after the doors makes contact with the ramp too low , the unit just gets pushed back out of the way for a total fail . I think it would work great if you had a door with sufficient clearance so that it hits the unit high enough to depress the ramp AND if you have carpet so that the rubber can grip better . I have neither so this did not work for me .	-1
this would be perfect except the metal top part comes off when installing the battery and can be a pain to put back on ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! has on off switchits loudgrips the floor	-1
If used as directed , this emits a very loud distinct squealing alarm that will definitely alert or awaken you if the door is opened upon it . However , I very much doubt the plastic that it 's made of would keep a determined intruder from being able to force the door open . I think I 'd ultimately prefer the latter , but I think you could make this device of materials that would create both an alarm and an insurmountable obstacle at the same time . The only reason I have n't returned it is because the time it would take me is n't worth the cost of the device .	-1
This stopper will only work on a door with no gap between the bottom of the door and a bare floor . I have two outside doors , each with weatherstripping and sills which close this gap . Why would I want cold air , bugs and dust coming in from under my doors ? I do n't and therefore there is no gap and no room for this jammer to fit . And , I do n't remember being in a hotel room that does n't have a pretty solid latch , which I think would do a better job of keeping out intruders when I 'm in the room ( obviously , it ca n't be put in place when you leave the room ) . So , if you have a house with gaps under your doors , this might work -- except on the door you use to leave the house .	-1
Just got this product today , it came as `` Nail-On EPDM Rubber '' which is more like a foam.I was expecting to get the hard nail-on rubber stuff , which this is not the case . Frost King must no longer make it since at one time this product was a hard rubber . The foam-like material they use now rips easily which makes it difficult to use for any long-term purposes .	-1
very small and limited in what they will be able to hold . I was under the impression they were larger and able to hold power tools.They are more likely to hold wrenches and drill bits . I would recommend the larger Dewalt bag which I also got . That bag can hold tools and accessories .	-1
Probably a good set but received the order with the 2 smallest sizes missing from set . Amazon is supposed to be sending me a new set , with my delivery scheduled in 4 business days . Funny thing is that it was a Prime item and I did get in in the 2 days . Why it is taking 4 days to get the replacement is beyond me especially when it is in stock in the Amazon warehouse.I would n't be a big deal if I did n't have an immediate use for the set and have been waiting for it .	-1
They looks better than their actual uses . I tried to use them to unscrew the hex screws from my pistol grip , and the hex screw did n't even budge at all , but the metals on the L-Wrench were wearing off ! ! ! This is bad , I thought this is strong steel , obviously it was not hard enough . I wish they have tungsten made L-wrench available in the market .	-1
Did n't work right out of the box . You think Timex would have a quality product but not so it seems .	-1
Did not work out of the box . I tried it on several outlets and it would n't turn on . It was cheap , so I did n't bother to return it . I think I just got a faulty unit.Go by other folks reviews if you decide to buy this .	-1
I 'm adding this paragraph to my review after owning the timer for about 9 months . It broke . It no work any more.Yes , I 'm using it correctly -- I have a PhD in experimental physics . So , my original five-star rating is now a two-star , because a device like this should last more than 9 months.There are two circumstances that can make you think the device is broken . ( 1 ) Inadvertantly getting into `` manual off '' mode . If you get into this mode and do n't realize it , you will think the device is broken . Read the directions and set it to `` program '' mode . ( 2 ) Blowing the fuse by plugging a big appliance into the device . To check for a blown fuse , read the directions and try `` manual on '' .The device has 5 buttons . You use the buttons in pairs . Every possible pair ( there are 10 ) has an action -- fumbling with the buttons will cause unexpected results . In addition to being cautious , you should be able to read all features of the display.It 's a good little device , but it wo n't handle big current loads ( like big air conditioners ) . The max is 600 watts ( 5 amps ) .It 's not for applications like cooking , because your hot plate will come on every 24 hours . To control your slow cooker or hot plate , get a count-down timer.UPDATE : 8 and 1/2 months later it 's still working like a champ . This is ( by far ) the best electric timer I 've ever had . I use to to turn on the light 2-3 minutes before the alarm clock goes off .	-1
I bought five of these units about six months ago and used each as a timer to prevent my cordless phones from overcharging . I have five Panasonic cordless phones stationed throughout the house and they really only need to charge about 3 hours per day , rather than 24 hours per day.Six months later , not one -- not one -- of them is still working . They all died within a few months of use.This is junk . Do n't buy it.Instead , I recommend that you consider one of the Leviton Plug-in Timers , which do have batteries that allow you to program the unit without having to sit next to an outlet and which retains the time even when you unplug it . Those units also retain the timers you set ( but not the current time ) even when the internal batteries are dead .	-1
I purchased two of these at the same time 4 years ago . The irony is one of them stopped working after 1-2 years ( as the other negative reviews state ) but the other one is still working to this day.This timer uses an internal battery ( which is why it keeps the time and your settings when you unplug it ) .It likely stops working because the internal battery has died . You can probably open the screws on the back and buy a replacement battery at Radio Shack or the Wal-Mart.OVERALL RECOMMENDATION : On the whole , I would recommend this timer simply because of its ease of use . The price is reasonable for 1-2 years or 4+ years of service . I have tried other brands and they are too complicated to use ( change the time ) on a daily bases . I really like the simplicity of this timer . It 's as easy as setting an alarm clock .	-1
The Timex electronic timer is a convenient gadget for controlling lights and appliances . With basic functions such as current time and a single event timer , the Timex electronic timer can easily control one or more electrical devices.Unfortunately , this particular timer is lacking in a few areas , which would otherwise make it simpler and more powerful . For example , it would be helpful to have a set of colored LEDs indicating the timer 's event status and override status . Being a wall timer , which effectively locates the user interface very close to an electrical outlet , it can be difficult to reach . `` Table '' electronic timers are much easier to place as the interface is located several feet from the IN ( power ) and OUT ( control ) receptacles via an electrical cord with one extra conductor.With the recent focus in energy conservation , consumers are often using electronic timers to reduce their electrical usage . In my case , I use my timer as a third alarm clock . Connected to a very powerful full-spectrum light box ( Sunray by Sunbox ) , it is set to fill up my bedroom with light , five minutes before my alarm clock ( s ) are set to go off . Additionally , it engages a powerful speaker system connected to a digital audio source . In this arrangement , the timer serves as a multi-sensory wakeup tool.While the design appears solid and robust , I have not been happy with its longevity . About a year after purchasing the timer , it stopped working . There is no physical damage . Moreover , opening the unit revealed no fuse nor obviously damaged components . This is n't a problem , however , as I have decided to upgrade to a table electronic timer for easier access.ProsSimpleCompactSleek designConsAmbiguous status ( especially from more than 18 inches away ) Only One EventLack of DurabilityPossibly InaccessibleLack of clear status indication	-1
In random orbit mode it barely removes material.My $ 60 ro works much faster and is much lighter and less bulky.It has a very small stroke , the motor is powerful but it does not matter because with such a small stroke it 's not able to use the power.In fast removal mode it removes material fast but it wants to twist itself off what your sanding.You have to use a gorilla grip to hold it flat.After 5 minutes your hands will hurt really bad.I think what makes the problem worse is that the tool is very tall and you do n't have leverage to hold it . Do n't waste $ 270 on this tool.I bought a flex L 3406 VRG lower rpm angle grinder with variable speed and use a flat sanding disk.This is for very rough work only.I love this tool works great.standard grinders wo n't work because they spin to fast and the disks burn up .	-1
I am not sure how genuine the reviews posted here are but here are my thoughts on this sander.I bought this 1 week ago and was disappointed with the Build quality of this 'Bosch ' tool . I already own Home Depot Ridgid sander.I did purchase vaccume adapter but this machine is not worth of spending $ 250 . Vaccume adapter keeps on falling and finish quality is OK but not great at both modes . Build Quality of this sander seems 'cheap ' to me and not sure where this $ 250 price comes from.I am not sure if this machine will last 1 year of usage and if you check the Ridgid or festool , you can feel that they are 'Built Tough'.I will returning this today and will buy Ridgid 6 Sander which is one of the best tool I ever purchased.If you really want a Great RO sander at great price , I would sure avoid this one and would rather buy 'Festool ' for some more bucks or buy Ridgid Sander from Home Depot.Both Ridgid and Festool have worked flawlessly so far and comes with longer 3 year warranty .	-1
Two starts for this because it will certainly support 400lb , but the aluminum lock-by-lowering mechanism for the swivel wheels does n't appear strong enough to lift the machine without breaking . The force on these parts is significant . I found myself lifting my machine to help it up . They protrude out from the base by a couple inches which causes them to get in the way while moving it around my other machines , all of which are on JET mobile bases . I think it 's probably a good idea to spend the extra and get the JET bases if your machines are over 250lb . This HTC base is probably a good deal for light stuff .	-1
I 'm giving this a low rating and I wo n't buy Weller again.The problem is the tiny , vulnerable power cord.It makes this a throw away tool .	-1
- Cheaply made , drawers do n't fit , too loose.- Broken stopper tabs on drawers , mine arrived with broken parts and drawers can just fall out.+ Stores things okOverall , WAY too expensive for what you get ! The fit and finish are crap , this should cost $ 10 at most .	-1
The face of this product that is red is rippled in certain spots and not smooth . I have two of these and both of them arrived with broken clips that keep the clear drawers from sliding all the way out . Very disappointed .	-1
Mine arrived with two of the small plastic drawer stop tabs broken off - these tabs keep the drawers from being pushed too far into the cabinet when closed . The drawers work ... but they do not stop correctly - this allows them to be misaligned and to push too far into the cabinet . I used small screws and epoxy to fix the problem - I could have returned the item for a replacement but the next one would have been just as poorly made .	-1
I ca n't believe how poorly this thing is designed and built . I have a workshop full of small parts bins from various sources and this is by far the worst . The rails and back are very flimsy which makes the whole unit torgue and sag when full of parts . The drawers only accommodate 1 divider so small parts drawers waste a lot of space . Every other bin I own has 2 per drawer . The large drawers have front-to-back dividers which is nice ( the only positive comment I can make about this thing ) . The final insult ... only a handful of dividers come with it . You have to buy the rest at a ridiculous price . I gave it 1 star because it will hold parts . I guess that 's worth something . I suggest you take a pass on this item . Just about anything you buy will be better than this .	-1
This is a cheap dado set . The blades are not all the same diameter and it is extremely difficult to set up . Let me explain the set-up problem first . The set comes with two outside blades which the documentation says are 1/8 inch each , then four 1/8 inch chippers , and two smaller chippers ( a 3/32 and a 1/16 ) . The problem is that the blades do not add up to the sizes indicated . That is , the 1/8 chippers and the outside blades may have carbide cutters 1/8 inch wide , but the disk supporting the carbide is not 1/8 inch thick . So if you put the two outside blades and one 1/8 chipper on your saw , you do not get a 3/8 inch wide cut - you get something less . To get a 3/8 inch cut ( or any size ) you have to play with the blades and the spacers until you hit on a 3/8 inch wide combination . If you use a dado set VERY rarely and just want cheap , this set may work for you . But if you want to set up quickly and get your work done , pass on this set and get a better known set.At a minimum , Avenger could have included documentation on what combination of chippers and spacers to use for different width cuts , but no , they do n't do that.Regarding the difference in diameter of the blades , on my set the 1/16 inch chipper is larger than the rest of the chippers/blades so when I use it , I get a groove in the bottom of my dado . To be fair , all the other blades/chippers are the same size so if I build up a dado size without the 1/16 inch chipper I get a good flat bottom dado.The only way I could recommend this product to you is if you ca n't afford anything better . But overall , I think you 'd be better off to save your money and pick up a name brand on sale . I returned this set and bought the Freud 6 inch dado set - and have been very satisfied with it.ASIDE COMMENT : Based on my experience with this dado set I 'm just astounded that previous reviewers could give this dado set five stars . One reviewer who gave this set five stars even commented on the problem of setting up the blades . How on earth can you give five stars to such a kluge ? I 'm starting to think that manufacturers get some shills to write early reviews to make their products appear better than they are.Follow-up 2/15/05 - I contacted Avenger by e-mail to complain about their dado set . I received a response from a marketing person who claimed that Avenger had received a batch of dado sets with undersize ( I assume he meant under thickness ) blades and that they would have replaced my set if I had n't returned it to the store where I bought it . Being the skeptical type , I invited him to post a `` review '' here on Amazon ( in response to my review ) with that information and offering anyone who received a `` defective '' set to return it for replacement . As of 2/15/05 , no one from Avenger has left any postings here . Until you see such a posting here , I would assume that all Avenger dado sets are `` defective '' .	-1
I did n't have what I would consider a serious problem with blade thickness since the shims made it possible to get the widths I needed . But the cut quality was not nearly what I find acceptable . There was noticeable chipping of the veneer of plywood and horrible tearout at the back of the cut . I know I could use a backer board to reduce the tearout but not worth it since it is chipping anyway . Spend a little more and get a high quality set from a name brand maker .	-1
The can was a disaster ! The new `` comfort spray '' did not work well at all , and seemed to drip paint everywhere rather than actually spray . I was covered in paint after trying to use it a couple of times before giving up . Very wasteful , messy , and annoying . Will definitely not be purchasing anything with the `` comfort spray '' grip again .	-1
I have used Krylon as my go to paint for many projects over the years . It always went on easily , laid down nicely to a good finish , covered well , and rarely sagged or ran . in short it was very forgiving for an occasional user like myself . These properties were a result of getting the formula just right for surface tension , viscosity , the perfect ratio of pigment to solvent , and the correct drying time to balance between flashing off too fast so it ca n't flow , to drying too slowly so it wo n't sag or run . Because of this for decades Krylon was my go-to spray can paint choice every time . I would drive to another hardware store in another town to get it over any other brand if I had to . It used to be that good.Well the regulations about paint have changed and virtually all paint manufacturers are scrambling to change thier formulas to comply . Not just spray cans , but all paints from professional automotive finishes to house paints . Like everyone else Krylon has had to change thier formula.But the new Krylon is not so great . It has too little pigment to solvent , which means you have to put down multiple thin coats , or apply a thicker coat to cover . BUT WAIT ! When you lay this new formula paint on thin you get flash-off before it flows ... . which resluts in a rough granular sort of surface , and if you lay it on a little thicker it dries too slowly which then leads to two kinds of problems : One is runs and sags . The other is the top-most surface dries faster than the underlying paint , which causes alligatoring . Once you get alligatoring there is no way to fix it save removing all the paint right back down to the bare workpiece . And of course the only way to fix a run or sag is to let it dry for a good long time , 24 to 48 hours minimum , more if you can afford the time ... and sand it out and recoat.Next ; the new style spray tip and can are very sensitive to can position . Even a brand new full can will sputter if held at an angle as little as say 20-30 degrees from vertical . This will screw up your painting for certain . Somehow the old style cans were better in this regard . Again , just more forgiving of off-vertical shots.Also this new formula can puts a ton of mist into the air . Several minutes after spraying even a very small piece a large cloud of paint mist remains surrounding the piece and everything near it . Mostly I worry about this in terms of it settling back on the new work and ruining the finish . You could set up a fan , but that can cause other problems of its own by stirring up dust etc . The old style Krylon was never a problem in this regard.It claims to dry in 10 minutes . The old stuff really did dry fast . You could over-coat in about 15-30 minutes or so depending on the humidity and temperature . This stuff is at beast tacky in 10 minutes , and still very soft after an hour or more , certainly not ready for another coat or to be touched or handled not even gently ... . and no where near ready for the next coat . Which is an issue because ... . ( looping back ... ) there is not enough pigment to cover , so you need lots of coats . That longer drying time translates in to longer project times , but also into more dust and debris settling into your painted surface before it is hard.Bottom line this paint is persnickity to use . It is NOT AT ALL like the old formula Krylon . The easy and reliable nature of painting with the old Krylon was my main reason for choosing this paint for a couple of recent projects over the past year . At first I thought I had just gotten a bad can ... . not so . Multiple cans exhibit the same faults.Then I thought it was just life with the new formula paints and I had to learn to deal with it and become a better painter ... . but honestly I'v come along way since I first picked up my first can of Krylon back in the 70 's and I have become a decent home-project painter ... and unlike back then I now have a shop with controlled temperature and good light and so on . I still ca n't make this paint do the job . I have a current small project that I have had to take back to bare workpiece TWICE now because of this stuff ... . causing a delay of at least 4 days while I wait for the paint to get hard enough to sand off cleanly . I 'm ready to give up and move on.I 'm on my way out right now to buy another brand.If you are not very experienced with spray paints and you do n't have a lot of time to mess around with a learning curve for a home decor or modeling project , stay away from this paint . Come to think of it , even if you ARE a prety darn good painter , stay away from this product .	-1
Impossible to open this with one hand . It would be a very helpful tool if one-handed operation was designed into it.Then the upper part of this ( fairly new , hardly ever used cuz it 's so hard to open ) key -- the semi-circular part that hooks onto a key ring/keychain , broke -- so I can no longer hang it on my key-ring . Now it rattles around in my pocket with my spare change .	-1
This is a handy tool if you ca n't our are uncomfortable having a knife or multi tool . However this is not the item you want to rely on to get you through a tough spot . More of a hey i do n't have to look for this other tool . I do n't expect it will last more than a few uses , and would not purchase it again .	-1
This is was a good idea but it has a major design flaw . To open it you have to really pull to get the & # 34 ; legs apart & # 34 ; but notice that one of the legs is an extremley sharp semi-serrated knife . Does anyone not see the issue this poses ? If you want to use the can-opener your grabbing the knife blade as a handle ... Seriously ? If you buy this thing please be careful so as to not cut your fingers when you use this thing .	-1
I 'm not too impressed with this keychain multi-tool . I am a bit particular and it may be more useful to someone else ... if they had no other options . I found it works well in opening Amazon boxes but that is about it . I would recommend a Gerber Shard and a decent pocket knife instead .	-1
I got this for one reason ... to open boxes and or cut things as needed . I work 5 days a week in a warehouse and do not like to carry around large knives or multi-tools . I have enough stuff to carry without the weight of a extra tool . I thought this would solve my problem . First off this is longer than any keys you have so it is constantly getting stuck on something . Second the blade is sharp and not well designed so when you go to open BE CAREFUL ! I have almost cut my finger on several occasions . Basically I had to take this off my key chain and dump it .	-1
Bought this thinking that the ability to have it with me 24/7 would make sure I would actually use it.However after a few months I realized the following : Pros : Knife actually is fairly sharpCons:1.Make sure you do n't cut yourself trying to open it ( you need to grip it with your fingernails too ) 2.The edge is a pokey danger in your pocket3.The small flathead `` eyeglass '' screwdriver is too thick for my eyeglasses4.Good luck sawing anything . You have almost no surface area to grip , and risk stabbing or stabbing yourself too.In my opinion , you 're better off doing the job right with a larger tool . At least then your hands wo n't be scrambling for purchase .	-1
Bought this , against my better judgement . I did n't think it looked sturdy or valuable ... Well the reviews made me give it a try . I own it now . It is n't sturdy or easy to use or particularly good at anything.If you 're planning to open a bottle , I think you should be very careful , as the blade will be open while you 're doing it . You 're actually pulling up on the edge to pop a top.The blade is good for very simple tasks ... cutting tape on an amazon package , for example . You wo n't be slicing anything with this tool.The philips head is a # 1 ... which is rare . To turn the screw , you 're stressing the joint , pulling on the blade at the same time ... I 've tried to use the flat head on several occasions ... You ca n't use it with the tool open 180 degrees . Every time I 've needed to use it , the tool open to 90 , the phillips/bottle opener part hits some other part of the thing I 'm taking a screw out of ( door knob , towel bar , anything that needs tightening/loosening when you do n't have regular tools on you ) Finally , I think it 's intended to be kept on a key ring . You may be thinking it sort of looks like it would easily come-off a key ring ... It does . I ca n't believe I have n't lost it . It keeps turning up like a bad penny.I love tools . Big and small . If you do too , you 'll hate this . Nothing worse than a tool that does n't work .	-1
I 'm really wishing that I had read the negative reviews on this purchase prior to buying this item.First , per the photo , I actually thought this item was larger than it really was . At first , I was pleased to learn that it really was n't much longer than a key is . However , like many other negative reviews on this product , I 've found that this is n't all that sturdy nor easy to operate.I work for a catering company as a side job which requires the use of a flat head screwdriver to easily open the gel sterno fuel containers . The flat head on this driver is small and virtually must be operated with the knife open as the hinge is inconveniently located right next to it . Therefor , plan on cutting yourself during use of it.Other than that , the bottle opener was used the first day because a Coworker of mine had a coca cola bottle they needed opened . Again , this tool proved to be virtually useless . I will probably never have use for the knife as I carry a Milwaukee box cutter on me at almost all times . Additionally , I will never have use for the Phillips head bit either.Long story short , this tool did not serve useful for me at all . I would compare it better to a teenager novelty item than a functional multi tool.I have switched back to my old multi tool that the key ring holder broke off of by just spot welding it back on.Do a little bit of research and spend a couple of dollars more before just deciding on this one . You 'll be glad you did .	-1
Here 's the problem : This tool attaches and detaches by prying it open . Needless to say , you do n't want it falling off your key chain ; but , you may actually want to use it someday . When I tried to open it with just my fingers I could n't -- it was way to tight and I did n't want to cut the $ % *+ out of my fingers when and if it finally broke free.I managed to pry it open using a small screwdriver but I do n't normally have that with me . So how am I supposed to get it opened ? Swiss Army SwissCard Translucent Pink ( well mine is blue ) seems to do the job better for me . I can easily get to the knife and have used every other tool at least once . It also passed through numerous TSA screenings without any issue . Either they do n't see it ( unlikely with a full body scan ) or they just do n't see a 1 '' knife as a threat ( more likely ) . ( A pencil is probably a worse threat to air safety . ) This tool , on the other hand , is significantly less useful . Even the bottle opener seems like you 're risking a serious cut to use - particularly after a beer or two.No , I would n't buy this again nor would I recommend it .	-1
The concept of having a 6 in 1 multi tool in the shape of a keyis great ! Unfortunately there is one major deal breaking flaw.In order to use any of the 6 functions of the tool it has to beremoved from the keychain -- which I found infuriating.Essentially , to use any of functionality of this tool you have to:1 : Open it , which immediately detaches it from you keychain.2 . Use 1 of 6 functions.3 . Re-Attach it.Any good multi-tool for a keychain should be deployable in one step.I ca n't recommend this item as key-chain multitool , especially whenthere superior alternatives available . Go for a Leathermansquirt , or Victorinox aloc , etc .	-1
I liked the idea of this tool and wanted to get one for some time , but once I got it and put it on my keychain it did n't meet my expectations . The blade is not sharp ; the bottle opener is useless , the scerdriver is of really limited use.. The only thing the tool did well was poke a hole in my pants pocket .	-1
Yes this will work in dire situations , but you 're better off buying something more stable because this item makes a great gift , but a dinky tool.the blade is literally 2-inches long . half serrated and half straight . For example its not very good at cutting zip ties , i did cut my finger trying to cut a zip tie . This will definitely let you cut soft plastic packaging.Another annoying part is opening the keychain . unless your thumb and finger nails are rock solid , you 'll have a heck of a time opening this knife to use it . When you do open it , the screwdriver becomes the only substantial handle for using the knife.lastly i wanted to point out that it does n't work like scissors . My friend thought it worked as scissors , i had already opened it a few times so i KNEW it was n't like scissors , but to someone reading this that has never used it before , just be aware of that .	-1
I did not like how big my previous keychain was ( Blue Metro Knife and Key Ring Bottle/Soda Opener ) so I decided to get this based on the great reviews.PROS : - Very lightweight , and the key profile means that you wo n't notice it much . It is also easy to go through metal detectors with this because it looks so much like a key . I hate having to take my knife off in the car at airports.- Easy to remove . The top of the two pieces form a clamp that locks when it is closed . So you just open it up , clamp it around your keyring , and it is locked . Very easy to remove , but wo n't fall off . This comes in handy if you are at a metal detector and need to remove it quickly . No hassle of having to thread it through a keyring.- Blade is fairly sharp.- Useful . This is a great item for people who do n't want to deal with a mini-knife on their keyring and want something small.CONS : - Blade is short . Blade is about 3/4 `` , and the rest of the blade is serrated . This makes it more difficult to cut things . Secondly , you have to open up the keyring to cut things since the blade is on the inside ( see picture ) . Not only is this awkward as well , but this means that whenever you have to cut something , by opening up the blade you will unlock the top clamp , and it will come off your keyring . It 's easy to lock back on , but this is not a tool you are ever going to be able to use with one hand to quickly open up a box or cut something.- Design . It took me awhile to notice there are actually three screwdrivers ( 2 flat and one Phillips ) . The two flat heads are at the top of the key . One is so small it is pretty much useless for anything other than eyeglasses . The Phillips head is better , but you have to open up the key to use it . I can see it being very easy to cut yourself while using this to unscrew something . The bottle opener is the same way . Be careful trying to open that 6th or 7th beer because you are likely to slice your thumb off if you are not completely focused on what you are doing . It also takes a little more effort to open a bottle than with something like a Swiss Army knife bottle opener , because you do n't have much to grip onto to get leverage . Not to mention it takes two hands to open up the knife to open a bottle , and then again , the knife will come unlocked from your keychain , meaning you almost need to put your keys in your pocket , hold the bottle with one hand , Util key in the other , open bottle , then take out your keys and re-lock it.Overall , I think this is a pretty good device for the minimalist who likes the idea of having something in an emergency , but I would not recommend this for anyone who plans to use it on a regular basis . You will be much better off with something bigger that is easier to use . Anyone considering this product should take a look at it 's actual design and then picture in your head how you would use it , and you will probably realize where its limitations lie .	-1
I have had this tool on my keychain for about six months . I carry a leatherman and often forget it , so I thought this would be a nice thing to have since I do n't forget my keys.Once I got over the fact that it 's a really neat , aesthetically-pleasing tool , I realized it 's just not that useful , which is really what matters in a tool . The fact that you have to open the blade to use the other tools means that you 're always in danger of cutting yourself when using anything other than the knife . Even when I want to use the knife , it 's prohibitively difficult to open , to the point that I 'll usually opt to go find an actual knife or box cutter rather than use it . The end result of this is that after I tried out all the tools when I first got it , I 've used it a total of maybe five times in the last six months.I 'm rating it two stars instead of one because there 's nothing wrong with the manufacturing . Like I said , it 's neat and aesthetically pleasing . But it 's more of a novelty item than an actual tool.Get this if you think you 'll be in situations where you 're likely to have absolutely no other tools available , or if you get an adrenaline rush from sneaking a blade past TSA . But do n't get it thinking that just because you 'll have it on you at all times that you 're going to use it a lot . It 's just not that useful .	-1
Like other Swiss+Tech tools I have purchased , this is a good idea executed rather poorly . Like the concept but in real life have never used the tool	-1
Swiss Tech really messed up on the Micro/Micro-Max series . The Micro original is super small and pocket sized , however the screw driver features are clumsy and fat , making them limited to very few screws , and not even that great at unscrewing/screwing ( good luck getting a solid lock ! ) . The plier function is also poor- the teeth are glossed over , making the 'bite ' poor and slippery- this is not helped by the device being so small that you ca n't get enough leverage to do whatever you wanted to do.The Micro-Max for a few dollars more does n't address any of the issues above , however it at least comes with a few more features that are n't half bad , and it is n't much larger as well.Swiss Tech has some really innovative designs , but the way they execute them is quite disappointing . I donated my Micro as soon as I found it again while going through my old belongings . Glad it 's gone .	-1
I 've used this glue a number of times over several years . I 've followed directions and it holds a little . A good example is I attached four wooden dowels with screws and Gorilla Glue for a drapery rod . It held as long as no pressure was put on the joints , but after a couple years I took it down for drape cleaning and a joint failed . I 've experienced other failures like this in the past . I 'm getting rid of the remainder .	-1
The problem with this and the Gorilla Wood Glue is that although they perform very well , they do not keep.The container and cap are poorly designed . Once opened , within a month or two , the entire bottle has solidifiedso for an occasional user like myself , it becomes a very expensive product because I get one use out of the bottlebefore it hardens up on me.Ca n't fault the product ... I glued a block of wood on a wooden gate 3 years ago and still holding strong but I wish they would fix the cap.I bought a small bottle after the first one hardened up on me . The second bottle hardened up inside the bottle before I even had a chance to use it . The product itself works well but it does not keep . They need to market it in smaller bottles or do something to improve shelf life .	-1
I found Gorilla Glue to be way over rated . Everything that I 've used it on eventually came apart . Even when I accidently took the capped off with my mouth ( do n't try this unless you 're a professional ) , it did n't take long to get my lips unstuck . I 'm glad that I just bought a small size of it .	-1
The glue does what it is advertised , but the bottle I received is not.The nozzle and the nozzle cap are stuck together tightly because there has been glue filling between them , so they become impossible to separate , and I had to use a stick to access the glue from the large opening . As a result , the glue now has also glued the bottle and the cap together inevitably . It probably will keep the largely unused glue from hardening for a good long time -- - as an inaccessible museum piece .	-1
This glue works fine if you use it in perfect circumstances ( temperature , pourous material , etc . ) but I find it to be generally unreliable . If you want a glue that works on just about any type of material get a bottle of Sticky Ass glue . That glue performs as I expected this glue to .	-1
Try to buy only as much as you intend to use . My large bottle went south after one year . By the way , Elmer 's is probably as good as Gorilla and costs less .	-1
Ok this is a Polyurethane Glue which is quite different to use than any other glue.Its water activated which makes it faster drying than the old brown glues but these guys are pulling the wool over our eyes . Its a good glue but way to expensive for how it performs . Forget about using it in the cold ! Second once its opened use it up like yesterday becuase the way they have this stuff formulated it drys out in less than six months and you are back to the store for another bottle ! Not bad marketing I 'm thinking . It foams way to much for a PU glue which leaves it very vulnerable to failure with large open holes in its bond . Its slow to dry and its also not made in America WHICH THIS WOOD WORKER HAS A TUFF TIME WITH . I am testing several other brands and will post comments to this review later ! I recomend you skip the Gorilla and try an American Made Glue ! try these with me and see what you think !

I needed to drill one hole that required a right angle drive , so I figured that an inexpensive tool could do the job . Well , I was wrong . This item is so poorly made that it wo n't even get one hole made through a pine board . The key for the Jacob 's chuck is so sloppy a fit that the bit ca n't be tightened down enough and the bit slips . I did not expect much , and I got it . Do not waste your money on this item .	-1
I 've owned this right angle attachment for about a year and used it about ten times . It 's the kind of tool I wish I had never purchased - it works , just not very well . Since it 's not defective , and the cost is low , I never bothered returning it.Pros : - easy to use , and it seems moderately robust with it 's combination of metal gears and bushings housed in a thick plastic casing.- low costCons : - does not run true . If you put a pencil in the chuck it will trace a circle of more than 1/8 '' . This is fine for rough work like drilling large holes through studs with a spade bit . For most anything else I find the wobble in the chuck renders it unacceptable.- big and bulky . The large size of this item makes it only slightly more useful than a small drill , especially when you take into account the large amount of runout in the chuck.Summary : Most of the time when I reach for this tool , I wind up putting it back and not using it , either because chuck runout is too excessive , or the bulk is such that I can find numerous better ways to do the job using quality tools.Construction is metal gears , metal bushings , loosely held in a thick plastic case.Save your money and spend it on a better quality tool .	-1
Yes , its light and flexible as others have suggested . These are great things to have in an air hose . The fact that its hard to kink is somewhat irrelevant because under pressure , I 've never experienced a kink in my regular rubber air hose.This hose just continues to annoy me though . The big problem is that it wont lay flat on the floor . It will lay twisted and semi-coiled no matter how many times you unwind or untangle it during use . The coils on the floor create 6 to 8 inch `` bridges '' of hose that you will inevitably trip over , become tangled in , and then curse like a sailor . I cant count how many times the hose has literally wrapped around my foot by accident . I 'd bet that 25 % of those instances caused me to mis-step or flat out trip and stumble . My good old rubber hose lays flat on the floor and has never caused me an ounce of disgust . And the rubber hose is much easier to re-coil for storage.This is not an issue limited only to these Hitachi hoses . I 've yet to find a polyurethane air hose that lays flat . You see , the trade off to the `` lightness '' of the hose is that it causes it to lay at its own will ( seeming to disregard gravity ) . I 'm not even sure you 'll understand the point of my review . If not , go ahead and buy one . I think my comments will be clear within a matter of minutes.Regretably , I bought three of these hoses before I realized what a pain in the rear they are .	-1
Cuts great but bent and kinked , now crooked . Not as good a steel as i thought it would be .	-1
It did not come with 30 accessories . It came with two mandrels , two clamps , 4 sanding bands and a pack of cut off wheels The two mandrels that came with it do not fit the one collet that came with it . Out of the box , this product is absolutely useless without purchasing additional accessories that one is lead to believe come in the box & # 34 ; 30 & # 34 ; sounds like a useful lot of accessories , does n't it ? The box itself only says & # 34 ; various accessories & # 34 ; without listing what those are supposed to be . But the far fewer than 30 accessories that are supposed to be in the box do not even work with the tool that they came with .	-1
I seems like a decent tool but if you are going to prominently advertise that it comes with a nice carrying case then it really should come with that carrying case - especially when the main display photo is of that carrying care .	-1
What is not to like about this tool ? Hmmm ... everything.- It is cheaply made . Cheap plastic fasteners , and I could n't even fit the accessories inside as it would n't unfasten . It was stuck . And I saw similar reviews , so I know I 'm not the only one.- You do n't get what you expected . The 30 accessories count is really tricky . In the end if they could count a screw as 1 accessory , they would do it . What you end up with is a couple of cheaply made accessories , not even fitting properly . And I know what good ones should look like and feel like . The bag is useless , the sanding barrels are useless , maybe the cutting discs are the only thing to use . And that 's all you get . Forget about other accessories . You think `` 30 accessories , I 'll get everything I need , at least for basics jobs ... '' Nope . You don't.This one is going straight back to the merchant . I immediately ordered a different one , and I received it and tried it today : the FORCE PT113001 40 Piece Accessory Kit and Case Variable Speed Rotary Tool Kit . THIS IS THE DEAL ! You get a REAL case . You get REAL accessories , and plenty . All kind of attachments , solidly made tool , and it outperforms many , many others I 've tried before . SO POWERFUL , well built , adjustable speed , plenty of accessories . This is the deal . So return your useless Black & Decker and go buy a Force PT113001 , until the people at B & D ; decide to go back to building tools and taking their customers seriously .	-1
I was very impressed when I first got the unit . It out performed the previous dremmel uint . It was easier to handle and would perform very good . After about 3 weeks of heavy use the unit stopped . We will see if the first was just a dud . I have replaced it .	-1
maybe I just do n't get it but every attachment that came with this tool ( by the way the tool seemed OK ) was absolute crap - could n't imagine using them on anything practical so I returned the whole kit	-1
I do n't understand how it can be this way , but ... I just ca n't get the saw to follow a straight line . I 've used lots of circular saws without this problem . A friend in the trades tried it ( to show me it DID cut straight , it was n't the saw , and make fun of me ) but had the same problem . It pulls to the left !	-1
I buy everything I review . To receive FIVE stars , a product must meet > 90 % of the manufacturer 's claims . I do n't subtract because I don ' t like the color or appearance ( too subjective and personal ) . I review form , function , ease of use , and construction quality . Please forgive typos : I 'm an evidence-based scientist , NOT a typist . If you find my review helpful , please click `` YES '' . This helps me improve future evaluations ( which I do for free to help people make more informed decisions ) .Their Claim : Used to work on small products around the houseMy Verdict ( details below ) : True , to a pointWe all know how needle nose pliers work . So let 's skip that.These Stanley ( who usually make excellent tools ) pliers are made of sub-standard metal . So much so that with anything other than small jewelry ( for instance , electrical wires or metal toys ) the metal indents or bends . Further , the spring does not always return it to the open position . i returned the first and the same thing happened with the second . Pretty soon , the ends become misaligned as well . If you 're a craftsperson , these may be ideal . If you 're going to use this to bend 12 gauge metal wires ( commonly used in all household wiring and NOT very thick ) , you 'll soon have useless pliers.My advice : Avoid these and buy heavy duty needle nose pliers for a couple bucks more . You wo n't be sorry .	-1
The real product is a lot smaller than what the image shows . I expected to buy a bigger one where I can apply enough torque to open nuts . Beware ... ... ... ... ...	-1
It is hard to hang many of my ear protection muffs on it because only the wire part can be hooked on this holder .	-1
This is a tough product and seems well made , but there are serious design issues that make this product a failure for anyone using it.1 : Drill Holder - My 18v Dewalt XRP drill will not fit into the drill holder with the button snapped closed . So , the drill hangs there waiting to fall out of the sleeve , if I move the bucket . I wonder how many other drills will not fit into the drill holder.2 : Screwdriver Storage - There are no proper screwdriver slots . All of the slots and pockets are closed on the bottom . This means that your screwdrivers will hang high over the slots , instead of fitting snug . Screwdrivers will most likely be lost on any job site , if the pockets are used.3 : Way too expensivve - This product is worth $ 15 max , with its design flaws .	-1
I 'll start with that I like about the vise : It 's small and looks like a vise.What I do n't like is it 's not flat across the back surface , meaning it does n't lay flat on your table . It does clamp out the flatness , but the vise is n't . The jaws are not parallel when clamping . One side 'gets there first ' and with enough force , clamps parallel . But , they are not parallel without forcing them to be . When you DO put pressure on the jaws , the one that moves pushes 'up ' in defiance of gravity . If you are trying to get something to stay level in the vise , and you clamp it down ... .it pops up on one side . The use of parallels to bring a piece of stock up to a level even with the top of the vise is n't possible . You have to put the items flush to the bottom of the vise rails and hope the vise does n't ride over the top of it . For something cheap to hold non-critical items , this works fine . To hold anything else is subject to frustration .	-1
This clamp failed the second time I used it . As has been pointed out elsewhere the moveably portion of the clamp that the lead screw runs through is held together by 4 very small , short , Philips head screws . This screws hold the top and bottom of the casting together and take all of the force exerted when closing the clamp . Only about 1/8 & # 34 ; -3/16 & # 34 ; of the screws are actually threaded into the bottom casting , the threads are extremely fine , and who knows what kind of metal the casting is formed from . This design is obviously so poor that only an idiot would have considered it acceptable . I 've gave up on finding a good corner clamp anywhere . This is the 3rd type I 've had and the 3rd type that has failed after 2-3 uses .	-1
The job I was doing was n't even that hard , just making a picture frame . One problem , was not enough support to keep the pieces in place , so I added a little more pressure , and the screws that hold the the moving head broke through and it was ruined . I would not recommend this product for anything that requires any strong holds , perhaps I just would n't recommend period . I do however , have a pair of Irwin 's quick adjustable grips that are wonderful and have lasted for years.Sam	-1
This staple gun jams so much it is useless . Getting it unjammed usually requires a herculean effort using a screwdriver or other tool to wedge out a staple . This is a tiresome process that is necessary just about every time you use the stapler . Not recommended .	-1
I bought one of these at Lowe 's to staple some chicken wire to wood . I got about 4 staples to go partially into the wood , then it jammed . After that , every time I tried to staple , it would jam . I never got another staple to come out , although I spent around 2 hrs cleaning out the jams and reloading.I decided maybe the staples I bought were too long , so I went back and got the shortest ( 1/4 '' ) and tried again . Still jammed and jammed and jammed ; never got even one more staple to shoot without jamming.Fortunately I had kept all the packaging and receipt and was able to get a refund from Lowe 's , although I spent about $ 6 on staples that wo n't fit any other guns.Worst part is , I have yet to find a staple gun that has gotten good reviews on the internet . I thought I 'd found one , a Bostich T6 , which got a good review on one internet site when pitted against a Stanley CT10 and an Arrow T50 . However , Bostich has apparently been bought out by Stanley , which according to reviews , produces constantly-jamming staplers . Stanley has replaced the Bostich T6 with a Stanley Bostich T6-8 so I do n't trust that it 's the same thing.Can anyone recommend a good staple gun for attaching wire to hardwood or trellis material to plywood ? I asked a construction guy , too , and he said get a Swingline staple gun . Of course , Swingline is no longer in production ( bought out by another low-rent company ) . Help !	-1
I have had this unit for a while ( probably since 2004 ) and I do n't use it often because of the problems that 's already been mentioned here . Jams frequently , fails to fire when you want it too.The first day or so it worked fine , but after a while I would have to make it fire TWICE before anything comes out ! Then it began jamming.Today it worked once or twice then would jam , then worked once , then jammed .. until it finally quit.I started taking it apart and it FIRED , yes IT FIRED and the jammed staple nearly hit me in the face ! Too dangerous for me , so I just threw it in the garbage . I took it completely apart before dumping it for fear that someone might want to salvage it . I do n't want to be responsible for taking someone 's eye out with it.Sorry Arrow , I 've had other Arrow staplers ( which tends to disappear around here ) and they all work fine .. but this one is a mess . Too bad because it really looks good and solid , but if I wanted a paper weight or a door jam I 'd get me a rock !	-1
This has got to be the worst stapler ever invented . They have great packaging , couple that with the design and it seems like it would be easier to use ... but that is as far as the functionality extends . I have attempted to use this for a few simple tasks : reattaching the thin cover on the bottom of a sofa , putting up holiday decorations and reupholstering a few chairs . Each one of these led to the most aggrevating time ever , wasting at least 75 % of the staples due to the design of the `` launch '' mechanism . It either fails to retract completely , or it fails to punch the staple with any force.I just went through 2 strips of staples , and only ~10 staples actually worked.Do not waste your money . I just wish I would have actually used this right after purchasing it , instead I bought it ( from b & m ; home improvement store ) for a project that was in the future and am now stuck with it .	-1
There is a reason pro painters never use these things ... .they do not preform as well as a good brush . Think about it , if a painter could save and hour per room by using this tool , do n't you think he would have a whole box full ? These things are for people with no idea what they are doing and are satisfied with a mediocre paint job . You are probably going to paint a lot more rooms in your life time , so do yourself a favor , buy a really good chisel edged angled brush and make yourself learn how to cut in . It 's not that hard and then you wo n't waste any more money on these cheap gimmicks .	-1
I set it up per the directions . I jut started painting a high ceiling with it . Thought , `` wow , this thing works great ! '' Then the thing snapped from the painters pole and came tumbling down about 15 feet . It went EVERYWHERE ! ! Paint got on our carpeting , stairs , railing , and on another freshly painted wall ( of another color ) . I would n't recommend this thing if my life depended on it . The only reason it gets one star is because Amazon wo n't let you put zero . Do n't waste a dime on this .	-1
I bought this from Lowe 's and was n't pleased . As much as I wanted to like it , the dumb thing immediately got paint on my ceilings . I used very little paint and tried cutting the top bristles like another reviewer mentioned , but this did not help.I prefer cutting in with a higher end 1.5 '' brush for greater speed and accuracy . Granted , it does take some time to master the technique of cutting in with a brush , but you 'll get it . What I do is place all the bristles on the tip of the brush against the wall and move the whole brush left or right with a medium amount of paint on the wall . Do n't turn the brush sideways and just cut in using 1/8 '' corner of the bristles . This will give you a wobbly , unsteady line . Instead , use the entire end of the brush and move it sideways along the wall to get a bigger footprint as you 're cutting in . It will result in a much neater line that is faster to replicate than if the brush were turned sideways ( i.e. , vertically when you 're cutting in the ceiling ) . Basically , what I 'm describing is that you want to hold the brush horizontally when cutting in the ceiling , not vertically.Overall , I 'd only recommend this Shur-Line 500 Premium Paint Edger if you really do n't have much attention to detail at all . Yes , it will cut-in a pretty straight line for you , but little spots of paint will be painted in areas of your trim/ceiling that you did n't intend to paint while you 're cutting in . Is n't that why you bought the device ? To avoid this ? ? ? JUST DO N'T BUY IT..	-1
I purchased this item at Lowes , thinking it would save time to edge the ceilings . I 've painted professionally in the past and know how time consuming it is to edge . It has some pros and cons , but generally , I do n't believe this item is worth it . It definitely will save time in edging . However , it does n't make the cut at between the ceiling and the wall . It will paint 1/8 '' on the ceiling or trim , because of how the bristles are designed . There is no real way around this . If you do n't mind having an even cut edge on your ceiling , then this product may be fine for you . However , after using it on ( 3 ) bedrooms , ( 2 ) bathrooms , and a hallway , it 's not worth it . I just had to go back the old fashion way with a paintbrush . Just buy a good quality chisel-edge paintbrush ( Purdy ) and practice a little .	-1
Maybe there is a trick to using this tool that I do n't know about . For me , using this edger was far more work than it was worth.PROS : * NoneCONS : * Paint kept collecting in the front of the edger . * The edger had to be frequently cleaned . * The edger did not spread the paint evenly . * The wheels did not roll smoothly.SUMMARYThis edger did not work for me . It was an absolute mess to use . I will NOT buy or use this edger again.I paid $ 6.15 on May 25 , 2014 for this edger on Amazon .	-1
The first box cutter I received had no blades . I contacted Amazon and they immediately sent out another but it also had no blades . I assumed the first bladeless cutter I received was a fluke but when the second also had no ability to cut I decided to check the reviews here only to find that several other recent purchasers had the same experience . I decided to call the 1-800-GO-IRWIN phone number that was included with the packaging.I got a bored , unconcerned customer service rep who told me a ) These cutters were meant for industrial users who often bought replacement blades in bulk and b ) I probably needed a & # 8216 ; simpler & # 8217 ; cutter . The first statement was irrelevant especially since the bulk of reviewers/users of this cutter were also individuals and the second statement was just short of insulting . Was he implying I wasn & # 8217 ; t smart enough to use a box cutter ? He refused to help me by sending a cutter with a blade until I requested to speak to his supervisor . He put me on hold for five minutes and came back asking for the product number for the cutter I & # 8217 ; d purchased and a picture of it . I gave him the product number and told him I had no way to take a picture of it . He again refused to replace the blade . I again asked to speak to his supervisor . He put me on hold for another five minutes and when he finally came back he asked for my name and address and agreed to send me a replacement . During the entire conversation he was just short of surly and seemed bored . I was not impressed with this customer service rep nor that he would not let me speak to his supervisor . At the time I purchased this cutter it was under $ 5 . Why wouldn & # 8217 ; t they want to make customers happy at very little cost to them ? I & # 8217 ; m mystified by that . At any rate I did receive a cutter with a blade and it works well . The only reason I & # 8217 ; m not giving the product one star as it deserves is because I did , at last and with some effort and irritation , receive a working cutter .	-1
I believed the writer who wrote here that the shipping problems seemed to be corrected . Well , it ai n't so . I noticed an oil stain on the box when I found it on my doorstep . Examinaton of the tool yeilded a cracked crank case plate . Looking at the damage and the oily damage to the box , it was cracked when the box was dropped on its side during shipping . There are NO PACKING MATERIALS in this box , they just stick it in there a send it on down the line.I tried to contact Makita , but they only take calls from their customers M - F from 7 - 7 EST . I found the crack when unpacking the tool about thirty minutes after the Makita folks went home , on Friday . So , even though I paid for overnight shipping from Amazon , seems that I will have to wait until Monday to even let them know I have a problem . So much for needing the compressor until I get in touch with them and they send me a new , hopefully intact , part in a week or so.UPDATE : I waited for nothing . Makita was quick to tell me they do not provide replacement parts . I have to take it to the authorized repair ( closest one is 40 miles from home ) and let them look at it . If they say so , I can get them to install a new crankcase plate - Five Screws . Makita said I could buy a part , which with shipping was $ 30 . I could have gotten a better compressor with the extra bucks . Said to send it back to Amazon . So I have . I 'll take odds that the one enroute is broken when it gets here.Other than that , the un-usable compressor from the un-caring customer service company looked good sitting on the floor . A brilliant shade of blue ... or is that turquoise ? UPDATE : Amazon took it back and sent me another at the same time . They even sent it overnight because I had had it sent overnight originally . It arrived with some bumps and bruises on the box , but this time the delivery company failed to damage the compressor . So , it works wonderfully , it is strong , and it makes very little noise . And even that is muffled . Holds its pressure , easy to drain , everything fits . Good product , overall . Thanks , Amazon guys !	-1
This was purchased for me as a Christmas present ( Dec. 2010 ) Most of the reviews are favorable , but also a lot of shipping damage reports . We checked over the machine very carefully during and after delivery , and found no apparent damage . HOWEVER , it will not run more than two seconds before tripping the overload breaker on the unit . On a single 15 amp circuit , contrary to Makita 's claims , the house breaker trips immediately on a startup attempt . On a 20 amp house circuit the unit tries to start , but after 1-2 seconds the `` overload '' switch pops out . The switch seems quite loose , even when in ( it looks like a circuit breaker from a power strip or airplane panel ) . This is contrary to experience ; so a faulty overload switch is suspected . Heaven knows how long this will take to fix . There is a `` pneumatic '' Makita authorized service center in a nearby town . Hopefully , they can handle the repair , if that is what is needed.The documentation with the Makita compressor is essentially unuseable . The `` Owners Manual '' is more of an Owners `` pamphlet '' . There are NO assembly or set-up instructions or diagrams . There are no pictures or diagrams pointing out the various controls , switches , and valves . The parts diagram is n't much help for identifying operating controls . The `` Manual '' is essentially useless except for the parts list and parts diagram . Troubleshooting suggestions are miniscule . The `` Manual '' also seems to be outdated . There is no additional help on the website . Fortunately , some of the prior reviews included assembly and set-up information . There is a hokey warranty `` card '' ( thin paper ) in the back of the book that says to mail or fax in . Actually , their website accepts warranty registration for this unit ; another reason to believe that the pamphlet is out of date . The overall construction quality of the unit appears quite good . It appears well built and crafted . It is on the heavy side but has a very good handle assembly . Older versions of this model reportedly had thin plastic wheels . This model now has four legs with heavy rubber feet - no wheels.If and when the problems are resolved I 'll be trying to update this review . Meanwhile , we can not recommend purchase .	-1
Can not give a better rating as I have waited 2 delivery times to find each time the compressor is delivered destroyed `` damaged '' in the box . This last time the UPS guy witnessed the opening . I have n't seen it run yet after a month of waiting . I kinda need a compressor is why I bought and paid for it . Get the hint . I can not recommend this compressor if you are really in need of one.They can not seem to get it delivered with out destroying it.We are waiting/going on the 3x third delivery now . Amazon has been great to handle each issue free of charge and is now expediting shipping to help even more . We will be getting a Senco if this one is not shipped correctly.Well its delivery day and we are waiting . I just received an email stating that Amazon was going to double bill me . back on the phone , 4 calls trying to get a supervisor . I am on hold for hours and as I said 4 calls . Cant cook breakfast , this is turning into a nightmare . Billed 2x or threat of it anyway , On the phone with customer service . They refused to escalate the call.Looks like getting screwed by Amazon , double billed , and no compressor.Hours Later ; I am still trying to stop Amazon from double billing me . I still have no compressor.Have you ever had so much trouble that you did not even want the item you bought and paid for.Amazon has offered no compensation for all the trouble . Said they would n't refund until they receive the damaged compressors back . Got screwed on this deal.This sucks ! 3 weeks and screwed every step of the way . If Amazon gave me the compressor for free it would not make up for the hassle . The call center CS when the issues are serious are trained liars ! Hour later ; Low and behold I got a manager on the Chat . He offered a $ 50 refund for all the hassle which is not much for the trouble but is commendable on his part . We will see if it shows up today and in what condition . Lots of reviews say the shipping/packaging is a real problem , so beware..This can happen to you.Noticed after unpacking and packing these , `` if the compressor is on its side in the box for any reason , the weight of the compressor , the way it 's packed , will break the shroud '' ! Poor packaging ! None of this is a review of the MAC700 but rather my experience trying to obtain one from AMAZON , wish me luck ! I still have n't heard it run yet . I am wondering if I am supposed to have one of these ? Well it is supposed to be here no later than 8pm today which is a little over an hour away deadline.Think they will make it with a compressor that is n't torn up ? NO they did not make it , never showed up the delivery I was promised as a concession.Can not recommend sorry..Bad reviews all around on this thing coming damaged . I do not see how it gets 4.5 stars as every 3 or 4 feedback is destroyed or comes reconditioned . Big rip off . How many are not even reported on the feedback . AMAZON is covering this up.Anyone want to know how this turned out . It never showed up . The customer service say that it got held up , no explanation and it should be in next week Tuesday . The customer service are trained liars and have hurt my business . Anyone that needs a compressor would be nuts to try and buy this from Amazon . They say it will take 3 days to get me a refund so I can buy something else . I suspect that is also more deception and that I will be back on the phone resolving that as well.PS : Read all the feedback . I believe they are manipulating the feedback score . These compressors are all coming busted up or rebuilt by Amazon and sold as new.SCAM	-1
Like many others my compressor arrived with the plastic shroud in seven pieces . It would not take much to correct the packaging to prevent this from hapening . One of those inflated plastic bubles taped to the front of the shroud would stop the leading edge of the shroud from hitting the cardboard insert and putting enough pressure on it to cause it to break . Putting large red arrows on the box and printing this end up in large letters would also help as the small red arrows are easily overlooked . My unit came with oil all over the cardboard insert and an imprint of where the leading edge of the shroud had pressed into the cardboard . This was a good indication that the box had been laid on its side . I also own the MAC2400 which is great but really heavy . As Amazon will not replace this unit I have returned it and have ordered another from Home Depot.Com for the same amount plus sales tax . I hope this one comes in one piece .	-1
I bought this to use at the data center where I work . Had almost 1,000 circuits to find and verify that the receptacles were labeled properly . It worked on a few circuits , but it was so hit-or-miss that I did n't trust that it correctly identified the breakers that it toned on . I brought in my circuit finder that I use at home which is made by Ideal and it worked perfectly . Plus the Ideal circuit finder is $ 70 cheaper than this unit.I did like the accessories that came with this unit , but that 's about all . In fact , I cut the leads off of the tone generator , wired them onto an electrical cord , and used it with my circuit finder.It might be good for home use , but really it should work anywhere if it is a good product and does what it is supposed to do .	-1
But i am hopeful the second one which they sent me promptly will . Good service in that they sent the second on out fast , that 's the only reason to give a non functional item anything but 1 star . We 'll see how the second one goes .	-1
Cool , Cool looking , great size , but I ca n't even blow out the garage floor without it turning on all the time , pump up tires , etc . My fault , but I still think if you own this HEAVY compressor you should at least be able to use the air gun without a recharge every minute . better for quick things than constant . HEAVY and LOUD .	-1
My unit arrived in fine condition ( box was not damaged either ) as some report . I also do n't have any problem with the wheels like some reviewers , but I rarely move the unit . My biggest beefs are this unit is extraordinarily loud , to the point where I now use it as little as possible . The tank is small too , and the unit cycles on constantly , although that 's not an issue I can fault . It 's also requires oil , and remembering to check and top off is a bother , although a small one . To recap , I ca n't complain about the unit 's tank size or the fact that it requires oil -- I knew what I was buying -- but those are considerations if you 're considering buying an AC , nonetheless . It seems awfully well made , which is really about all the good I can say about it . I regret buying it -- I was swayed in part by the reviews here and I was not as informed about these things as I thought . A bit wiser and sadder , I do n't think most of the reviewers know what they 're talking about and are merely looking to rationalize their purchase .	-1
I love mechanix gloves normally and have bought a lot of them . I think they are worth the money even though they wear out kinda fast , but this version ( fast-fit ) is not worth any money as they have a seam right at the index fingertip which makes them pretty useless and annoying to wear .	-1
I typically wear a large in any sort of work glove so I ordered the med/large size . These things must be made for big fat hands because I had so much extra material in the palms that I could n't even grip something effectively with these on . And the fingers seemed REALLY tight for such a large palm area . Seems like Mechanix kind of missed the mark trying to accomodate both medium and large sizes in one glove . I really wish they just offered a medium fingerless option because I would buy that in a heartbeat .	-1
Good quality gloves , but I had to return them . Palm of glove fit my hands ( I have a very small hand ) but the finger were too long	-1
Pros : Good fit , durable , high Quality , easy to put on , and sleekCons : There are two seams inside the fingers and the one closest to the fingernail rubs right under the nail into the nail-bed and discomfort . The palm and fingers are made of a very smooth material and gripping things can be a challenge , for example the steering wheel of a car or truck . Get something with rubberized grip for stronger hold .	-1
Here 's a great example of how to take a time-tested tool like the classic Stanley utility knife , and `` innovate '' on it until it becomes a flashy gadget which looks cool until you actually try to do something useful with it . It 's a utility knife that tries to emulate a traditional folding blade , but fails at being either.The first disappointment starts as soon as you try to open the blade , and realize that it takes both hands to open , despite the advertising claims of one handed opening . That 's because the thumb stud seems to have been designed by preschool children and not anyone who has ever used a folding knife . It 's in the shape of a cylinder with a semi-round smooth dome top , which lacks any traction , and combined with the unnecessarily stiff back spring and pivot , ensures that the only thing it 's good for is giving you a sore thumb . And just in case you got the bright idea to adjust the pivot , there 's a security bolt that ca n't be loosened without special bits.Next up is the handle . It 's textured just enough to fool you into thinking you 'll have good traction , but that fantasy fades in short order . The texture is too fine and shallow to provide any substantial grip , and if your hands are wet , it actually provides less grip than the smooth steel of the back spring . It 's also flat on the sides and with square corners , thus making prolonged heavy use a real pain . The square corners continue into the front half of the knife , except now there 's also the useless thumb stud and the blade release tab poking your thumb as a bonus . Or maybe I 'm just `` holding it wrong ? `` And now we come to the blade itself . Not only is it dull out of the box , but there were no extra blades included , because there is no room to store additional blades in the handle . It also ca n't be adjusted to different lengths in case you want to make shallow cuts , there 's only a one-size-fits-all position . And lastly , the mechanism holding the blade in place operates merely on friction , thus making long term durability questionable.The only way this knife beats the Stanley is that changing the blade does n't require unscrewing the handle apart . But in terms of ergonomics , features , and safety , this knife is a major step backwards . And considering this one costs more , that 's simply adding insult to injury . I ca n't think of any good reason to buy it , except maybe to play a prank on someone looking to `` upgrade '' their plain old reliable utility knife to something less boring and more flashy .	-1
I was fairly impressed when i first received the knife , it feels good in your hand , handy belt clip , quick change blade.However.. the second day i had it , I was cutting heavy cardboard and the blade pulled out . I started checking and you can actually pull the blade out with your fingers ! The mechanism that locks the blade into the knife is just too loose . It looks like it would maybe work better if the blade was twice as thick.If you are going to use this for light cutting such as cutting tape to open a box , it will probably work fine , but not for heavy cutting .	-1
Saw the good reviews and wanted to like it , but the blade does not stay in securely . The blade could easily come out and lead to a serious injury . Not sure if it was just a defective knife that I received , but I want nothing to do with it and I returned it for a refund . Would give it 5 stars if it held the blade in place .	-1
I 'm not sure who exactly is in the target demographic for this knife . If you want something to throw in a backpack just in case or if you have the need to do some light slashing or stabbing after hours , this might do the job , but generally I thought that this combination knife/flashlight/whistle fell short in all three areas.- Knife : the knife blade is 3 inches long , with a sharp point , a straight blade , then a serrated section at the base of the blade . I was disappointed that the blade did n't lock open or lock closed , and the promotional materials describing the blade as `` razor sharp '' overstated the case . The knife has a lanyard hole for storage , plus there 's a belt clip.- Flashlight : Again , the materials described this light as `` brilliant white . '' It 's good if you 're working close , but is a very small light . If you leave it mounted over the knife , it lights your hands well enough to see your work , and if you remove it , it has a articulating magnet which lets you stick it to something while you work , which is nice.- Whistle : I could n't get much noise out of this whistle without very careful mouth placement . If I was very careful , I could get a fairly loud sound , but have heard louder . If you 're backpacking or something and want an emergency whistle , I do n't think this would be a substitute.Basically , if you need this particular combination of functions and are n't too demanding about any of them , this might be a good buy , but otherwise , I would keep looking.Update : Apparently , this knife is supposed to lock when open ( but not when closed ) . Mine definitely does n't lock in either position - the lever inside the handle must not be installed correctly .	-1
I like how this knife feels in the hand , and the fact that it 's very easy to snap open with either hand , left or right.However the add-on flashlight is pretty much useless . The beam is underpowered , and if you twist the head too much - it falls out of the socket , together with batteries and few other small parts ... and then good luck finding them all in the dark ... So I 'd give 4-5 stars for the knife , and 0 for the flashlight .	-1
I 'm a bit of a knife hound and I generally stay away from these cheaper blades , but every once and a while you find a gem hidden in the rough . Unfortunately the Tool Logic SL1 I received is not one of these gems . Instead , take a cheap blade , add an underpowered flashlight , a whistle and a cheap , overly bulky housing , and you get the SL1 . *Note : I have several images posted up on this knife , but for some reason they are n't showing up properly on the item . You have to go to http : //www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B0001WC6LS/ in order to see them . *The Blade -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The blade is a standard 50/50 serrated/plain edged combo and comes semi-sharp - the blade is not dull but it 's not razor sharp either . I could not find the metal make-up of the stainless steel they use in the blade listed anywhere , but the metal seems pretty soft ; tapping the blade against the flashlight 's housing caused noticeable nicks on the edge ( and by `` tapping '' I mean tapping - not a hard slam or anything ) . I did the same test with one of my Benchmade knives just to be sure I was n't being unfair - the Benchmade had zero edge damage . However Benchmade is known for some solid knives so I did a more dollar-for-dollar comparison by using myVictorinox 47520 Fibrox 8-Inch Chef 's Knife- also no nicks . However with all soft metals , it was easy to repair back to a sharp edge . Just be prepared resharpen a lot.This is a minor complaint but it 's worth noting that the non-blade edges of the blade were also pretty sharp . Generally when you purchase a quality knife , the stamped edges are given at least a cursory file down to remove the sharp corners . The edges on this blade feel as if the blade was pushed out of its stamp , had the extra flash removed and nothing else . Out of the box , you could remove paint from a wall using the backside of the blade . Why does this matter ? Well , I 'm assuming that the SL1 was meant to be an everyday carry knife ( EDC ) . Given any amount of friction , the non-finished edges of this knife will chew through your pockets.The Flashlight -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The flashlight is pretty horrible . It was hard to tell exactly how horrible until I put it against some of my other flashlights . First up was a free keychain I got with myStanley 95-155 3-in-1 Tripod LED Flashlight . Against this little keychain , the knife 's light was n't too bad except for the fact that it was so diffuse . The LED did not have a very intense focal spot and therefore if you wanted a specific area lit up well , you need to have the light pretty close . The light is powerful enough to shed light on an object 7ft away increasing the illumination by one or two light levels in a dark room , but useful range is probably closer to 3ft max . Compared to theStreamlight 73001 Nano Light Miniature Keychain LED Flashlight , Black ... well , there was no comparison . The Nano simply blew the SL1 's flashlight away ( see picture ) .The only added benefit of the SL1 's flashlight is the magnetized base clip . It 's an innovative idea which does actually add some functionality to the light . I 'm not sure about using the magnet as an item picker-upper like they have illustrated in their product shots ; mostly because the surface area of the magnet is so small . However the magnet was able to hold the SL1 ( obviously without the weight of the flashlight and batteries ) +Spyderco Police 3 G-10 Plain Edge Knife , Black , but not much else - so the total lifting limit of the magnet is probably somewhere around 15oz . which is n't bad at all.The Handle -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Due to the inclusion of the flashlight the body of this knife feels pretty bulky - in fact , the handle comes in at a thickness of 5/8 of an inch - larger than some full-sized multitools . In addition there is only a light texturing on the body 's surface , so slip could potentially come into play in less than ideal conditions . The fact that the body is made of plastic does n't bother me too much - it helps keep the overall weight of the knife down . Unfortunately it just feels too big.The whistle ? I do n't know.. it 's a whistle . It seems loud enough . I 'm sure it 'd get people 's attention if you blew on it hard enough.The Drop Test ( Failed ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- One of the most important tests for any folder is the drop test - ie : dropping the knife from a closed position to the ground . A well constructed knife with a good folding device should not open when dropped . It 's common sense - if you drop your knife , the last thing you want is for the sharp blade to drop on your foot . Dropping the SL1 from a closed position at a distance of approximately three feet , the blade was more than half open and fully exposed each time upon landing ( it did not seem to matter which part of the knife hit the ground ) . Assuming that perhaps the screws got loosened in transit , I verified that all screws were fully tightened - same result.Failing just this test disqualifies this knife for consideration as an everyday carry in my eyes.Conclusion -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The SL1 failed the drop test which completely takes it out of the running for consideration as a EDC for me . Unfortunately this seems to be the intended primary function of the SL1 , thus the one star rating from me.Is this knife useless ? Well no knife is really useless , but if you were considering this knife as a simple utility knife , at the current cost of twenty five dollars , there are so many more quality options . They may not be the all-in-one flashlight-whistle-knife that the SL1 is , but I 'm betting that they 'll fill their one or two roles better than the SL1 fills its three .	-1
It 's actually a really smart idea attaching a flashlight to a knife . Even in pitch darkness the little light can shine up a small room pretty well . It 's firmly in place ( unlike another reviewer said , it is impossible for the flashlight to `` fall off '' so he must have had a different model ) . The light is always directed at the blade so you know where you 're pointing the thing and can easily see what you 're cutting . Unfortunately , for the shockingly expensive price tag of $ 40 or even Amazon.com discount of $ 25 , it just is n't worth it.The Pros : - Flashlight is bright , effectively pointed , never falls off.- Handy . Given you find yourself in an extreme situation where you need a knife , it is likely you will also need a flashlight . The combination of the two is useful and great.The cons : - Dull knife ( it is sharp , do n't get me wrong , but for $ 40 you should expect better ) .- Dangerous ( as others have mentioned , the blade flops out really really really easily , making it accident-prone ) .- Expensive ( Waaaaaay too expensive . At $ 10 I would feel less guilty and at $ 5 I might even recommend getting one.. but as long as the asking price is $ 15 and up , I call this product a rip-off ) .Overall , the only good ( and safe ) spot I can think to keep this is in the glove compartment of my car . You never know when you need to cut off a seat belt , survive in the wilderness , or stab an approaching zombie . In any of those cases , I think this knife would be helpful . I do n't know that it 's actually sharp enough to easily cut through a seat belt , but I 'm guessing it would do the trick if you sawed at it long enough . Probably the most helpful thing about it is the flashlight , though . Even if you are n't using the knife for anything , it is quite bright for such a tiny thing . I just hope I wo n't accidentally stab myself with the loose blade .	-1
I ordered AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener at the same time that I ordered a J.A . Henckels 8 Piece Stylus Block Set . When I first received this sharpener , It worked well at keeping the knives very sharp . After using it for around four months , honing mostly the three knife blades used most about once a month , I needed to open it up and reverse the carbide inserts because it had stopped sharpening the knives.Within another four months the sharpener was completely useless . It would n't work any longer . So the carbide inserts do need replacement after 30 to 40 times of use , and the carbide inserts that need to be replaced are at a cost almost equal to what I had paid for the entire unit.The `` 5 to 10 years of use between blade changes '' on the product page of the AccuSharp Sharpener is a complete exaggeration . Just two weeks ago , I paid over $ 7.00 to Amazon ( best price on the web ) for a new set of replaceable blades , after only eight months of what I consider to be light use .	-1
Bought the 3-piece set recently . The surface has a few spots that are high and my chisels keep catching on them ruining the edge . Expected more for so much money .	-1
Well built , seemingly . Reliable , no . Mine stopped working after a few uses , contacted Surefire customer service . No response . $ 80.00 for a pocket size flashlight should include a company that stands behind their products .	-1
I want to concur with the other comments about problems with this dispenser holding to a surface using adhesive . I think it has something to do with the surface to which it 's being attached , the adhesive used , and the fact that you press down when you insert bags and pull out when you remove them.When the supplied double-sided adhesive gave out ( after a few weeks ) I tried several different brands of double-sided tape . Nothing worked.If I could have used screws then this would be perfect . Unfortunately the doors and sides of my cabinets are too thin for them to work well.If you have some place where you can screw this down then it will be a perfect dispenser . If you will need to depend on adhesive then ( as you can see from this and other reviews ) some times it will work and some times it wo n't .	-1
While I 'm a firm believer that everything has it 's place , I believe that my wife came up with a better/cheaper alternative than simplehuman . Empty Kleenex or tissue dispensers work perfectly . Only one bag comes out at a time , and they come in enough sizes/colors/patterns to match any decor .	-1
As other reviewers have mentioned , the peel off tape strips on this unit will not hold it in place for very long . Additionally , the screws provided to mount the unit are too small . The screw head is not wide enough in diameter to securely hold the unit.Several customers have complained about this yet the manufacturer continues to include incorrect hardware.Not impressed.On a positive note , this item is made in Taiwan and NOT in China . Amazing !	-1
easy to assemble if there are 2 of you . it 's the company you need to be careful about . the product is okay , the company is annoying . the wheels roll easy , the company thinks they have the right to call you and convince you to write a good review . if i knew this was going to happen i would have bought from another seller .	-1
Nothing in the website description says that it can not be mounted on a vaulted ceiling nor on a rod . The whole unit must be flush with the ceiling . Otherwise , it does n't work . The attachment points for the blades are straight bolted on and does not use rubber washer - careful not to over tighten , you 'll ruin the finish of the blades . The frosted glass light covers do not have rubber mounting rings . So , you have to get the metal screws to force onto the glass surface itself . Again , careful not to over tighten . The parts are needlessly heavy yet the motor was somewhat small . This is a serviceable fan for the limited budget and limited time . But get a Hunter fan if you want a real fixture that lasts .	-1
UPDATE:3/13/07I spoke with a DeWalt representative that contacted me after reading one of my letters to express his concern regarding my issues with DeWalt . He assured me that the representitive I originally was in touch with was not typical of DeWalt , hence his call to me . We spoke about the issues with the batteries among other things . It was possible I may have bought a bad battery ... it does happen with any company I suppose and he was kind and considerate enough to contact me and deal with the issue at hand.He also gave me his direct number if I should have a problem in the future which is what I 'd expect of a company that cares about their products.I do have to admit I was very impressed with the response and hope DeWalt can stay on top of the game like this rep was doing with me ... there 's too much compitition out there now a days not to.I want to say thank you for the time that was taken to explain and resolve the issues with me ! ! ! Thanks DeWalt ! andy clifford ... Clifford Renovations and RestorationsPS ... if I could upgrade the star rating I would but unfortubatly Amazon does n't give me that option as far as I can see.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The recent 18V DW batteries I bought which are about a year old do n't seem to hold a charge like the originals I bought when I first bought my DeWalt tools.I do use the Tune-up mode button and even with that the two batteries I bought still seem to be loosing their charge after only a year . Coincidently thats how long the warantee is for . Customer support for DeWalt has to be the WORST I 've ever encountered in my life and I have thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of hand tools.I 'll be going with Bosch after my drills die , , , but better yet ... rather than keep sinking money into their batteries I think I 'll sell them on Ebay and start my Bosch collection next week . DeWalts going the very same route Crapsman tools went ... just watch ! !	-1
I do n't know what it is with DeWalt but their batteries are very lackluster . I have a charger with tuneup mode and even so , come about a year later they do n't hold a charge . I do n't feel good about these things being so `` disposable '' so to speak so I changed cordless brands and ditched all my dewalt 18v cordless for mostly hitachi . Some things , after years of use I decided were just never going to be that great in a cordless version so I am back to using corded saws for many apps . This battery was very disappointing and for the cost of it , i could n't in good conscience recommend this battery to anyone .	-1
I purchased a dewalt 18v combo pack ( hammer drill , circ saw , recip saw and flashlight ) .My biggest complaint is with the batteries.Out of 5 batteries , only 1 still works . I just ordered 2 more because without batteries the tools are useless , so what do you do . I should throw the whole set in the trash and start over with a different brand , but that 's a lot of $ $ $ $ .The recip saw variable speed does n't work , it runs only about half speed . The drill that came with the set burned up so I bought another one since I had the set and I do like the drill.With cordless tool sets you are sorta stuck with the brand you buy , unless you start over .	-1
I own a lot of 18V DeWalt batteries ( NICd ) and tools ( about 7 drills , 3 or 4 reciprocating saws , rotary laser level , 3 cordless nail guns , etc. ) . Most of them are dead . Some of them are less than 2 years . All of DeWalt 18V batteries discharge very quickly by themselves without using ( less than a week after fully charged ) . I understand none of rechargeable batteries last forever and there is a life span . But comparing to other brands , DeWalt batteries are the most expensive and last less . Last year I bought a 18v combo set ( drill , circular saw & flash light w/2 batteries ) of Porter Cable at Lowes . I think it was less than $ 100.00 . It has been a year . I do n't take this one to the job site because all of my cordless tools are DeWalt . It has been in the garage for more than a year . I have not recharged battery yet after fully charged on the date of purchase . I have been using it occasionally , but it is still very powerful almost same as the fully charged on the first day . It is very hard for me to change other brands of cordless because I already have too many 18v DeWalt . I agree with most of negative reviews . Before I place this review , I have thought a lot whether I am wrong or I expect too much . However , DeWalt batteries are too expensive and do n't last long comparing to other brands . I use these tools almost every day as a professional carpenter . Early this year I bought a combo set of Lithium 18V DeWalt , drill & impact . It is still working good same as new one . I wish to buy another DeWalt 18v lithium battery only , but too expensive . It is better to buy a full set with batteries.I wish there are some generic brands of these batteries or DeWalt makes its price lower .	-1
This is worse than replacing ink-jet printer cartridges ! ! ! ( could be debated ) My second pair of 18 volt XRP batteries quit working , and they are not quite two years old ! They have not been abused and have been properly maintained and charged . I even use Dewalt 's reconditioning charger on them every so often.Dewalt ! ... .these batteries should cost at least 60 % less considering their longevity ! Now , do I spend another $ 120 on two batteries that have 18 months of productive use ... or Buy the Hitachi Pro 18v Lithium Cordless drill , w/2 1.5ah batteries for only $ 159 ... hmmmmm	-1
I own two of these , a type 3 from 1992 and a type 7 , the `` whisper '' model , purchased in 2003 . The later model adds variable speed , revised tool body ( with flat sides so you can clamp it for stationary work ) and is slightly quieter . As noted by other reviewers , you would be a masochist to use either sander without ear protection and a respirator . Both versions of the 362 have great balance and power ; both need the graphite platen upgrade . No complaints on the durability of the type 3 - I 've lent it out to non-woodworking types and have watched it rocket off the toolbench more than once when I reset the breaker with the tool still switched on : O . It 's a little ugly and missing a few pieces but still works great . Not so for the nicer designed type 7 . I 've seen two of these fail on jobsites ( loss of power ) and have had 3 failures myself . One shot blue sparks out of the housing on day 3 ( warranty replacement ) The second ran for three years of intermittent use , then the main armature bearings failed . Three months to the day after that repair , the armature seized up again . P/C will cover the repair , but at this point I have no faith in the tool . Too bad the new model 's durability does n't measure up - in other ways it 's an improvement on a good tool .	-1
The first time I tightened the screws they broke through Had to use longer ones and a washer . Other wise it holds my tools ' handles very well .	-1
About a week after installing it , one of the friction holders lost its grip completely , and it was only holding a light broom . It loosened right up rendering it useless . It was annoying in that it took a little time to put up with 4 screws and now holes in my door for something I no longer have . Save yourself some money and aggravation and avoid this particular design no matter the manufacturer . It is not durable at all .	-1
I would not buy this again ! the belts are very difficult to replace , and do not stay tight , and fly off for no apparent reason ( the clips are of poor quality and tend to not hold the sand belt ) . In addition , the , so called repair center , appears to not know how to repair JET products . I will probably not by JET again . A big part of the problem with JET and other `` manufacturers '' is this ... MADE IN CHINA ! ! ! WAKE UP PEOPLE , WE MAKE CHINA RICH AT THIS COUNTRY 'S AND ITS PEOPLE 'S EXPENSE , AND HOW ABOUT TRADE DEFFICITS AND NATIONAL DEBT , AND GUESS WHO BUYS OUR DEBT ! ! ! Read my review of the Jet 1442 Lathe ; It is as sorry as this machine !	-1
I purchased this Jet 10-20 this past summer to clean up 300 square feet of IPE porch floor wood.Well I received the unit that must have had the worst tracking problem of them all . I followed all of the instructions and all of the suggestions from these ( Amazon ) reviews to no avail . The belt tracked off to the left every time in a few minutes no matter where the tracking was set . I ruined several $ 40 drive belts . The drive belt will run off the edge and tear it self up at the seam with no warning.I had to get the job done so I just machined a couple of groves into the out bound roller and put on `` shoulder '' retaining rings . This allowed the belt to run into the `` shoulders '' and then roll over on itself , but not tear itself in half . After many hours of this the belt `` lost '' about 2 inches of usable width . This was acceptable because I was sanding 6 inch wide boards.A second serious problem is the hold down springs on the sanding drum mount . These spring provide the downward force necessary so the drive belt can move the wood through the sander . These springs measured about 2 pounds of force . The friction force that holds the wood to the drive belt comes the downward force of these springs times the coefficient of friction of the sand covered drive belt . This 2 pound downward force is simply way too low for sanding hard wood ( it only worked on narrow cedar for me ) . I had to replace the springs with ones I measured at 20 pounds force . This drastically improved the performance.On a subsequent project I tried for several hours , on the recommendation from the service guy at Hartville Tool , to extremely slowly adjust the tracking setting . Well , after hours , this finally worked , but only for that drive belt . Absolutely not worth the effort for each drive belt . No tool should take hours to become functional . It is a very poor design . I was told that the 16-20 does not have this problem.Another annoying problem is that the sanding belts get tight on the right side of the drum and loose on the left side of the drum , no matter how tight they start out at ( because the right side of the belt is in tension and the left side of the belt is in compression , since it is spirally wrapped from left to right ) . This results in more material being removed from the left side of the board than the right ; do the increased diameter of the loose belt on the left side of the drum.Yet another problem is that the exhaust port has a cross member for rigidity that simply serves to catch all the dust going by and clogs up every 10 to 15 minutes . The only solution was to cut the plastic cross member out ( the port is still strong enough ) .It seems that this unit was only designed for very soft wood ; as that is all it does with out extreme hassle.I asked all the local wood tool stores why they do n't sell this item - too many complaints was their answer.The reason I choose this over the 16-20 was that this weighed only 100 pounds and hence was portable and of course it was less expensive.Until Jet fixes all these problems I do not recommend this unit .	-1
When I first got this sander a year ago,1 . first thing the conveyer belt fell off and tore itself to pieces.2 . 220 grit sand paper just does n't stay in place on this sander 's drum . Just today , 2 wraps of new 220 grit paper self destructed . The clamps just do n't hold.3 . I can never get hold of performax ( WMH ? tool group ) for any technical assistance . It 's one of those `` I am either on the phone with another customer or away from my desk '' but they never seem to come back.4 . The sand paper is expensive especially in precut rolls so I am going to get bulk rolls so losing a wrap is not so painful.5 . The alignment of the drum to the coveyer does n't stay put very well.6 . You ca n't use just any dust collector to collect the rather fine dust . It plugged up my first one but now I have a cyclone and it is satisfactory.BUT , NOW I am addicted to the wonderful concept of wide sanding ( no tear out anymore ) , so I will keep on trying to get around these problems .	-1
When this thing is tuned and working properly , it 's a great machine . Alas , those moments are rare . I spend more time adjusting it than actually using it.First , setting the sanding drum parallel to the table is a pain in the ass . The owner 's manual says that parallelism is set at the factory and should not hafta be set by the owner . When I received mine , it was out by 3/8 '' ! This is a huge amount . Obviously , the quality control department was at lunch when my machine was assembled.To set the parallelism , four bolts are loosed and a knob is turned . The problem arises from the fact that there is so much play in these components , that by the time everything is re-tightened , it is out of parallel again . So , to set it is very much a hit-or-miss process.Second , attaching the sandpaper belt to the drum is another pain in the ass . There are two clips that hold the sandpaper , one on either end . The first one is easy to set because it is on the outboard and you can see it and reach it . But the in-board clip can not be seen . The clearance between the drum and the frame is really tight . Performax supplies a wire thingamajig to open the clip and keep the sandpaper taut . This works kinda . But if you have bear paws for hands , forget it.Third , it 's tough to keep the sandpaper taut . Pulling the sandpaper taut , working the thingamajig and pulling the tab into the clip is an exercise in frustration . Then the belts will stretch and need to be re-tightened . And the belts will always rise away from the drum by about 1 mm where they turn into clip . The clip is at 90 degrees to the drum , so , you could crease the sandpaper so it fits better but when you do that , it weakens the sandpaper and it will break . So , with this bump , you really do n't have a full 22 '' because it does n't sand correctly at the bump in the sandpaper . And forget trying to sand something 44 '' wide-I 'd rather use 36 grit as toilet paper than sand a wide face frame.Fourth , wood burns for no apparent reason . I get these areas , usually 3/8 '' wide where something attaches itself to the belt and boom , there is a band of pitch that is burned onto the sandpaper and will never come off . This pitch immediately starts gouging the wood . I use a dust collector rated at 1100 CFM and I clean the belt often with a crepe rubber stick . Also , whenever I sand something greater than 6 '' wide I increase the depth of cut only 1/8 of a revolution at a time ( 1/128 '' ) . So , I 've come to the conclusion that this is underpowered.The automatic feed limiter does n't solve this problem . In fact , if the feed limiter kicks in , at least 50 % of the time , I 'll get a wide swath of burn marks . So , I always feed so slow the feed limiter does n't kick in.Fifth , the belts break long before the abrasive is gone . And given the cost of these belts , it makes using this machine too expensive.So , unless you like fiddling with your machines more than you like working wood , stay away from this.Oh , there are a few good points . The stand is nice and sturdy . The casters are great . And the stand has a nice shelf to store sandpaper . Nice paint job too.UPDATE A friend reccommended that I not use the crepe rubber to clean my belts . This has helped reduce burning a lot . So , I would now give this machine 3 stars and strongly reccommend that you do not use the crepe rubber pad sold by Grizzly for cleaning drum sanders .	-1
I purchased a Powermatic 14 inch bandsaw in August 2009 . I 'm not at all impressed with the quality . I know a lot of people like Powermatic , but mine must have been made on a Monday . For the most part , I think it is well designed , solid and a great performing saw . I took off three stars though , because of recurring problems I 've had with the machine . Here are the things I did n't like:1 . Initial set up is much more difficult than it needs to be : the manual is not very helpful . I got a lot more help through forums in Lumberjocks than I did from the manual.A somewhat related problem is that the part numbers in the manual do n't seem to exist in real life . For example , the manual calls the Upper Wheel Sliding Bracket part number PWBS14-211 . But I searched online , and on the Powermatic ( and then Jet ) websites : no such number . I finally called the toll free customer support number , and they gave me a number of 100016ACP.2 . Quality is not as good as I 'd like . One year and 2 weeks into ownership , the quick tension release broke . I called the toll free customer support number , and they would not pay for a replacement , or for anyone to install a replacement . Since I was a `` start up '' shop , money is tight , and I could live without this feature ... so I 've not had the luxury of this feature ever since . ( Admittedly the quick release feature is a Carter product , but I was disappointed that WMH Tool did not stand up for this , simply because I was 2 weeks out of warranty.3 . Now after 2 years and 1 month of ownership , the upper wheel sliding bracket broke . Unlike the quick release , this is not something I can do without . So I 'm having to replace this part . Again , I called WMH Tool group and explained , but they would not replace it , or even offer free shipping on the part . Yikes.I had always heard great things about Powermatic tools . I paid extra for this saw to get that quality , but as I said , I 've had mixed feelings about the purchase . ( By contrast , I bought some relatively inexpensive Grizzly products ( jointer , drill press , etc ) and have had great success with them . ) I do like the built-in dust blower and light , I think the table is solid , nicely sized and easy to use , and most other features are worth the `` Powermatic reputation '' . It has great cast iron wheels , and it easily re-saws even 10 '' hardwood ( I have the riser block - a `` must have '' ! ) The poor manual , spotty quality , and lax response from WMH Tool Group , however , are disappointments.On the plus side , I called Woodcraft today ( this is where I purchased the saw in the first place ) . They were very responsive and are offering a replacement sliding bracket at no charge , and no questions asked.Overall , a good performing tool , with nice features . But for the money , the service , instructions , and quality seem a bit off.UPDATE : Well I received the replacement sliding bracket and still had difficulties . My sales team at Woodcraft was great . They got me in touch with higher ups at both Woodcraft and Powermatic . The upshot is that WMH Tool Group authorized a guy to come out and service the saw at no cost to me , eventhough the saw was out of warranty . That seemed to do it for a while ( about 6 weeks , and I 've only used it maybe twice in that time . ) Today the whole problem started all over again . And to cap things off , the tensioning arm broke . This saw is going up for sale tonight , and I 'm getting something else that I can rely on . This saw has simply caused too many problems too many times .	-1
I bought this stapler b/c driving a lot of staples at once by hand can be tiring . Included with the Arrow ETFX50 Stapler : the electric stapler with attached 10 ' grounded NEMA 15-5 grounded power cable , black plastic carry case , instruction manual , warranty card . The stapler is solidly constructed of high impact plastic . The design is very simple , there are no power adjustments or depth settings , and staples are loaded from the rear with a familiar spring loaded staple pusher . The ETFX50 drives BN1810 5/8 '' brad nails and six sizes of T50 staples ( 1/4 '' - 9/16 '' ) , resupply is easy due to the popularity of the T50 staples , found virtually anywhere.I have used this stapler mostly on wood to secure insulation backing , fabric , and plastic vapor barrier . My experience has been the stapler is very finicky . It is underpowered when driving larger staple sizes into 2x4 wooden studs or plywood , leaving staples proud . The manual states one should use smaller staples if the staples stand proud , however the frequency of jamming increases substantially when using the smaller staple sizes . Further , you must hold the stapler completely flat and level against the work surface or it will not drive the staples correctly , either crushing them or jamming , not always easy to do on vertical surfaces or in tight spaces . While the carrying case is nice , it needs to be slightly larger ; the case leaves barely room to hold the cord , and no room to store extra staples . Note , I have not used the stapler to drive brad nails , so I can not comment on this feature.Clearing jams is a slow and tedious process . The staple magazine must be fully removed to clear jams . The magazine is held in place at the rear of the stapler with a pin secured with a nut , and in the front there are two male nipples which engage with female holes . The retaining nut is constructed of nylon surround by an aluminum shell , presumable to prevent it vibrating loose . The design makes it difficult to remove the guide rail as you must secure the nut with one hand/tool while attempting to unscrew the holding pin with the other hand/tool . Also both pin head and nut are prone to damage/stripping due to the soft materials they are constructed of . Once open jams are easy enough to clear , however replacing the guide rail is fraught with the same annoyances as opening it.Perhaps the most annoying feature is the small black safety switch located just above the trigger . The safety switch is there to prevent accidental misfires , however the switch is very sensitive and must be completely moved to the `` on '' position which is not marked on the product . Further due to the poor placement of the safety switch , you often bump it with your hand preventing you from being able to fire the stapler at just moment when you planned to.In conclusion ; I would say this stapler has done an adequate job , but its finicky design makes me unable recommend it to a friend . Look elsewhere for better designed product.Pros : Solidly BuiltEasier on the hands than a manual staplerSupplies are easy to findIncluded plastic carry case ( could be larger ) Cons : Finicky design featuresAnnoying safety switch placementProne to jamming with smaller staple sizesJams slow and tedious to clear b/c of staple magazine retaining pin designUnder powered with larger staplesMust be held very flat/level to work surfaceSummary : Quality construction but finicky design oversights prevent recommending this product to a friend .	-1
I 'm an avid diy'er and purchased one these at the local home center about one year ago . I have primarily used this for insulation and cathedral ceiling baffles . When it decides to work ... there is no finer tool for the job . The trigger pull is awesome and there is absolutely no hand fatigue after hours of use . BUT ... lately it only fires when it feels like it . It may shoot five staples perfectly , and then die for the next 20 trigger pulls -- extremely frustrating , especially when standing on a 12 ' ladder . Unfortunately the warranty is only 90 days ; I think for the price they charge it should be at least a year.Some other notes ... You 'll need a decent extension cord ( 12gauge or better ) ; it does n't run so well on light-gauge cords -- the staples will not sink flush . I also wish the magazine/clip that holds the staples was longer ; it goes empty real quick -- at least it use to ... when it fired properly ... Now I 'm using the Arrow staple hammer , which I love . It is very fast and holds twice the staples , but it 's not nearly as precise as the FX50 and often tears the vapor barrier ...	-1
Heavy-duty my a** . This stapler wo n't drive through 1/8 '' tempered hardboard ( MDF , basically ) , and even in plywood about 50 % of the staples are crooked or bent over . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !	-1
I bought this stapler to save on time and fatigue for a canvas project requiring 300 staples.A stapler is such a simple product that it either works or it does n't . In this case the ETFX50 does n't work well enough to warrant replacing a manual T50 stapler.Cons : - jams too often and you fight to open the staple pusher assembly- trigger lacks positive feel- can not fire staples quickly , during `` recharge phase '' trigger does nothing- sharp edged trigger lock rubs against your thumb- cord is too heavy as others have commented- worst of all , with all this power 10A+ , staples still do n't sit flush	-1
I agree with the review above . The tool needs more power . I work on oak , and can not get the 1 '' or 1 1/4 '' brads to penetrate fully . I tried 2 hands and putting my weight into it , but still no good . The nails are very difficult to set by hand as they bend easy . When I tried to remove the brad , it would snap in half ! Very disappointing , since the tool appears to be good quality and it never jams.I contemplated buying a pneumatic nail gun or a cordless nailer . The pneumatic is cumbersome and the cordless is expensive . I 'm going back to using my nail spinner , hammer , and nail set .	-1
I purchased my ET200 nail gun to do some molding and other light work while having my kitchen remodeled . I read the instructions , simple enough . So I did some practice nailing before doing the floor molding . I started with the 1.25 '' nails . The first few shots left the nail exposed about .25 '' . Okay , press down harder , no difference . Try a softer wood , still left with .25 '' exposed nail . So I reviewed the instructions , nothing there . Lets try the web page . Nice looking site but a serious lack of help . The FAQs ' were canned to sell accessories . No real product support . I tried some smaller one inch nails and pretty much the same problem , but those 5/8 '' nail gets driven in almost flush . I took the first back and tried another . It goes back tomarrow .	-1
I bought this nailer at a local home depot only because the reviews were n't good and I figured if it did n't work well I could quickly bring it back ... Good thing I did . I bought it along with one box of each of the size brads it used . Took it out of the case , and figured I 'd try out the longest brads ( 1 1/4 '' ) figuring if they worked , it was good to go . I tried it on a peice pine ( soft wood ) . I was n't able to get one brad all the way into the wood . There was typically 1/4 '' of the brad left to be hammered in . No matter how I tried it just would n't sink the brad . So , I immediately took it back . Too bad , I 'd love it if it just worked !	-1
I wanted a finish trim nail gun , but did n't want to get into the air gun type . This was suggested , and it looked capable of basic and infrequent use . The FIRST one that I bought would n't sink nails into soft pine all of the way , leaving about a quarter inch sticking out . You ca n't pound the recommended brads in , they are very soft . So I took it back to the store . They provided another one , which worked for two uses . It worked flawlessly . And then today , I opened the case , pulled out the gun , loaded it per the instructions , plugged it in , turned on , set in place , depressed the safety and pulled the trigger . Nothing . I tried a different load of brads . Nothing . I took it back to the retailer and found out that they no longer carry it because of defective merchandise claims . I called Arrow and they said it was out of warranty.Reading through the other reviews , I am comforted in knowing that I am it alone in being taken by the promise , but instead finding out that the product is riddled with bad quality and uselessness . Do n't buy it .	-1
this charger keeps knocking off and you must keep cycling the switch to make it start charging again.I do n't know why I am asked to AGAIN rate this item . IT does not get any better ! I already rated it.Again ... ... ... ... this charger just keeps turning off even BEFORE it has fully charged my battery .	-1
I received a Black & Decker drill , and battery as a birthday gift and was surprised that the only way to charge the battery was while it was attached to the drill . I did charge the battery one time while it was in the drill , but stayed on top of the charging time and did find that the `` dumb '' battery charger would start to heat up the battery while in the drill.Either the built-in charger in the drill is defective , or just `` dumb '' with no automatic shut-off once the battery is fully charged . Overcharging and excessive heat will destroy batteries . So , after reading all of the specifications that I could find about Black & Decker chargers , I purchased this one.Information about Black & Decker chargers is non-existent on the Black & Decker website , as is information about their batteries . I gained most of my knowledge on Amazon and from other reviewers to insure I was buying the right charger for my new Black & Decker batteries.This charger arrived yesterday , and I read the pamphlet and checked that the batteries fit . So far so good . It fits the battery in the drill , plus the extra battery that I bought . The pamphlet states that you can leave your battery in the charger to maintain it in a fully charged condition . DO N'T DO IT ! The charger I received did not shut down to a `` maintainance '' level once the battery was fully charged , but kept right on charging . Once I detected the battery heating up , I took the battery out of the charger . This charger is no better than the built-in charger that came in the drill .	-1
I have several B & D ; outdoor 18-volt products and the batteries wear out pretty fast . I wanted a charger that would charge one battery as I work with the others . The charge light blinks when it is charging and is steady when the battery if fully charged . The product description states `` less than 90 minutes '' for a complete charge.I have charged about a dozen 18V batteries with this charger . The average time from when the battery is first inserted until the blinking charge light goes steady indicating a full charge IS ABOUT 3 HOURS 15 MINUTES.Since this charger is made for 9.6 volt to 18 volt , I believe the `` LESS THAN 90 MINUTES '' is referring to the 9.6 volt batteries . The 18 volt batteries take more than twice that long.The stock black charger than came with the products takes about 6 hours to charge an 18 volt battery , so this charge IS faster -- about twice as fast . But the `` less than 90 minutes '' statement does not apply to the large 18 volt batteries -- just so you 're aware.Whether it 's worth $ 25 to charge a battery in 3 hours instead of 6 , you 'll have to decide . For me , I was a little disappointed that the charging takes more than twice as long as what was advertised .	-1
I tried dowelmax and it worked well , but I could not justify the price for my applications . Finally I picked up Jessem dowel jig over dowelmax . IMO , Jessem is better than , at least as good as dowelmax but much cheaper . When you are looking for a decent dowel jig , you may want to look at both jigs to make a decision .	-1
This item is obsolete . It works only with incandescent lamps which are no longer manufactured . Even if you still happen to use incandescent lamps in your house , the days are numbered as far as this switch working properly for you . I had to remove a dozen of these from my house and replace . Get the new Insteaon versions which are backwards compatible with X10 or consider switching to zwave ( zwave is unfortunately not compatible with x10 so you 'd be starting over . )	-1
UPDATE : not long after my purchase of these , Amazon gave a full refund and recommended that I destroy these rather than return them . I put the cables in the trash but not before cutting both items apart multiple times to be sure no poor soul found them in the trash and tried to use them.the quality of the plug and sockets , and the quality of the wire , is very good . the fact that hot and neutral are reversed is very , very bad . this is NOT UL CERTIFIED . this is very probably illegal and worse than that , dangerous.if you are plugging in ubiquitous wall warts , cell phone chargers , etc . typical DC things that are not polarized , you 'll be fine . if you 're plugging in a toaster or any other thing that depends on polarity for safety , not so fine . it seems likely that most people will use this to plug in 2 wall warts at the same time , so no real harm there.I 'm not sure why these are still available for purchase given the obvious illegality and potential for harm , and more importantly the lack of UL sticker . but again some reviewers have said theirs tested fine , so it may be more a matter of which vendor.original review : maybe different vendors are shipping different ones . but thanks to the ( years ! ) earlier reviews mentioning about miswiring , I made sure to check mine with a meter before use . turned out both of the ones I received are wired incorrectly.this is not only dangerous , it most likely violates US law / UL / etc . at best you could likely kill whatever polarized device you plug in . at worst , fire , and ... how hard can it be to get the polarity right ? ! not just shoddy workmanship but literally dangerous . these are going back for refund.I hope more people test the ones they receive before using .	-1
I got this product based on the many positive reviews and was looking forward to using it , but for me it did not work . After only a few `` pokes '' the soil got stuck in the tubes and I had to clean them out with a screwdriver . I tried again with the same result . The soil was moist but not wet . Maybe it works with bone-dry soil , but in my region ( New England ) it rains more-or-less regularly year round so the soil rarely get that dry . I probably wo n't bother to return it , but I will definitely need to find another way to aerate my lawn .	-1
I purchased as an upgrade from the regular aerator thinking a coring model would be more beneficial . Come to find that it requires the right medium to work properly . unless your lawn is the right moisture it will either ; not penetrate or impact quickly . So perfect conditions are required . I went back to the regular aerator . Good luck predicting your lawn hardness between watering .	-1
I returned the product mainly because it does not fulfill my home painting needs , and it seems too cumbersome to use while on a step ladder . The paint hopper is huge , and it could block users view while spraying the paint . Looks like it 's ideal for painting ceilings .	-1
This abrasive cut-off saw consistently trips 20 amp circuits . After about 6 months of moderate use the clamp system broke . Do not but this saw ! ! ! !	-1
I had this saw for about a year and have made hundreds of cuts on everything from conduit to 1/4 inch thick square tubing . The original blade life was disappointing , but a quality aftermarket blade at my local saw sharpening service at approximately the same price ; it was still going strong after twice the work . The key to blade life is use some cutting lubricant ; stick wax is my choice since it tends to stay on the blade awhile . Another critical part of blade life is how the work is positioned in relation to the blade coming down . Feed rates vary with material and material thickness ; everything has its sweet spot . If it is fed too hard it may catch and tear off teeth , overheat and warp the blade where it catches . If the feed rate is n't fast enough it can also get hot and even cause the metal being cut to become hardened ( depending on the metal ) . A dry cut blade depends somewhat on every tooth cutting just the right amount of base metal which is cooler than chip the previous tooth cut away ; the chips carry away a lot of the heat . Too heavy of a feed will cause heat generated where the chip tears off the base metal to be conducted into the base metal and into the saw blade . Too light of a feed will cause the blade teeth to cause friction heating of the blade and base metal without the chips carrying heat away . Part of the problem with the OEM blade is the thin kerf which allows less effort on the part of the operator and the machine at the expense of longevity and blade run-out as it heats up.The good : The blade runs true even after hard use.The pivot does n't have much play after hard use.The D handle is comfortable and ergonomic allowing good controlThe vise has a quick release on the screw threadThe bad : The vise wo n't stay where it is positioned because the work clamping screw is offset from the back fence pivot . As it is tightened , it pivots the vise no matter how tight the back fence locking bolt is tightened with the provided bolt arrangement . 45 degree cuts are impossible to reproduce accurately . I even tried adapting a longer through bolt with a spacer to allow a real wrench to tighten it ; which worked a lot better but was n't the total solution.The spring loaded plunger that allows front to back movement of the vise does n't always hit the right spot to position the part being cut in relation to the blade.Milwaukee knows how to make a soft start ; this saw would be a good application.As the vise is pivoted , it moves support away from the blade . Proper support is critical for a good cut and safety.Bottom line : If you are only cutting 90 degree cuts that do n't need to be perfect , it is a good buy . If you are looking for something that will miter cuts consistently , this is n't a good buy ( put your money toward a cold saw ) .If Milwaukee really wanted to make this a great saw , they should copy the vise layout used on many cold saws where two vises are stationary and the saw pivots . I would certainly pay extra to have the part to be cut held properly and the cuts consistent .	-1
This ( not so `` Smart '' ) outlet will not work with most flat plugs since the plugs usually offset to the left . No surprise - as shown in the picture the adapter 's female plugs are oriented like all three-way plugs ( ground pin low ) on the left side of the adapter , but the adapter 's female plugs are flipped upside down on the right , meaning flat plugs can not be used on either side since there 's no room between the adapter and the wall . Goofy design . No center screw was provided even though it was designed to use one . Gave it two stars because it actually has real male plugs for both wall outlets , so if your upper and lower outlets happen to be on different circuits like mine are in some rooms , this adapter provides power to both banks - a lot of these 6-way outlets use a dummy plug for one of the males and wo n't allow this.The better design in this type of adapter has pivoting outlet banks on either side so a variety of plugs ( normal , offset flat plugs and ac/dc transformers ) can be used . This one did n't work for me since neither side accommodates my flat plugs .	-1
Just like another reviewer , I used this for 2 or 3 years with no problems , then recently I went to use it and it did n't work . Thinking somehow both bulbs had expired , I bought replacements bulbs , and it still did n't work . I took it apart and with a voltmeter determined the electronics inside failed somehow , unfixable by me . I think a work light should last much longer than 2 or 3 years , but that 's the trouble with electronics everywhere , the gizmotronics fail long before the lamps or the rest of the product .	-1
I have the Makita 6217DWDE 12-Volt NiMH 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit and one of the batteries started not holding a charge . So I brought it upstairs to my computer and typed in the model ( 1234 ) and found this page . They want $ 55 for the battery . You can buy the Makita 6217DWDE 12-Volt NiMH 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit with TWO of these exact batteries ( $ 110 purchased individually ) and that means the charger and drill itself cost $ 19.That 's just stupid.So I bought another kit . Instead of spending $ 55 for one battery , I spent $ 129 and now I have TWO drills , THREE good batteries and TWO chargers.In other words , unless you are flat broke , you 're better off buying another kit than you are just replacing a bad battery .	-1
Purchased Makita cordless impact driver , cordless drill and flashlight . Original two batteries made in Japan died after 4 years of heavy duty usage . I liked impact driver so I purchased replacement Makita battery which was made in China . I was worried when I got the battery . Well , I was right about worrying . Japanese cells are much better than Chinese cells . The replacement Makita made in China battery lasted only 2 years of light duty usage . Lately , my impact driver lacked power when I charged the battery . Today my charger said that the battery is damaged.I am really upset that Makita charges over $ 60 and now $ 70 for low quality made in China battery.I purchased Upstart battery rated at 3.3Ah instead of Makita 's 2.6Ah . I am big fan of Makita but battery does not measure up to Makita name .	-1
I am a professional carpenter . I have had my Makita saw for 24 years and wanted a change , The Bosch CS20 looked like it had some pretty good features and the balance was not bad . After 3 months the composite foot plate has warped making for gouged cuts . I can not cut a true 45deg bevel with it because of this flaw . The detents are not adjustable . My 45deg locks in at 43.5 deg . This is ubsat in my line of work . Bosch is going to send me another foot plate and bevel indicator but its the same material as the one I have . Bosch NEEDS to produce a replacement aluminum plate like all other quality saws have . They have missed the boat big time in this area . Based on this I would not recommend this saw for the serious tradesman .	-1
I read all the reviews then finally picked this one over the PCMag saw because if was $ 40 less.I loved using the saw at first . It has a great line of sight and is quiet and runs smooth . having an extra long cord is a awesome feature , but it did add $ 20 to the cost.but now after 6 months the base plate is warped making it a pain when cutting expensive oak plywood . It rocks from the back left to the front right over 1/8 '' .I put an email in to Bosch about a replacement plate but I am scared it will be the same thing and fail again after another 6 months.Should have spent a little more and got the PC .	-1
first one lasted 6 years , second one lasted 2. i do n't think that i 'll buy another of this brand . when the first one only lasted 6 years and i only use it about once a week ... i thought that was a bit short but not too bad . but the second one lasted only 2 years . that is a very short life for something that costs $ 200 . both dies the same way . they just wont reset and stopped working .	-1
On a ROCKWELL RADIAL SAW - MODEL 438 02 314 0509 @ 3450 rpm , this blade warps dramatically , leaving nearly a `` kerf ; it will naturally re-center after the cut [ when not in use = spin only ] but that does n't make the actual cutting any less defective . The saw was unplugged & the blade was re-secured three separate times just to be certain that there was no problem with the installation . We 've instructed to not replace this blade with another of the same , it is of no use to our firm . Once we have the refund [ if not sooner ] , we will purchase a different blade . Sincerely , CHOSENcontract.com	-1
At less than half the price of it 's Makita equivalent 60 tooth blade ( 792118-8 made in China ) and made in Italy by Freud - I thought to take a chamce on this for cutting Glue Lams with a Makita 5204NA Saw . Since the Makita ( $ 700 ) saw is a bit underpowered ( compared to the $ 4800 230V Mafell ) I thought that the combination - and thin ( 0.114 ) kerf on the Freud blade would help out . Unfortunately for me - the results were less than hoped for - and a belt sander was needed to clean-up the cuts . On the next job using the same saw and the Makita 60T blade which has a 0.109 kerf - results were much better .	-1
I do a lot with metal , and my first attempt with these had me very frustrated . I broke out my plasma cutter , and shelved the shears . I will try them again come spring , and hope for a different result .	-1
This piece of blank phenolic is 11 x 15 x 1/4 , not 11 x 15 x 1 as stated in the text with the product . It is also rectangular , not oval like the picture . I bought it for the purpose of making my own router table and table saw inserts , assuming that the size listed was a typo . It wo n't be good for either purpose , since my router table needs 3/8 '' thickness and the table saw needs 1/2 '' . But I wo n't be returning them , because I can envision a number of other good uses for the material , such as jigs , etc . The material I received is kind of a dirty white color , if it matters to anyone . It was very flat , which caused Amazon to pack it in an unusual way - just laying in the bottom of the box . If the shipping company had managed to puncture the box in any way , the product would have been scratched or gouged and unusable . My experience is that Amazon usually over-protects products , like books that are shrinkwrapped to a piece of cardboard inside a box filled with inflated pillows . Keep that in mind - you may have to return a damaged piece .	-1
Purchased the product which was highly rated , looks good , mounts easily.All of the high rating gave me nothing but a dissapointment.NOT ENOUGHG POWER , PERIOD . A SHEER WASTE OF MONEY.CLOGS TOO QUICKLY , AND THAT 'S THE FIRST TIME I USED IT . NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.ANTHONY , BURLINGTON , MASSACHUSETTS .	-1
I am disappointed with the instructions for mounting the vacuum and hose brackets to a wall . They only give you three screws but only give the instructions for `` lag bolts '' , which are not included . What gives ? I ca n't recommend this unit to anyone until someone can give me clear instructions on how to mount the vacuum brackets and the hose brackets .	-1
I ca n't explain why other reviewers say it 's quiet . It 's the loudest vacuum I have ever heard.Ever use those vacuums in car cleaning lots that you pay for with quarters ? It 's louder than those . Compared to my house vacuum , a Miele , it is about 10x louder.I hardly use the thing because it makes me nauseous .	-1
Do not buy . Suction is pathetic . Equivalent to a dust buster . On and off toggle switch could not have cost manufacturer more than a dollar . Hoover should be ashamed of themselves .	-1
This worked great the first time i used it . I bought this for sawdust and only for sawdust . I do n't give a damn what the inside of my Jeep looks like.After the first 2 cups of sawdust , the unit basically lost 75 % of it 's suction . Okay , the inner filter was clogged to all hell , but really , 2 cups ? that 's all it takes ? Probably works great for cars , but I do n't think this will cut it for a vacuum system for my garage/woodworking shop . Probably sell it to someone interested in a car vacuum and just buy a regular shop vac then figure out a way to rig that onto the wall . I like the wall mount aspect , that 's the whole reason i bought this .	-1
Had motor problems after 2 1/2 years of light use ( perhaps once/month ) . Filter was cleaned regularly and basket never more than 20 % full at any time . Ultimately replaced it with a different garage vac . Given all the positive reviews , I can only guess I had the one bad one in the batch . ; )	-1
This kit failed to tell how to DISINFECT the faucet end BEFORE one took water sample in order to make the bacterial test legitimate . I got a positive on the bacteria , which scared me . BUT , it came out negative when the local public health re-did it . The Public Health kit requires firing ( sterilizing ) the faucet with a barbecue or cigarette lighter before ANY testing , AND to run the water for 10-15 minutes before taking samples for any test.This kit does not give any such instructions , not even to run the water for a while . Since this is a water well test , the idea is to get the sitting water out of both your holding tank and your pipes by running for a while . That way you 'll get to the `` real '' water as it comes from your well.If you use this kit , without doing the above 2 things , your results will not be accurate , and you 'll have to pay the regular price for a pro re-testing ! ( over $ 100 in my area )	-1
Yes , The Worst tool ever by DEWALT . It will kill your fully charged battey in less than 20 min . If you go straight cuts fine , but the minute you put pressure on the blade because you want to correct the line ... it will stop because it has no torque at all . I bought one and send it back to amazon , so i will say do n't buy it ... it will go back in 2 days ... a real waist of time.I have to say.. the idea is great but only if it works ...	-1
Do not bother , these simply do not last at all well , and are worse now than the smaller units that came with my drill . They start off so well , you actully have hope for improvement , but the satisfaction is very short lived , and within a year they simply fail to give you much working time . Not worth it .	-1
I purchased this battery at March 14 , 2010 . In last 2-3 months it started to show signs of weakening - quickly self discharging and ca n't hold capacity well . Yesterday , after full owernight charge with specified original charger , it was only to able to drive 3 screws into plywood.Very shame for a battery made in japan and costing $ 60 ! Just for comparison , in January I bought Black & Decker FS130 battery ( which is same as dewalt , but 1.2ah capacity ) and it still works flawlessly !	-1
For what these Dewalt Battery Packs cost , they should at least meet their rated life . We have never gotten the kind of battery life that the ratings would make you expect . And neither has anyone else that we know . We are switching to Porter Cable , Bosch , Rigid and Ryobi . For the Dewalt cordless that we have , we are going to try non-Dewalt replacements as they can not be any worse and they are a heck of a lot cheaper .	-1
Nicads are getting cheaper and cheaper because they are n't as good as Lithium Ion batteries that are becoming the popular battery . Lithium batteries have many advantages over the old Nicad batteries , they hold their 100 % power to the end , which Nicads slowly lose their power . Lithium batteries are lighter , the Nicads are really heavy . Lithium Ion batteries keep their charge better when not in use , offer more power , and do n't have `` memory '' problems . They last longer than NiCads , too . I think it 's dishonest of this Amazon seller not to mention that these are NiCad batteries , although I can understand why he would do it , he 's hoping people wo n't realize there is a difference so he can make higher profits . VERY dishonest , in my opinion ! I have both the XRP Nicad , and the smaller lithium ion Dewalt batteries , and the Lithium Ion batteries are far superior , let alone making your cordless tools much lighter . It costs much more to make Lithium Ion batteries , and thus a higher selling price , but you get what you pay for .	-1
The product came with a label stating it was & # 34 ; USED but LIKE NEW & # 34 ; . I paid for New ! ! ! What does that even mean ? ?	-1
I have a DeWalt corded drill and a plate jointer -- I like them both . One battery on this cordless failed after only one month . The gears also sound like they are about to fail- a lot of clunking when the trigger is released . I also have a 15.6 V Panasonic -- it beats the DeWalt in every way . I wanted to buy American . The DeWalt is made in Mexico . I 'm sorry I bought it .	-1
I finally am able to remove this piece of junk from my truck and replace it with something else . I 've been a user of DeWalt and their cordless tools for some time , and generally love their products , but this one is a terrible joke . DeWalt makes fantastic tools ; they need to buy these junk radios back and put out a better designed jobsite radio .	-1
The sound is comparable to a $ 20 boombox ( which would likely include a CD player ) . The digital tuner is just mystifying . You turn it to go up ( or down ) the dial , and 1/2 the time , it goes the opposite direction . Sometimes it just leaps to a random point at the other end of the dial.There is no scan feature to offset this voodoo.When a station does eventually get dialed in , the reception is usually not very good . The clearest signal ( not to be confused with a clear signal ) is usually a click or 2 off the station 's actual broadcast frequency . As often as not , I end up settling for a station I 'd rather not listen to , or turn the thing off altogether.This is an oversized , overpriced , battery charger . It comes with a radio so bad that it 's a wonder any manufacturer would even allow it to leave the factory.NOTE : This is a review of the DEWALT DC011 Heavy-Duty Worksite Radio Charger . Amazon has combined reviews of this product with the DEWALT DW9109 1-Hour NiCad Vehicle Charger ( 7.2-Volt - 18.0-Volt ) . The DC011 will not charge a battery from a vehicle . The DW9109 does not have a radio .	-1
Dewalt , what were you thinking ? This thing is way to expensive for a portable radio , and it 's way too expensive for a charger , but maybe for the convenience of both together ... ... However it is severely limited as a portable radio . The batteries run down over the weekend when the thing is turned OFF . It 's no good on a job site - at least not for very long . I 'll put it in the shop and use it for a VERY expensive plug-in radio , but I have no Dewalt products in the shop so the charger is useless . Dewalt , I expected better from you . Do n't get very far from your extension cord with this thing . Not recommended !	-1
the dc011 looks neat and is undoubtedly durable , however , my new dc011 only picked up 2 radio stations when even my cheap clock radio with no antennae can pick up many times that amount . i used to like dewalt , but their products are getting worse each year . i think they are riding on their success of past years and have pretty much quit trying . i 'm going to find another brand to start using .	-1
I purchased this item so I can listen to music , during the Spring and Summer , in my back yard . I have owned DeWalt products and have always been satisfied with their performance . Let me state that the radio tuner in this unit is crap ! It fades in and out of the tuned frequency . The Knob feels loose . The power drains from my Dewalt 18 volt battery even when the radio is not being used . I have to freshly charge the NiCad to keep it playing for the whole day.The unit works well with my MP3player and it is well constructed . But Again , the radio is Crap !	-1
Got one for Christmas on sale for a real low price at local hardware store . Took it back the next day . Why ? It will not charge lithium batteries just the nicads . What every one else has said about this radio is probably right . Another thing , I have a preferance for Dewalt ; makes charging the same batteries easy . But what I do n't get is why a lithium battery charger can charge both a lithium and a nicad battery but a nicad charger ca n't charge a lithium battery . Anyway , I 'm not going to keep this radio if it ca n't charge both . If you 're sold on buying a DeWalt radio buy the newer model . More money but will change both .	-1
Durable and hi-tech design functions well overall , but battery life issues others report are all too real . And , where is the CD player ? What were they thinking ? Needs a little more work to be a tool I 'd want to keep , so mine went back . Hit Wally World on the way back to the jobsite for a & lt ; $ 50 replacement with better sound quality but sans charger . I did n't really need another charger anyway .	-1
Looks good and works good , but the keyless blade holder is a poor design . The blade in mines is very wobble and I had to send it to a factory center.Got it back and after several uses wobbles again . Wont buy Dewalt recipro saw again .	-1
This is a good saw for a home owner or occasional use around the yard , etc but I would not recommend it for regular use . The motor is powerful enough for most jobs , and while the 4 way blade change system is convenient , it often does n't work . The release mechanism will only work at the beginning of the stroke so you sometimes have to slowly run the motor to just the right position to change the blade . The locking pin often locks up and has to be persuaded with a screwdriver to lock in place . this takes all of the convenience out of the quick change system . My quick change system was ruined after cutting through some slightly damp boards , which was enough to cause some surface rust to creep up on the blade change mechanism , preventing it from locking at all , I can now only change blades by taking the entire head apart , and even then it will only lock in the sideways position and not the vertical . If you are a contractor or pro , spend the extra money to invest in a heavy duty Milwaukee sawzall .	-1
So typical of both Hammond and Parts Express , no dimensions provided . Go to Hammond 's web site , no such product . Go to Parts Express website , no dimensions .	-1
The basic design is fine , but the manufacturing quality of this tool is poor . Mine arrived defective with an incorrectly-threaded barrel adjustment screw . Hopefully , the replacement will not be a lemon .	-1
Imagine getting a little box full of rattling parts , among which is a magnifying glass . I thought it was all broken before I opened it , just from the rattling . Well , the lens is scratched but I can live with that . But the small box has all the pieces like wing nuts and base loose , with no instructions for putting it together . Completely unassembled . I 'm sure I can figure it out , but the idea that they shipped all of this in a loose box bouncing around says so much about the manufacturer and the seller.I would n't do business with them again , and I 'll put up with the scratches because I need this by Thursday . Additionally , it arrived a day later than was projected.I hope you find this review helpful !	-1
It came quickly but the magnifying glass came right off when I got it . Screws stripped already and could n't tighten at all . I had to used some tape to use it . But it was cheap not to bother returning .	-1
I do not recommend this because it is too small and cheaply made . I bought it as a present and was embarrassed to give it to her .	-1
Well least it was cheap , and there in lies the problem you got just that , a cheap useless toy that ca n't be be used for real work . I laughed when i pulled it out off the box . Threw it into the junk draw of life . Do n't waste your money or time with that nonsense .	-1
I have one of these I used for about 15 years probably from Radio Shack when Radio Shack was that kind of store . Went to RS to replace they had a cheap looking product like this for $ 29.99 . Went on amazon and seen this was low priced . I was even sent 2 of them by error . They are very cheaply made . Feel apart before each was out of the box . Beware Chinas worst .	-1
I only use this for soldering small wire . It 's OK , but it 's a lot smaller than it looks in the photo ( my fault , the dimensions are on the Amazon page ) . The base is weighted , but it 's so tiny that it tips easily . Like another reviewer said , you have to use the magnifying glass as a counter-balance to keep the thing upright . You need to plan to attach it to a board or workbench to use it . Cheap , though .	-1
This Amazon purchase was the worst clone I 've ever seen , so I had to return it . It was so badly made , it was comical and at least made me laugh . Its is not the item pictured on the link . I 've posted comparison photos of the 'original ' versus the bad Amazon vendor sold copy so future buyers can beware . I rarely return Amazon purchases , but for this item , I had too.In a nutshell the key problems shown in the photos are:1 . Alligator clips are friction held rather than tightened by thumb screws , so they are easy to dislodge . The original design could hold firmly with a simple thumbscrew + wingnut . Squeezing the metal wo n't help ; repeated movements of the clip will fatigue the metal , and it will inevitably dislodge again.2 . The metal is thinner than the original , increasing its rate of fatigue . The thinner metal reduces the weight further of the original design . The diameter of many parts are even smaller including the already small thumbscrew and wingnuts of the original design , that was already inconvenient to use.3 . The base weight has been reduced by ~ 1/3 , and is so poorly cast , metal flakes were flaking off it.4 . The magnifying glass was of similar quality as the original , no optical aberrations , but the frame was of thinner metal that I half expected the lens to fall off.Note , the original design is still worth buying , but make sure the clips are held by thumb screws , and the base metal weight is cast smoothly at all corners , and not uneven as photographed.I 've used helping hands for over 20 years . Its so cheap , that whenever I think I need another , I pick one up . Its ranged from $ 3-10 , and the 'originals ' had made in Taiwan stamped on them . I frankly do n't know who invented these , but its been copied by so many manufacturers , the main difference is the quality of whatever clone construction you pick up.An advantage it has over PanavisePanaVise Model 201 `` Junior '' Miniature Visebeyond price , is that its small enough to put inside some equipment under repair , its metal so when soldering there is no risk of melting plastic parts as in some Panavises , and multiple cheap helping hands can do what a large Panavise is meant to do and more.If you need more weight pick up a $ 3 5 # weight plate Olympic-Style Plates - 5 Lb . ( EA ) from any sports store and zip tie it to the base , to provide more leverage and stability .	-1
this was a good Idea but this is useless clips keep falling off the base is to small keeps tipping over . need to bolt base to work bench or something and have better clips . bought this over a year ago and used it once have not had time to rig something up to this so I can use it . I think if it had a bigger wider base this would work better .	-1
not much more . expect to spend a lot of time fiddling with it . the arms rarely stay where you put them for any length of time , it gets real tippy without extreme contortions . it has its uses but in one sentence let 's say it 's an amateur tool for sparing use . I have a lighted magnifying hood and a panavise jr. mounted to a 5 lb weighted base that 's the bomb for this . If only the panavise had two arms I 'd chuck this thing where it belongs .	-1
The two clips work well enough , but the magnifying glass is too heavy and unless positioned just so , can cause the whole business to tip over . It 's too hard to tighten and loosen the retaining bolt for the glass for adjustment . Finally , the glass was loose in the frame and fell out . Easy enough to push back in , but I finally just removed it entirely and use just the two clips . If there 's a version without the glass for less money , I would recommend that over this one .	-1
I bought this for model making . It just is n't stable . It flops over and the clips are terrible and just do n't hold on to anything . I need to replace this with something stronger and sturdier .	-1
My glass was chipped . The base is too light / small to hold anything remotely substantial without tipping over . The unit is also difficult to adjust . Lastly , I do n't have 20/20 eyesight and I can see better *without* it .	-1
This is , outside of things that are DOA , the worst product I have ever purchased on amazon . I have experienced similar problems to other buyers mainly that what I received was not a `` Helping Hands with Magnifying Glass '' but a box of parts . I have no problem with a little bit of assembly , but there are absolutely no instructions , the image on the amazon page is only barely enough to decipher how this device is put together , and most people wo n't have enough fingers to reliably construct this . In fact , you 're better off ordering another set of helping hands just so you can put this together ! Once it 's finally assembled , it works fine but skip ordering this and save yourself 30 minutes of needless frustration . For this price , there are plenty of other good options . If you are enough of an idiot to order this despite negative reviews ( like I was ) , attach the hands to the base in reverse to get a little more stability from it.Unlike other sellers , I my magnifying glass did arrive with a cover so there were no scratches.DO NOT ORDER ! I have purchased hundreds of products of amazon and wrote about half that many reviews .	-1
Took about 26 days to arrive.One of the alligator clips was bent . Had to use pliers to tighten . I had one from Radio Shack years agothat was better mechanical quality . The magnifying glass on this is OK .	-1
This works `` ok '' at best . It 's better than not having one , and so for $ 5 , I guess it 's not terrible , but the arms fall off A LOT . They 're just rounded sheet metal . I have to often tighten them with pliers , then push them back on . Terrible design . Better designed ones do n't fall off . Ever . And they do n't cost any more than this one . Look closely in the picture and you can see the way the aligator clips attach to the base . Save yourself frustration and get a different one .	-1
It 's not really heavy enough to hold even a mini-computer board ( like an rpi or wandboard ) . The base is n't strong enough.If you want to use this for soldering I think is a poor choice . Better to get something with a large base and really strong clamps .	-1
I just received a case of 15 of bulbs from Light-Bulbs PLUS and they do not look like this . The bases are silver not brass . The printing is black , not green . there is no dot-matrix or laser production code such as the one in the reference photo I am uploading . Instead , the bulbs looked hacked together in some back alley . Green gunk and mysterious damage and holes in the lamp bases . Some of the threads were so poorly made that they would not screw into the lamp socket . Even the shipping box had strange surgery on it , with original labels hacked out in three places with clear packing tape covering the exposed corrugations . The weirdest thing I 've seen , really ! See my photo tour . Worse yet , this vendor wants to argue about it instead of issuing a refund . I think we know how that will be resolved .	-1
This is an amended review . I first used the tool outdoors in 40-50 degree days and found it close to dripless . At warmer temperatures and with the caulk more liquid , the gun is no more dripless than any other that I have used . The gun has some nice frills -- it is easier to clean than cheaper tools , it has a more convenient/useful cutter and puncture pin , etc. , but labeling it as dripless is pure bunk .	-1
Starret is an American company who 's products are top of the line . Except in this case . It is out of square by more than twice as much as the combination square this one was going to replace . The old one , a cheap $ 9.00 tool , is out of square by 1/64 & # 34 ; over 12 inches . This brand new $ 71.00 Starret is out of squre by 1/32 & # 34 ; over 8 & # 34 ; . The old one was spot on when it was new 15 years ago , but they wear over time just as this one did . I ca n't see spending nearly $ 100.00 for the Starret name only to receive a tool that can not serve its purpose.I did not check the ruler graduations for accuracy or precision . This tool is a square that is n't square so none of the other features is worth anything , either.Amazon , as always , was quick to respond and the item is being returned for a refund .	-1
Had to go back to the old fashioned way of painting as this power roller really just made more of a mess and was more hassle . Not sure if mine has bad O rings or if the design is poor . Leaks around the connections due to poor seals . We used brand new paint with normal viscosity coming right out of the can after proper mixing . Too bad , could have been a great time saver .	-1
DO NOT GET THIS PIECE OF JUNK ! It broke the first time i used it . wagner warenteed it , but that one broke too . is next to impossible to clean . AVOID	-1
I found this thing a pain to use and clean . Used it once and tossed it . Ended up buying a nice USA made Graco Sprayer for $ 300 that was such a pleasure to use and so fast , although clean up with that is a bit of a chore but not as bad as the Wagner roller .	-1
I have a multimeter which measures exact voltage of the battery and I also have analog battery tester which measures the capacity of the battery by its needle showing good , low or replace.. I read the review for this item and most reviews said that this is a great battery tester because it puts a load on the battery and it would register the real remaining capacity of the battery..so I 'd decided to purchased this for $ 32..I was so excited to received this and as soon I I got it , I tested several batteries..it would show the capacity of the battery by different color coded light and it woul correlate to different percentage from 20 percent being red light , 40 to 60 percent being yellow light , and 80 to 100 percent being green light..wow ! Nice colorful light show..but then I started experimenting -- check the same battery with this tester and then with the analog and then with the multimeter ... ... guess what.. There is no different..this item showed yellow light which is 60 percent , the analog meter which cost $ 3.00 showed just slightly below the line good..and the multimeter showed a voltage of 1.48 volt ... in conclusion , any battery tester works good..just in different way.. If you like a color coded lights , a word showing good , low or replace or if you want it in voltage measurements.. But this zts multi-battery tester is way too much money for battery tester..do n't waste your money.. If I did n't throw away the package , I would have return this back .	-1
The 110 work fine , but the USB quit working after the first time i used it , and the unit i received had both USB aside the top plug , not the the left as pictured here	-1
Sorry , but this is nearly double the price of MSRP . I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon but I 'll have to go elsewhere for this .	-1
Let me make it clear up front , I am a huge fan of Bosch tools and own several , including a sliding miter , a job site table saw with a gravity base , hammer drills , a saber saw and a trim router . I am pleased with all of them and made that clear in my reviews I have written about Bosch equipment . But , then there is this little tool.Of course , for a sander to work , you , first , have to mount sandpaper on it . This tool allows that . You just should n't turn the sander on and expect it to hold the sandpaper . That breaks the deal on this sander , unless you want to cut the cord off ( to get it out of the way ) and use the sander as a paper weight.In addition to drum sanders , stationary and portable belt sanders , I have about five pad sanders . My `` collection '' includes about five sanders ( Dewalt , Porter Cable , Bosch and Makita ) . As you might guess from that , I use finish sanders a lot . Because of that , I quickly learn if a given sander is worth having around . Subsequently , I learned the Bosch sander is a waste of space , or an expensive paper weight.I bought this on sale . It did n't hold paper then , so I returned it . The new or repaired one held paper better , but only for a short while . Now it 's back paperweight status , or maybe I 'll think of someone I do n't like and give it to them.The problem appears to be with the single , push lever , which seems unable to exert sufficient force to hold the paper under the extreme vibration produced by this [ or any ] sander .	-1
I had great expectation for this sander but the included vacuum adapter was the RS007 for a 19mm hose , not the RS006 adapter for American sized hoses . The Bosch web site says the RS006 adapter is included but it 's not in the package . The I 'm not going to order the adapter ( at extra cost ) , so it 's going back .	-1
I stuffed this sander in a drawer shortly after I bought it because the front gripper failed to hold the securely . The concept is wonderful but in practice , it makes the tool frustrating to use . The sand paper falls off after less than a minute of sanding . Either that or the rubber gripper on the front clamp comes off.Recently , I 've started using it again . I spray the back of the sandpaper with 3M 77 adhesive before attaching it . Voila , it works . I like the sander but I can not believe they are still selling this tool given the faulty design .	-1
I had nothing but problems with this unit and eventually threw it away ( wish I had read the reviews and called Kiddie to get it replaced ) . If the power went out , it would alarm . If I used hairspray two rooms away , it would alarm . If I used the stove or something burned on a unit , it would alarm . The final straw was during a power outage at about 2:00 am when it went off and , not knowing what to do , I called 911 and had the fire department come out . There was no explosive gas or CO at all . It was just blaring for no reason .	-1
I could live with the few false alarms we had with our unit - but in January , when a knob on our natural gas stove had been left partially `` on '' - I came home to a house sickeningly filled with gas - and the Nighthawk blithely read `` 0 PPM '' . No alarm - not a peep . It was by the Grace of God that my house did n't explode when I flipped on the light switch before I smelled the gas . An hour after opening all the doors and windows , our utility technician arrived - and her `` gas sniffer '' went crazy - it was still reading 4 % concentration of gas . I 'm sure the initial concentration had been 3+ times that much.If my light switch had sparked - I could have been killed . For this unit to NOT have sounded any kind of alarm is truly scary .	-1
I 've had this gas and CO alarm for approximately 18 months now . The alarm has gone off many times in the past several weeks and it seems to be getting worse . Ever since I bought it we have been getting the occasional alarm from various sources . If my wife puts on perfume ... BEEP ! BEEP ! BEEP ! Pass gas ... BEEP ! BEEP ! BEEP ! Spray gel for hair ... BEEP ! BEEP ! BEEP ! Cook the pizza a little too well done ... BEEP ! BEEP ! BEEP ! I 'm about to chuck it into the garbage . I just ca n't trust it.I see there are many other such reviews also . As far as I 'm concerned ... it 's a `` POS '' and a waste of money . Do n't buy it !	-1
I do n't know how many times we had false alarm with this unit . I just thanked our fire department right before I decided to give this bad feedback . I own this unit for 2 years , thinking that Kidde is a good brand for alarm for CO or natural gas , but there were too many false alarms . Most of the time you change the battery and reset the unit , it 'll stay quiet , but you always never know if it 's real or not . This last false alarm that I called the fire department for , went off 5 or 6 times after resetting , changing the batteries and so forth . The fire department checked our premises , and completely zero reading while this alarm kept going off for gas at 228 , which is quite a high level . This caused us to evacuate the place ( including the dogs ) , call the fire department , and the fire department to come over by the huge fire truck for nothing , and this wans't the first time . I 'm so sick and tired of this alarm , and will invest in a better alarm . Do n't recommend at all .	-1
For me this is another Lost , it never work as described , it keeps beeping every say 3-5 mins . saying low battery power when plug into AC outlet . Pricey too its now maybe I just got the luck of one that do not works as describe , so I 'm not sure if I would really call it JUNK , unless other people experience the same issue then I would agree.Ras ... ..	-1
I purchased three of these for Hallowe'en party lighting on 10/5 . After using them for the party , we put one up on a bookshelf in my son 's room to enhance his glow-in-the-dark solar system . We used it every night for about a month , and it died . The bulb was fine -- I tested in another fixture . We put a second unit in his room , and it lasted about a week ( dead today 11/28 ) . Same deal : bulb fine , fixture dead . I 'm guessing these have really , really cheap ballasts . I would not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else .	-1
I 've put the purchase of these clamps off due to the price . I have Bessey Uniclamps and K-Body 's and have never had a complaint . I decided to pull the trigger on these . Yes the money for two of them stings , especially when considering they are simply clamps , but they will last my woodworking time , then probably whoever would get them after that.They lock incredibily easy in that you simply slide the jaw to the bottom of what you want to clamp and are set to `` cam over '' as vise grips do . When releasing , the side extended release bar certainly saves your fingers as opposed to the older style of vise grip.Aug 2010 : They are a stout clamp , but I do n't use them enough to warrant the purchase . Due to the short throat , they are more limited in range than I thought . I use them for clamping things to the benchtop , but that 's about it . I 've also discovered that you have to hold them pretty tight when you close the clamp or it closes fairly loose . Does n't matter how good they are if you spend this much money on something that has limited use . Must confess that I have some buyers remorse due to the cost . I have since sold them and recovered most of my money . I do n't miss them .	-1
DO NOT BUY this item until AMAZON reviews and corrects their inventory.The item I received is not a LEATHERMAN product , it is a very cheapknock off of the kind you find in the `` DOLLAR '' stores . And it looks tome to be deliberate fraud . The box is labeled Leatherman 830039 New WaveMultitool , but it most certainly not a Leatherman product box , nor isthere a Leatherman stamp on the item itself . I will be returningthe one I received today , and I guess I 'll have a problem trusting AMAZON'Sfullfillment organization in the future . I have never before received afraudulent item from AMAZON .	-1
I returned this Leatherman 8300939 New Wave Multitool for the simple reason that when I opened the blade fully , used it and then went to unlock the blade , the unlock mechanism would not release the blade . When I went to reorder a multitool , I read more of the comments from others and found that some were claiming that Leatherman was no longer maintaining the quality standards of days of yore . Thus , I have since acquired a SOG and a Gerber multitool , neither of which has had a problem requiring return of the product . Thanks to Amazon 's return policy , the return was easy .	-1
This tool does not feel good in your hand . I do n't like it ... It feels cheap.My friend bought the Gerber tool . We traded and both agreed the Gerber Freehand feels and looks better .	-1
I was really excited when I first got my Leatherman Blast . It seemed perfect for me . It was relatively small and light ( definitely pocketable , I could carry it comfortably without a sheath ) , it had what seemed like my ideal tool loadout , it was fairly inexpensive , it was a Leatherman so I was sure it would be a quality tool , everything locked , and I even liked the hybrid Zytel construction because it made the handles very comfortable . As a bonus , the price was also very reasonable ( I think I paid $ 40 for mine ) . In short , I thought I 'd found my ultimate multitool . I was very excited to get it , especially after mostly carrying a Juice KF4 for a number of years . Locking tools , heavy duty pliers ( the same plier head as the Wave in fact ) , scissors , and even a bottle opener , comfortable handles that actually fit my hands , what was n't there to like ? Well it turned out this tool had a fatal flaw that lead it to disappoint me at almost every turn . I did n't think twice about whether the Blast was well constructed because I 'd already had 2 Leatherman tools in the past ( the original PST , and that Juice KF4 ) , and though the Juice had shortcomings ( the PST I had to give away to my dad to replace one of his tools I 'd lost ) they were both basically impossible to break . Not so a Zytel Leatherman though . Its not that the Zytel itself is a bad material , its just that it fails to keep the Leatherman handles rigid enough when you twist with the tool . This caused my Blast to fall apart over time . The screwdrivers tended to slip , and I eventually chipped the large driver blade while turning a screw ( and in particle board ! ) . Worse , one of the fasteners that holds the tools into the handle managed to work itself loose , and though I tried to remember to screw it back in , eventually it fell out and I lost it . At that point , all the tools in one handle were only semi-usable . I know Leatherman would have repaired or replaced the tool if I sent it in , but the problem also would have repeated itself . Originally I also complained that the Blast could not cut the `` sign wire '' I use at work ( actually 7 strand stainless steel fishing leader I do n't know what the test weight is ) , because I was extremely disappointed that something with a much heavier pliers head than my KF4 still had such a tough time cutting the stuff ( and that certainly added to my overall disappointment with the product ) , but I now know the issue is simply 7 strand steel fishing line gives most bypass style MT cutters trouble ( it tends to slide between the cutters ) .Anyway , it turns out there 's a reason why Leatherman got rid of their Zytel tools , they 're not rigid enough , and in the longer term , this means they 're not strong enough . The Blast disappointed me so badly , it almost soured me on the Leatherman brand , but I gave them one more shot because my most likely alternative ( Gerber ) did n't make anything as cheap as the options available from Leatherman , so the following Christmas I got the new Rebar ( which is a MUCH stronger design ) , and I absolutely love it . Incidentally , even though its mostly the screwdrivers that will cause a Zytel Leatherman like the Blast to fall apart , I still think the lower end Fuse and Kick were good ideas because they were extremely light , very inexpensive , and most of the people who would be likely to buy one probably use them lightly enough that they would be nearly as long lived as a regular Leatherman , while the Blast , with its great tool loadout was more likely to appeal to a slightly more serious user like myself who could wreck such a tool in a pretty short time frame ( unfortunately , it only took me about 8 months to break that driver and handle ) . Anyway , Leathreman did correct their mistake by replacing all 3 of their hybrid Zytel tools with MUCH stronger designs . The Rebar essentially replaced the Blast ( the tool loadout is somewhat different , but not only is the Rebar much , much stronger its even a bit lighter ) , and the Wingman and Sidekick replaced the Fuze and Kick . Granted , the Wingman and Sidekick are quite a bit heavier than the Fuze and Kick , but they are also MUCH stronger ( I know I bought a Wingman for the Tackle box ) . So anyway , the concept behind the Blast was worth a try , but there 's definitely a reason why they were discontinued . If you see one for sale , steer clear . Unfortunately they are easy to break .	-1
This tool is made up of roughly 33 % plastic.I was surprised of the lack of quality in this Leatherman tool.Avoid this one at all costs.Are the people who left positive reviews for this item nuts ? Since when was it acceptable for a multi-tool ( even the $ 5.00 ones ) to be made with plastic ? ? ? ?	-1
Leatherman user since 1988 . At least the original PST made in Mexico ( stamped made in USA ) had some decent metal . Apparently the blades were made in Asia and the pliers in Mexico , then assembled in USA which makes their claim legal but not ethical.. Old story everyone knows or should by now with the California lawsuit.This is the third screwdriver failure . The metal just crumbles . Only good for very light duty . The original PST had much better metal . too bad as it was just getting broke in after having been replaced.The lanyard ring , can opener and other parts I have no use for have held up just fine . Why do they include this crap . The file is okay as is the saw -- handy . The eyeglasses screwdriver is handy in a pinch . The phillips is okay.My PST screwdriver is still great after nearly a generation of use . Pliers are worn out but thats expected with the usage they 've had.Sure they take them back , but why not put some good metal in them in the first place and actually save some bucks .	-1
There is no perfect multi-tool . Only multi-tools that different people find different uses for . Just like with the Swiss Army Knife.My one major gripe is that the original tool models have been left behind . So , you make a few changes , the tools are safer , more comfortable , stronger ... ..great ! Now what about those of us who just have n't been able to keep up with the Jones ? I still have the original Leatherman PST . And since I 've also got the original Gerber Multi-Plier , this applies to that company also.How about reverse engineering some of these new attachments to work with the older model tools , and making them cross-compatible with other models in your line ? I want to be able to buy this kit , and use it with all my Leathermans ; from the Juice , to the Kick , to the PST , et cetera . I just ca n't go out and buy every new tool attachment that you release , the same way I ca n't go out and buy every configuration of the Swiss Army Knife.And if you should happen to wear out a specific bit ( like a Phillips ) , you have to buy another whole set of bits just to replace the one . Why do you think those multi-piece drill/driver kits all come with duplicates of the popular bits ? What if I only want a Phillips ? At least offer the option of buying the bits piece by piece , as opposed to the whole set.This sucks . Know why ? We do n't need this . Just give us a bit adapter . Bit adapters that will accept 1/4 '' & 3/8 '' bits.The original Leatherman PST had a tool adapter that accepted 1/4 '' bits . Not fancy proprietary bits that only work on select Leathermans . All that I had to do was slip on the tool adapter , and use any bit I wanted to from my drill/driver bit collection . I did n't have to buy a set of proprietary bits . I did n't have to carry around a set of proprietary bits.Leatherman 65010301K Standard Tool Adapter for Super Tool 200 , PST , PST II ,	-1
It appears that this clip was made in China . Poor grade steel . It snapped apart within the first week of use . I like the idea , just wish the quality was better . It was not worth the cost of shipping to send it back to Leatherman for yet another inferior attachment replacement . Buyer Beware !	-1
Have not used this item yet . Was planning on purchasing another Leatherman but have not gotten around to it yet	-1
Leatherman needs to wake up as a company . What 's with the new-found love for Velcro ? What happened to the old fashioned snap-button closures ? The ones that do n't wear out after a few months of normal use and make about 1/6th the noise when you engage them ? And is the sheath about twice the size of the old-style Wave sheath ? Yes , to hold all the bits that you might use once a year . Still better than the leather version . Sad to see that Leatherman , Oakley and the rest of them are trying to fix things that definitely were not broken .	-1
This is an insignificant item and I am only reviewing it to point out the important problem with dust control.I got onto the www with the idea of a simple upgrade from my screaming Sears vac . Instead I found a huge amount of fairly alarming and potentially expensive dust control informaton . The health risk factors are evidently more critical than we thought.It turns out that dust control hoods on devices like planers should have at least 4 '' and hopefully 5 '' connections . The volumn of shavings and dust is just too much for the typical shop vacuum to keep up with unless you clean the filter continually and have some kind of cyclonic pre-vac seperator.So , dust hoods should be standard and they should be compatible with the best dust collection machinery and methods.I agree with the overwhelming number of reviewers who think the Makita planer itself is a great machine , but the dust hood really needs some work . *******Updated review 3/29Since the initial review I have modified my dust collection system with a Fein vac and a system of tubes , blast gates , etc . Before I just hooked up my shrieking Sears shop vac directly . I now use a tapered connector from the hood to the hose and that has made a big difference . I do not think the Fein is any more powerful . In any event , all the chips are being evacuated properly . It seems that the hood requires a perfect , smooth connection to work properly . So , now I will upgrade this a couple of stars , but the use of a weird outlet size that requires odd or home-made connectors is still bad and so 3 stars it is . Hmm , ca n't change the stars . Oh , well .	-1
The tool bag is nice but I felt it was over rated for the function . Mainly used it for onsite repairs of networks and telephone systems but found that although it was a nice looking , strong built bag , it was difficult to find my tools in the shadows of the zipper pull down . I also did n't like the way it carried , it felt unbalanced . I switched back to a cheap $ 25 dollar aluminum case from HD which I have to replace every year because they fall apart .	-1
I purchased pump to run my aquaponics garden and the pump stopped working in a month . No help , no replacement .	-1
The greatest con is that after you leave the motion area , the light stays on for a very long time . I timed it , and one time it stayed on for 54 minutes . It basically kept me up at night .	-1
The idea seems alright but the tool , especially a heavier tool like a drill , bounces in the bungee when you walk . The plastic belt clip also feels like it digs into your waist . The big lug hook is better because you do n't have to search for the holder ( especially while wearing a coat ) like with this one although the hook is a pain sometimes because it tends to catch on things when it is empty . The big lug 2 obviously does not have this problem.All in all , it 's ok but the bouncy tool thing is the worst part of it .	-1
I thoroughly tested the bigg lugg 2 for about two weeks and the bottom line is , the product is a great concept but in reality does not work well at all . The bungees stay wrapped around your tool and the holder stays on your belt . the bungees on the toolhad to be adjusted to fit the tool into their tool cases , which became a headache real fast . I tested the bungees on makitas 14.4v impact driver , milwaukees v28 hammer drill and the paslodeangled finish nailer . On all but the finish nailer the bungee was always in the way of my normal grip on the tool , you grip the tool and the bungee becomes part of the grip handle-very uncomfortable.The manufacturer recomends that for lefties you position the ball to the right and for righties the opposite . This does not work well at all as positioning the ball anywhere but the dead back of the tool forces the tools bit to dig right into your leg as it hangs , and dead back position prevents you from gripping the tool , also if you ever switch hands for use , the ball prevents you from grabbing the tool and you have to swing the ball to the other side of the tool , not at all user friendly.That was enough to nix this product for me but there is more.You will notice that with the bungees your tool swings to and fro as you walk to the point of annoyance , especially with the paslode nailer attached , and dont jump or hop over anything the ball will pop right out of the holder and let your tool come crashing to the ground.As I said earlier when the day is over you will need to re-position the bungees to get your tools to fit in their cases.I went back to big lugg 1 `` the hook '' it is far superior in function to the bungees .	-1
Bought this tool along with a couple of others on the strength of the Hyde brand , but was very disappointed when it started to show rust spots after 3 weeks of working with compound . Rust , really ? ? Maybe my expectations were too high , but my old generic brand 3-inch flex scraper was unblemished after 10 years of usage .	-1
I wanted to like this flashlight , and I did n't expect too much . All I wanted was a simple LED version of my old Jr model.Amazingly , this flashlight still uses the old ring-type Cree emitter ( I bought this new from Amazon ) . Most manufacturers got rid of that years ago . It produces the classic hated `` cree ring '' beam with an extra dim area surrounding the spot beam , then a sloppy thin bright ring outside of that , before finally producing the normal smooth flood area . Someone else already uploaded a beam picture more than 2 years ago , and the latest stock still looks like that , though in reality the spot beam looks worse ( the spot beam tends to wash out in photos , making it look more consistent than it is ) . The spot area is slightly lopsided and not consistent.The finish is a very fine matte texture which looks and feels like a quality product.The tail cap looks like it does n't fit on all the way . The back end of the body tube has a tapered-out area which makes it look like a perfect fit to match the width of the tailcap , but there is a gap between them.The only good reason I can think of to get this flashlight is if you want exactly the lumen output offered in order to use less battery power than other flashlights which tend to be brighter at the expense of battery life , though most of them have low or medium modes to accomplish that .	-1
Just like the mag light leds , the first time you drop the light is the last time it works right , it starts flickering which is very annoying.I now use the streamlight protac 2AA , have had great luck with that light minus it eating batteries	-1
These test leads are so poorly assembled that several of them had NO CONTINUITY AT ALL . The electrical connections from the wires to the alligator clips are the sloppiest I 've seen - EVER , and I 've been in electronics for almost half a century . The wire is only slightly stripped , a few strands are folded back over the insulation , then held in place by the wire-strain portion of the clip . No soldered connections , no welded connections . Nothing . They recommend this product for use in labs - I do n't think so . You should n't have to & # 34 ; fix & # 34 ; a product before it can be used . The quality is incredibly bad .	-1
I own mini grabbers before and these are not mini at all . It is fairly large in comparison to my mini sets .	-1
I purchased the arrow T50 staples in both 1/4 and 3/8 inch sizes . Unfortunately , my staples were put into a box with little thought to the journey ahead . With very little packing and no means to keep the staples from sliding out of their boxes , my shipping box arrived sounding like it was full of marbles . When I opened the box , I discovered that both packages of T50 staples had come open ; this resulted in all the staples breaking apart and mixing up during shipping.I was able to separate the 1/4 size from the 3/8 size , but it was a little disappointing that so many of the long staple rows broke into smaller sections . I ended up having to throw away about 5 % of the staples ordered , as the broken sections were too small to really load into my staple gun . I also ended up stepping on one of the loose staples that fell out of the box , but luckily it went into my shoe , instead of my daughter 's bare feet or something.If Amazon could do something to help keep the boxes secure during shipping , I think that would be a great help - perhaps some tape or maybe shrink wrap or something alone those lines might be helpful.If you do order this product , just be aware that there is a potential for the boxes to slide open during transit ( and be careful of loose staples if you have kids or pets , etc . )	-1
the candle I received has little gashes all around it in the wax . these little gashes and holes detract from what might be a sort of nice looking candle . but more importantly , the bottom part that unscrews is very difficult to grab and turn - stay away from this product if you have any hand/finger mobility issues at all . also , there is a waxy residue around the bottom piece that unscrews so that anyone looking at it would have to wonder why its there and eventually would realize the bottom opens . I do n't know what the brown stuff is sticking to the inside and I can not clean it . but if you are OK with an expensive product that is so-so then this might work for you .	-1
In the market for a good easy tape measure and this got good ratings . I found the lock mech did n't allow me to keep it locked while pulling out more tape . too much work .	-1
The tape measure states that it can go to 25 feet . It did n't even make it to 20ft before the spring tensioner over extended and would not retract the tape . There was no warnings written on the tape to indicate that I was reaching the end of the useful length . I would expect better from a Stanley product . I have had cheapo tapes that go out to their full indicated length and then provide a warning . The previous Stanley tape i had did the same thing but I figured it was because I mistreated that one and got it wet . This one was less than a month old with very little use . Last Stanley tape i buy .	-1
i regret not spending $ 80 or more on a filter regulator.i have a 60gal / 12scfm compressor in my garage . i made all the connections with teflon tape and once done , you could hear a leak . so i went back to home depot and bought some thread sealant , brushed plenty of it on the male & female ends of the 3/8 & # 34 ; connections . let them dry for a day in the garage ( Houston - two days ago = 80F in the garage ) tank to nipple - good connection / zero leaknipple to regulator - still leaking - tested with soapy water.the regulator valve body seems to be a cheap cast / not a smooth granular cast , i assume they drilled a hole on the body and then made the threads . it is still leaking and i have not had a chance to test the regulator , filter or anything else downstream.i would like to return it and get my money back .	-1
Bought this same stripper elsewhere . Put it in my electric tool box.Went to use it for LAMP WIRE ( ! ) and the plastic squeeze handle broke right off ! Spend more and get an all steel wire stripper .	-1
This is a metric tool.On one side , the numbers indicate ( from largest to smallest ) , 35 , 25 , 16 , 10 , while on the other side , the numbers indicate 38 , 22 , 14 , and 8.I assume then that this tool is designed for metric wire , not AWG.Metric 35 = 0.305 Dia while 2 AWG = 0.292Metric 25 = 0.255 Dia while 4 AWG = 0.232Metric 16 = 0.204 Dia while 6 AWG = 0.184Metric 10 = 0.162 Dia while 4 AWG = 0.146I could not find a reference for 38 , 22 , 14 , and 8 , so I have no idea what those numbers mean.The metric dies are probably close enough to AWG to work OK , but its not an AWG sized tool . Since the metric sizes are larger ( generally between 1/32th or 1/64th ) the crimps wo n't be quite as tight .	-1
I bought this for a repair job on a Samsung LCD TV . After seeing a similar product at Radio Shack for $ 15 , I decided it was too much to pay . As far as materials go , this product is quite well constructed . The housing is made of solid aluminum , on part with flashlight tubing . As for the actual functionality of the product , it was unsatisfactory for my needs . Suction is very poor or non-existent . It does not create enough force to pull the melted solder into the tube . I had to repeatedly plunge and release to get any of the solder off the leads . It would 've been the same as if I used a pencil and flicked away the solder . What I thought was going to be a 30 minute job ended up taking over an hour because I was slowed down by this sucker.Another thing to be careful of is the sides of the plunger tube . It 's just an aluminum cylinder cut in half , so the edges can potentially cut you if you run your thumb down it the wrong way . I was a sucker for buying this and threw it out after one use .	-1
I 've tried about 20 times and never had it suck any solder.I 'm not very good at this , so I asked my friend who is an electrical engineer and builds circuit boards all the time , to try it . He tried several solder joints and never got it to suck anything . He has a different `` sucker '' that he says does work , but he is more a fan of solder wicks.I do n't recommend this product .	-1
This product is cheaply made . After the first day it had already manage to fall apart in my bag . I ca n't review how well it actually worked because I 've yet to spend the time to put it all back together .	-1
This is a cheaply made product and comes with no instructions . The threads on the cap are so poor that it takes considerable effort to line them up and screw the cap back on . I do n't expect it to last long .	-1
This could be what I call 'user-error ' due to my more innocent ventures into soldering particularly on electronics . I found it rather larger than I anticipated and as many times as I tried to get it to 'suck ' up the old melted solder as the instructions said it would do , I found the solder cooled quicker than I could hit the button to make it work . Again , it could be down to my soldering virginity . A more experienced person may not have the same issues .	-1
It is actually a `` power port '' socket . All of the male ends I use would not stay locked into the device , very loose.Never installed it in the boat.Very poor quality ! ! Do n't waste your money.RLC	-1
does not wick solder . Other brands will do much better and are worth extra cost . Check around and read reviews	-1
I got this with a kit and I have to say it is the worst stuff ever . I had the solder all bubbling and hot and put the wick on top of it and it absorbs a pixel sized amount like a speckle . I watched videos and read how to use it , and I just ca n't get it to absorb anything . I got the cheap solder pump and that thing works decent enough , have to pump a few times but eventually most of the solder will come up . This stuff is just bad though , maybe it 's just how cheap it is or the solder I was using , but it really did n't work at all for me .	-1
... .on a roll is what you get . The product fails to do what it 's called , wick solder from a previously soldered joint . When are retailers going to quit offering buyers the only choice of buying the crap produced by a third world communist country ? I would 've *gladly* paid more money to get a quality product , made here in the USA that actually did what it was supposed to ... instead of wasting my money.Stay away from this junk ... ...	-1
While it 's nice to have this around for an extra iron I have to stress that based on the positive reviews here I was curious to order this item and see if it really worked as described . To be honest my Radio Shack iron does not fits in well , well it goes in the metal casing but since it is China - made you can tell it wiggles too much and it 's not solid when holding my hot iron , I 'm worried my iron will one day fall off from it and burn whatever is laying around it , therefore I put it back in the box to be given away one day , to a person I do n't really like = ) .Overall : Would not buy again nor recommend .	-1
The stand works alright , it is very flimsy and wobbles barely holds my little weller without tipping , the sponge pictured is also larger the one that comes is a half cm thick when wet	-1
Borderline Junk ! I had to reinforce the spring so it would hold my soldering iron without it falling forward . The sponge-like piece used to clean off the iron tip is pathetic . The only sponge I ever saw that does n't & # 34 ; grow & # 34 ; when wet . Save the few bucks and make one yourself . I would have returned this , but I was too embarrassed I even bought it .	-1
Really a disposable item on the face of it . Comparable to junk sold at Mexican outdoor markets in Mexico . Junk .	-1
After trying this thing for about an hour , I threw in the towel and headed on over to Amazon return-town . I bought it mainly for small point soldering on guitars , but was very frustrated at the lack of quick startup and consistent heat output . Needles to say , I 'll be spending a few extra bucks and getting something more substantial . Great idea with the kit and all , but the performance just is n't there for serious work application .	-1
solder iron was packaged in what I can only describe resembled a sandwich ziplock bag , come on , how cheap ! Smoked both times I turned it on !	-1
OK ... the iron gets kinda hot ... If you let it sit for 10 minutes , it might get hot enough to melt the solder if you hold the solder directly against the tip for 10 seconds . You are n't gon na get anything other than poor cold solder connections with this thing . I ca n't even desolder a piece on a PCB.Spend another $ 20 and get a Weller . If it had n't come with the vac ( not bad ) , the little bit of solder and the braid , I 'd send it back.I 've had to delay my project by several days and order a real soldering iron .	-1
I 'm a beginner solderer and I wanted an inexpensive starter kit to try out my skills . I had watched some videos on YouTube that suggested I not get an iron rated at less than 40 watts . I should have paid attention . This one seemed like such a good deal , but it 's rated at 25 watts and it never got hot enough to melt the solder properly . I returned this and bought a medium duty Weller iron and am happy with my purchase .	-1
This will cause more frustration than anything . It takes forever to melt the solder and seems all beat up after only a few weeks use . Get something a bit more powerful from a known manufacturer ... Weller is great . Be sure to look at the alternative heat source irons . You may throw this away and the next until you really sit down and do the research needed to find the one that works for you . I ended up with the Weller butane iron , great product for my uses .	-1
Fortunately , Amazon has excellent customer service ! Amazon reimbursed me when the product was missing . I suspect that the organization responsible for sending this out never sent it .	-1
This kit is aweful ... do yourself a favor and get a better iron . This one does n't get hot enough to melt the solder . The solder sucks . Just a waste of money . Only thing that kind of works is the solder sucker.. and it is novelty at best..	-1
Two stars is average for the device type.The Good : Straps are well built and plenty strong.The bad : The hooks are too small to fit over the rails on most roof racks and so the hooks must be used to snag the web after being passed around the rail.The cam buckle sounds like a good idea but it is really not particularly . The latch must be depressed to tighten the strap through the buckle . Because the hook is too small and it must be looped over the strap this is more awkward than the ratchet strapThe ugly : The latch is difficult to depress.Overall in some cases a bit better than the ratchet strap but by and large not as good as the better ones .	-1
These units ( pack of 4 ) have very unreliable locking system for tighening straps to whatever , must be pulled extremely tight anf then tied as they slip very easily , Would not recommend for roof top traveling .	-1
Even thought indicated otherwise , I could not get a secure grip on my F150 with an ARE topper . I spent quite a bit of time trying to get them to work and making sure I was n't the problem . At the end of the day they would not accommodate the thickness of my shell.To be fair , I was given a full refund on both the opened and unopened set .	-1
This is the worst 18 volt cordless drill I have ever bought . the chuck was replaced once and the drill kills the battery in no time . I do n't even use the drill any more , it is in the bottom of my tool box . I did buy 2 flashlights to go with the drill and they are great . They are used when I need a light in a tight place and last a long time on a charge .	-1
I 've had this drill since last christmas and have used it 8 or ten times around the house.Today I was installing some new windows and the drill fell from the window sill to the hardwood floor maybe 3 or 4 feet . The drill , that I was counting on to finish my days work BROKE IN TWO.This is in no way acceptable and anyone doing commercial work and relies on their tools needs to steer clear of Hitachi ... .Man , what a pain . I had to call my wife to bring me my 10 year old Panasonic to finish the job and it still works like a champ ! ! I 've got to call Hitachi to see if they will fix this drill made out of glass ... .works good besides that ! ! LOL	-1
I tried to use this remove two broken bolts from the heads of my '78 ford , had no luck at all . In all fairness though , I was so scared of these things breaking off and making the situation worse I limited how much force I allowed myself to use ; but while trying I got no movement from the bolts ( also be advised , this was the first time I had ever used any kind of extractor ) . Finally had to pay a shop 500 dollars ( I wept ) . Of note , while trying they did not break or bend so it might be that I simply had bolts that were too badly lodged for it to work or I just did not know what I was doing . So construction quality seemed fine just did not work .	-1
They fit fasteners just fine , but are too short to lock on my extensions/ratchets . I will return these and just buy the bloody snap on ones when the tool guy comes around . Also they have a very poor finish quality , HUGE machine marks all over the things . VIM is a much better inexpensive tool manufacturer .	-1
I believe that you can rarely go wrong with an item that has great reviews . However , the reviews fooled me on this one . I bought this level to replace one that I have had and used frequently for about 10 years , but eventually developed problems.As soon as I opened up the package with this new level , I laid the level on the kitchen counter . The bubble was slightly to the right , so I knew that either the level or the kitchen counter was not straight . I flipped the level around and the bubble was slightly to the left this time . The problem was not a crooked counter top ! The only other issue that was a little bit discomforting about this level was how flexible it was . When it was laid across my counter top , it was slightly bowed . I pressed lightly on the level and it straightened out . I would n't have returned the level over that issue alone , but it is a consideration that buyers should be aware of.I immediately returned this level and spent more money on a better one . Some reviewers said that this level is `` good enough for do-it-yourselfers . '' I disagree with this statement -- unless the DIYer is okay with building things crooked !	-1
my level arrived with the center insert piece busted . its pretty much useless now i wouldnt but a level online ever again . the packaging was terrible as well .	-1
The Surefire E2D Defender turned out to be a disappointment . I had to contact Surefire twice to replace the on-off tail switch two times but it continually breaks . I have serious concerns about the reliability of the tail switch to function properly . Due to this ongoing problem I can not depend on this light to function when needed . SureFire did replace the tail switch both times in a timely manner and their customer service was excellent . Ultimately though the light still does not work and is sitting in a junk drawer.When I did carry the light it was put in my left front pants pocket . The sharpened bezel tore a significant hole through my 5.11 tactical pants . My bad and I own that mistake but it should be noted that you must carry or store the light where it will not damage clothes or gear . A few times the clip got stuck on items and bent which had to be squeezed back into position with a pair of pliers to get it to a usable structural integrity.The 60 Lumens Incandescent light that only runs for 1.25 hours is now outdated and obsolete . I would only recommend getting an LED light.As for recommending the Surefire E2D Defender I would pass on this model . The tail switch does seem to have some functionality problems . If you need your light to work flawlessly then this is not the light for you . I suspect this would apply to the LED version as well as the only difference is the bulb . I have many other SureFire products that work as designed but the E2D Defender does not cut it for me .	-1
I have had so many poor experiences with cheap products from China that I try hard to find things made in USA . In the past , the DeWalt name has generally been one I could depend on but now , it 's beginning to mean & # 34 ; made in China. & # 34 ; These nails are no exception . They are Chinese . They may be OK but I 'm suspicious of the quality of the metal and plan to look elsewhere for future nail purchases .	-1
The tool does have a lot of uses and is definitely versatile . But , what other people have remarked holds very true : - a first time owner would have probably liked to have some instructions explaining what everything in the kit does and how it is used . Having to search online to figure out which one is supposed to be the # 401 mandrel is lame ; - the tool feels in your hand as if Dremel outsourced the design and manufacturing to Fisher-Price ; - overheating seems to be a problem - a short session sharpening my lawnmower blade made the motor scary-hot ( it has n't burned out yet , but it feels like it 's heading in the general direction ) ; - some attachments are supposed to be limited up to a certain rpm - but in this latest and greatest version of its mainstay tool , Dremel marks the speed selector from 0 to 10 . Hard to know what number is supposed to be 15k rpm , the max speed advised by some attachments.I fell into the trap of `` newer must be better '' , even though the 300 series felt so much better in my hand when I visited the home improvement store ...	-1
I have gone out of my way to review this Dremel under each of its listings ( for the various kits it is included with ) because I do n't find any other reviews sharing my opinion.I have owned 2 other Dremels , and used at least a half-dozen . I looked forward to owning this one since first seeing it advertised . It looked to be a significant improvement.I bought this Dremel because it is the only one that works with Dremel 's new multisaw attachment . With that attachment , which is sold separately , you can use it like a miniature reciprocating saw ( Sawzall ) . Just pop any `` T '' or `` U '' shaped jigsaw blade in , and you 're in business . I do n't know of another tool that can be used in this way , and for that reason and that reason alone this Dremel is worth owning.I already own another multiple-speed Dremel , and I thought I 'd sell it once I bought this . But I 'm keeping both because this new Dremel simply feels cheap and poorly made . It seems like its plastic case is flimsier and it does n't feel as balanced when it 's operating . It certainly is n't ergonomic . Any Dremel user who buys this latest model will instantly notice the drop-off in quality.On the good side , the multisaw attachment works well and the molded plastic case is designed to hold the Dremel , the multisaw and planer attachments , jigsaw blades , the included circle cutter and flex shaft . The kit also includes two bit sets that lock onto the top of the case , with room for two more on the sides.There 's no way I can tell if this Dremel will last . I 've put a pretty good load on the motor , and it has n't failed . But I think that if I drop it more than a few feet onto a hard surface , it will break . The shaft lock button feels particularly cheap and uncertain . I expect it to break first.Despite all my concerns I 'm keeping this Dremel . But I 'll only use it when I need the multisaw or planer attachment . Any other time I 'll use my other Dremel ( model no . 3956-02 ) .It 's extremely unfortunate that at the same time it has chosen to make the most versatile Dremel yet , the company also decided to cut corners on quality . Dremel doubtlessly wanted to keep the price down on this unit , but in doing so they 've produced a multi-function tool that feels like a toy .	-1
I was very disappointed in this tool . I bought it to cut out a 12 '' x 6 '' panel in 1/4 '' thick fiberglass with 1/16 '' aluminum on one surface . Since it used standard jig saw blades , I figured it would be up to the task.The primary reason I used this item rather than a jig saw is that I had a restricted area where the jig saw would not fit.It made it about half way through the job when it quit working . When I disassembled it , I found it had nylon ( or perhaps simply plastic ) gears , which were rounded smooth . The manual does caution against running the tool too fast , and I did heed that , but its supposed to be able to cut through 1 1/2 '' material , so I figured it should have worked for my application . But at any rate , for almost $ 30 , it should have metal gears.Unless you are cutting thin or soft material , get something heftier , like a pneumatic saw .	-1
Not adjustable at all.I needed this to shave off a little bit of wood backing that was sticking out 1/8 '' from behind some book shelves I built . The problem is that the planer is only designed to be used in one direction . If you ca n't use it in the direction they want you to , you are out of luck . Also , you ca n't change the depth of the cut , so if you do n't want that deep or shallow of a cut , you are out of luck there too.I ended up using the planing bit without the casing , and had better luck doing it that way , but it was n't perfect like I was hoping the kit would be able to provide.I would have given it only one star except that I was able to use the planing bit alone for what I needed . That is why two stars .	-1
I got this tool as part of a set . i was very excited , i thought i 'd never have to use my chisels to clean up the edge of some my wood working projects , boy was i wrong , as others have said it takes a large , uneven bite . I would think that with practice that uneven bite problem could be fixed . however while trying to get it to work right , the blade got warped some how , making it impossible to make a good cut , so i bought a second bit and was extremely careful with it , and it still warped . I have removed this tool from my dremel kit	-1
Save your money and your time . Make a story stick and use that instead , in the long run you 'll be done quicker with a lot less frustration AND you 'll have an extra 30 bucks in your pocket to spend on making the wife happy .	-1
It has no ability to clamp to faceless cabinets without a center rail . Also I was unable to find instructions on the Kreg web site if this is possible or not - the issue is just ignored by Kreg . The description states it will work with faceless cabinets - not true if the cabinet does not have center rails.I am back using a story stick - or just clamp a straight edge and and place the cabinet drawer on it and mark the center of the elongated holes . Then install the cabinet drawer rail.Too bad as I thought this Kreg tool could make the drawer slides install easier .	-1
I love Kreg products but sometimes less is more . It is much easier to cut a piece of wood at the height you want your slides and reuse it . Do n't have to keep remeasureing and clamping . Set slide on top and drill .	-1
I bought this tool because I was building a filing cabinet . The cabinet has a face frame but the drawers are floating and there is no cross member in the face frame that separates the drawers as there would be on a kitchen cabinet . Hard to explain ... but picture the face frame with a large opening for the cabinet door and a smaller , thin , and rectangular opening for the upper drawer . This tool would be clamped to the piece of 3/4 '' wood ( the horizontal rail ) that defines the separation between openings.I did n't understand this difference until I tried to mount my full extension drawer slides and I was having trouble clamping it down on the vertical stile of my face frame . I could n't find a spot to get any leverage on it , and my Kreg face `` klamp '' was too big to fit on it . I tried several different angles and even tried using various C-clamps to hold it in place , but it was n't working . After messing with it for a few minutes I realized I would have been able to cut a few stop blocks or story sticks by now , so I just did that . Drawers are now mounted . Afterward I went back to have another look at the tool instructions and only then did I notice that all illustrations showed the tool clamped to a horizontal rail . That 's a subtle difference that belies the advertisement that this is the perfect tool for mounting drawer slides.Perhaps if I was building a more conventional kitchen cabinet ( or a few of them ) this would be worth it , but I was pretty annoyed . I bought this and the other drawer mounting tool from Kreg . Since Kreg 's pocket hole jig got me into furniture building , I expected more from this tool . A tool like this could certainly be a bit more universal and would only require minor modifications to allow it to be used on stile or rail - why do n't they do that ?	-1
I am not a professional cabinet maker but I have installed many slides on various projects I have built . While I have found Kreg to be an excellent tool maker overall , I was unimpressed with this particular one . I found it cumbersome to use and I did not see any benefit in time or effort . In my view , this tool is a complete waste of money .	-1
I bought these in addition to the magnetic slide mounting tool.I was building a filing cabinet that does not have a rail in between the drawers . The cabinet has a face frame but the drawers are floating and there is no horizontal rail that defines the separation between openings . I did n't expect this to be an issue , but it rendered these tools ineffective.I did n't understand this difference until I tried to mount my full extension drawer slides and I was having trouble clamping the tool down on the vertical stile of my face frame . Because these share the same mounting configuration , they do n't clamp to the stile either . I could n't find a spot to get any leverage on it or use C-clamps to hold it in place . I ended up cutting stop blocks ( story sticks ) to do the mounting . Afterward I went back to have another look at the tool instructions and only then did I notice that all illustrations showed the tool clamped to a horizontal rail . That 's a subtle difference that belies the advertisement that these and the other tool are perfect for mounting drawers and drawer slides.Perhaps if I was building a more conventional kitchen cabinet ( or a few of them ) this would be worth it , but I was pretty annoyed . I bought this and the other drawer mounting tool from Kreg . Since Kreg 's pocket hole jig got me into furniture building , I expected more from these and the other tool which cost about $ 45 together . A tool like this could certainly be a bit more universal and would only require minor modifications to allow it to be used on stile or rail - why do n't they do that ?	-1
I got these and tried to use them to install some draws in a cabinet I was building . But they did not seem to be of any use . It might be they need another jeg to go along with them . So far I just feel I wasted my money on them .	-1
The instructions have outdated image photos and the setup of the lens stop instructions do n't work . I contacted customer service and Dan Fisher sent back a nice e-mail confirming the images and offered another setup directive , which did n't jive with what I was led to believe I purchased . I still am unable to use the lens with any confidence . His directions work , but I could do the same thing on my old miter gauge , which counters the reason I purchased this one..I gave it a two stars as the rest of the assembly is excellent . I am a Kreg fan , but this one lacks.Bye the way , I suggested perhaps a quick video regarding the lens setup , but as far as I know , the suggestion was not accepted .	-1
This product is somewhat of a disappointment . I would have expected a vaery high quality product from kreg . I have had a Dubby sled miter for probably 15 years and have just purchased another and frankly i would recommend that you NOT purchase the kreg miter and seriously consider a dubby by inline industries . It is stable , rock solid and probably the easiest miter out there . The kreg just did n't cut it .	-1
I was needing a couple self-stick tapes for a table saw sled I made . Looking through the choices I thought I was ordering the right one for the job . Wrong . The one I got is 6 ' long which is 4.4 ' longer than I wanted . It is also white and I wanted yellow . Not only that but it is just one side ( Right to Left ) . I wanted to send it back but the shipping would cost me about the same price as another tape like it so I am going to have to eat it while I wait for my new kit ... I found the ones I wanted and made sure by re-checking everything that is to come in the Jig Self-Stick Tape KIT . Yes , a kit with 3 sets , etc . in the kit for the cost of 2 tapes if you do n't buy the kit.When buying make sure you get and review all the specs to make sure that is what you really want or need .	-1
I purchased this product thinking it would fit my other fences but it dose not . I guess I can figure something out .	-1
These screws work great , but they are really expensive for screws . Amazon has a better deal on them than anyone else , its just that Kreg is way to proud of them to start with . Hopefully someone can find another supplier .	-1
Horrible is the only word to describe these bits . This is my only bad Kreg review . ( Strangely enough , the driver that came with my jig lasted a long time . ) -1 was bent about to about 1/4 '' runout.-I literally rounded both off on the 1st or 2nd screw.Yes , I 'm using the correct size.One is stuck in the the garage sheetrock where I hurled it after being unable to drive the 2nd pocket screw . The other is in the trash . I went to the local building center and bought a handful of their no-name bits . I 'm still using the 1st one after 250 pocket screws .	-1
Get the 5 in one . Trust me . Or you 'll use the bits out of this thing within a day .	-1
Buy a Lennox 9 in 1 ( or whatever it 's called ) instead . These things strip out on you . The shaft on my first one cracked when I was using the screwdriver part , so I returned it and got a new one . Same thing happened again . An old electrician told me they always do that . Now it 's in my kid 's toy toolbox .	-1
I expected more for these because of the Klein name on them . I was wrong . These are not designed well . They do not hold screws good enough . They slip off a or shoot off when trying to screw them in . I would recommend more expensive one vs these cheapos	-1
Looks good , very hard to reach into , useless when it rains . We have 4 in use , all the same , they do n't need wind to leak , just rain . I ended up drilling loads of 1/8 '' holes in the bottom of them , the mail still gets wet but does n't sit in a puddle anymore . Also , the paint does n't stand up to sunlight , gets matt & faded pretty quick . ( We are in CA , but SF , so not exactly known for year round strong sun ) .	-1

Yes it is easy to program but it is junk . If I set the heat for 77 when the display shows 77 my heater will stay on until it goes to 78 which can take 30 minutes more and the room is boiling hottttt ! ! ! When the digital thermometer on the table which is accurate and is 15 feet away shows the room is 73- the thermostat will show the room is 77 or sometimes 80 . Then later it will show it is 75 . My guess is the sensor in this unit is getting the temp from the back or the walls and not the room so it is not right . I emails hunter which said it was over a year old . OK if you are one of the biggest makers of therms in the country and you ca n't comp out a free unit which probably costs you $ 5 to make then your support sucks . I will not buy hunter as my next unit . MAYBE they work for some but this thing has always kept my heater running too long past the set temp . no thanksUPDATE a couple years later . I hate it but have not replaced it . It is winter now . At night I have to set it to 79F so I feel comfortable . I know the room is not 79F- it is about 76 . The problem is I live by the beach in Los Angeles . winter time my indoors gets down to 32 % humidity so I need more heat to feel comfortable . In summer it might be 45 % to 55 % humidity so I do n't need heat because the place is 80 inside at night.Last night I got woken up . Heater was set to 79. unit comes on and heats the condo . After set temp it still stays on . I do n't know heating but I read that heaters need to cool down or vent out the heat before they shut off . So this thing is set to 79 and when it gets to 79 it keeps running and venting and by the time it shuts off i am awake because it might run for 10 to 20 minutes or longer . The other problem is say the room is 76 and the heater comes on and it is set to 77. the heater could run for 30 minutes trying to raise the temp 1 degree where if i manually change it to 80 the heat comes on stronger and heats faster and then I shut it down . It might be my old 25 year old heater or the thermometer- but I did install another one at my mom 's house and for that 1 degree problem it could run a long time . One day I will replace this but I have not	-1
***EDITED REVIEW*** I wanted to note that when this review was written , the purchase cost of this item was substantially higher than it is now . *****This is a nice thermostat . It does have a few issues I discovered now that it has been in use about a week.1 ) The wiring instructions are not correct , at least not for my AC unit . I wound up calling an AC company who was nice enough to walk me through the wiring over the phone for free ( there are a few good people left out there ) . Only two of the five wires actually went to where the instructions said they should.2 ) The backlighting only stays on for about five seconds , its kind of a let down considering I paid $ 25 more for the version that is backlit over the same one without the backlighting option.Now that it is installed , it is easy to program and works fine.I gave this item two stars due to the 40 % extra I paid for a disapointing backlighting feature and the incorrect instalation instructions . I almost had to pay a $ 100 service call to have someone install a $ 60 thermostat ! One piece of advice , make sure its not hot out when you do the instalation . I live in Arizona , it was 113 degrees outside and 78 inside when I started this , thinking it would only take a minute . When I was done two hours later , after the phone call with the AC guy , it was 98 degrees inside my house .	-1
I have purchased several nail products for my air mailers at different times . The nails themselves work as required , but the packaging for shipment was poor , as a result the packages of nails were broken and the nails were strewn around in the outer shipping box . This happened on several shipments . Once you can get the loose nails contained , then you can use them fine .	-1
Tried these staples to nail down bamboo flooring with a Bostitch angle staple gun . Would not drive through the bamboo without bending . Used an off brand staple that was coated with no problems . Would not by for this application again .	-1
this is not a security bit , no hole in center , if that is what you need , do not buy this product .	-1
So , when I got this set I gave it a 4 star review based one what came , only knocking it for the cheap case . That was before I used them . The concrete bits did fine . The other bits did fine in wood and soft material . But when it came to a simple piece of 1/8 '' mild steel , these things were completely useless . FIVE bits almost instantly dulled trying to drill one simple hole . Started out with a smaller bit as a pilot , then was going to use the bigger bit to drill out the hole to the correct size . None of the smaller bits lasted more than a few seconds of drilling before they dulled . The coated bits and the black standard bits were all dulling the same . To be fair , and for a control sample , I grabbed an old bit that I probably got at tractor supply years ago to try to drill through this steel , thinking it might be the steel . Nope . The old cheap bit drilled right through . You truly get what you pay for with these bits . I had bought a kit for myself and my dad . While for $ 35 I 'm not totally angry with myself for the purchase because there are still valuable parts to the kit that I can use . But do n't buy this kit expecting it to do everything you need it to . It is what it is .	-1
Its a great idea but after the 5th time using it the black knob snapped , making the tool worthless . The Black knob or handle is plastic , it should be metal .	-1
just like the review for the SAE set . There is no way the hold these on a ratchet or extension . This fact make them useless . will return .	-1
The Ingersoll - Rand 231C 1/2 inch impact wrench is made in China . Since I already own a Chinese impact wrench , there 's no point in owning another . The point was to replace the low quality chinese tool with something better . Yes , I was looking for an upgrade , and the IR 231C is n't it . I thought Ingersoll - Rand 's products were made in the US , why would they start manufacturing in China ? It will only ruin their name , and in fact already has with this customer . However , this does explain the low price ( which is actually quite high for a made in China impact ) . I am willing to pay up to $ 400 if needed for a high quality impact wrench , but it will not be from IR . Out of the box , it looks and feels like typical Chinese tools . I will return it , and never buy anything IR makes ever again.Here 's the best review I can give considering I never used the product , but did give it a good look it over.It 's very heavy , and if you ever needed to use it every day , I would n't recommend it for this reason alone . I think the specs say it 's about 5lb , it has got to be more , I will weigh it and get back to you.Out of the box the tool looks like it was 30 over years old . It appeared worn , even used , yet the thing is brand new.The torque/pressure control on the side is very stiff and could not be turned by my fingers , and feels low in quality . ( note : my hands are quite strong , but that knob needed nearly a foot pound just to turn ) The finish is dull , and not polished well . Tool was covered in thick oil , and black stuff , inside an open ended plastic bag stuck to the gun . You would need to clean it right out of the box . The picture on this web page makes the tool look much nicer than it really is.Trigger is loose , wobbly , thin , is plastic , and feels weak . It has nearly no spring pressure . The trigger performs like the ones found on childerns ' toys.1/2 '' anvil does n't have a spring ball detent . How could sockets stay on tight ? Tool does not come with an air fitting , just a threaded socket in the handle . If you do n't have this fitting , you would need to buy that before using it.Tool does not come with a storage case.It does n't ship with any socket tools , oil , or accessories . Just a red cardboard box ( that was oil stained ) , plastic bag , and a few documents ( The document booklet edges were bent over because they were longer than the box . ) Impact wrench has a tiny decal on the back of the gun that says `` Made in China '' . It could be removed , and no one would think you own a Chinese tool . I question the tool 's resale value.Is the tool junk ? I do n't know , and with over $ 100 on the line here , I am not going to find out . I will find a non-Chinese made air impact gun even if I have to buy it used .	-1
Titan 16048 Quick-Disconnect 48 Piece Drilling and Driving Set in Plastic Case -We have 2 General Carpentry/Home Improvement shops , with every major brand of construction equipment possible , left over from our 'construction days ' , Now for our Vacation Properties in Hawaii , so we go thru a tons of Drills & Driving Sets , per year . We mostly purchase them from our local low 's and home depo ( sits ) stores . This set was priced well , so I gave it a spin.In short , they were of Poor Quality , performed Poorly on Wood & Metal , and just like everything that is not of high-quality Steel or Stainless Steel , when exposed to the Ocean air , they Rusted after 3 months , plus the ( Metric-size ? ) Coupler was Not Interchangeable , as someone else noted , with other Brand name drills , and it 's China Made.At least with a Craftsman piece or tool , you can take any Tool back to Sears , and get a free replacement , with these you are SOL .	-1
I bought two of these holders for sockets with 1/4 & # 34 ; drives ; two holders for sockets with 3/8 & # 34 ; drives and one holder for sockets with 1/2 & # 34 ; drives . When the holders were flat on a work bench , the magnets held the sockets in place but , when the holders were lifted and/or tilted , some of the sockets fell out . Also , some of the compartments were too big for the sockets . The holders were too bulky so five of them almost filled my toolbox and left very little room for my other tools . I returned all five holders for a refund .	-1

Yes , these seem well made and are very heavy and strong . If , however , you buy one and you ca n't squeeze it to make the jaws open , return it instantly . The ratcheting mechanism is supposed to unlock and open once the crimp cycle is over . Mine came squeezed shut , and no amount of further squeezing would unlock the crimper . I had to apply quite a lot of force on the manual unlock lever ( while squeezing the handles ) to finally get it to open . I should have sent the things back right then , but I 'd already waited for the crimper to arrive , and they 're so heavy returning them would probably have cost me five to seven bucks . So I spent about four hours filing away two of the seven ratchet teeth using files . A better way would have been to use a 3/8 '' grinding stone in my Rotozip or a Dremel tool , but neither of those tools were at home at the time , and I was determined.Once I 'd done away with the last two teeth the crimper worked normally . I suppose the factory ( or some joker at the factory ) thought it would be funny to squeeze a defective crimper shut , knowing it would n't open again , and send it on out for sale . I was n't amused . I 'm still not . Enough that I 'll never buy another Tool Aid product again . At least not through Amazon . I might consider it if I can buy locally where I can try before I buy . Order these at your own risk .	-1
Being the first on the market I just had to have one . I like to buy everything new when it comes out . But man was I wrong to buy this right away . First , the motor is severely underpowered . Other reviewers have commented about it as well . It does conk out after about 3 feet and then requires the manual pull . Secondly the retract barely works . I mean I need to hammer my switch to get it to work . Third , this thing is huge and weighs a lot . I know its because of the motor and batteries , but still its too big.I own many Black and Decker tools and have been extremely satisfied over the years . This was a first attempt at a new product that did n't get as much testing as it needed . I 'm sure that Black and Decker will try and improve this and make it better . It seems that everyone thats reviewed it has the same complaints . Have faith and trust in them to make it better over time !	-1
Tape worked OK until I fully estended it and it came out of the holder . The taped didnt break , but there is no way to reinsert the tape or open the case due to security screws . I 'm sure it is a simple fix to reattach the tape , but with the security screws on the casing it 's just a paperweight now .	-1
works well but to big and bulky for most work . ok for outside jobs but to hard to handle for small inside work . I do n't use it to much because of it size . I would say buy only if using for outside work .	-1
This is another B & D blunder . Motor drive extends tape but does not retract . Battery door ill fitting . Can see it falling out at any moment . Not a serious tool for a contractor or weekend warrior . Get a laser measure instead .	-1
Black & Decker ATM100 25 ' Auto Tape MeasureOk ... It 's a fun toy . One of those gadgets to play with when bored . Too large , bulkey ; heavy etc to be practical . Moy lowest rating ever for and Black and Decker product . Sorry !	-1
This was a great idea that got very poorly executed . First off , it 's huge ( roughly 4 '' tall by 6 '' long by 2 '' thick ) . It takes four batteries , which is probably most of the reason for the gargantuan dimensions but that makes it nearly 2 pounds as well . Seriously , its very size and weight makes it nearly unusable with one hand , which was supposed to be the whole point of an `` automatic '' tape measure . Further , once the tape is more than five or six feet extended it starts to bow unless it is supported against something . If you are trying to measure up a wall to the ceiling , for example , it wo n't work unless you have something to hook it against at the top . Again , that defeats the `` hand-free '' goal . This is one of the dumbest gadgets I 've ever seen let alone used . I got one as a gift and returned it after one use .	-1
The physical size and weight of this tool makes it difficult to use unless you have both hands free . A second set of fresh batteries did little to improve tape extension beyond about five feet . The tape should be motorized for rewind also so that if it should happen to fold you could retract and extend it again more easily .	-1
A gadget would be putting it nicely . My mother got this for all of us on father 's day . I guffawed to myself when I saw it but sadly , did not immediately return it to the store for credit and get something good . It is so heavy and big , its unwieldy . The tape is so flimsy that overhead one hand use is impossible . All in all a gimmick that fails badly . It will be one of the worst sawbucks you have ever spent .	-1
I had one of these professionally installed and it worked for about 30 days . The power outlets still work , but the USB outlets are dead .	-1
I do n't like this tester because it has a dial allowing me to adjust the sensitivity . When adjusted down it never beeps and when adjusted slightly up it beeps for everything including dead wires . I have yet to find a setting where I can actually trust this tester . My old tester I lost on a job does not allow for adjustments and just beeps at live wires and does nothing for dead ones . I really thought based on reviews this would work but it really does not . Going to buy another brand now .	-1
At one time this flashlight was more competitive , but these days many flashlights are available at a similar price point ( or lower ) with much better specifications.This light is solidly built compared to older flashlights , but modern flashlight makers such as Fenix make even more durable lights out of aircraft-grade aluminum and other materials . The build on this light is decent but not stellar by modern standards ; it only for example offers water resistant construction ( I believe the listing to be in error on this ) , while more modern competing lights offer 1PX8 complete waterproofing to two meters or more . Competing lights also tend to offer more brightness levels/modes ( which aids in runtime and preservation of night vision ) , better max brightness , optional ability to take higher-powered 14500 batteries , and other features.Some competing more modern 1 X AA lights in the same price band with better features include theOlight i2 , ITP A2 EOS , Fenix E11 , Fenix LD15 , JETBeam BA10 , and4Sevens Quark MiNi AA . This list is not exhaustive , but hopefully browsing this selection will convince you that you can get far more for your money than with the Inova X1 . It 's not bad ; it 's simply an older design with older tech , and not competitive today .	-1
I am an IT consultant , and bought this light at Target to replace my old Maglite 2AA unit . At first , it was an all-out love story . Sure , it 's not the brightest thing in the world , and the push-button is virtually useless , but it was more than bright enough for my use and as a HUGE bonus , it fit perfectly in the little side-pouch of my Leatherman Wave ( the nylon pouches have two extra little compartments on either side , not sure what they 're for , but the X1 fits it perfectly ) . I used it in dark server rooms , parking lots , inside PCs and servers , while re-routing emergency power during an outage , and it was always adequate . I even wrote a positive review on another site shortly after I bought it . I should have waited ... Now it 's six months later , and the light is sitting beside the keyboard , not working , totally dead . The light has received literally daily use , harsh use . It 's been underwater , it 's been in extreme cold , it 's been in extreme heat , and it 's spent it 's whole life bouncing around and getting laid on and bumped around next to my Leatherman . The problems began about 2 months in , at first I was able to resolve them by cleaning the contacts with alcohol . What would happen is I would twist the light `` on '' , and nothing would happen , tap the button , still nothing , finally I 'd smack it , and it would pop right on and stay on until I turned it off . Then this became more frequent , then it became constant , even with the alcohol treatment . I put up with it , I actually had fun with it a few times , handing it to a buddy and watching him try to turn it on , but last night it 's happy little life came to an end.I rode my motorcycle out to my mom 's place about an hour away to help her with some Christmas decorations outdoors , night fell and I was using the X1 to see what I was doing . Right in the middle of things it began flickering , and finally went off . I put a fresh battery in it , tried all the tricks I 'd learned during the six months I 'd owned it to get it to work , nothing . I could get it on , but only for a minute or two , then it would flicker back to darkness.I got mad and threw it into the street , where it was promptly run over by a reindeer ( in this case , the four-wheeled Japanese variety ) . I left it , and forgot about it , and it probably took a couple more hits while I wrapped things up . Then it was time to go , and uh-oh , I do n't have a light . I had ridden my motorcycle out there , and do n't like to ride at night without a flashlight in case something happens . I borrowed a $ 5 plastic flashlight from my mom and went looking for my $ 25 X1 . I found it , scratched up a bit but still intact and set about trying to revive it . I should add that I have a lot of experience fixing things , electronics , cars , computers , you name it , I 've fixed it . But not the X1 , I do n't know if it was the Honda , or if it was already dead when it hit the road , but nothing I did would bring it back to life . I had made the mistake of depending on this thing , and now I had to ride home on my motorcycle , in the dark , with no light if something happened.That 's it , my X1 's life story . It 's as factual as they get , and I hope it helps you make your decision . I think a lot of the positive reviews are probably like my first one , written right after the thing was purchased , but my experience suggests that these things are n't suited to hard-core , real-world usage as an EDC light . Unless you only need it for two-months , of course.EDIT : I can now report that a friend received one as a Christmas gift and he had very much the same experience . His too is now broken and useless .	-1
After reading this week the comments posted by Jon Fowler and Alan W. Richmond , I would like to confirm their experiences . After I quit carrying my original X1 ( purchased in 2006 ) for a while , I remembered that Inova has a limited lifetime warranty of its products . So , on August 3 , 2008 , I sent to Inova ( Emissive Energy ) an e-mail message about the problem I was experiencing in turning on my Inova X1 flashlight . I received a reply from the Sales Administrator , who provided a return authorization number . I sent in the X1 and received a newer model X1 on August 19 , 2008 . The newer model ( it is brighter than the model that I sent in -- I think that it had the 2-watt LED ) did work satisfactorily for a while , but then this X1 also started being inconsistent in turning on . After twisting the end cap to the constant on position , I would have to tap the flashlight against my hand several times before it would turn on . Sometimes it would not turn on and I would quit trying to use it for a while and then try again a few days later and it would turn on . So , several times , before I sent another message about the problem , I would try the flashlight and I would be able to get it to turn on , so I did not write about it.I had purchased one of the older models in 2006 for my younger son , so I tried using the end cap of my X1 on his older model X1 , which is not as bright but which continues to work without any problem . His older model X1 turned on every time with my X1 's end cap , even at the momentary on setting . When I put the end cap back on my X1 , my X1 did not turn on . Consequently , I figured that the problem may not be in the end cap switch but in the circuitry of my X1.The last time I tried to turn on my X1 again , I had to tap it once on the desk edge and three more times on my hand , before it turned on . I was then able to turn it on briefly about four out of seven times -- sometimes , after I twisted the end cap to the constant on position , the flashlight would turn on after a delay of about a second . I have changed batteries before without any noticeable improvement . It is frustrating to have a flashlight not turn on right away when it is needed , so I gave up carrying the X1 and started using other flashlights that may not be as sturdily constructed as the X1 , but were more reliable in turning on whenever I needed them.So this past week , I sent another e-mail message to Inova about my X1 's problem , also asking whether there was a known circuitry problem with some of the flashlights . I was told that there was no known problem with the X1 , but I was given a return authorization number to return my X1 under the limited lifetime warranty . I mailed in my X1 this week , but then read the comments referred to above , which indicated that the problem may be more common than Inova may want to admit . If you experience a problem with an Inova flashlight , exercise your rights under the limited lifetime warranty.Today , Sept. 4 , 2009 , I received a replacement X1 ( X1MT ) for the one I mailed back on Aug. 12 . The packaging says `` max output 25 lumens '' and does not mention a 2-watt LED . The replacement X1 came with an AA battery but with no holster or wrist strap . This X1 turns on as it is supposed to so far . When it works , the latest model is very bright -- brighter than some of my older 2-AA battery LED flashlights ( but , of course , not brighter than some of the newer 3-watt 2-AA battery flashlights ) . However , I do like the smaller size of a 1-AA battery flashlight for pants or shorts pocket carry with the AA battery 's longer life over the 1-AAA battery ( I do like convenience and portability of the slimmer AAA battery flashlights for shirt-pocket carry for close-up use ) . Hopefully , this X1 will last longer than the first two that I had to mail back to Inova under the warranty -- it does cost money to mail the flashlight back to Inova . If the circuitry problem is not present in my latest X1 , I would rate it with a lot more stars than my original model.Because my son still has the older model X1 ( the second version without the spotlight lens and , apparently , not the 2-watt LED ) , which is just a little brighter than a 2-AAA-battery LED Eveready penlight , I was able to compare the brightness of my original model of the X1 with the latest `` 25 lumens '' version . The latest version is much brighter , but it has a bright center `` spot . '' My son 's older version is much dimmer ( of course , with a longer-rated battery life ) and has a more evenly diffused floodlight circle of light that is actually easier to use for close-up lighting of objects . I have a Coast LED Lenser Digitac II 1-AA-battery flashlight that has a larger and more evenly illuminated circle of light ( without the noticeably brighter center spot ) than the `` 25 lumens '' X1 and seems to be better for close-up illumination , but the latest X1 has a brighter , whiter light that could be more useful for outdoor distance lighting with a very compact 1-AA battery flashlight.UPDATE : As of April 2010 , the latest X1 is still working and has not developed the circuitry problems of its predecessors !	-1
This light is bright and solid.It feels good in your hand.This is a flashlight that had lots of promise , but failed in the end to a design flaw.The light flickers as you walk or move the light around.This is caused by the battery rattling around inside of the casing.In fact , it even shuts itself off at times and you have to rattle it back on.The light is way too expensive for what you get.I would also look at the Streamlight Microstream and the Streamlight Pro flashlights.The Streamlight is brighter and I have found it to be much more reliable , when I have needed it .	-1
USED 3/8 INCH DRIVE UNDER LOW TORQUE JOB USE . IT SNAPPED ON SHANK . WOULD NOT BUY OR RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT .	-1
I ordered this set with a Makita corded impact driver . Tried to see if I can loosen up the wheel bolts on my car . Could not loosen one , took out the second and the attachment snapped on the third . It may be just too much to ask of this set . I bought a replacement piece , forged , for more than the cost of the whole set . So far so good , but I am clearly more timid to apply full force . Realistically , with the narrowed part on the hex shank , it may be too much to expect the tool to take the abuse of the impact driver.I believe Amazon should not be recommending this set to go with the Makita driver .	-1
Id look elsewhere , using my dewalt impact wrench on light jobs it snapped two of these at the shaft . The head still functions so I just ground the shaft down . Still soft metal though .	-1
The smallest bit shaft broke after very little use , first time out of the box . I 'd spend more money next time to get better quality .	-1
I bought them just to have in a milwaukee kit bag I have . I used the 3/8 '' once and put it back in the back with the rest of the attachments and bits . I went to grab it again about a month later , and saw that all 3 of them were rusted to hell . Its fine for what it is , a cheap set of adapters to get you by , but def not high quality . They did hold onto the sockets nicely and didnt crack or bend with an 18v impact on them.Bottom line in my opinion , if you want a set to last you a while and look nice in your toolbox , look elsewhere . If you dont care and just need something to get you by for a weekend , then these will definitely do that .	-1
Try as I may , the 3/8 & # 34 ; socket bit does n't accept my sockets . It is just a little too big . The 1/4 & # 34 ; and 1/2 & # 34 ; work perfectly . I thought maybe I was missing something - but I tried a handful of sockets and they would not go on the extension . Very weird . Maybe my set had a manufacturing defect - but everything appeared correct . Just a little too big . Maybe your luck will be better ... .	-1
Cheap piece of crap . I put mine outside with a & # 34 ; free , take it it 's yours & # 34 ; sticker on it . Buy a better drill . This is not worth the money .	-1
I am ashamed of Black and Decker on a poorly made product . I have owned several of their tools over the years and have never had any issues . Good quality tools . This 7.2 volt cordless drill with keyless chuck missed the mark by a mile . You can not keep a drill bit tight in the chuck . You just can not hold the drill to tighten the chuck . First time you use it to drill a hole and the drill starts to have some resistance the drill bit stops and the chuck loosens up . I am just disappointed with this tool . The reason I purchased it was to keep in the house for little products without bringing out my big cordless drill . Another thing is the drill used a NI-Cad battery so it takes a long time to charge . There is no indication when the battery is charged .	-1
Even a FIFTH-GRADER would need a better tool.1 . No replaceable battery - SO - when in MIDDLE of a small job , SHE GOES DEAD and you have to charge UNTIL TOMORROW.2 . NOT variable speed - - I knew that when I ordered it , but , thought it would not make a difference - - IT DOES - A LOT ! 3 . THIS tool SHOULD NOT have the BLACK & DECKER label on it - - it 's like some of the REALLY CHEEZY STUFF I sometimes buy online from a DISCOUNT house.4 . My poots have more power .	-1
Out of the box , the drill rattles as if some parts inside are loose . Makes me wonder what is broken and whether the drill will short out itself in usage . I know its a cheap drill , but should n't Back & Decker be concerned about its brand-name ?	-1
I used the light for several months and then the switch went bad . Took it to the recommended dealer who confirmed the switch was bad ( cleaned it and it worked but ordered a new one for warranty replacement ) . The entire light was replaced at no cost . After a few weeks , the switch on the replacement light did not work once but seems to be doing okay now . This light definitely has a switch deterioration problem as evidenced by several other commenters . It 's a great light if they could put a better switch on it .	-1
I have plaster walls and even with brackets and other heavy install items this goes flying off my wall with everything on it . Was really hard to install on a plaster wall and after trying three or four different types of install screws nothing works .	-1
i was so looking forward to it . very disappointed that the product looks very cheap . so i returned it . i have n't gotten any replacement because have n't found one that would work	-1
I have 3 of them . The revolving balls designed to hold the handles get stuck and become useless . Seemed like a good idea when I first got them but , unless they corrected the problem , I 'll stick with more conventional tool racks that are n't made of plastic .	-1
A lot of people have varying opinions about the Schrade knives made today , some are holding on to American nostalgia and some just do n't like these knives but are n't being specific as to what 's wrong with them . So today I 'll be conducting a review on the 8OT ( my favorite knife by Schrade USA ) and give specific detail against the imported model by Taylor Cutlery ... Blade Steel : The original Old Timers used 1095 Carbon Steel and the Uncle Henry 's used Schrade 's Plus Steel ( 440A Stainless and 420HC in later years ) ... 1095 was a great blade steel you could get for a slipjoint but it was also the standard steel offering of American knife brands . This steel yielded between 0.90-1.03 % in carbon content and was just about holding a really good edge and being easy to sharpen . The only thing about 1095 you had to get used to was that cutting fruit or cleaning small game or anything moist the steel would tarnish/form a patina.For people used to the patina effect from carbon steel it gave an antiquated arts & crafts appeal to the knife , for people who liked their blades pretty they hated it.Great edge life you 'd get from 1095 Carbon Steel but it was n't for people who neglected oiling their blades or leaving water or chemicals on them for extended period of time . So the newer Schrade 's by Taylor Cutlery do n't use carbon steel they are now stainless and not even the quality of Plus Steel.This steel is not 440C as that is a super stainless and China does n't use 420/440 Series stainless steels they develop their own . The steel holds an alright edge but it 's dense and not soft like actual 440A , it just does n't sharpen worth a lick on a stone ... that 's because China has purity issues with making their own steels , not every China made knife is like this but from Taylor they scrape the bottom of the barrel . The transition to stainless steel might have made some happy but regardless 1095 Carbon definitely made an Old Timer what it is.Was Schrade USA 's Plus Steel bad in comparison ? Not exactly I 've got a few blades in Schrade USA 's Plus Steel and their stainless steel did hold a good edge.Those older knife manufacturers like Imperial Knives USA and Camillus were known for hardening all their blades from 57-59rc ... good heat treatments back then were n't a selling factor if everyone did really good work . But a lot of people did n't get that stainless steels were soft and heat treated for strength/performance and offered rust resistance with less carbon while 1095 was a tool steel.1095 is a very pure steel so a heat treatment has a more intense effect on the steel making it noticeably harder than a stainless . Purity is why 1095 sharpens up faster and brings back a edge that has more definition to it ... in short it comes back sharper . The carbon of course is for long edge life but that hard edge from 1095 also makes it well known for holding it 's edge to coarse materials as a cutlery steel . As I said before Schrade USA 's Plus Steel holds it 's edge and was made to perform so it is underrated . I grew up on carbon steel and it 's much longer lasting and better in too many ways to overlook as a user steel.Edge : The original Schrade USA 8OT Stockman did n't possess quite a sweet edge like a Camillus but out of the blister pack they were useable . The imported version does have a improved grind on the blade so it looks sharper but it 's a fat wedge like cutting edge versus the keen edge formed from the original 's flat grind ... in short the imported model ca n't carve wood worth a darn because of that blunt edge it has.Sheepsfoot and Spey Blade : These two blades face each other now so they do n't take up more than a single backspring 's worth of space and that 's because they drastically thinned out these two blades . The blades are n't useless now but they are n't reliable like the thick blades of the original 8OT ... you can bend these blades.Blade Snap : The imported version of the Schrade 8OT does have better blade snap over the original , Schrade USA 's ranged from fair to good when it came to blade snap . This might be irrelevant to someone but if you did n't like oiling your carbon steel backsprings they are now stainless steel.Delrin Scales : The Schrade USA originals had dark and light brown delrin scales while the imported version shoots for black and tan instead.The hacksaw grooves I 'll give China credit the texturing feels a little deeper than the originals . Did n't like the use of black for the delrin because it obviously spilled over from the mold into the tan and it looks grey.Schrade USA had a tendency to do the same but the use of two different shades of the same color contrasted well.Final Thoughts : There are comparisons between the original Schrade USA 8OT Stockman and the imported model to make , but the bottom of the truth is the original Old Timer 8OT was a better knife . Schrade USA was simply a machine-made user knife brand that cost less minus the trimmings found on pricier slipjoints like swedgeworked clip-points , longer matchstick nail-nicks , four brass liners instead of three and sweeter edge work.But you 'd get something as reliable as any other knife with the same steel as other brands . Not surprised Schrade USA fell through , you ca n't sign paychecks if you have a handful of customers that buy slipjoints when the majority goes for one-handed blade access . If you 've never had an original Schrade/Old Timer USA 8OT you might like this knife but it really does n't follow the reputation that original had in any way simply because it 's not the same knife .	-1
This thing is pretty pointless . Tried hanging stuff with it twice and epic failure ! I had to end up using tacks on my wall !	-1
I have used a similar putty in the past for posters . I bought this and used it but the posters fell down after about 3 months .	-1
Sent the item back ... the laser line was fuzzy/out of focus ... NOT GOOD for me ...	-1
The price is right , the features are useful , but one of the most important characteristics , the visability of the laser line I found poor . It sometimes dims , the horizontal lines do n't line up exactly , and the laser lines put down are a bit wide -- compared to my $ 10 no-frills laser straight line . I have to smack my unit around to get the red lasers to brighten when it will inexplicably get dim all by themselves -- yes , I did take the plastic safety insert out of the laser . Seems like I got a shoddy/defective unit.If I had purchased it from a brick & morter I would definitely bring it back for a swap .	-1
I admit I did n't buy this on Amazon . This thing is ok if you need to level a curtain rod or that shelf that you ordered from Ikea . But if you drop it off the table or kick it accidentally do n't be ssurprised if you hear little pieces of plastic bouncing around in the case and the laser is no longer self-leveling . I opened mine up to see what gives and discovered that it 's no better constructed than some of my son 's cheap toys . That laser crystal must be pretty expensive because the rest of the stuff must cost all of $ 2 . RK	-1
To create a straight line this works as expected . To create a level line - this is worthless . When set to the unlock position , the unit is to create a level line . It is inaccurate 95 % of the time , and no two lines are the same for the same wall . If it is not over the return time I will return to Amazon .	-1
I bought this stand for my Bosch 5412L several years ago . It works okay once it is setup and is quite stable in that position . However , as a `` portable '' stand , it leaves much to be desired.If you leave the saw mounted on the stand , ( who does n't ? ) , it does not sit steadily during transport because of its narrow frame . The whole contraption tends to rock or fall over when encountering rough terrain , like ruts in a driveway.Another problem occurs when you get ready to take it down after use . The sliding extensions must be thoroughly cleaned of sawdust or they will bind and jam when you start to push them in . The extension stops are not particularly accurate for repeated cuts on long timbers , being a bit wobley.Collapsing and setting up the legs is a little rough on the back , requiring the frame to be held up with one hand while the other unlatches and deploys or collapses the legs . You need to switch hands for each side.The saw and stand together make for an ungainly and heavy load to lift into the back of a truck alone . The combination weighs over 100 pounds . If I had it to do over again , I would look for a lighter saw and stand for portable work , perhaps the Festool Kapex and portable stand .	-1
I cant say it has more cutting power than my conventional skill saws . It bogs down the same as the milwaukee or dewalt 15 amp units . Not sure if the extra weight and expense of the worm drive is worth it .	-1
Here 's what you should know BEFORE you buy this thing . If you are planning to use disposable cylinders this heater will suck them down in no time flat . It 's expensive , inefficient , and environmentally lousy with disposables . If you are planning to use ( 2 ) 20lb cylinders you will need a 'fuel filter ' for each regulator ( there are 2 ) . Mr. Heater sells them for 9.95 each postpaid . You will also need hoses . Amazon seems to have the best price for these . There is a built in fan in this unit . It does n't do much except make noise . The unit does not come with the AC adapter to run the fan . If you feel the fan is a requirement , Radio Shack sells the adapter for 18-20 $ . The part # 's are 2731761 ( adapter ) & 2731708 ( plug ) . You can also use the 4 D cells but you will run through a bunch . I spent about $ 150 over the purchase price to get it up and running ( Tanks , Hoses , Fuel Filters , AC Adapter ) . You can download the owners manual on the Mr. Heater web site , consider doing so before you buy.You should also know about the recall on the heater . There was a problem with some of the regulator/control valve assemblies . The units affected were sold prior to January 10 , 2005 . I had one of these units and went through the recall process . Mr. Heater sent me a postpaid return tag and I had my replacement heater in a week . It works just fine . The process was frustrating and inconvenient but Mr. Heater has ultimately made it right.Some comments about Amazon Customer Service : Amazon completely abandoned its customers when the product recall occurred . They made no effort to contact people who had purchased the item and refused to accept returns . I had owned my heater about 2 weeks , had used it once , and was writing a product review when I found out about the recall . I was stuck with it . ( A friend was able to return his to a local hardware store for a full refund . ) Amazon even took down product reviews alerting people to the safety recall . My letter to the President of Amazon about this remains ignored . Amazon gets a failing grade for conduct regarding this problem.Before you buy this item , consider getting a Little Buddy heater ( or 2 ) . The Big Buddy is basically 2 Little Buddy 's in one package . ( 2 regulators , 2 tank connections , 2 heating tiles ) I like the heater . Knowing what I know now , I would buy it again . The folks at Mr. Heater have done their best in the face of a bad situation . I wish the same could be said for Amazon .	-1
Had this item for two winters . Worked fine for the first year this past winter would n't stay lighted for more then 15 minutes . Tried to contact there customer support what a joke , e-mail several times NO answer . Just wanted to know what parts were needed to make it work nothing from them.save your money DO N'T but this heater.After a few e-mails they offered me a new heater . the new one works fine , I 'm pleased but it did take longer then it should have but they did make right .	-1
As noted by many people , this heater does n't stay lit with the small bottles of propane . It 's not oil clog , it 's not the tip switch . It 's faulty design that does n't allow the valve for the ceramic tiles to stay open when operated in cold weather ... when you 'd want a heater let 's say.I 've never tried the big propane tank as I bought and need it for the portability of it and only for a few hours at a time . I 'm not going to continually re-light it every ten minutes , though i have done that in dire situations for warmth.The pilot light has always stayed lit for me once lit though . [ single clap of appreciation ] Very open to anyone 's ideas for a different brand of heater that 's equally portable .	-1
I have had mine for over a year now . I read the manual and got the filter and and adapter hose for bulk cylinders ( BBQ style tanks ) When it was new it would take forever for the thermocouple to get hot enough to allow my to turn it on without the pilot going out.Then if it was at all windy it would shut down , not blow out , but it would click off due to the thermocouple getting cold . Then the whole startup procedure would have to happen again.Sometime later the thermocouple just got stuck in the on position so I could immediately light the burners , sure this was unsafe , but I was using it outside and it sure beat having to relight it a few times an hour Now the thermocouple is working again and it goes out after about 3-5 minutes , regardless of the wind.When it works it works great and is much better then the round style as this generates most of its heat in infrared . This means if you are outside most of the heat is radiated towards you , and does not go up in the air .	-1
You ca n't count on this Buddy to keep you warm ! This heater has been a huge disapointment ! If it is cold it will not run on one disposable or one 20lb tank . It keeps shutting down . Customer service has been terrible . You are lucky if they call you back a week later . First they told me I need to buy the filters which was very hard to find . They will not help this problem I can gaurantee . Then they told me to buy yet another $ 28 hose and hook both 20lb tanks up . That seemed to work but have not tested it in real cold weather . I use it to heat an ice fishing trailer in Minnesota and it gets cold here . I called them back and told them that idea sucks because I have to worry about always having two full 20lb tanks available otherwise it will shut down . They told me for all my hassle they would send me a quick connect hose for free and that would cure all of the problems of it shutting down because using the quick connect bypasses the 20lb of minimum pressure required to keep the safety valve open in the heater . I waited for two weeks and it never came . I called and they told me to stop using the heater because there is a safety concern and they wont know anymore untill Feb.1st . That is all they would tell me and they never sent the hose . I spent over $ 80 dollars in hoses and filters for this worthless heater you can definitely NOT count on to keep you warm . As far as the fire hazard talked about in other reviews it did act weird quite a few times with real small explosions . Avoid the headache and buy two of the small ones if you need the extra heat . I have never had a problem with the little buddy .	-1
This tool works great for emptying your bank account . In fact this has been one of the most non-cost effective wallet drainers I have ever encountered . However it is very shiny and has a cool box . Whenever I think about how much better tool I coulda shoulda had if I had just bought the Lisle or OTC , I reassure myself by admiring the shiny chrome and the coolness factor of owning a genuine made in china Gearwretch .	-1
This model is cheaper than the 6P , easier to grip , and is easier on the teeth if you hold it in your mouth to free both hands.However , the bulbs are unreliable and quite expensive to replace.A nifty toy , but not a tool you can rely on or keep running economically.If I had free bulbs and batteries , I would give it 5 stars .	-1
There 's something terribly appealing about the Surefire G2 . It can be carried in a pocket , or a pocketbook , and can easily temporarily blind an attacker with a simply push of a button . Still , it 's an incandescent light and despite its power , battery life is only one hour with two CR123 batteries.The G2 used to sell for $ 26 . Now everyone wants about $ 65 and Amazon , $ 59 . For that price , I 'd recommend an Olight M20 Warrior , which is selling for $ 69 currently .	-1
They sent me the children 's size and it was just not going to do the trick . The filter was expired but I was n't going to dock it for that . I was assuming it would be based on everyone else 's review . But I would see where someone tried to erase the year of manufacture . Not cool .	-1
The mask came in a loose plastic bag and looked used with smudge marks on the lens and scuff marks . The mask seem to fit well . The canister that it came with was dented pretty badly .	-1
For those that wish to drink while wearing one of these keep in mind whether you receive the drinking tube is hit and miss , both of mine did not arrive with a tube so they were immediately returned and another ordered . Otherwise it appears to be in good condition , not worn , but with a filter dated 01/92 and 07/09 . Not sure if one is the manufactured date and the other is the expired date ... .	-1
After reading the product description and many of the reviews , I can not understand why anyone would purchase this item . The mask is advertised as old and not guaranteed to work . The seller admits that the product can not be relied upon . Posts confirm that the filters are OUT-OF-DATE and need to be replaced . Some posts say the product `` works great '' but how would they know ? Do they have test facilities ? Are they engineers ? Probably not.I am surprised that Amazon would partner with someone who sells defective safety equipment .	-1
I bought this coded key box earlier this year and just installed it the other day . Prior to that , it worked ! I even showed it to family and friends telling them how cool it is . Today , after opening and closing it once to teach someone how to operate it , it wo n't open the second time around.Now , I got an ugly useless decorative up on my wall .	-1
I got locked out of this device while trying to set it up and now it is useless . No way to reset	-1
This safe works fine for house keys and car valet keys but it is not large enough for even 1 car key with buttons on it . Two stars because it is so cheap .	-1
If you mistype the code you have to wait 30 seconds before you can type it again ! REALLY ! So if your guest misses a button or the keypad does n't register the press ( as both ours often do ) they are left confused as to why the gate code does n't work.This is a junk product . Not work the money . I threw both ours in the trash and installed a garage door opener board and used garage door keypads instead.You will have nothing but trouble with the this remote . It will frustrate guests and family alike . Avoid at all costs , Mighty Mule no longer provided terminals inside the keypad to run power from the control panel , you can ONLY use batteries . Sure most people will use batteries for convenience , but a good portion have already run wire out to where the keypad will go to ensure the keypad will still work when the battery fails . We all use remotes here , so the keypad gets very little use . Invariably the one time it is needed the battery will be flat .	-1
I 'm sharing my humble , though thought out and experienced logic here : My yellow flags are out here , as we think there 's price gouging here.Though we do n't own one of these kits , we do n't think we want to-because of the sooo few sensors that come with the kit that theysay is for a 3000 sq ft home.We have a 2300 sq ft , 4 Bedroom house : but we have 3 doors , and 10 windows to protect ! And protecting thishouse would cost another $ 100 dollars , or more , to buy extra sensors.And , furthermore , the poor batteries life would be an expense thatwould eventually prompt us to turn the whole system off.Why are n't AA alkaline batteries used here ? You can buy 40 atSams/Costco for $ 10 or so and they will last years ! Correct me if I 'm wrong , but is n't this a very poor choice ? Thanks.Don	-1
We are currently under contract to one of those home monitoring companies and are looking to get something on our own and out of their contract . We had hoped this would be the one.Unfortunately we had a number of times when the alarm would go off for no reason . I do n't need false alarms to drag me home from work or create unnecessary panic . We made adjustments and did some trouble shooting , but the phantom alarms continued.Installing the unit is very easy and the instructions are clearcut to use . But when we called the company to ask questions about the product , we only received one call back ( when we were not home ) , and after we returned the call , we never heard back from them again . Perhaps it was just some glitch or miscommunication . But we 've decided to continue looking until we find the right match .	-1
Installation was extremely easy . The provided double-sided tapes installing the the sensors an easy task . The keypad which includes the siren died after only about 4 months of use . The siren simply died and would no longer work .	-1
It is hard to understand all the hype people have after buying and installing this system ( or any other all-in-one system of the same type ) . I guess as soon as it makes noise , people think that they are protected and scared burglars are running away in horror . Here is what is going to happen in real life:1 . Burglar approaches the house . He may be a kid or on drugs ( a professional burglar is not our intended target ) , but still he has enough brains to check your house walls for Internet and phone wires to cut them ( actually , there is no need to cut anything ; you can pull the wires with one hand to disable the phone dialer ) .2 . OK , he wants to go through one of your doors ( it is easy ( and you have to ) to secure those with Strike Master strike plates , so a window may be his actual target , but OK , he uses your back door ) .3 . The door sensor trips right away ( not a motion detector 10 min later , OK ) The system starts beeping , waiting for disarm , so burglar follows the sound to find it.4 . He finds it , rips it off the wall , puts into your toilet , covers with towels , flashes it and closes the seat . He knows he had plenty of time to remove it , so it sent no signal to ADT ( he believes it is a real system , that 's what you want , right ? ) . Plus , there are no cables left , you remember ? 5 . He does whatever he wants in your house.The only good use I see for the system the way it comes , is to monitor your house at night when you are at home . However , it is much better just to protect the house more so burglars make noise when they try to brake in giving you extra time.Yes , the dialer still may be useful if it is set to no delay , wires are not cut and you can ( and have to ) place it in a secure location , but you ca n't rely on it if you have your wires accessible and do n't have a cellular backup . After the burglar silences the main unit , his idea would be he is all set and there is no need to worry.To make the system to work the way it should , more or less , you will have to spend much more money and time , as many other people said . You will need to purchase Skylink AA-433 Audio Alarm ( about $ 35 ) and program the system to keep the main panel absolutely quiet after you hide it somewhere where it ca n't be found . Since SC-1000 comes with a single remote , and you will have to hide the main panel , you will need an extra remote ( if you are not the only user ) . They are about $ 20 , so it is easier to buy SC-10 system for around $ 70 and use alarm and remotes , plus you will get 2 extra ugly door detectors.OK , we spent over $ 200 now . For the money , you can get a real professional wired system , like Ademco Vista 15 or 20 - gold standard for alarm installations , with a 6160 alpha keypad , main panel you can hide in your basement , bunch of hidden ( not ugly as hell ) door contacts , real , not crapy Skylink , PIR pet-proof sensor and a basic 3rd party phone dialer . Wireless receivers are from $ 30 to add to Ademco , sensors are numerous and cheap : fire , glass break , window etc . OK , it may be 30-50-80 dollars more after you add wires and 2-3 extra sensors , but those systems compared to Skylink are like night and day . Plus , a real system may be connected to a monitoring company in case you decide to go that way one day.That 's why I have returned mine after calculating all the costs to fix all the issues and cost of their extra sensors of very questionable quality I may need later on.I 'm not against Skylink or their product , no . I 'm against them calling it a `` complete security system '' . The current system can be easily redone by Skylink to make it much more secure . Main panel , siren and keypad have to be separated . They already have all the components , but need to do it right . At the moment it is a toy and has to be considered as a toy , not a security system . It may have its users ( people in mobile homes , apartments or those who do n't know how to use a drill ) , but there are much-much better systems out there for the money you will end up paying at the end .	-1
I purchased these gloves in anticipation of a major amount of demo that I needed to do for a fixer-upper home that I recently purchased . They were great for the first 4 weeks of demo ( only used on the weekends ) but the leather/fabric ( ? ) on a few fingers had worn through by the end of this period.This weekend ( week 5 ) , the finger next to the pinky on the left glove wore all they way through so that my finger sticks out of the fabric . Admittedly , demolition of lath and plaster , a stone fireplace surround , basement stairs , and linoleum floors can be hard on gloves . . . lots of nails and abrasive surfaces to grip ( i.e . rough wood , stone , some concrete ) . However , I would have expected these gloves to last for more than 10 - 14 days of hard use.Pros : - Very comfortable- Easy to take off when you release the velcro- Good protection , even from sharp objects- Hands did not get overly clammy or sweaty when in useCon : - Wore out after 5 weeks ( weekends only ) of useI recommend these for light duty only .	-1
This is a very strong glue . It recently won a fair and well-orchestrated glue face-off . I use it . But I 'd like to know who came up with the 10-minute open time thing . To me open time is the time available to maneuver parts into position before applying clamp pressure . I recently made an oak picture frame ( 3 '' wide x 1-1/2 '' thick ) with biscuits in the mitered corners . The parts came off the miter sled fitting perfectly . Prepared the glue-up table so I could work quickly and started . When all four pieces were in position ( about 3 minutes max ) the first corner had seized and would not close . Had to take the assembly apart , clean up the glue , retrim the corners , and do it again ( using epoxy ) . By my definition this glue 's open time is about 10 milliseconds . I definitely do not recommend it for even slightly complicated glue-ups . For straight-forward gluing it is fast and strong , ie , if you build some sort of jig for your shop you 'll probably be able to use it within a few hours . But the 10-minute open time is a myth .	-1
Like in movies the sequels are not necessarily better.I 've used Titebond II glue before and was satisfied . When time came to reorder I noticed that Titebond III was available touting improved performance and decided to try it.After using Titebond III on two projects I am completely disappointed . The first project I tried it on was a coffee table .. a total disaster . Using biscuits joints and clamps I glued together about seven 1x5 pieces of pine together for the table top . Looked pretty nice until summer when in the dry heat the joints started to come apart . The table was used only indoors and not subjected to moisture.The second project involved gluing together miter cuts in cedar trim boards . The joints were reinforced with 18 gauge pins . Nonetheless , after a couple of weeks exposure to the sun the joints came apart ! My other gripe is that Titebond III is fairly `` runny '' .. after spreading the glue liberally and then tipping the surface prematurely , the glue will drip before you have a chance to make contact with another surface.So , back to square one with the projects and back to Titebond II glue .	-1
I constructed a counter top of end grain hard maple . The end grain is the work surface ; the joints are all flat grain . After a few months , in the area where the top is used most , all joints are failing . Examination under magnification shows that the glue simply softened . The top was thoroughly saturated with mineral oil . ( General Finishes . ) Either water or food or cleaning agents ( I use Fantastic ) caused total failure of the glue . After this experience , I wo n't use this glue for anything and will probably shift to something other than a Franklin product for quick glue jobs . All critical jobs will be done with epoxy .	-1
Great glue , but after the first use , the glue locks up the bottle cap so you ca n't open it again without a pair of pliers . Ridiculous . This review is more for Titebond ( Franklin International ) than for users . Get on the ball Titebond and invent a useful bottle cap , one that the human hand can manage.David	-1
This is the first time I have used this glue and it does n't work as expected . Now , maybe I got a bad batch or something but all this stuff seems to do is soak into the wood and hold nothing . I apply this glue and within a few minutes it is almost dry so then I apply another coat ... .and sometimes yet another coat ... .aggrevating , to say the least . After I let it dry I can still pull the glued objects apart with my hands . This is the first and last time I am buying this stuff ; I 'm sticking to the regular carpenters glue because it worked a lot better ... ..and it is also cheaper to buy . I do not recommended this product ... in fact , I hate it ! !	-1
It looks white on the picture . But when I got it and installed it . Placing a white wall plate next to it made me realized this is a off white color . I would still consider this white , but little bit off , like a kid had rub dirt on it and tried to clean it . I have been replacing light switches all over my house recently and none of the switches have this affect , so I do n't think it is the wall plate being different color .	-1
I ordered one of these on November 1st , 2012 to replace a plastic stem in our Moen bathroom sink faucet which kept requiring an o-ring replacement or lubrication . I thought maybe being a Genuine Moen part , and of brass construction the sealing valve surfaces for the moving O-rings would be of higher quality and not need such frequent attention . This sink gets a lot of warm water usage , dozens of cycles on this valve every day.As of February 17 , 2013 this stem is already worn out , and presents extreme resistance to pulling the faucet handle . I removed it and carefully pulled the inner stem out and cleaned and lubricated it with FDA approved silicone grease , and re-assembled it . It does n't leak , but it is still hard to pull and actually squeaks when pushed closed . The sealing o-rings look like new , but since half the O-ring seals in this model are mounted inside the barrel into grooves , instead of having all of them mounted in grooves on the removable stem ( stupid design ! ! ) it would be very difficult to try to remove the hidden o-rings and get a new set installed without scratching the brass in the process , which could lead to premature damage of any newly installed o-rings . So I am replacing this piece of junk and going back to the cheap plastic style of stem . At least those CAN be serviced , after which they work very well for several months , until their o-rings wear out and need to be replaced and re-greased.Of course , if Moen could simply make a faucet that did not NEED all this attention , I would not be in this predicament . But at least this lasts longer than the lousy single handle Delta model it replaced .	-1
The unit advertised was `` MOEN '' brand ( original brand ) but the one they sent me was generic -- no maker name on package , unit , nor instructions . Seller offered to accept the unit for return , but I said no . Seems to work when first installed . We shall see.LATER : Well , it 's been in use a few weeks and it 's getting hard to operate . If you buy one , make sure to get a genuine `` MOEN '' brand unit . Mine is not MOEN , and I regret it .	-1
Replaced existing heater/fan which was the same model as this one . The first one was satisfactory , so I bought this Broan 655 again to save having to retrofit another model in the ceiling . The noise is enough to make on wear ear plugs . Dreadful sounding , especially when the heater is turned . Wasted money on this purchase . Will not use this brand again . Would not recommend this particular model .	-1
Quality brand name , that 's why I purchase it to replace our noisy one . However , this unit vibrates and is very noisy . The metal is so weak that it reverberates when the fan is turned on . I 'm going to have to put some screws in the unit to stop the vibrating . I would n't purchase it again	-1
I replaced the identical unit I had for 22 years so I know how the last one was , It lasted over 20 yearsThe sound was manageableThe heater cranked out some heat.The new unit is noisy , you can feel the vibrations on the first and second floors.I get minimal amount of heatAs far as sones go this must be a 10The light works like a light , pretty hard to mess up a basic light fixture	-1
In the past 10 years or so , I have replaced both my Intermatic timers two or three times each . This unit lasted just 16 months . I just do not get why someone else does n't market a solid state device at the same or even higher price so consumers have a choice . As it is , if all you need is something under 100 watts ( with the advent of LEDS , that 's now plenty of power ) , you have to keep going back to Intermatic and these folks have not innovated in 30 years as they keep selling the same timers with the same terrible light connectors that they have always used . Yes , they added LED technology but at ridiculous prices . There is a market there for someone ... .	-1
the fan control is good . I find sometimes I have to turn it to high rather than Max to get it going , but for the most part its good.The light dial is annoying , you have to turn it halfway like people said and then dial it back to dim . real loose play like other people said . Also , the most annoying part is it buzzes . The switch itself buzzes . I do n't hear anything coming from the bulbs , but I can hear the switch buzzing . I do n't have any other dimmers in my house other than the 4 of this model I ordered , so maybe that is just what dimmers do , but I installed a few of these and they buzz when not at full brightness . Full brightness = quiet . Dim=buzzzzzzzz	-1
I thought that this would be a life saver for me . Had to paint newly sheetrock house , 1800 sq ft . The roller does n't get even coverage , so you 're going over the same spot numerous times . The duck nose paint intake broke after the first gallon.Once I picked up the light stick and the roller , I was working much faster , even if it meant I had to dip it into the paint tray regularly . With this item , you still have to stop and pump , so there 's not time savings.If you 're doing the ceilings and want a major workout , buy this . You 'll have muscles in places you never imagined .	-1
My plastic check valve broke after 2 quarts of paint . Sent Wagner a email . Wagner sent me one check valve , and I would need to buy more . I figure having 20 check valves would be fine .	-1
Wow , we were primates that used to use a hand held roller to paint our walls ! The back ooh the back . This item , for the price , is a terrific product for the sheer fact that it is easy to assembly , easy to use and clean up was pretty easy too because there were not many little parts . Sure , on the first paint pull , you find it all goes to the roller , but little on the wall for some reason . But one the second fill , you are off , and my Hubbie was dashing to the finish line in no time . Of course , you still need the roller/brush to do the tricky areas near the ceiling or floor . Only on star deduction was for the fact we had a tricky time using it in our 4 foot wide hall way as the plunger is long once you have pulled in a full tube of fresh paint . Other than that , I really love the item . We did consider buying the 'autonamtic ' one that would have added an extra pound . I would recommend it as we found the manual process very easy to use , and the item is heavy once you have a full tube of paint in it.Took this down to a 2 star from 4 stars : next day look and decided the roller is awful for us : left a textured and blotchy look . I know if the roller is not saturated enough , but we did a huge space , it all blotchy . I ca n't use other rollers with this product so I am suck with their brand . We are going to have to repaint with more professional rollers that will leave a smooth finish on the wall . Ooh yuck . Great concept , but could n't they put in better quality roller , really .	-1
I had an older Brinkman that lasted me for years trouble-free , I got this as a Christmas gift and the thing is broken right out of the box Wont work at all , And Amazon will not take it as a defective return because it is considered hazardous waste now I have to deal with disposal and try and get my mom inl-aws money back .	-1
The color on the cap does not match the paint color . It is actually much darker and not as glossy as I expected . It also does not stick as well as some of the older Fusion Plastic paint I have used . It also seems more sensitive to how clean the surface is . I rarely saw any problems with any of the previous Fusion Plastic paint I used ( over a year ago ) . I really used to like how well the Fusion Plastic paint worked on plastic and similar surfaces but very disappointed with the results from this can .	-1
Too expensive here , the price at Wallyworld is much cheaper . And I usually ca n't say that about most products . Rating is based on price only , the product is a good one otherwise .	-1
I have done finish carpentry for thirty five years , and for twenty five of those I have used a Schlage lock gig.Thought it was time to update , you know round corner faceplates and all.Well , do n't waste your time or money.This tool is the worst I have tried in some time ! It will not hold to the door unless you tighten so tight it will crush the door.The 2 1/8 bit I do n't think would cut through butter.I did not try the faceplate cutters , but they look good !	-1
I have installed scores of doors as part of remodels or new construction laid out by hand and carefully bored with forstner bits . With 16 doors to install and limited time , I thought it was time to buy a `` professional '' boring jig.This jig is the same pattern as several others currently on the market or made in the past but is made without the attention to tight tolerances in manufacture . The biggest single problem is that the two clamping jaws are not PARALLEL and regardless of any attempt to adjust them I could not make them clamp evenly . Even trying to shim the gaps resulted in uneven clamping pressure.The lack of parallelism causes dents in the door where it contacts first , and also allows the jig to pivot out of position.Other reviewers have already noted the sloppy bushings and limited quality bits.Neither this or any other jig on the market will make everyone a professional installer . Even professionals pay careful detail to how they use their tools and do not expect them to be substitutes for their own lack of experience or attention . However this tool does not work well regardless of the level of attention given . ( I have returned the kit and will spend the $ 400 for a well respected boring jig which is available elsewhere . ) Incidentally , I do n't know why this or any other door installation kits include the `` striker '' cutting tools that are used in conjunction with chisels . Everyone that I know use routers and guides to mortise for strike plates and bolt recesses . The money thrown away with those parts should have gone to better manufacturing tolerances which would have made this a usable tool .	-1
Not durable . The bladder burst after the third use within 2-3 days . It is not big enough to fit a four inch iron pipe , for three inch iron pipe , it 'll do the job . For the price , it is what it is . You may receive a good one , cross your fingers .	-1
Master Lock failed with this product . There are 2 design flaws . One ... the push button used to set the adjustable length of the bar , retracts with pressure on the bar . Push down on the top of the bar and you can watch the button start to retract . Once installed a the door provides even more leverage for increased pressure to retract the button and easily defeat this bar . Secondly ... the padded foot is made out of nylon and slides easily on smooth floors . It should have been made out of rubber to grab the floor.I pointed these issues out to Master Lock and they sent me replacements , of which I had hoped would include design changes but this was not the case . I received the same flawed security bars . Clearly , the Master Lock name means less than what it had in the past.Others have made modifications to their bars which have corrected the flaws , but we should get what we paid for without doing this .	-1
This device collapses while trying to wedge/deploy it against a doorknob . I discovered this after a few attempts and thought perhaps I was doing something wrong -- I was n't . Do n't take a chance on this junk .	-1
I bought this for a female friend who just moved and apparently the non slip bottom came off rendering it completely useless . Not sure what else messed up with it but she could n't fix it .	-1
This may or may not work for you . I tried it on a smooth linoleum floor and it 's pretty bad . Any level of dust or pet hair would make this weaker . The construction is 'ok ' for $ 15 , but not super . Not sure why you would use this as a sliding glass door bar since you can cut a dowel to size for about $ 2 .	-1
I have bought this security bar from Amazon in the past . Master Lock security bar works very well.This time I ordered one for my mother , Alena , but did not notice it was coming from Taylor Security ? When I got the box it was damaged and product too . When I went to return the process was slow.IF YOU BUY THIS ITEM MAKE SURE YOU ORDER FROM AMAZON AND NOT TYALOR SERCURITY , who ever they are ?	-1
I braced my door with this and had the stopper braced properly . A solid cement step held the bottomw firmly in place . Sure enough , the same person who broke in came back 5 nights later and kicked my back door in with this device in place . I 'm not happy at all . I trusted this device to protect my home and now I 've lost another $ 1000 in belongings . If you want to brace a door , get yourself long bolts and brace your door with a 2X6 and screw the hardware in on each side to hold it up . I 'm not sure the name of the metal pieces but they simply are used to baricade the door .	-1
I installed a Fluidmaster Pro to replace a leaking toilet control . The instructions were not very good and the illustrations were poor . I have repaired toilet valves a number of times so the instruction quality was not very important for me . I am very handy at fixing things around the house and I enjoy repairing things not just for me but for the neighbors as well.The Fluidmaster would not stop running . It would turn on every 10 to 20 minutes and run for a few seconds . It was in our bedroom so I would hear it wasting water . I purged it several times per their instructions and it just kept running . I purged it and adjusted it again and again and nothing change . It kept turning on for no reason every now and then . I finally got mad and bought a new one but made by Korky . The Korky one installed more easily with better instructions better quality and worked fine right away.So my final advice is to buy Korky and avoid Fluidmaster . The Fluidmaster valve is just too finicky .	-1
This was the first time I used hammered finished paint and it did n't work well for me ( it might be operator error ) . I do n't think I put enough paint on to get the hammered effect . I used it like regular paint and when finished , it looked like regular gray paint on the metal grinder stand I painted . I think a person should find information on how to use hammered paint to get the effect before using . Also , this is almost 2x the cost than the same paint can be purchased in local retail big box stores .	-1
Got my first one , broken base plastic piece at the bottom of the tripod . Requested for an exchange , then broken tripod adjustment knob and missing bolt on the light handle . Give up trying to get a functional set , requested a refund . I seriously do n't mind paying $ 10 more and have something that does n't look like jerry-rigged from some scrap metal .	-1
Very bright , but poorly made . I 've had to build a new base for it already and I 'm just barely getting by with the fractured bracket on one of the lights . All of the screws that hold this thing together are attached to flimsy , thin , brittle plastic . I bumped it with a piece of lumber on my work table and rather than rock up on two legs and come back down as you would expect , the support leg just snapped and it fell straight over and broke the bracket on the light . There 's no way to fix it , since it 's just fractured plastic , but if it had been metal on metal , like any serious tool , I could have JB welded it or drilled a new hole . Unfortunately , I 've had to scrap the entire base and build a new one out of extra material that I had laying around . I will probably end up having to JB weld the light in a fixed position because right now I 'm getting by with over-tightening the screw on the opposite side . If you 're going to be extremely gentle with it , this is a good price for a lot of light .	-1
I 've used Elmer 's Carpenters Wood Glue for years , but recently I bought some of the Titebond to give it a try . I 'm building a shelving unit out of 3/4 '' birch plywood with 12 '' shelves , mitered at each corner.I started out using the Titebond . After gluing a number of miters together I realized I made a mistake and had to take several corners apart . Kind of frustrated , I just pushed in on the boards , and they came right apart . I really did n't think they were held together stongly enough . So , I switched back to Elmers . And , I did an experiment . I waited 24 hours after gluing a joint with Elmers , just like I had with Titebond , and tried the same thing . I could n't break the joint apart . I did n't try with all my strength , just the same amount I had used on the Titebond joint , and more . But , the joint held . So , I 'm convinced the Elmer 's is better for gluing mitered plywood joints .	-1
I used this to hold a molding on a faux fireplace i was building and ended up just hammering the pieces on because the glue alone would not hold .	-1
Franklin International has an aggressive sales promotion program to sale their products , and it has worked . My son used Titebond to glue a project in his bedroom and he become deathly sick by urea formaldehyde fumes . He called the company and asked them to put a warning on their product and they were very rude to him , to the point the representative was calling him names . For those who use their fingers to spread this glue , please read the MSDS ; `` If absorbed through the skin may produce kidney , liver and central nervous system damage . '' `` Avoid prolong breathing of vapor . Contains acetone , hexane and toluene . '' F.I . claims it is safe once it dries , but if you study urea formaldehyde you will see it off-gasses for ten years . I feel much safer with Elmer 's and Weldwood . They are all stronger then the wood you are gluing , so what 's the point of picking the strongest . I have used Elmer 's for 30 years and no project has ever came apart . Elmer 's company is very helpful and honest . I use Weldwood for special projects and so far , it has worked well . No glue is completely safe for humans , so for me it is very important to deal with a company I can trust . U.S. Schools have trusted Elmer 's for fifty years . I will not allow any chipboard , particleboard , or F.I . products in my woodshop . Please study all the products you are handling instead of believing advertizements .	-1
The light indicators are inconsistent and confusing . half the time the garage is closed , it 'll tell me it 's open , or that it ca n't connect with the unit ( despite being less than 40 feet away ) .	-1
Worked for less than a week . Thought it was a bad battery , but still did n't work after replacing the battery . Tried to reporgram it and still did n't work . Requested to send it back and sellar never contacted me back .	-1
The product was obviously used w/ pry marks on the transmitter . It literally fell apart when I opened the box . When I opened the transmitter , ( since in trouble-shooting it told me it was the battery ) I saw that someone had simply put a piece of tape over the battery to hold it in place . I will solder it somehow as a permanent fix , but if it still does n't work , I 'm taking the loss . Returning it is a colossal pain . My garage is only 15 yards away in a straight line w/ the receiver , and it still does n't receive the signal . Looks nice in the picture , but it 's a piece of junk .	-1
At least 4 times a day , the lights would start toggling as it loses signal and I had to unplug and re-plug the power cord.There 's no ability to shut the garage door - which is something I thought it had , but it 's my fault for not reading it.I 'm sure there 's something better out there ...	-1
Sometimes it 's ok , then other times is flashes red-green all night ( communications failure ) . When it works - its great . So-so over all .	-1
Range is terrible . The thing is only about 50 % reliable.The picture does not show you the piece of wire sticking out of the top of the unit that acts as an antenna . This makes the thing look like cheap garbage.I would NOT recommend buying this at all.I got an old power pack that was laying around the house , a 12 volt LED , and a magnetic sensor and wired up my own . It is 100 % reliable and only cost about $ 12 .	-1
the glue would not come out of the bottleI think it was old or had been frozenbe aware	-1
I read all the previous reviews and I was particularly interested in using an effective product that did not contain harsh fumes and could be used indoors . I have a Weatherby rifle stock , that has a urethane or epoxy finish that was resisting any of the other non-fume strippers that I had tried , so I thought I 'd give this a shot . FORGET IT ! This stuff might be useful as a glaze for a ham , but is totally ineffective in removing urethane finish . I applied it THICK ! I did n't brush it on , I poured it on . It clings extremely well and I was able to establish a 1/8 '' coating on the stock . It was 75 degrees , indoors , and I left it on for five days ! In the end , there was a spot about two inches square ( the same spot I would test scrape daily ) that removed some finish . The rest of the stock was untouched by this stripper . The bottle says it will do about 50 square feet . Well my stock is about 3 square feet at most and I used about half a quart ( like I said I layed it on thick ) to no avail . This product might do well with varnish , shellac , or perhaps paint ; but as for urethane , it is totally useless . I guess it 's time for harsh chemical time !	-1
I thought that this might be a little bit better , because of the thickness . The first time I used it tied down tight on my trailer , it ripped as bad as some of the cheap ones I have bought . One trip and that was the last.Why do they make these so thin ? I would rather pay a little more and get one that last awhile .	-1
I was looking for a really heavy tarp to lay down under a tent to help reduce punctures in the tent floor on rocks and such . This tarp is the same thickness or thinner than any tarp you can find at home depot . The grommets are carelessly attached . I have not used the tarp yet , but I will be surprised if it lasts more than once camping trip .	-1
This tarp was done after 8 months in the SoCal sun . I am very disappointed in its UV resistance and overall performance ,	-1
The 4 stars review is due to a few things.1 . As other reviews have noted the angled plate that joins the fence to the miter plate could be made better . it could even be made at a 90 degree angle so you would n't have to use strips of paper to shim it until it was square . The out of square is the fence vertically in relation to the table.Incra should have used a machined part for this or paid more attention to quality control.2 . Only three screws used to hold the sled to the miter bar , unless I missed a trick here it is possible to twist the sled on the miter bar when checking for slop in your setup . You can actually see it moving a bit . I honestly thing it could use a few more fasteners ... 3 . The tiny tiny allen head screws used to adjust the miter bar to fit you table saw miter slot . I did n't strip any , but I did use a screwdriver ti pry the white bushings open a bit to avoid problems . A larger screw would be the right thing to do here.4 . The free hold down clamp tends to pull your work away from the fence . just use a block between it and your work it you use it at all.Basically if you just want a 90 degree crosscut sled , make one.Do n't get me wrong I 'm not bashing I love this thing but it 's not perfect by any means . If you want a great miter sled here it is . With a little work it is very accurate.Here is how to actually adjust it to be truly square.http : //youtu.be/UbG-n -- LFgQ Watch the last part of the video where he is actually adjusting his sled and just copy him . It works very well.The formula is : A-B=X A being the side furthest away from you.X/4=YY/L =ZZxD= your actual number of thousandths in correctionA is the top of your fifth cut ( away from you ) B is the bottom of your fifth cut ( towards you ) X is the difference between these two . Negative number , the fence needs to move towards you . Positive number , go away from you.Y is your actual error in your fenceL is the length of you last cut ( just get it within 1/4 '' for a useable number ) Z is the error in your fence divided by the length of your last cut.D is the distance from your pivot point to where you choose to measure with dial or feeler gauges to adjust your fence . ( make it away from the pivot point 20 '' or so ) the further the better within reason.You come up with a number in thousandths that is your actual correction factor at the point of D. Set up a dial gauge and make yourself perfectly square the first time.If the youtube link did n't work search `` 5 cuts to a perfect crosscut sled '' .UPDATE 2.13.2014Every time I move the miter setting and make a cut it does n't rest to a true 90 degrees . It is off just a bit.The unit is n't solidly made enough to hold it 's adjustment . They should have used aluminum for everything.You can grab the mdf base and twist it visibly out of adjustment . So putting it on the saw/ taking it off , cutting stock all the things you should be able to do with a sled ... ... ... .will knock this thing out of whack.My recommendation is to build your own sleds . Make one with a pivoting fence and use a protractor to set it.I am tired of cutting test pieces and re-zeroing this thing .	-1
My needs are not such that this tool was not necessary , but I needed some new batteries , and for a few dollars more , I received a tool . I suppose others will find uses for it . It is a good tool as most Dewalt tools , but it is quite bulky , and although not the tool 's fault , this is a messy tool .	-1
I purchased the DeWalt DC550KA about two years ago when I needed to make several circuit box cut-outs in drywall during a kitchen renovation . I was swayed by the initial positive reviews , the brand , its portability over the Rotozip , and that it complemented my other existing DeWalt 18V tools.My first use on a box cut-out was very disappointing . It had plenty of power and speed but quickly spent one battery before I could complete the entire cut . Other attempts yielded similar results with other charged batteries.I was not going to post a review but felt compelled when it was receiving so many favorable one . Besides the poor run-time , the spindle lock was awkward and not well designed . Unlike most solidly designed and built DeWalt 18V tools , this tool is not designed for prolonged or rigorous use.I would only recommend this kit if you needed the extra batteries or the case ( it fits the DeWalt DW960 right angle 18V drill , charger , and two batteries ) .	-1
I love my 18v Dewalt variety & was thrilled when I found this option for a drywall gun . After receiving the item I noticed immediately how cheap the front section/nose piece was . I put much thought into the new tool , researched other reviews of corded drywall drills & made my decisions ; This would be fine for small installations ... in which case a normal cordless screw gun/drill that most of us already own would realistically work fine.When installing lots of screws ( the whole purpose of a drywall gun ) the cordless weight & flaws would slow the process down.So , I returned this product , purchased a cordless DEWALT DC550B rotozip ( which seems great all around ) to eliminate a cord & bought a corded drywall gun DEWALT DW276 for the long haul .	-1
I usually like Dewalt tools but I do n't know if it was Amazon 's fault or if it was poor quality from Dewalt . The switch for the speed control will not stay in the number 1 or number 2 position . I think Amazon sent me a tool that had been used and returned .	-1
Looks good and feels good , but the belt walks so much you end up with more shavings from the belt than the wood . No matter what you do , you ca n't keep the belt from traveling off track . Not worth it , even for the occasional user such as me . Spend a little more the first time , that 's what I 'm going to have to do now .	-1
This sander is easy to use . It does not connect to a shop vac . The saw dust collector has a small rectangular outlet .	-1
The plunger ca n't automatically raise smoothly.Requested a replacement.The plastic smell seems strong like cheap plastics . A bit curious about the quality . But it seems quite , so I 'd like to have another try with the replacement one .	-1
I purchased a number of items that were returned when I decided to have the repaires made on my American Flyer trains by the dealer . I felt my skill sets did not include electrical repairs - so it was me and the the item . I did not even open the package .	-1
If this unit had an extra setting to allow for silent arming and disarming + a volume adjustment on the chime mode , it would be an acceptable device for indoor use . Returned to vendor ...	-1
I was not pleased with the results of this night light , the light output did not meet my expectations especially for the higher price point than its competition	-1
Bought 4 of these . I did not work at all when it arrived . It was replaced by amazon . Another one worked fine for 5 weeks and then just died . I would not recommend this product due to the production QA . The remaining lights that are working are pretty nice but not near worth $ 17 !	-1
I ordered three of these nightlights . Of the three , one did not work at all . The other two do light up . They sense movement and light right up but do so in bright daylight and in total darkness . They should n't light up during the day time.I ordered the G.E . brand nightlights in the hope that they would not be cheap `` Made in China '' garbage . They are cheap `` Made in China '' garbage . I 'd hoped that , if they only lit up at night , and if they only lit up when someone was close by , `` the fading over time '' brightness problem that seems to be inherent to all LED lighting items would be at least be reduced.I do n't know what type of nightlight you should choose , but this is n't it . Returning them is more trouble than it 's worth.R	-1
I bought several types of lights to compare them . All the different types work well except this one . When I first plug it in it will work for a few seconds but then it will not work no matter what you do .	-1
I am interested in RF and EMF.I was excited to receive this meter and quickly tried it out.Battery checked fine.Most readings were zero even though I have wireless router , cell phone and cordless phones ( DECT 6 ) .When it would read anything it was just in a very narrow angle and I had to have the meter face turned toward the area of the reading.After looking at working units on You Tube , mine was obviously Defective.Brand New arrived DOA ! I am not impressed with the build quality , externally it is obviously built with Radio Shack parts . Common box , meter , switch all stock parts with a custom printed back plate.Hard to imagine how much the electronics inside would cost much at all.I will either find some one who has high end meters to rent or buy top quality equipment.Also of interest is the other feedback saying that this does not measure RF from a wireless source.UPDATE Checked out these meters on YouTube and this one was obviously DOA , bought it from Amazon Warehouse , obviously it was DOA and then they sold it to me . Bummer .	-1
This device is selected when I searched for `` Geiger Counter '' but this is NOT a geiger counter nor is it related to one . Itwill not measure radioactivity . Period . It is kind ofmisleading that it appears by this search .	-1
This field strength meter is good at detecting magnetic fields , not so good on microwave and radio.Needs very strong microwave/radio to show up . Example - cell phone booting up or initiating a call will move needle .	-1
I have had this sander for several yrs . now . When I first used it I thought it was better than the Porter-Cable and it was . This year I had alot of wood restoring to do . So I decided to look around to see if I could find something better in the sanding dept . You see prep and sanding is the longest part on projects such as these . Efficiency is what I 'm after . I purchased the Ridgid 6 in . orbital . Variable speed/variable orbit , on and on . Hands down I got what I was looking for . Efficiency ! If you think this dewalt is the ticket , you have n't shopped around !	-1
After using these in a fabrication shop these do not stand up to commercial use . The bits have started coming apart after only maybe an hour of use grinding down welds . Looks like I have to spend more money on a better product .	-1
First off , the packet did not come with 1/2 size holders , which is annoying ... poor quality control . Luckily I dont have too many that size . Secondly , they do not come on the rails , you have to put them on yourself , which is a royal pain and makes your fingers hurt	-1
Bits are not hardened and will round or get stuck in allen screw . Very disappointed and have given up on Dewalt products .	-1
I might have gotten a bad unit but this 'flashlight ' is a joke . Ultra Task ? ? ? ? please ... Sad truth but i have a $ 2 lighter that has a brighter LED on the other end . Apparently its only 8LM which is weak considering its a $ 14 light . My friend bought a lot of 100 6LED 1xAAA key-chain flashlights for $ 120shipped from China - he gives them out as gifts for customers and Gerber barely outshines them .	-1
I recently purchased both this Gerber Infinity and theStreamlight 66318 MicroStream LED Pen Flashlight . I have to say , this is n't a bad light unless you have a competitor 's for comparison . It simply has nothing on the Streamlight . The Streamlight is brighter ( a lot ) , smaller , lighter , more white-blueish , and uses a AAA rather than a AA battery . Both lights seem like they would take a 20 foot fall and are highly durable . The Streamlight has a pushbutton , this light is twist for on . I 'm not sure which one is better , I do n't really care . The Streamlight just simply seems superior in lightage , and design . This one is so heavy I do n't understand who would want to clip it on a shirt.. Maybe a belt.Even the Streamlight is kind of heavy for a shirt ( it still has a AAA battery ) , but at-least it is doable.Again , not a bad micro-flashlight , just inferior in every way to an alternative that only cost a buck more.UPDATE : The new Streamlight 66318 C4 is out making the Gerber light is even more useless than it was before . The C4 is substantially more bright than the regular Streamlight 66318 . It 's brighter even with a SANYO Eneloop battery , and whenever it runs dead I 'll just recharge it .	-1
I got this and was quite disappointed by quality , light output , pretty much everything . OK its not a pro light such as the Olight M10 or some cheaper clones but still even if you want it as a utility light there are better cheaper option out there.. Anyway I was disappointed so i returned it and got a refund and eventually got a M10 for my backpack and also a single AAA keychain model for another bag I frequently carry . Both are higher quality than this light .	-1
there are smaller brighter and less expensive lights it is durable but just too big to carry on knife sheath .	-1
not bright at all . i hate the twist-on style switch . Not badly made but performs like a $ 6 flashlight .	-1
I 'm usually a big fan of Gerber products and own several of their knives and multi-tools . This was disappointing . I accidentally dropped this in some water while working outside and it has n't worked since . It also ca n't be taken apart to access the bulb so self repair or cleaning is not an option .	-1
These countersinks will create a hole and a countersink with difficult . They are quite ineffective at removing waste so your drill needs to back in and out constantly to avoid jamming and burning .	-1
Ok FEIN , when are you going to eliminate blade slippage by upgrading the design of the drive pattern from the current Round to a Star drive ? It is my opinion that you are too slow in responding to customer requests to improve the drive design and I reluctantly returned my unit because of frequent slippage . All of you newer blades have the Star drive but the power head still relies on compression , thus friction by the washer and bolt to hold the blade in place . Your current solution is an adapter , which is nothing more than a washer that has sandpaper like surface/carbide particles to increase the friction . Not an acceptable solution for and expensive tool.When you finally get around to improving the design , I will purchase a machine again but I will definitely wait until the new design is released .	-1
The utility versus cost is not there for these blades . While rated for metal , they are destroyed in one use it they encounter a nail or screw .	-1
The Fein Multimaster is a great product , solid , sturdy , and well engineered . The blades and accessories are absolutely terrible . First off , the blades are extremely thin , if you touch a finish nail with the e-cut blade , consider $ 25 out the window as the blade is ruined . If you even look at a nail , or use is on hard woods , or cut too fast with one of their wood blades , it will destroy it . For the price of these blades , they should be considerably more durable than they are . I give these blades 1 star as they are overpriced by a wide margin , poorly constructed , proprietary , and limited . Go with a cheap one like Rockwell or Dremell , the parts and blades are cheaper and available everywhere , and it does the same thing as the overpriced Fein .	-1
They do n't last very long at all , they get dull cutting wood and are worthless if you hit one nail even though they are a bimetal blade .	-1
Extremely pricey for what it is , although it works well . BUT , after less than 4 months of use , it blows warm for 3-4 minutes , then the heater element switches off and it blows cold air . This is just poor workmanship.It was used to boost the heat a little in a small bathroom , and only for about 15 minutes in the morning . I purchased it last February.If you like to gamble and are made of money , buy it ! You 'll love it , as many other reviewers have , and you may get lucky . But for my hard earned money , I 'll get something a little more solid such as a milkhouse heater next time .	-1
Brand new out of the box , this unit emits a very audible hum on the low setting . Also , on the low setting , set to maintain a temperature of 60 degrees in my garage ( which does allow it to cycle up/down ) , after about 3 days its thermal protection system shuts it down . Perhaps my particular unit is defective and should be returned to Amazon.com , but I can not discuss this with Vornado over the phone because they are closed down for two weeks over the holidays . Also , be advised that : 1 ) Vornado 's instructions specifically warn NOT to use this unit to heat outside buildings or pet kennels , and ; 2 ) if it breaks during its one-year warranty period , Vornado will charge you ... [ undisclosed dollar amount ] for `` shipping and handling '' to repair . That amount is almost 17 % of the purchase price and is ridiculous , given that actual shipping cost could not be more than ... [ undisclosed dollar amount ] , and `` handling '' of a defective unit ought to be at Vornado 's expense , not the consumer 's .	-1
I tried to blow up a huge mining dump truck tire with this thing , it took me 2 weeks to do it . Very slow . I even left it on during the night .	-1

The adaptor that is supposed to attach the hose to the tire valve is difficult to get into proper position & almost impossible to remove without releasing much air from the tire as the rubber seal is poorly made.But worst - the connector does n't grip the valve tight enough to allow it to be inflated since pushing down the lever to lock the connector in place causes it to lift on one side , breaking the seal.I 've used these types of device often and know how to work the lock - this one is just crap . Cheaply made from folded metal rather than a casting . Silicon rubber in place of proper rubber seals . Crap.I may return the item . I may invalidate my warranty by fitting it with the hose off my old compressor that gave years of great service but stripped a gear just before Christmas , just to see if it can inflate a tire when given a fighting chance ( I 'm not sanguine - the `` stroke '' sounded very short ) .Even if the compressor were working the cable/hose storage compartment is hopelessly undersized and cramped , making each deployment of the wretched thing a struggle.Do not buy this worthless device . You will be sorry . [ EDIT ] I recently bought aViair 00088 88P Portable Air Compressorfor just a little more than twice what this useless thing cost , and it is a vastly better made machine that works , works well and works relatively quietly . You have to clip it to your battery rather than plug it in your cigar lighter , but offsetting that is that it works . Do yourself a favor and look at this before you make a mistake . [ /EDIT ] [ EDIT 7/22/13 ] Yesterday I finally had a clean-out and put this piece of junk on my curbside . I made it clear I did n't have much time for it by not packing up the hose or wires , leaving them in a jumbled pile , and just dropping the rear cargo hatch on the ground beside it . To hammer home the derisive quality of the device I put a non-functioning humane varmint trap next to it . Someone took both within the hour . [ /EDIT ]	-1
Made of super-cheap plastic and very noisy . The lock lever on the nozzle is also cheap plastic and I feel like it 's going to snap off every time I lock it . The reviews were good , but I guess in this price range I should have lowered my expectations . It works , but I also have a Black & Decker ASI300 and prefer it in some ways . For example , it does n't dance around on pavement the way the Campbell Hausfeld does . You basically have to hold this unit in your hand the entire time . Otherwise , it will scoot five feet away . Also , the on/off switch has a dopey design . Down is on and up is off -- like an upside down light switch . Have a closer look at the photo of this product and you 'll see .	-1
These glasses do the job of protecting your eyes , but unless you 're 6'6 & # 34 ; , chances are these glasses are too large for you . They do n't adjust well , and seemed to never find a spot to settle into . Just turning my head to sneeze has sent them flying to the floor . Go for the DPG55-11C for better adjustment and comfort .	-1
not nearly as anti-fog as expected , not very comfortable , expensive for what you get , below usual `` DeWalt '' quality level	-1
These glasses look lovely ! I love the iridescent & # 34 ; fire & # 34 ; mirror lenses . The lenses are much thicker and tougher than those on regular sunglasses , and understandably so , since these lenses are ANSI Z87.1 compliant , impact-resistant protective eyewear . Although these glasses are meant to be used as protective eyewear , they are snazzy enough to also be used as regular sunglasses -- and a casual observer would be none the wiser ! One gripe I do have - that a couple of other reviewers have also stated - is that the lenses scratch very easily . Right out of the box , one of the lenses already has a sizable scratch right in the middle of the lens . When I put on the sunglasses , the scratch is very visible since it 's right in the middle of my field of vision . I 'm usually very forgiving of most defects but the scratch is annoying enough that I feel it warrants a one-star rating for the glasses.Such a shame . These glasses are going back .	-1
I get these safely glasses hoping to use them for small intricate work but found them to be less then useless . I recommend any kind of head mounted magnifying glass over these if you plan on doing anything more than reading small text .	-1
Update : The first time I wore one of these it scratched . And there should have been NOTHING to scratch it on as I had it hanging around my neck by itself . As I used them throughout the day , I began to notice my neck getting sore . The bifocal part is simply too low , requiring me to lean my head back to read anything that is higher than my stomach.I go through a lot of safety glasses because I keep my reading glasses on neck-loop and used to have to hold them up to my safety glasses when I needed to read something in an area where safety glasses are required . Now I can leave my reading glasses off , and just wear the safety glasses . Since I can leave them on , even when reading , they will get much less scratching .	-1
But they came 'pre-scratched ' . Not really possible to 'buff ' them out and it 's right where you have to look through them too ! Bummer .	-1
The left eye has a pair of deep and wide scratches right where my pupil is , so I end up with hemianopia . Shipping was good , and contrary to previous reviews I have no issue with the bifocal placement - it 's optimal for where I wear them on my nose . You ca n't expect a stock pair of glasses to fit every face well , but it fit my very average face well and they were quite comfortable.If only they were n't so badly scratched I ca n't see out of one eye ... ..	-1
The basic idea of adding the bifocal lens to the glases is good and useful . However , in these glasses , the bifocal lens takes up way too much vertical field of view , so you are constantly looking through the bifocals when you do n't want to , producing a slight blur to your vision . Consequently you find yourself making little 'adjustments ' frequently - shifting your view up or down . After a while this is a pain in the neck .	-1
The bifocal spots are terrible because they are focused to just a foot from your face . How many people use power tools that close to their face ? ? ? ? ? ?	-1
The primary flaw with these glasses is that the magnifying section goes up 40 % of the way into my field of view so often it is necessary for me to tilt my head down so I can look over this part of the glasses . Fit is good and they stay in place with no problems . Not worth doing a return but I will not be using the eyeglasses due to this problem.Adding a tubular sleeve for protection was a nice touch but someone at DeWalt forgot to measure the eyeglasses and so the sleeve is a full inch too short . Most cheap safety glasses do not come with any type of cover so at least DeWalt gets a point for effort .	-1
Makes up for a negative side-effect of the Little Giant ladder design . Because of the way the ladders have telescoping sections , the steps are very narrow , which can be painful to stand on for any length of time.The downside is that this platform is kludgy , awkward , and a little scary to use.You insert the platform so that it hangs inside the ladder , climb the ladder to the rung above the platform , then use your foot to push the platform outward into position ( watching to make sure that the lip on the platform is locked safely over the lower rung ) , finally you step down onto the platform.There are two notched arms that hang on each end of the outer edge of the platform . You can see them in the closeup photo on this site . The murky photos in the directions attempt to show the arms being used somehow with the platform to make a second A-frame ladder when the Little Giant ladder is separated . When handling the platform , and when I tried the platform for a couple of minutes , the two arms were always in the way.The platform floor is perforated , but is not smooth as shown in the main photo . The round holes on the unit I got are punched with a tall , sharp upward rim , so that the platform is serrated like a cheese grater . Should be safer but not as comfortable to stand on.My Little Giant ladder is made very well . It is beautifully designed and depends on solid connections , not welds . However , the safety of this platform depends on two end-on welds of curved tubing to the two side brackets . Probably fine , but those two welds make me nervous.Returning the platform . I should have looked more closely at the close-up photo on this site .	-1
I purchased this to use with my black giant little giant ladder that I got stuck with because when I purchased it as a gift , it came in and looked used , anyway , when I was using it , it bent when it slammed against the house .	-1
Nice headgear on headlamp , but it seems as though headlamp use 's a lot of batteries , and for the price I expected a little better light .	-1
I have had two of these for the last 4 years . One failed almost immediately , but Kwikset sent me replacement keypad and I had to pay a lock smith again to install it . Now the other lock failed on me . The motor that turns the bolt wont work . Kwikset wont help me and cant even manage to figure out the problem.My Master Locksmith said these are a P.O.S . and to buy the Schlage keylees as it doesnt have a motor to fail.I would give these `` 0 '' Stars but it wont allow me .	-1
I have purchased and installed two of these locks over a two year period . Both started to malfunction within a year . The motor whines but the bolt only moves halfway in or out of the lock . I tried taking the cover off and lubing everything with silicone spray which worked for about two or three weeks.I really liked the look of this lock so I purchased a 2nd one to replace the first one after I was tired of performing `` maintenance '' on it so often . The 2nd lock worked for a while then started doing the same thing.After reading other reviews it appears this lock has a fundamental mechanical defect that is not conducive to long term residential use . My next lock with be a brand other than Kwikset . I have no patience for inferior , sub-standard products .	-1
I bought 2 more than 2 years ago . Installed only one . After a year , the thing started beeping , read troubleshoot , said keypad was bad , tried to find all over the internet the freeking 17733-1 keypad that NO ONE SELLS , not even ebay ! , so i used the brand new keypad i had . After i few months , beeps again . Changed it for a Schlage . This is a terrible product . I payed 150 for each ! ! ! This product really sux . Read reviews before buying .	-1
have to return this , after I installed it , which meant putting 5 new holes into my steel door ( holes in places a new lock wont cover ) this lock failed to have the power to open and close even with the door open . it is so under powered . I can see why they dont allow us to post our own photos , this has plastic gears in it ! dont wast your time installing . it works fine out of the box on the table but as soon as it has to push the bold in and out , it cant do it . I should have known kwikset would disappoint me , it always does . but this was in stock at the store and I needed one right away.dont waste your time .	-1
it did n't last very long the push button fell off the light refused to work i would never buy this product again something wrong with the switch mechanisms i bought a couple of these flashlights and the same problem	-1
I have a number of Rayovacs I have relamped with with LEDs and been very satisfied with their function.This one , for me , is an unreliable loser . I ordered this because I wanted a 2-D cell , flat bottom , yellow barrel flashlight.When it arrived , I inserted two fresh 'D ' Duracells and observed the light produced was orange -- not the usual incandescent yellowish glow . I should have realized this meant it had some poor , internal connection which produced resistance.I went ahead and swapped out the incandescent bulb for a new LED . To my surprise , it was not as bright as some 1990s Rayovac flashlights I had relamped with LEDs . Moreover , the light would not always go on when switched 'on ' . I disassembled & reassembled the flashlight to assure everything was in proper position and tightly seated . The light would go on but was unevenly bright from one use to the next . Sometimes , in a single use , its brightness would fluctuate repeatedly . Sometimes the light would flicker on & off.At its best , this 2-D cell flashlight , with an LED , was never as bright as either of my old 2-AA Rayovac & Eveready flashlights which had also been relamped with LEDs.This one is a loser .	-1
this turned my soapstone table yellow . I had to sand it to fix it . I 'd never recommend it to anyone . The worse part , is it did n't even clean it .	-1
IMHO . . .In my opinion , this product leaves behind a film that actually *traps* typical dirt and make 's it twice as hard to remove unless you use the same product over and over to clean it again , and again , and again , and again , as build-up occurs much faster due to the film 's attraction to dirt , especially traffic filth , so buy a case of this stuff and figure your weekends are booked for the next . . .Preparation is 9/10ths of the job ... ..If you have n't installed yout tile yet , you may want to consider the EPOXY grouts , often used on tiled kitchen countertops . No , not the acrylic caulking compound disguised as a grout , but real epoxy.A much better alternative.Epoxy is an inert material , and once allowed to cure is impervious to ANY liquid with the exception of industrial solvents [ xylene , toulene ] that really have no place being anywhere near a kitchen in the first place unless your kitchen is a meth lab or crack house . It does take some finesse to initially apply , and one should address one small area at a time [ 4sqft ] as once this stuff cures [ please follow curing directions thoroughly ] , nothing short of a Hilti rotary hammer will remove it . So unlike typical grouts , you must clean and smooth your joints BEFORE you move on to the next area . Now , if you are hiring out the work , remember that installers HATE epoxy grout [ I think I 've actually seen one break out in hives at its mere mention ] , since unlike the very forgiving , very easy to work with but not live with sanded grouts , so they will often try and talk the customer into sticking with traditional grouts and apply this stuff afterwards . You see , they can charge up the wazoo for what is essentially diluted-down poly , and just like sanded grouts , very easy to apply . Which is great since you 'll be doing it or paying someone else to do it over and over and over [ you get the idea ] .Measure twice , cut once.This product is directed at folks who did n't do the job correctly to begin with and now need to cover-up their mess . But why should Sparky be the only one chasing his tail ? Sparky would give it five stars but he ca n't reach the keyboard.UPDATE : 8/19/2008First , I must apologize for not making some of my points clearer at the expense of a tongue and cheek approach : Mia culpa.This update addresses the sense of some who felt there was little benefit gained by the review and one taking the time to share their thoughts in the `` Comments '' section.More to the point : The sealer IS the film , whether it 's above the surface or below ; which is the whole point of my review . Sorry for not making that clear . Basically , it 's like Scotchguard treatments , which do indeed protect from spills , but allows grime to be ground in and adhere to the sealer or Protecter . In the end , it actually makes the substrate more difficult to clean due to the adhesion of the sealer [ or protector ] .Simply put , sans the tongue and cheek , using these sealers or protectors starts an ever increasing cycle beginning with most contaminents adhering or being ground into the sealer within the substrate/protector making it that much harder to remove grime and that much faster to collect it.PS . I appreciate all votes , positive or negative , as this means the review got you to THINK and PARTICIPATE . Agreement neither contributes to the process nor does disagreement detract.Here 's to ALL buyers that take the time and effort to THINK , PROCESS and PARTICIPATE ! My words are not gospel and skepticism is an invalable attribute ! How on earth do you think ANY company can manage to sell anyone a gallon of `` cleaner '' for FIFTY BUCKS or a bottle of WATER for _____ [ fill in the blank ] ? ! ? ! ? ! Some folks are perfectly satisfied to let others do their thinking for them . Without this population , such companies would all but disappear ! AX~	-1
I have rare granite slabs in my kitchen and all of my bathrooms , the kinds only found at high-end marble and stone shops . One granite slab is of a somewhat porous granite that needs re-sealing every 6 months , and the other two are very hard granites . I had two different granite fabricators , who both said that simple cleaning with water will work as long as the granite is properly sealed . They both said that there was no need for expensive cleaners like this . A year of usage has found them right ! None of my granite has yet streaked using a sponge dampened with water -- nothing else . Everyone who visits my home asks what is used to maintain the granite 's beauty , and they ca n't believe only water is used as a cleaner.That said , granite does need proper sealing . That is very easy , too . I swear by the Dupont StoneTech Bulletproof sealer . Better than any sealer at Lowes or Home Depot , and cheaper online than buying at a marble/granite shop.Also , about acetone as a granite cleaner : one fabricator used it to clean my newly installed kitchen granite . He said that some granite fabricators use silicone-based sealers , and supposedly acetone and denatured alcohol might damage that kind of sealer . He said that the sealer he used on my kitchen granite can accept acetone . After the tile guy installed the wall tile and some of the mortar and some sort of liquid dried onto my kitchen granite , I used acetone to clean the granite with no ill effects . After my kitchen was completely done , I used only water , sometimes with a drop of liquid dish soap , to clean it .	-1
Price was good . Easy to apply . My only concern is that after applying 2 coats as directed and letting dry for 72 hours , standing water still cause the granite to darken . That would indicate to me that the water is penetrating the granite . Once dry , color returns to normal but is this typical ? I would think once a sealer is applied , nothing should penetrate the stone . I applied this to the granite counters in my bathrooms . I 'm glad I went with quartz counters in the kitchen . That looks as good or better , requires no sealing and is maintenance free.Update 7/25/2010I have staining on the granite where the soft soap dispenser dripped . That tells me this sealer is ineffective . I am downgrading the rating to 2 stars .	-1
We selected StoneTech BPSS12-32 based on the positive reviews and reports that it has low emission of fumes . Two stars for ease of application and low emissions , but it is just OK as a protector for granite.We followed directions to apply the first layer to a new granite counter . It was easy to apply and we waited 15 minutes before wiping off the excess . We were able to buff it so that there was no streaking or hazing . After waiting for two hours , we applied a second layer and buffed dry . The next day we applied a third layer for added protection , buffed dry and then let it sit for a day.Then we did the water test . The sealer does slow down the absorbtion of water , but the water does not bead very well and leaves a dark water spot . However , the spot is not as dark compared to a test done before sealer was applied . So there is some benefit , but I would expect better performance from such an expensive product.PROS : - Easy to apply following the directions- Low vapor emissionsCONS : - Does not bead very well and leaves a dark spot indicating water is absorbed- Very expensive	-1
It 's difficult to write a review for a product like this until it 's been on the floor or counter for a long time to see how it will hold up but I will do the review on my experience so far . First of all , I 'm using this as a grout sealer rather than a sealer for stone tiles or counter tops . We just put in a new porcelain tile floor with light colored grout that looks beautiful and I want it to stay that way . Since we 're a household of 3 sometimes messy adults , 2 dogs and several cats , we needed a product that will go over and above in protecting the grout that will get frequent cleanings and lots of traffic . I chose the product because DuPont generally produces reliable products , in my experience . And with a name like & # 34 ; Bullet Proof & # 34 ; it promises to be strong protection . So far , after a couple weeks , it seems to be holding up to spills and dirt . Everything mops up easily without sinking in.The directions advice to allow 72 hours for the grout to cure before sealing . After applying one coat , a second coat can be applied after 15 to 30 minutes . The sealer is dry enough for light foot traffic in 6 to 8 hours . A full cure is achieved after 24 to 72 hours . This probably covers the differences in humidity and temperature in different areas . Since our humidity was pretty low , the 24 hours seemed like a good amount of time . Keeping people and pets off of the grout was a big thing.Applying the sealer to the grout only was kind of a pain . I started using a small brush but discovered that sealer that got on the tiles themselves dried to a dull but transparent finish and in the light , at an angle , I could see where the grout had overlapped onto the tile . I did n't realize this for an hour or so because I was still applying the sealer . So I had to get the sealer off the actual tiles . Let me tell you , this stuff IS bulletproof when you 're trying to remove it ! I ended up using a toothbrush to scrub it off and it did n't come off easily . The instructions say to use more of the product to re-wet and remove it , but at the price of this stuff , I did n't want to waste any on removal . I called DuPont a few days later , since I still had grout to seal , and asked them how to remove it from tile . They told me to use a solution of half vinegar and half water . Well , if a little vinegar is good , a lot must be better , right ? So on future drips and spills I used straight white vinegar and wiped it with a soft cloth . That seemed to work . But now , that brings up the question , & # 34 ; Is this bullet proof sealer , bullet proof to salad dressings containing vinegar ? I 'm going to trust that once it cures , you 'd have to let the vinegar sit a long time to damage the seal . At least that 's what I hope ! I finally discovered a good way to apply the sealer to grout without getting it on the tile . I used a bottle like this Grout Seal Bottle that I got from our local big box store . It came with two wheels , one larger and one for 1/8 inch tile . This simple device made the job SO much easier and faster . I had over 1,000 square feet of tile in all , done in sections , so this little bottle was really a godsend.One other note , the product is water based and has a very low odor . This was important to me . In the past I 've used sealers that worked well , but took weeks to get rid of the smell in the house , not to mention causing headaches or a & # 34 ; sealer high & # 34 ; while applying them . I 'm hoping this product will do just as good a job of sealing . I 'll update this review in a couple of months and let you know.Update 2/20/12 - I 'm disappointed with the way it is holding up on the grout on the counter where I make lots of messes when cooking and serving food . ( We have ceramic tile on the counter and I used this sealer there after doing the floors . ) On the floor it 's holding up OK in some places , in others where we drag in dirt on our shoes from outside , I am having to do some scrubbing . It 's not as bad as if I 'd used no sealer , but for the price of this stuff , I dunno . Is there any low odor sealer that 's really bullet-proof ? I 'll let you know how it 's holding up after another few months.Update 4/2/12 - For all the time I put into applying this stuff , it sure is n't holding up very well . Most of the areas that get a lot of traffic , like in the kitchen , are getting dirty looking and take a lot of work to keep clean . I 'll probably have to find a different sealer and do them again.Update 1/9/13 - I will have to reseal the grout in all the areas that get a lot of traffic and heavy use . The product just is n't holding up . I need to find one that is low odor and durable , if such a thing exists . I 'm disappointed in this product . It was good for the first few months but then started failing . I hate having to go through all the work of applying a sealer again . I remember when I was first looking to buy this product that a couple of the tile stores in my area said they stopped carrying it , one because they had too many complaints and another because customers brought it back . That 's what led me to look on Amazon and buy it here . I should have heeded the warning .	-1
The mallet was delivered with a cracked handle . I can only guess that the wood was n't aged/dried properly.Going to order a 'wood is good ' mallet .	-1
If your goal is to keep things closed and have a visual theft deterrent , this is probably fine . As far as actually provinding protection , this lock can be easily defeated with the smallest of hack saws . The shank does not even lock into the body of the lock - it just dead-ends into a 2mm deep bowl on the top of the lock . Also , the three number combination can easily be cracked - when you realize that numbers on either side of the number selected are also triggered . That is , if you need to select 4 , both 3 and 5 will also work.Finally , as stated below , this lock is lacking the ability to see if the TSA opened your bag.On the plus side , the set your own combination feature worked fine .	-1
my son needed it for his sports locker in the gym - had to be this style.Ours arrived with the combo already set and no idea how to change it ... no biggie , Amazon returned it no problem and we still have the same style lock working for him now .	-1
I like how light it is . However , when every sixth nail or so gets jammed in the gun it makes a carpenter very frustrated . Unacceptable performance .	-1
I like the scale and the compact size . I used it for about a month and then discovered the hook at the end of the tape was not calibrated correctly . When you pull the tape using the hook over the end of the board , it was 1/8 '' short over 12 '' . I compared it against two other tapes and one steel ruler to confirm it was this ruler . When you used the hook end in a butt measurement , it was accurate . I ca n't use it and am going to seek a refund .	-1
I 'M UNUSUALLY DISSATISFIED . DO NOT BUY IT IF YOU PLANNING TO MEASURE INSIDE CIRCLES ; IT DOESN'N WORK .	-1
I thought I would really like this tape , but find I hardly ever use it . For general use , a conventional metal tape measure works better and faster , as you can often work one-handed and there are things you simply ca n't do with the Flatback . The Flatback tape ALWAYS requires two hands to use , and I do n't need the write-on capability . The single thing the Flatback does best is measure around curves . In response to the reviewers that wrote about accuracy , for most purposes the absolute accuracy of a tape does n't matter - what does matter is using the same tape for measuring that you do for , say , cutting . When I need real precision I reach for a steel rule anyway . You can also compare tapes and rules so you know the error margins within which you are working .	-1
The accuracy of the tape is so poor I could not use this tape measure.When cutting wood I noticed sometimes my measurements were off by as much as 3/32nds.I laid this tape measure against another tape measure and a 48 '' steel measure and both the other measure and the steel measure are in perfect alignment , but with the Fastcap you can see where the markings are off for part of the tape , then go back into alignment.It makes a good toy for my 3year old granddaughter .	-1
This level is titled & # 34 ; Heavy Duty & # 34 ; and I can assure you that is completely inaccurate . It is lightweight plastic and the first time it was dropped the end piece opened up . I tried to snap it back in place but it did n't work . I can still use it but I have to be very careful about what side I use . I ended up buying a Fat Max and am happy with that purchase .	-1
I got one of these for Xmas , and finally had the chance to use it today . After inserting 4 new 'AA ' batteries , I tried using it with various size solders to try and make some simple connections on a small Ham Radio electronic morse code keyer kit PC board . I used 2 different size tips , and tried holding it to the PC board and/or solder at every conceivable angle possible , and it did n't work at all . The solder did n't melt even a little . I must conclude that this product is a sham , and is a good example of one having inflated claims . Absolutely worthless !	-1
I really should have read the reviews on Amazon before buying this exact item at Home Depot yesterday . I got it home and put the batteries in it and opened a pack of solder . To my great surprise , it would n't melt the solder - barely made it warm ! This item is as close to worthless as anything I have purchased in the last five years . It really does deserve ZERO stars . Lesson learned .	-1
When I saw the Cold Heat commercial on TV , I thought it seemed too good to be true.I was right.First off , forget the word `` IRON . '' This is a soldering CARBON . ( Think 'pencil lead ' ) '' IRON '' implies a certain degree of strength . Within the first five minutes of owning this piece of garbage , the ends of the carbon tip spread apart and split completely in two.Having read some reviews ( and the directions ) that implied that one needs to be gentle with this thing , I was NOT using a ton of pressure.I suppose I might have received a defective tip , but frankly , I 'm not impressed enough with the way it worked in the FIRST four minutes to try to get them to send me a free replacement.Not that I think I 'd GET a free replacement , mind you . The tips ( and there are several sizes available ) , are advertised on their website for $ 9.95 EACH . So given the fact that MY experience shows they 'll last about five minutes , you could easily spend 40 or 50 thousand dollars a year on replacement tips , given a moderate amount of usage ! I 'm returning my `` IRON '' tomorrow . I 'll stick with an actual soldering iron ( or gun ) .	-1
I 'm sorry guys but this tool was very disappointing - I should not have got my hopes up so high.I 'm an electrical engineer and have been soldering circuits and cables and connectors both professionally and as a hobby for 30 years ( although I give that task to my technicians at the lab nowadays ) .But I tried to but could n't use this iron for my normal soldering tasks . For most tasks with a normal termperature-controlled electronics grade iron I place the tip at the junctiont so both parts being joined get heated and then I flow the solder onto the junction . The other job often done is to tin some stranded wire.With the cold heat I could not get enough energy into the joints to melt solder - I tried contacting it lightly and then more heavily but I just could n't get heat to make a good joint - when I fed solder to the junction usually a little bit just blobbed on the tip and that was all . As for tinning wires , forget it , usually the end of wires waves in the air I could n't get enough pressure on the wire to make the circuit for the cold heat to run . The tip is real fragile , I chipped the expensive tip while testing it . Took the iron back to the store so fast ... Two thumbs down fo this one .	-1
maybe we got a lemon but for me the saw is almost unusable because of the dust control or more the lack of it , even with vacuum attached , the worst is mdf you can ` t breathe the saw shoots huge amounts of dust right at you all the time , never saw something like this , by far the worst dust control i saw on a table saw , my old craftsman is far superiorand i am saying this as somebody who loves his other bosch tools	-1
I placed an order with Ace Haredware Direct . The next day they canceled the order due to a `` pricing error '' caused by a `` computer glitch '' . They then offered me the same item at a much higher price . I would say it is probably a good saw , just do not buy from Ace Hardware Direct . Unless you like being the victim of a bait and switch operation .	-1
As I am finding with most everything these days ; once again , the reputation of the name fools the buyer . 2006 I needed a new table saw . Prior to , I never had a need for a durable saw as I only did repair work and craft work . I needed a saw with a strong motor for long rip cuts ; dadoes ; some resawing of hardwood ; etc . I did homework -- read reviews -- but I read the wrong reviews . I concentrated on reviews that compaired saws : ease of use ; power of motor ; portablility ; etc . Bosch always rated high -- 1st and 2nd . And straight from the box the reviews were well deserving . But now in my enlightened mind I know the reviews you need to read are those done by consumers who have actually used the tool -- for long periods of time ; not for thirty minutes in a comparability test or during the occassional weekend home repair excursion . I discoverd as have many who have actually used the saw on a regular bases -- this Bosch does not stand the test of time ! Building whole sets of kitchen cabinets ; desks ; entertainment centers -- this is the real test . And no I do n't need a real cabinet saw because I have never cut sheetgoods on this saw . I cut with a circular saw , then only trim cut with the table saw . And having actually read the manual I knew better than to put this saw on an extension chord.The motor did burn out after the first year ; and had I not purchased a warranty it would have cost me almost as much as a new saw to replace the motor . Or should I say REBUILD the motor . This motor has to be rebuilt . No pulling the old one out and sticking in a new one . That is the 1st pain . Inside this motor is a big bearing . When the reapriman ordered the parts ; the part with the bearing did not come with a new bearing . He had to specifically order the bearing as my bearing was bad . So I had to wait even longer to get it fixed . And I know this is so because I was there when he opened the parts box.Motor finally fixed I returned to woodworking . I was not dissappointed -- for the next two years . Again the motor has burned out . Again I am waiting to get it fixed . Again we had to specifically order the bearing.Getting back on the internet I did a better review search and low and behold , I have discovered quite a many people , who really use their saw ; have also suffered bad motors . So my point being , you can not always rely on a name . If you are not doing serious woodwork ; there are plenty of less expensive saws -- some even have built in rolling stands -- that will serve your purpose.I think my next purchase -- or nightmare -- will be a Dewalt . It 's motor may burn out too ; but at least it comes with a full 3 year warranty -- at no extra charge ! This saw is listed specifically as a portable CONTRACTOR saw . This is misadvertisement . It should be listed as an expensive hobby saw -- in that capacity is should last years .	-1
So what if it is easy to collapse if you have to carry the entire stand and saw to get it into a truck or up stairs.You can not get this up or down stairs using the wheels , unless you want to bang the stairs or drag the stand , scraping every surface that touches , especially bad on concrete , as the wheels are too small in diameter , go flat easily , were flat in the box even though it states they are inflated to 25psi , maybe they were . The valve stems are on the inside and hard to even get too . With the flat tires they will come off the rim and they are not easily re-seated . My Ridgid stand has no problems . The above black thinly painted bar , [ most here have a padded handle ] , to get it into a pickup bed will get scraped as again with the small wheels you are forced to drag it on the ground as you tilt it.A lot of assembly compared to similar stands . and the bolts are all too long and can catch . It is bulky in that when folded it sticks out unnecessarily , the non wheel end . You have to fold it up to move the saw , that is really a bad design , never had any stand require that . I would have never bought this except it came with the saw.This is NOT for a professional who needs portability , ok maybe in a home shop .	-1
This item sold on Amazon and at HD and Lowes for less than $ 150 in late 2010 . Now it is listed here on Amazon at $ 350 - and it is sold by Amazon , not a third party vendor . I am surprised that Amazon is 'scalping ' its customers on this item .	-1
The problem with this battery tester is that it only checks for voltage remaining in a battery . Even a 90 % used battery can show nearly full rated voltage . It is only when a load is placed on the battery that a true assessment is possible.For example , a dead alkaline battery and a fully charged rechargable battery ( NiMH full charge = 1.2 volts ) both read the same low ( yellow ) .Look for one of the more expensive units that tests under load .	-1
Despite the positive reviews here this is not the best tester . Check out the more negative reviews and you 'll learn a bit about the subject . Actually accurately testing a battery is n't that simple and a cheapo , quickie analyzer like this one wo n't really give you an accurate test . You 'll have to spend quite a bit more money than this to get a good one . They 're for sale here on Amazon but even a relatively inexpensive one will cost you fifty bucks or more . A really good one even for small batteries for consumer use can be several hundred dollars . A professional automotive battery analyzer can be a thousand dollars or more.A good tester does a test under load , called the closed circuit test . This shows truer capacity as this tester only tests voltage and batteries are designed to hold a steady voltage but the current still declines , especially ordinary alkalines . Current capacity is actually a better measure . The only way I use this battery tester is if the needle swings quickly to the right into the green `` good '' area , it 's probably okay . If it moves slowly and barely reaches the green , it 's probably bad even though it says good . If you really need a good battery tester this one is n't it .	-1
Measures Voltage only . This is no way to check a Battery 's state of charge . Buy something like `` Delkin Devices DD/BATTEST MULTI RoHS AA/AAA Battery Power Tester '' , it really Rocks !	-1
Too bad ! ours was defective , needle totally unresponsive . Since it was fulfilled by Amazon they are paying return postage . Thank you for that.Oh well .	-1
I just want to say that this and most of Westinghouse products are pretty good for the price but there is a reason why they sell for less . If anything ever goes wrong just know you will be left high and dry with their customer service.A friend of mine who use to work for them told me that their customer service will listen to your concern and promise to follow through , however when the call is over they will just accidently loose ( delete ) your ticket because they are not suppose to cost the company to much money or it comes back on them . Most people after they call forget about their call until months later and they know it so be forwarned.Also if you do remember and call back they will say there is no record and if you want to speak to a supervisor they will refuse or say that they are the supervisor . If in the end you do happen to get all the pieces and it works then you got a pretty good deal and did alright .	-1
The noise ! ! It 's not rattling nor rubbing , nothing externally off balance . It 's all internal . The sound you get when the magnets and the rotors are not aligned . It 's awful ... worse on lower speeds . rotors designed wrong ? ! ? Contrary to other reviews , it dose n't move air better than a 52 inch ... . not even close . It vibrates too ... this was installed in my finished basement and the flush mount made it so the rotor vibration was louder upstairs than it was in the basement . Moving to a seldom used bedroom and putting the old one back in .	-1
Westinghouse 7850900 ceiling fan . I purchased this on December 19 , 2011 it is now June of 2012 . The fan started to make noise about two months ago . Now it slows down and will even stop for a moment or two by itsewlf . I will need to replace this fan soon . I can not recommend it even at the great price I payed for it . The last fan I had lasted 21 years and was still working when I replaced it with this one . You get what yo pay for .	-1
Generally speaking , fluke products are surperb . But these , although made well , did n't perform as well as other clips I have . Inside , where you slip the probe tips into , there 's a little sleeve . The sleeve will slide out unexpectedly , and get stuck on the probe . On mine , this happened , I did n't realize it , then found one side to be suddenly loose . I continued using the other side , until the same happened , and I noticed the sleeve stuck on the probe . After , the sleeve refused to stay in the clip . So , I switched the whole setup to removeable probe tips , so now the clips I use slide on in place of the probes . This makes available several different tips , such as what you would find in test lead kits available everywhere including fluke .	-1
I bought it for some projects . The general quality is good but there is a serious issue with the angle . It is off a few degree from 90 degree ( straight down ) . Tried to do some trouble shooting and found it is a problem with the tooling Dremel using during their mfg process . Too much trouble to return it and I was afraid that the replacement might have the same issue as it is a tooling related problem . I try to compensate it as I use it . Dremel is a good brand and it should not have such a quality problem .	-1
I have been and continue to be a fan of Dremel products , but this adapted is totally useless as both drill press and mill . The main problem is lack of support for the tool . Even with the locks fully engaged , the Dremel was shaky . I was unable to get a hole drilled in a piece of aluminum without the assembly shaking . Save yourself a bunch of hassle and get a real drill press .	-1
Pictures of this Dremel Model 220 inside the Owner 's Manual only show use of this device as a flex shaft hanger . That 's because it is not possible to use this device as a drill press for a flex shaft . HORRIBLE MISREPRESENTATION IN THE ITEM DESCRIPTION ! Assembly instructions are worse than horrid - they are downright erroneous . It took two of us over two hours to figure out how to put this together . Even the pictures are wrong ( for example : showing nuts outside the device when they should be place inside ) .I was using my oven door for a flex shaft hanger . Now I still have to use the oven door for a flex shaft hanger because this dratted item WILL NOT WORK as a hanger unless you screw it to a table . No way will it work in any manner with a flex shaft handpiece.If you think this is an item that will help you , think again . I am going to see if I can send this back .	-1
I love my Dremel , and it 's my go-to tool for quick prototyping , hacks , small part fab , etc . etc . I was hoping this could be another accessory i could count on- how WRONG ! The main clamping parts are made of crappy ABS plastic . Terrible choice . Are n't we in a world of Space-age plastics ? This thing flexes horribly , not to mention it has a really unsure feeling when locking down your Dremel into the cradle . Once `` locked '' on , i can easily nudge it- imagine the accuracy with the unit spinning at 6000 RPM ? It 's sloppy- hardwood , once engaged and pushed slightly , can flex the spirit of this little toy way too easily.This might be great for Balsa or carving foam- otherwise totally useless.Lame . Really , really lame.Again , disappointed with a legacy toolmaker . ( I have a 1967 dremel Moto-Tool Mount which is made of steel- unfortunately it only fits the old style dremel ) When are these older companies going to realize- people that buy and use tools , actually care about craftsmanship ? ( Festool and Fein among others are capitalizing on this notion )	-1
This cross vise is not worth the price . I thought with it 's size and having adjustable gibbs it would be great for my drill press . When it arrived part of it had broken through the box in a few places . I disassembled the entire vise and cleaned all of the matting surfaces per the instruction manual . I then reassembled and oiled everything.The gibs need a 10mm wrench and Allen wrench to adjust them . I would set them but if you moved the vise to far in one direction they would need to be readjusted . This leads me to believe the slides are not machined very well and the Gib are a cheap way to try and compensate for this . If you tighten them down to much it does not slide smoothly . To loose and your work piece wobbles around when drilling.I could have gotten the same low grade quality from Harbor Freight for a quarter of the price .	-1
Twice , I never got to use this tool because they came severely damaged from shipment . The inside packaging is so weak the heavy tool is easily broken .	-1
After 8 months using this jointer , I can say that there is a review here which is spot on.1 . Bench top jointer occupies more space than stationary 6 '' jointer.2 . No more that 4-foot long board could be accurately jointed3 . Loud , no . Very loud . God bless my neighbors4 . Outfeed table can not be adjusted at all5 . Infeed table and fence do not hold setting . Well they may hold when tiny boards are jointed.All in all , expensive mistake !	-1
Bought this with the expectation it would actually work as some of the reviews indicated . It would not pump up to full pressure with either its own hose , or my slightly better hose connected . In fact just turning the thing on it would drop pressure and restart every 10 seconds with no load on it , and nothing attached to it , at all . I did get it to drive about 10 finish nails before it started making an awful sound , and I turned it off before it got any worse since it never reached shutoff pressure . One of the batteries was also pretty useless , ran for about 5 minutes then quit.I would have given it zero stars but it did drive a few test nails before it died , but with the internal pressure leak and the dead battery I 'm afraid the quality control would keep me from recommending it , much less ordering a replacement for the one I just sent back to Amazon ( kudos for their return policy ! )	-1
Looks nice but it allows a little dribble of water to flow through , have not tried to return it yet .	-1
I will begin by saying that I am not a newcomer to DIY , or to plumbing . My experience includes almost 50 years of construction and renovation experience , including top to bottom renovation of 3 houses 100 years or older and the single-handed construction of a small house from the ground up . I have lost count of the number of bathrooms I have built or renovated . As I said , plenty of plumbing experience , but this is my first Mansfield flush valve , which is quite different from Kohler , American Standard , and others ( even Fluid Master ) . Once I figured this thing out , it worked fine . The instructions , however , are woefully inadequate . If I had not followed my standard practice of taking photographs of the old one with my iPhone as I removed it I might have never completed this small job . A simple exploded illustration of the parts , including the toilet tank portions , would solve this problem.Also , I found the old attachment nut impossible to remove non-destructively . I wish I could say that it is unusual for me to encounter parts that have been over-torqued by & # 34 ; pros & # 34 ; in a hurry to finish a job . Unfortunately , I see it all to often . This is a lesson I learned as a 14 year old rebuilding an old flat-head Jeep engine . I put too much torque on one of the head bolts and broke it . I have been using a torque wrench and/or common sense ever since .	-1
