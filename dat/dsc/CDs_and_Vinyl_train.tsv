Thanksgiving is devoid of icons to make it a favorite amoung children - Tom Turkey ca n't compete with Santa Claus or Dracula - and so this holiday which is crammed in between the other two bigger ones comes up short when it comes to fun TV specials marking the celebration . However , you can count on Rankin/Bass , the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming , to have left us this warm , entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe , Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims ' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse ! Although this special was done in traditional animation , and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for , it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday . Also , like most other R/B specials , this one gets better and better each year you view it , with the songs becoming more familiar and enjoyable every time.With the lack of Thanksgiving Day Specials out there , and the beloved legend-like status of Rankin/Bass , you would think that this one would have been released on DVD a long time - but not the case ! We are still left with a decade-old VHS release as our only source . Hopefully this will change soon .	1
ok I guess a little over 2 hours was not enough for some but I thought the dvd was better then the vhs was	1
I read one of the review 's on here for woodstock 99and I 'm sick of people writing review 's and they don'teven know the difference between rock and pop.First of all Limp Bizkit , Korn and Kid rock are not popbands they are rock and metal bands.Sure they are mainstreambands but they are still rock and metal bands.It 's obviousthat future woodstock concert 's wo n't be the same as the first.That was then this now and there is a whole new generationof band 's out there waiting to be heard . wether it 'd be metal , hard rock , blues , Jazz , rap/hip hop , alternative and etc.a bigconcert like this has to please everybody.They are not puttingon a concert just for you it 's for everybody.I 've never beento woodstock but even I know that not everybody listen 's tothe same music.I love rock n roll , blues , heavy metal , alternative , rap and Jazz and if I were to attend woodstockif there 's a band I do n't like playing I 'll walk away fromthe stage and wait to hear who 's next.I wish people wouldrespect music even if they do n't like it.The reviewer who I'mtalking about must be old because he or she only care'sabout the first woodstock and does n't appreciate any othermusic.Like I said that was then this is now and well if youdo n't like it well do n't buy a ticket . Woodstock 99 ' wasan awesome event with alot of great new music and a wholenew generation of people.It 's ok to remember the firstwoodstock but now there will be more and better woodstock'sin the future .	1
I love to listen to any album with good guitar playing , except for classical.It 's not that it is n't good , I just do n't like it.I checked out the CD and decided that it would be more fun to watch on DVD.Here is my review of each guitarist on here : Joe Satriani starts off the show.He is the guitarist I was most familiar with before buying the CD and DVD.He plays the songs `` Cool No.9 '' , '' Flying in a Blue Dream , '' and `` Summer Song '' .The third one is my favorite.He is my all time favorite guitarist ( Vai is second ) .Eric Johnson is next.He is the guitarist I was least familiar with.He is the most melodic guitarist here.On here , he plays the songs `` Intro Song , Manhattan , and `` SRV '' .On the CD , he plays `` Zap '' , '' Manhattan '' , and `` Camel 's Night Out '' .Manhattan is my favorite on both.I like it because it sounds jazzy.Steve Vai closes this show.He is probably my second favorite guitarist on here.He is definitely the most of a showman.Plus he has `` The Incredible '' Mike Keneally on guitar and keyboards.He plays the songs `` Answers '' , '' For The Love of God '' , and `` Attitude Song '' .In `` Attitude Song '' , him and Mike Keneally duel with each other , and Keneally is just as fast.Last becomes the best moment of all.All 3 `` G 's '' jam together ! They play the Freddie King/Jeff Beck classic `` Going Down '' , the Frank Zappa classic `` My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama '' , and a nine minute blues workout on the Jimi Hendrix classic `` Red House '' .The second is my favorite.Joe sings the first song , Steve and Keneally sing the second , and Eric sings the last.None of them can really sing.I ca n't wait to go to G3 '03 with Yngwie Malmsteen instead of Eric Johnson.P.S.I went there.It was awesome , but this concert was better.I missed Eric Johnson.Yngwie 's licks sounded mostly the same , and the three man jams were EXTREMELY loud .	1
After reading some of the other reviews I really do n't have much more to add . However in my opinion it 's as good as the other 's have said and then some . I own three of these 3G concert versions , and this is my favorite because of the jam at the end with all three . It 's too bad they did n't make that a tridition with all three , but the other two are damn good and well worth purchasing on their own merit ... .A good collection to own if you 're in to exteremly hot guitar licks ... .	1
This is a GREAT DVD . He truly was an amazing artist . This show covers what a typical show was like.I got to see Jeff twice on his 1995 tour . Both performances were in the same day ... an acoustic set at a local record store and live . I had only heard & quot ; So Real & quot ; and wanted to see him play . I went to the acoustic show and was amazed and blown away . I had to see him that night . I told friends the next week on what a great show it was . A few people borrowed my copy of Grace and they had to go out and buy their own cd .	1
I would be satisfied only with the Eletronic Press Kit , or I would be satisfied only with the 2 acoustic songs , or I would be just satisfied with the concert . Now imagine having all together ! This DVD deserves 5 stars ! You do n't need to be a fan to become one after watching this amazing video !	1
To anyone who , like me , only really began to appreciate Buckley 's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death , this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago . The concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program , giving it a very intimate quality . The ENTIRE show is here , all the banter between songs , the calls from the crowd . The DVD is excellent , two seperate sound mixes , regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix . Two bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny .	1
Wow , this is a concert experience unlike any other . I am a die hard Jeff fan , and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made . This concert , even if you dont know Jeff , is an experience within itself . There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album , and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great , try this one ! I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is . I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything . otherwise its a great buy !	1
Where to start ? I 'm sure most of you know the Jeff Buckley story . In short , Buckley was an amazing singer and musician who only had the opportunity to release one full-length album before his life was taken away . But fans , followers , and mourners rejoice - Live In Chicago captures him at his peak , and shines like a beacon of light into our darkened souls . Yes , that 's right - this concert is magical , transcendent , and just absolutely gorgeous.Jeff Buckley had a penchant for writing amazing songs , and they are on display full-force here . It is just magical to hear ( and see ! ) him sing these songs that I thought were inhuman and impossible to sing outside of the recording studio . The ethereal beauty of & quot ; Hallelujah & quot ; had the live crowd , as well as me , sitting in a stunned silence at the perfectness they were witnessing . But this magnificent display is somehow outshined by some of Buckley 's other songs.The song & quot ; Grace & quot ; stands as a milestone in my music listening experience . Jeff 's voice is just perfectly original and absolutely BEYOND COMPREHENSION . I really ca n't describe it , and I literally sat in awe for minutes after seeing this . Let 's make this simple on you ( and me , since I honestly can not describe this up to the standards it deserves ) - if you are a Jeff Buckley , fan , this is a no-braier : Buy it now . If you are a singer , and want to see and hear something amazing , definitely buy this . If you simply want to hear the most amazing thing ever , buy this . Jeff Buckley may be gone from Earth , but his music , spirit , and beauty will live on forever with this DVD .	1
This DVD of Mozart 's Don Giovanni is a really good one by my standards . The top-notch cast , brilliant scenery and costumes , and wonderful orchestra make this one of my favorite Don 's ever . I personally do n't like Herbert von Karajan , but I learned to tolerate him . Samuel Ramey as the vile Don was a great casting decision . He blends vivacity and vileness it one very impressive package . Anna Tomowa-Sintow is a brilliant Donna Anna . Her high notes are absolutely stunning and sings with a firm foundation . The Don Ottavio of Gosta Winbergh is stunning , but he lacked something . Nevertheless he was very pleasing . The Commendatore of Paata Burchuladze is good for all that he 's in . Now for the best : Julia Varady as Donna Elvira . I think she was Karajan 's substitute for Agnes Baltsa but Varady surpasses her in EVERY way . She is velvety-voiced and gives light to the aguishly played Elvira . The Leoporello of Ferrucio Furlanetto is very pleasing . Kathleen Battle as Zerlina was also a good casting call . Alexander Malta as Masetto is a little guff now and then but gives a solid performance . A good DVD for an expert or a beginner .	1
Being somewhat new to opera , my taste is still developing . This review is n't for the seasoned experts , it 's for the person who wants to explore opera but needs recommendations.So , I like a traditional staging . I do n't want some S & M ; interpretation or any other modernizations . I once saw the Shakespearean play Henry V `` modernized '' and it was an insult to the writer -- -I do n't want to see things too minimal . I hate these new spartan sets with no staging.This performance delivers . The singing is excellent . All around really good singing . Von Karajan delivers -- -he brings a snap to every performance that Levine lacks.If you 're wading through reviews and trying to decide if you want to try opera , here you go . It 's a great investment . You will watch it repeatedly and you will enjoy it . It 's well done , fun , great music , great costumes and sets.I highly recommend to any beginners . Also , this is a story that is easy and fun to follow . You do n't need a background in Norse mythology , Schopenhauer or 16th century Venetian politics .	1
Some faults on this DVD : you need to change the sides at the end of each act ; it does n't comes with a booklet about the production ( only advertisings - Karajan , Sony , etc . ) ; the picture quality is sometimes a little dark , with low definition , and the sound is only good . Otherwise , is a very good `` Don Giovanni '' to have.Von Karajan 's conducting may be controversial : in some parts , like in the recitativo before `` Mi tradi quel'alma ingrata '' , is very slow . But this is a question of taste : in these times of `` authentic fast tempi '' , some more `` relaxed '' conducting may be good for tired ears . And in moments that requires fast tempi , they are there , like in the supper.And we have outstanding singers here : the very `` macho '' Don of Ramey is almost perfect . He can be a seductor with the ladies , a sadic `` padrone '' to Leporello , and a men full of fear in his final appointment with the Commendatore ( the great bass Burchuladze ) . The role of Leporello is in charge of Ferrucio Furlanetto - good voice , very good acting . Windbergh is Ottavio : his voice can be excessively `` lyric '' for this role ( more a Ferrando than an Ottavio ) , but he sounds good at all . Malta seems a little old for a Masetto , but sings well . The ladies are all very nice : a great Anna in Tomowa-Sintow , a outstanding Elvira in Varady ( the portrait of a insane woman ) , a charming Zerlina in Battle.The orchestra is the Wiener Philharmoniker - that 's enough to say . The scenarios are sometimes very dark , but not necessarily unclear.If you love this opera , this is a good choice : a very good cast ( there are not a single bad or misscasted singer here ) ; a good conducting ( here , von Karajan is controversial in some tempi , but a master in orchestral balance and texture ) ; outstanding orchestra and chorus ; at last , a terrific statue scene.Good picture and sound quality . And a nice price .	1
This version of Giovanni is extremely impressive and has much fine music to offer . I recommend it whole-heartedly for the great moments of lush , wonderful sound it delivers . Varady , Tomowa-Sintow , Ramey , Battle are well-cast and all perform admirably . I certainly found myself breathless at several places hearing this Divinely inspired score so wonderfully sung . But you should be warned , this production takes itself mighty seriously . There are places where you may even find yourself a little bored . Despite a fabulous comic turn by Ferlinetto as Leporello , this production is a bit leaden . The Met version with Ramey and Battle had a better balance of comedy and drama in my opinion and was better-acted . When Giovanni was carried off to Hell at the end , it came as a genuine surprise and the subtlety of the drama 's structure seemed much more ingenious that way . But even if that version were available . you would probably want this one in your collection as well If you are in the mood for some gorgeous Mozart music , this performance just might blow you away	1
This is a wonderful DVD , having all the best of ingredients that blend together to make a near perfect Don G.Herbert V. Karajan has done a magnificent job with the orchestrated music and the performers are top notch ( acting as well as singing ) . I found the setting perfectly suited to the style and mood of this great work : dark , seductive and secretive . The camera angles are well placed and the audio is superb.Samuel Ramey is a perfect Don G. Unrelenting in his persuit of the fairer sex and unrepentant as well : great voice and obviously enjoys his role as the world 's number one philanderer.Julia Varady is the frequently scorned and forever forgiving damsel . Her non singing part in Leporello 's `` Madamina '' is delightful to watch.Kathleen Battle plays a coquettish Zerlina and her arias and the duet with Ramey are magnificent to behold.My favorite performance however , is by Ferruccio Fulanetto as the roguish Leporello ; playing the role of a scoundrel who knows he should know better but is having too much fun to stop.One final point : I liked the menu on this DVD . Giving you the option to play the entire concert or go to a particular scene . Also the choice of language for the subtitles was nice as well : although I speak English only , I find that once you get used a particular opera , it really is nice to follow along the voices in the recorded language , in this case Italian . I must admit that my favorite opera language is Italian.The true measure of pleasure an opera gives me is how often I listen to my favorite sections and it comes as no surprise that I play several sections very often . It seems every time I observe something new.If you were considering getting Don Giovanni I would n't hesitate to recommend this DVD . You will not be disappointed .	1
Elmo is so entrancing , I have no idea how he does it , but when this DVD is on , my daughter ca n't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo ( even at only 6 months old ! ) This episode of Elmo 's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals . Something about babies makes other babies want to watch . Thanks to Elmo , I get some much needed `` Me time '' ... Although this DVD gets old for me some days , it 's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just ca n't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends ! !	1
watched this movie when i was small and i wanted my daughter to watch it too didnt think i would find movie	1
John Riley has been playing and teaching the drumset for many years and has written well regarded books.Here he joins the growing number of drummers who are featured on their own DVD - some would say deservedly so.He shows a few of his favourite phrases ( as played by the jazz masters ) , how these can be changed around and a personal statement made.John also goes into the personal aspect of how to relate to other musicians in your band and the positive consequences of speaking a common language and listening to each other - a point he illustrates when he breaks down a solo he played live.I liked very much the story he tells about getting up to play with Dizzy Gillespie and not knowing the songs Dizzy was asking for - John 's personal feeling about how Dizzy reacted says so much and illustrates such a compassionate way for musicians to relate to each other that I was emotionally affected by it.I also was also affected by it as I realised not many musicians would react the way Dizzy did - you 'll have to see the DVD to understand what I mean.I do wonder how many younger musicians will make the long hard journey to discovering that listening to others is the best way to play music.If you are interested in how to swing or how to feel the 'swing pulse ' , then go no further than this DVD.If there was one thing I could add to this DVD , it would have been live footage of John performing with a band.I wholeheartedly recommend it .	1
It 's a teen exploitation movie . That means you already know the plot . Gut has hots for girl and is willing to do `` whatever it takes '' to get her , even be incredibly stupid . That 's what the genre is all about so people should not be surprised when that happens . In essence , guys , especially young ones , tend to do hilarious things to satisfy their ... desires . This movie goes a step better.Synopsis : one of the school geeks is infatuated by the head cheerleader but lives next door to the proverbial `` beautiful girl next door '' . A cousin of the head cheerleader , a jock , wants to add the `` girl next door '' to his scorecard . The two guys get togther to make each other 's fantasies come true . Along the way , the `` nice ones '' learn important lessons and the `` not so nice '' ones get their comeuppance . Its as predictable as the sunset . It 's still funny.Where this movie does its best is in the way it charactures the popular people . They are usually depicted as shallow and vapid . They still are but are taken to new heights of idiocy . It 's fun to see them get taken down a peg by some nice kids who find each other.Do n't expect any education from this film . Its strictly for laughs . Its not the best but it is certainly entertaining .	1
While watching WHATEVER IT TAKES , I thought I was watching just another teen movie . However , during the last third of the movie , the film became original . The parodies became a salute to one of the greatest films ever made , and a lesson was taught . Not too bad for a movie among myriads aimed at teens.The movie takes the story of Cyrano de Bergerac , but with a few changes . There are no ugly people here , even the geeks are attractive . Also , instead of one person using another to win the heart of a woman he thinks he can never win , the movie uses two ; a geek becomes friends with a jock so he can get the school 's beauty queen to love him and the jock uses the geek to get the geek 's best friend to fall for him.The movie contains a message about staying true to oneself . The message is delivered in such a way that it seeps into one 's conscience without knowing it . Also , towards the end of the movie there is a great scene taken directly out of IT 'S A WONDERFUL LIFE . The movie does n't parody that film , but in the nod of acknowledgement it does poke fun of TITANIC.Overall , an average romantic comedy that 's a lot better than the average teen movie .	1
This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City . Of the three Irish `` dance '' musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s ( which includes the first `` Riverdance '' and `` Lord of the Dance '' ) I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original , held in Dublin , Ireland , because it adds segments that are mostly good , it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that was n't good to begin with . This is just a very solid show with few weak spots . To be certain , there are some songs/dances that are just `` fair '' but none that are poor , which is amazing considering there are 20 numbers in all.The cast is similar to the first Riverdance with the main exception of Colin Dunne replacing Michael Flatley as the featured dancer . Both are extremely talented . The major difference might be in their looks with Dunne a little , goateed black-haired guy while Flatley is the clean-shaven blond . I prefer Dunne because Flatley 's ego is so big he gets annoying at times . The female lead , Jean Butler , thankfully , is still there and is great to watch : what graceful beauty and talent ! Butler and the rest of these women have the greatest legs I 've seen on dancers.I also enjoyed the dancing of Maria Pages , a Spanish flamenco performer , and two guys : Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas . One number - with those two pairing off against Dunne and two other dancers - is called `` Trading Taps '' and is terrific fun to watch , maybe the highlight of the whole show . I have no complaints about violinist Eileen Ivers , either.The `` fast '' Irish songs here appealed to me the most . I appreciated the audience not getting in the way of the performance either with shrieks and screams like the women do in the `` Lord Of The Dance '' video .	1
There will never be a winner in the Flantley vs Dunne debate , which is perhaps appropriate , as the true star of the show is the music and dance , ably assisted by Colin Dunne , Jean Butler , Katie McMahon , et al . The sheer power of this production is overwhelming . Even those who are not afficianados of the dance will be enthralled by the pounding rhythms and dizzying movements of the dancers . The joy of Riverdance is apparent in the interplay between the performers , masterfully captured in this video . When the dancers are enjoying themselves , the audience feeds on the enthusiasm , and a performance becomes a memorable event . Riverdance - Live from New York City is just such an occasion . If I ever find a time machine , I 'm going back to catch the premier ! What a show !	1
I do n't watch many movies , and have recently lost my taste for kids ' movies in particular -- which are also the few movies which do n't have gratuitous sex , violence , and cursing . This movie manages to transcend genres , a witty film that those who have outgrown the `` Madeleine '' cartoons will enjoy.Madeleine , played by the excellent Hatty Jones , is a little French girl at a boarding school in France , along with eleven other girls ( also flawlessly acted ) and their teacher Miss Clavel ( Frances McDormand ) . The movie follows her clashes with the Spanish ambassador 's son , Pepito , and with Lord `` Cuckooface '' Covington , the man who owns the school upon the death of their sponsor -- and who wants to close it down ; also with such problems as a ransom plot , and the loyal dog Genevieve.Madeleine purists should be warned : this movie is not just a live-action version of the book stories . The movie exists as a series of vignettes loosely based on the books , such as Madeleine 's appendectomy and her rescue by Genevieve . Two of the central plots are not in the books , however : Lord Covington 's wish to sell the school , and the kidnapping plot concerning Pepito . Occasionally dialogue will be lifted ( a difficulty , given the almost complete lack of REAL dialogue ) such as Miss Clavel 's midnight `` Something is not right '' or Madeleine 's defiant `` pooh pooh ! `` The actors and script contain the necessary amount of innocent cuteness and comedy ( the visits of the various ambassadors to the school ) while also having poignancy . One thing that will irritate Madeleine purists is Madeleine 's family situation in this movie , but it does give her the ability to interact with Lord Covington.McDormand is excellent as the rather put-upon nun Miss Clavel , who stiffly glides through real life while trying to keep her twelve little girls in something approaching order without squelching them . Thank God the old `` authority figure as clown '' thing never came into play . Hatty Jones is cute and sprightly without being annoyingly so , while the actresses for such characters as Vicki and Chantal are perfect in their roles . The girls REGISTER as being real people . So does Kristian de la Osa , as the attention-hungry Pepito -- the movie hints quietly at why he is such a `` bad hat , '' while simultaneously giving us sympathy for him and Madeleine alike . And kudos to the best original character , Helene the cook ! Music is overall very good ( thankfully no one breaks into spontaneous song ) with sedate music playing for Miss Clavel and the girls , sad music during poignant moments , and excellent Spanish numbers as we focus on Pepito . The final number stinks , though , it clashes with the setting and plotline.The minimal violence is cartoonish and there is no innuendo ; one ( bad word ) creeps into the script , via a bad guy.This movie is a delight from start to finish , a witty and charming movie that will take you back to your childhood . Or if you did n't like your childhood , it 'll take you somewhere nice ...	1
A really exquisite movie that will make you laugh , cry , and keep putting it on again for moreThe movie is about a girls school in Paris and the adventures of 12 adorable little girls , with the cutest and most interesting of all being the plucky flame haired little tyke , with a heart of gold Madeline ( Hatty Jones ) .With adventures taken from the timeless books , including little Madeleine 's appendicitis , and her rescue from the water by the golden retriever Genevieve , the centerpiece of the story is the battle of the girls and their loving guardian Miss Clavel ( Frances McDormand ) to keep their school and their dog , against the cruel plans of Lord Covington ( Nigel Hawthorne ) and also foiling a thuggish tutor cum kidnapper Leopold ( Ben Daniels ) This is really beautiful , not only for kids , but for all young at heart aged 2 to 122 years of age.There are just so many wonderful memorable heart-stealing scenes , funny cute and poignant .	1
I was 10 when this came out and was so excited in 1998 . Its still an adorable movie - no spoilers its a mash up of the 1st Madeline books and several others Ludwig B. created .	1
If you want to really treat yourself to something wonderful , check out this DVD of Carole King , who may be the best female entertainer of all.She has always been great , and I think with a few years on her , she 's even better.But I was just totally beguiled by one of her guest musicians - Slash - from Guns 'N Roses . I had never heard him before , but I do n't think I 've ever heard a more fantastic guitarist.The talent that these people , at this level , possess is absolutely mesmerizing.I guess there 's no limit to the incredible talent some people have , but what 's all the more mysterious is how some entertainers , who shall be unnamed , manage to make millions of dollars with no discernible talent whatsoever.However , that 's not the case here . Everybody on this DVD is a pro , and you will be duly impressed .	1
From start to finish this was a high energy concert . Carole seemed to be really enjoying herself and it came through in the performance . The oldies segment was great . If you 're interested in buying the audio CD of this show the oldies segment is not on there ; you only get it with this DVD .	1
I WOULD N'T RECOMMEND THIS DVD FOR THE EXPERIENCED VIEWER OF LIVE OR DVD PERFORMANCES OF BALLET . IT IS A COMPENDIUM MOST SUITED TO THE PERSON OF ANY AGE WHO HAS NOT BEEN MUCH EXPOSED TO CLASSIC DANCE NOR COLLECTED FULL PERFORMANCE DVD'S.YES , THE TITLE IS SOMEWHAT MISLEADING , MORE ACCURATE WOULD A SUB5ITLE SUCH AS `` SAMPLES FROM SOME OF THE LEADING BALLET COMPANIES '' OR `` A PRIMER FOR BEGINNERS IN VIEWING DANCE '' .FOR THE PURPOSES I OUTLINE , MY ONLY QUARREL IS WITH THE UNEVEN LENGTHS OF THE SELECTIONS . BETTER TWO OR THREE FEWER AND MORE TIME FOR THE REMAINING ONES . AS IT IS , TWO OR THREE ARE FRUSTRATINGLY SHORT WHILE NONE OF THE OTHERS COULD BE SAID TO BE TOO LONG.HOWEVER , MARKETING GOALS PROBABLY DICTATED A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ITEMS WITH SUFFICIENT TIME FOR MOST TO AVOID THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE `` COMING ATTRACTIONS '' OR PREVIEWS.THE VIRTUE FOR THE BEGINNER IS THAT ALL THESE SELECTIONS ARE GOOD TO LOOK AT AND GOOD TO HEAR , ALL THE PERFORMERS HIGHLY COMPETENT , AND ALL THE SEGMENTS AVAILABLE ( BY SOME GROUP OF GOOD PERFORMERS ) FOR PURCHASE OR RENTAL .	1
Perhaps some of the reviewers who preceded me have been too literal in their interpretations of this production . As I see it , a rather powerful ( and hypocritical ) group in power is persecuting a small and rather meek group , the reigning group using religion/culture as the basis of their demands for conformity . With a few adjustments it could be any set of cultures , Chinese government versus the Tibetans , for example . Sellars concept is quite powerful ; where he goes wrong ( whether due to ego , to poor taste , or to lack of trust in the intelligence of his audience ) is in gratuitous action : all that hand-waving , e.g . The worst offense for me is in `` fly-catching '' , i.e. , the addition by the director of sounds or actions that distract the audience from the important part of the scene , in the case of Handel the glorious music and in the case of this production the gorgeous singing.In spite of all the nit-picking complaints I have about Sellars direction , this is a very powerful piece of theatre . Sellars , by the way , has said that he loves it when he gets booed ; that means ( to him ) that people are really thinking about the issues . OK , Mr. Sellars , have your ego-boosting explanation , but this person will boo you for so much idiotic micro-managing : slurred speech in an opera to signify drunkeness ! ; sopranos singing while bent double over the back of a chair ; characters rolling about on the floor and crying out in fear or pain while another character is singing such beautiful music , etc . But there 's just too much about this production that is splendid -- do n't pass it up because of poor Peter 's bad taste .	1
If you 're looking for grand opera with pagentry and costumes showcased in period sets , this production is not for you . If you 're looking for some of the finest singing in opera heaven , this DVD is for you . I 'm in total disagreement with Sellers production concept , but those voices take control over everything so you can just close your eyes , or better yet , turn off the picture on your tv set and enjoy these opera voices at their finest .	1
It was only after I watch Christie 's Rodelinda dvd that I was able to understand how sublime is this Theodora.Not only because Handel wrote such a superior , touching music.Moreover , this performance has a higher emotional level that puts itself on the handelian elite recordings ever.In despite I have some restriction to Upshaw ' singing , it 's impossible to discard this dvd ; both Frode Olsen and Lorraine Hunt are in luxuriant voices , Daniels has the best countertenor vocal equipment presently ( listen the way he starts `` Streams of Pleasure ever flowing '' ! ) and , just watch yourselves this kind of a miracle , tenor Richard Croft singing `` From Virtue springs '' on third act and go right to Paradise.Even Olsen , the vilain on the block , seems touched by.Bravissimo , Mr . Croft ! By one 's turn , Christie ca n't disguise his passion with this music and Sellars proofs himself a very update director ; politic-religious tricks on America setting is clever and very suitable nowadays.I do n't like this cho- ( I ) -reography counfounding singers in their singing , however this is appropriate to fanaticism of characters like Irene.Very good sound recording and image ; a memorable revival of the Handel 's favorite oratorio .	1
This is a far better interpretation than the older Bolshoi performance that was recorded in the 1970s on murky Russian film stock . The choreography and dancing in that version were dull to say the very least - cinematography and editing uninspired and choppy , respectively . It was also half an hour shorter than this performance.This newer version with the Australian Ballet is superbly choreographed and strongly danced . It is perhaps the most virile ballet performance every captured on film or videotape . This is a videotaped performance and is overwhelmingly powerful and passionate . The male dancers are all quite strikingly handsome and every movement is devoid of the `` elegance '' and effeminacy in the earlier Bolshoi performance . This is rugged , but in its sheer masculinity , it is a tribute to the beauty of the male body in movement.This screams to be converted to DVD before the VHS goes out of print .	1
This was my first time seeing anying by the Australian Ballet and I was very impressed . Costumes and sets are beautiful . Pavane and Horsman are very talented performers . I really enjoyed the second act in the Dr 's `` workroom '' . The members of the company who `` dance '' the various `` dolls '' are great especially the one who performs the floppy , unformed , unsculpted `` doll '' . Also worth noting is that a friend who knows nothing about ballet easily understood the story without help from me or any other source .	1
It is almost twenty years ( 1993 ) since this recording of Coppelia was issued from the Australian Ballet . In all that time it still is , in my mind , the best rendering of this classic 1870 ballet by Leo Delibes . It was also in 1993 that what I consider the best runner up recording was made : that of the Kirov with new choreography by Oleg Vinogradov . Of the original choreography by Saint-Leon little remains , most danced today is the 1884 version by Petipa , Ivanov and Cecchetti . This is considered the standard classical presentation . This version was the basis of the Australian company 's effort as reproduced by Peggy van Praagh with some additional choreography by her . It is a nice happy , short ( thin ) story with happy peasants , sunshine , flowers and lots of happy dances ( even a Hungarian Czardas ) . It concerns a doll-maker that makes a doll so life-like that it causes trouble for a pair of innocent young lovers . After lots of dancing and dedicating a church bell it all ends happily . What I liked particularly is the limited story with a really excellent musical score by Delibes who later wrote another great score for the ballet Sylvia . He is considered along with Tchaikovsky to have defined `` classic ballet '' .The performance recorded here is `` spot on '' in all ways . The stars Lisa Pavone and Greg Horsman work so well together ( they are married ) and each is a master technician as soloist so that watching them is always a thrill even after many viewings . The corps works very well and the Dr. Coppelius of Colin Peasley is delightful . I felt that the whole Australian presentation was `` just right '' , just enough in scenery , costumes and gimmicks for a pleasant evening 's entertainment.The runner-up in productions of Coppelia is the Kirov version of 1993 . It too was an excellent produciton with outstanding corps work and great stars ; Irina Shapchits ( very funny ) and Mikhail Zavialov . In order to stand out from all the other productions of Coppelia ( and I 've seen a dozen or so ) M. Vinogradov resorted to somewhat excessive scenery , some added comic dances bordering on slapstick and his choreography had movements I felt were inappropriate for `` classical ballet '' . However each and every movement and each and every gimmick was well done so that it was worth watching . It was too much and I felt spoiled this simple beautiful story .	1
This is , by far , one of the happier ballets in the repertoire . There 's no hint of Swan Lake 's or Giselle 's or what-have-you 's gloom and doom , and the immensely capable dancers of the Australian Ballet Company will have you smiling -- and , perhaps , dancing -- almost regardless of the circumstances beyond your screen . Most of the music is immediately likeable , ultimately loveable , and performed with the utmost panache . Both the ( VHS ) video and audio quality are quite good , too -- at least for KULTUR ( which seems , based on other tapes I own , to have grossly inconsistent production standards ) . Alas , the unbridled gaiety of the ballet is slightly marred by a few absurd characters ( a `` village idiot '' , for one , and a `` grandmother '' , for two , both of whom tend to wear a bit thin on repeated viewings ) , and by some elements of slapstick comedy . But overall , this is an enormously HAPPY work of art -- geared to those who are , or wish to be , in a similar state .	1
Coppelia has always been my favorite ballet ( to watch and to dance ) .My friend and I decided that we wanted to see the ballet again , after several years of not seeing it , so I went on Amazon to see what was out there . I 'm really glad that I chose the Australian Ballet 's version.If you read the other reviews , yes , there are some differences from the 'classic ' version of the story , but it 's done really well and the dancing is phenomenal . If you 're looking for a great version of this ballet for your collection , pick this one up , you wo n't be disappointed . ( this , from a professional ballet dancer . Well , 2 if you count the friend I watched it with ! ) : - )	1
`` M '' has everything you could hope in a great film . The acting by Peter Lorre , Gustaf Gr & uuml ; ndgens , Otto Wernicke , and the rest of the cast all perfectly convey the different personalities in this complex story . The use of black & amp ; white and shadows is very moody and haunting . The use of sound is very important since it will tell you things the camera is n't showing . The camera work itself is amazing . I especially love the long shot in the beginning of the scene of the beggars are signing up to watch the streets where the camera moves back and forth , up and into a room through a window without a cut . `` M '' offers so much for the viewer -- thrills , suspense , humor , terror ! I enjoy it more and more with every repeated viewing . Fritz Lang does more than just give ideas on insane criminals . He compares and contrasts the police and the underworld criminal systems . You learn about the & quot ; state-of-the-art & quot ; systems of that time . And the last words harken a most important message that unfortunately is still true today . Also , if you look deeper , you can even sense Lang 's anti-Nazi sentiments.It 's a Criterion Collection DVD , so I had high expectations . I was disappointed with a lack of extras , but I happily noticed scenes that were n't on my VHS version . The picture was mostly clear with white lines rarely popping up . There were long passages of no sound at times , but it 's possible it 's supposed to be like that . ( I no longer have my VHS version to compare . ) The subtitles were clear and easy to read . There 's interesting details on the film in the liner notes . And not like this would influence anyone 's buying decisions , but I also loved the design on the case and the disc .	1
My feelings for this iconic piece of filmmaking mirror those I 've previously expressed for David Lynch 's masterpiece ` Eraserhead ' ; namely that it exceeds the boundaries of perfection and thus defines the very word that is ` film ' . There are very few films today that can even come close to capturing the brilliance that is captured within the frames that make up ` M ' , a harrowing story about a murderer of children who manages to elude the police but finds himself in the angry hands of the criminal underground . ` M ' ( shortened from the original title ` Eine Stadt Sucht Einen Morder ' which translates to ` The Murderers are Among Us ' ) broke many boundaries and paved the way for the expressive filmmaking of today , but still it holds it 's own as supremely better than most everything released today. ` M ' tells us the story of Hans Beckert and the misery and panic he spread throughout a small German city . As children come up missing and or dead parents and concerned citizens alike find themselves in disarray as the police continue to search for this killer of children with no real success and or advancements . As the police too begin to panic in their faulted efforts they begin to weigh heavy on the German community which has some adverse effects on the criminals controlling the underground . These criminals come together to try and better their own situation which leads them to conclude that the only way they will get the police off of their backs is if they catch and put an end to this horror of a man once and for all.There are so many facets to this film that make it one of the grandest of all time . It sets a perfect mood for the subject at hand , never once straying from that eerie and heart stopping vibe that permeates the screen . The film flows magically from one scene to the next , never chopping and or losing our interest . The rich black and white film and grainy atmosphere only add weight to the already weighty subtext ; and then there is the sublime inclusion of the tune ` In the Hall of the Mountain King ' , which is whistled by Beckert while he is on the prowl . It is a simple detail , but that one detail is probably the most haunting facet to the entire film.And then , there is Peter Lorre.Peter Lorre has received much acclaim and attention for this gutsy role , tackling the first ever on screen serial killer , and rightfully so . His fearless performance is one of the greatest of all time . There is a scene where he is staring in the window of a toy store , watching a young girl in a mirror and his face bleeds forth with this wretched pain and confusion ; utter torment eating away at his very soul . He makes this man human , which was very gutsy especially at the time . His final breakdown towards the end of the film where he tries to explain his horrible condition , his sickness if you will , is actually quite moving in his dire conviction and commitment to his performance . It reminds me of the shivers one receives when witnessing Edward Norton 's portrayal of Neo-Nazi Derek in ` American History X ' ; a horrible man yet so convincing in his plight you wind up sympathizing with the Devil. ` M ' is not a film to be taken lightly . There is so much power packed within this picture that one should be made aware of its affects on an individual . ` M ' captures almost all too well the true extensive deteriorating powers of panic and fear . As the general public begins to wear down with the police 's inability to capture this murderer they begin to turn on one another , ready and willing to condemn any man who comes within speaking distance of a child . The police likewise resort to rash and overzealous methods in order to uncover this murderer , feeling pressured by the innocent public merely trying to safeguard their offspring . The criminals too feel compelled to take matters into their own hands in an effort to rid their town of its eternal distress and all of this culminates into a melding pot of dread and misery. ` M ' may be hard to stomach at times . No , this is not a graphic film but it is haunting in that it manages to strike at the heart of the audience , seeping into their soul . The aftereffects are as distressing as those brought on by the recent ` 4 Luni , 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile ' ( ` 4 Months , 3 Weeks and 2 Days ' ) ; a film that brings out in us the human desire to correct all evils and save our loved ones from the exhausting touch of pain and suffering . ` M ' is a film that finds itself in your heart and soul and wrecks havoc on your inner being ; ultimately becoming a part of you and thus never leaving your side . As many have noted , ` M ' is one of the greatest films ever filmed , and I too stand by that statement.In fact , it 's quite possibly the best ; possibly .	1
Dark , disturbingly satirical , humorous exactly where you would n't expect it to be , and populated by strange-looking people , this would be the result if George Grosz had been a film director .	1
& # 34 ; M & # 34 ; is a German expressionist film directed by the auteur Fritz Lang . It 's the story of a child murderer , played brilliantly by Peter Lorre , and the people who are trying to track him down.Visually , the film is stunning . Lang uses shadows , and sound ( or the lack thereof ) to add to the tension created in the film.People who are serious fans of cinema DEFINITELY must see this .	1
While watching this story unfold , I found myself on quite a rollercoaster ride of emotion . First , I hated Beckert ( Peter Lorre 's character ) for luring innocent little girls to their hideous deaths . Beckert is scary due to his ordinariness , his gentle face and small stature . He 's the opposite of what we tend to expect ( even today ) a child molester / killer to look like . I really wanted this guy caught ! I cheered for the cops to nail this maniac at all cost . Then , I wanted the underworld types to nab him and dole out their version of justice ( regardless of their selfish , criminal motives ) . The scenes of the crooks surrounding / hunting Beckert in a deserted office building are paranoic and intensely claustrophobic . I could feel the terror in Beckert 's head . No longer the predator , he was now the prey . Once caught , he is taken to a deserted brewery and put on & quot ; trial & quot ; by the crime bosses . Beckert must plead for his life before a mob that 's not all that interested in his side of the story . He delivers one of the most desperate pleas for mercy in movie history to an audience concerned only with his destruction . Just as the mob leaps at him to tear him apart , the cops arrive , becoming Beckert 's ( temporary ) salvation . In the end , we are left with the words of one of the victims ' mother . She sadly states that while Beckert may die for his crimes , this will not bring her baby back to her . Such is the great paradox of justice . Fritz Lang gives us quite a lot to think about in this legendary tale . Buy it and see what I mean ...	1
Hi I have a friend named M. and it was his name that mademe feel I should watch this JEWEL of a movie ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! In this masterpiece of film Peter Lorre in what I feelis his best role plays a pathetic child murderer whodoes not want to kill children , but feels HE MUST ! With Fritz Lang 's splendid SHADOW directing andeerie lighting this is a morbid film and onethat I feel is the father of the PSYCHO , HENRY , SILENCE OF THE LAMBS , SCHRAMM and UNTOLD STORY ... M will always bethe PAPA of those films . We start out with a younggirl missing , she is not the first nor the lastand every one in town that is male is a suspect.Later we follow a man who whistle 's a classicaltune ( it 's famous but I do n't know what it ismy sweetie will though , I 'll ask her ) The man stopsto buy a balloon for a lil girl , what the man doesnot know is he is being watched ! As he leaves withwhat seems to be another victim for him a man bumpsinto him touches his back and say 's sorry . WhatLorre does not know is that the man wrote M on his handbefore touching Lorre and when the girl tells him hehas something written on his back the look on his face ( THE COVERBOX of this film ) is brilliant ! He runs leaving the girldoes he get caught ? Does he kill himself ? ? does he kill the menafter him ? ? ? You will have to buy and find out . This is a truemasterpiece on the macabre and opened so many doors for this kind.So thanks to my AMAZON friend M. For I would not have bought thistonight if you had the name N. Thinks for being a great friendand having a coooool name ! Now watch this ( but with the lights onand a stuffed Snoopy under your arm with a frozen otter pop toeat )	1
German director Fritz Lang 's first sound film was this haunting story of a child murderer ( Peter Lorre ) on the loose in a large German city . It is a seminal film in the sense that it ranks among the first appearances of two genres : police procedurals and serial killer movies . Lang 's Berlin is an eerie place full of shadows and inhabited by a very well-organized underworld that is capable of launching its own manhunt for the killer when the police investigation makes things too uncomfortable . Lorre 's Hans Beckert is a pathetic figure that acts on his grotesque compulsions in total ignorance of the forces aligning against him . His tormented speech toward the end of the film , when he has been put on trial before the mass of the Berlin underworld , shows keen insight into the killer 's condition and mental state , almost eliciting sympathy for him . This is a stark , facinating film .	1
This is the first Criterion release that I 've ever seen and I have to say that I am quite impressed . Fritz Lang 's first `` talkie '' has been very well restored and although the picture quality is not perfect which would be unreasonable to expect of a 80-year film and the sound quality is also not perfect but in this case is not essential as the film works very well with Lang 's direction and hence unique storytelling style making this is likeThe Complete Metropolis [ Blu-ray ] a few years earlier a film classic and another work of genius . The rolling ball and the flying kite scenes for example `` speaks '' volumes and does more than tons of dialogue could do and if ever a film shows that a picture speaks a thousand words this one is it.Fritz Lang addresses another social ill here as he did in `` Metropolis '' but unlike that film the actual lesson is elusive . The special features here are excellent and include an excellent interview conducted by director William Friedkin ofThe Exorcist ( Extended Director 's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition ) [ Blu-ray ] andThe French Connection ( Two-Disc Collector 's Edition ) of Lang in which he explains his intention was to instruct adults to be much more mindful of their children and that there is no excuse for neglecting them as they are the future and how well we look after them will determine what kind of a future we will have . This was so prophetic when you look at Germany not too long after with the Hitler youth that was so important for the Nazi party for example or how misguided youth can lead to tragic consequences when due to negligence parents allow unsavoury elements to replace them . The parents blame the police , the various criminal elements , the actual psychopathic killer , how busy they are with work i.e . everyone but themselves for the deaths . Lang even in a way tries to weaken the case for blaming the perpetrator who is portrayed as this killer who wants to be caught witness his letter to the police inexplicably leaving clues to aid in his capture and in his impassioned apologetic for himself in front of the mob which even evokes sympathy for him . This was very enlightening as because of various producer interference and hence various alternate endings and cuts which can be seen in the English version also included in this set it became very hard to see this thesis resulting in many people talking about how this film was about compassion for the insane criminal , the abolition of capital punishment for the insane , how insane is insane enough , the hypocrisy in society of how the `` low-life '' are targeted and assumed of the horrible crime of child murder when the perpetrator stands among the more `` respectable '' at least in society 's eyes , the comedy of `` low-lifes '' judging a `` lower life '' etc.These are just a few lessons one can draw from the movie without viewing the movie in full and hence in the way the director intended it to be and you get it here as complete and as well restored as can be to date but only in the original German version which is the best way to view this ; turn on the English subtitles if you need to as the English version has n't been restored and the ending has been changed and so does n't flow as well and is a pale parody of the German version . What the German mother says as the last line of the film is critical to the meaning and is totally lost in the English version which has an alternate ending . The fact that a 110 minute film generates so many talking points and is still relevant today with violence in various forms against children still rampant with many people blaming various things and pointing to various reasons when perhaps the answer is just better vigilance and spending more time with them so that the evils of the world ca n't get at them is testament to the greatness of this film and of Fritz Lang . Indeed this to me is the definition of a great film that transcends time and remains relevant and thought-provoking even rewarding many repeated viewings and it is really sad that we do n't get enough of these types of films today and we have to settle for mindless crap like `` Mr. & Mrs. Smith '' , `` Dumb & Dumber '' , `` Legally Blonde '' , `` Scream '' etc.Great Criterion release , well restored but not perfect picture and sound quality , great extras and excellent film makes this an easy review.Very highly recommended !	1
Fritz Lang 's great 1931 film M is an important film , and for anyone who collects classic films , a necessary addition . Criterion 's 2 CD set is simply wonderful , with the complete 110 minute Lang approved version of M on disc 1 , and a William Friedkin interview with Fritz Lang made a year before his death , among other goodies on disc 2.M was Fritz Lang 's 1st movie made with sound , although a few sequences were actually silent . This film is one of the last great examples of German Expressionism , as well as a precursor in terms of visual style and plot to the classic film noir of a decade later . This film is about a serial child murderer , played by Peter Lorre , and the efforts of both the police , and organized crime , to catch him . This was Lorre 's first screen role , and it not only typecast him as a villian for years to come , but was used by Goebbels in the vile propaganda film `` The Eternal Jew '' as an example of Jewish immorality and corruption.The visual elements in the film are particularly striking and memorable . The children playing a morbid game of `` next victim '' ; a little girl bouncing a ball off the murderer 's wanted poster while his shadow suddenly appears ; the dirty deed done , signified by her ball rolling away and her balloon flying off ; a potential new innocent victim framed in a mirror by knives ; the mark of `` M '' applied to the murderer which ca n't be erased . There is also that ominous leitmotif of the murderer constantly whistling `` In the Hall of the Mountain King '' .Lorre is riveting in this movie . It really is the only great acting done here , but it makes up for everything else . He becomes a human rat , scurrying to escape , trapped in a cage , frantic , and in the end , pitiful and almost pitiable . The fact that his final tormentors are sane career criminals , while Lorre 's character has sanity issues , gives the film a final moral ambiguity that almost overshadows the repugnance we feel toward him .	1
M is an essential film . But this DVD was a little disappointing , I felt . The picture and sound were better than other versions I 've seen , but still not as pristine as I would have liked . Special features were so-so . Price was as high as Criterion usually likes it . All in all , I 've seen better adaptations of similarly legendary films to DVD.But if you are at all interested in the great films of the past , this is a must-have , and Criterion MUST be kept in business at all costs ( wince ) . So this is a good buy overall .	1
This is more a review for the justice Criterion has done for Frtitz Lang 's 1931 criminal masterpiece than it is a review of the film . Chances are if you 're reading this review , your already have an interest in this film and have heard of how incredible it is , so therefore an in depth study of it from some amateur film buff like me will do you little or no good . Just see it and you 'll know all you need to know about what makes it an unmistakebale clasic.My hat goes off ( if I wore one ) to the Criterion Collection , who have released an amazing print of this movie . Not only are the German subtitles more involving and in depth , making the story easier to follow and all the expressions easier to understand , but the actual footage you see is so clear it is hard to believe this film is over 70 years old ! Even Kurosawa 's IKIRU from the 1950s does n't have such a high quality print available ! I 've watched this film for several years ( almost 10 now -- since I was a teenager ) and every time I see a new version of it , from video to DVD , it gets better and better . The version Criterion presents is easily the longest of them all , and following the feature a breif description of the restoration and the time is presented just so you realise you 've seen as close to the original film as you possibly can . The other versions of this movie that I 've seen were all shabby , at best . I remember in 98 or 99 , a video was released of the film that at the time was one of the most complete available , including the short finale just after the criminal kangaroo court scene , which had been deleted for many years . Not only is that scene included in this DVD , but it is presented much more clearly , with much a better translation available . Before , I 'd thought that extra scene felt out of place , and now I know why ; it had n't been handled properly . Thanks to Criterion 's amazing job completing this classic , its being shown that way it should be .	1
The city of Berlin ( during pre-WWII Germany ) is wrought with hysteria as a cunning child-killer stalks the streets . To hasten the capture of the murderer , the police clamp down tightly on local criminal activity , making business-as-usual activities nearly impossible for members of the city 's organized-crime syndicate . So in an effort to return the city to its previously permissive state of affairs , the local mobsters decide to hunt down the elusive homicidal pedophile themselves.This compelling study of a pedophilic serial killer and the public reaction to his odious crimes was decades ahead of its time in its treatment of psychological , political , and sociological themes . The first `` talkie '' from pioneering auteur Fritz Lang -- probably better known to fans of classic cinema as the director and artistic force behind 1927 's groundbreaking , trendsetting silent SF classic METROPOLIS -- 1931 's M is more than just a crime thriller . It is actually a subtle comment on the sense of security that modern `` civilized '' people so blithely accept . Lang so effectively blurs the line separating institutions of law from crime syndicates that he leaves viewers questioning whether or not society 's leaders are actually capable of keeping its citizens safe and secure . And indeed , Lang had good reason to pose such a question , as the Nazis were already on the rise in Germany at the time he was making M. The film barely veils Lang 's disgust for the Germany of that period -- a Germany that could birth and foster a philosophy of hatred like Nazism -- since the Berlin he depicts is dark with dirt and grime and the people all seem to have bloated , gnarly faces that are twisted into perpetual scowls . That being the case , it is no surprise to learn that Lang employed actual Berlin residents and real-life members of the city 's criminal underground to fill several supporting roles.M is also notable as the film that launched Peter Lorre into the international spotlight . Lorre 's gutwrenchingly emotive portrayal of a human monster who is unable to control his evil , deviant sexual impulses is nothing short of stellar . Unfortunately , this performance also resulted in his being typecast , and it was afterwards difficult for him to secure roles outside of the noir or horror genres , even after his emigration to Hollywood.Released the same year as Tod Browning 's classic Lugosi vehicle , DRACULA , M is actually the scarier of the two . Although Lang 's intention was for M to reflect the decaying and diseased society that WAS Germany during the years that culminated with World War II , it reflects just as poignantly the anger , violence , and social ambiguity so prevalent in today 's world . And that is very frightening indeed.The Criterion Collection DVD offers a visually stunning restored version of M in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio and at its original 111-minute running time . The disc plays the film with the original German-language soundtrack , but optional English subtitles are available . Unlike many Criterion discs , there are no additional bonus features , but the opportunity to watch this remarkable and historic film as its legendary director intended makes amazon.com 's less-than-suggested-retail price very reasonable . Definitely a must-see for students of cinema , aficionados of classic films , and fans of the noir or thriller genres .	1
what makes a man kill young children ? even he himself does n't know ! we look with hatred at the killer when he lures young children . but when he 's chased down and caught by a vengeful mob , his terror makes us pity him . even more his helplessness against his own perversion.he knows that what he is doing is wrong . but he ca n't help it.similar to drug addicts who ca n't help themselves from getting deeper into their addiction.beautifully done movie which brings out the enigma of human nature . brilliant performance by the lead actor .	1
Some film historics consider it the best film maybe ever done in Germany . Watch the old an decadent Berlin ( rare like in & quot ; Emil and the detectives & quot ; ) . It will never be the same city again later . Peter Lorre and Gustav Gr & uuml ; ndgens as Lang are genious . Fritz Lang has the sensibility of feeling the dark and light both ; like the german forests 5000 years ago : combining his understanding for dark pleasures as his love for any human on earth .	1
How can you not like this movie ? This movie was not meant to be a serious drama or not even a hardcore action movie ... it was meant to be fun ! Once that is in your mind , you will thouroghly enjoy this movie that made history with its live action characters . If you were a little kid when this movie came out , you did not care about little things like the plot or the script . And for grown-ups , the movie awakened the little child in all of us and we found ourselves remembering the days of yesteryear , when we were watching Saturday morning cartoons , rooting for the good guys to kick the bad guys butts . The movie is good , so if you do n't take this movie too seriously , you will enjoy it . The way the live action characters interact with their environment is really something . The turtles are a brilliant creation of Jim Henson , whose legacy still lives . If you are in the mood to just enjoy a simpler movie without all the expensive special effects , go watch this movie and forget about your troubles for about 90 minutes .	1
I 'll admit that I was at first only a reluctant fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoons back in the late 80 's and early 90 's , if for no other reason than I was pretty much forced to watch it by the simple fact that my brother and sister both watched it while they babysat me . But as time got on I did grow to genuinely enjoy the series . I mean , who can watch the show and not laugh at the bumbling antics of Shredder and his goons as they try to gain the advantage against the turtles ? So when I heard that a TMNT movie was in the works ( it came out as I recall in the summer of my tenth year back in 1990 ) , I was at least willing to give it a whirl.It should be noted that in quite a few important ways the movie is as unlike to the cartoon as night from day . The actors are n't even the same , for one thing . Not that this detracted from my enjoyment of the film or its two sequels , it did n't . But certain elements of the characters ' past , Splinter and Shredder 's in particular , were altered , more I think to be more true to the comics than anything . Splinter goes from being the mutated form of a Ninja warrior named Hamato Yoshi to being the pet of said Ninja . Raphael , who in the cartoon was always the wsecracker of the group , becomes a much more solitary , angry character often given to acts of rashness that nearly cost him his life . This behavior almost creates a rift in the turtles at one point , but they reunite in an effort to save their beloved master from Shredder . There 's another character much changed from his cartoon persona . Gone is the often petulant , whiny villain , to be replaced by a sinister and ruthless criminal mastermind with an ominous voice . In short he changes from someone to be laughed at to a man to avoid at any cost.All in all I was very impressed with the movies . I only wish I still had my VHS copies , but then again I so rarely watch those anymore that it seemed more advisable to get them on DVD , which I intend to do next month if finances permit . So if you have n't already seen them , pop on over to your local video rental and pick up the three TMNT films . I personally liked the first one best , but Secret of the Ooz was close behind . The third one took a bit of getting used to but I eventually did conclude that I liked it just as much as the others .	1
I remember when this movie came out - I was expecting to see something based entirely off the TV show ( I was n't aware of an original comic - most kids did n't ) . You know , Technodrome , Baxter Stockman , Rocksteady and Bebop , Nutrinos , Krang , stuff like that . This does n't have any of it ! Actually , I 'm surpirsed this movie managed a PG . In today 's time this would get a PG-13 . The hidden night club really had me surprised . It never crossed my mind to see a kid my age playing pool and smoking a cigar ! I also never expected the foot soldiers to be human.The movie has a mature overtone , with plenty of jokes and laughter to entertain both kids and adults ! They did a great job with this movie - especially when they had limited ends . It seemed they could do a serious movie the way it SHOULD be , or they could do one based off the cartoon that only kiddies would like . They combined the two flawlessly . The movie has a kind of 'realism ' to it . It 's still fiction of course , but it 's still based in the real world . The turtles themselves are n't perfect like they are in the cartoon . They go through turmoil , fights , and they get their butts kicked just like the real world.I 'll always like the strange palship that goes on between Michaelangelo and Donatello . I think the guy who really steals the show here is Casey Jones ! That guy just kicks [ ... ] all the way ! After he 's Wayne Grutskey on steroids !	1
Ahh , the memories , The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hitting the big screen back in 1990 . I was so excited to go see it . I thought it was a great movie at the time , and still enjoy watching from time to time . TMNT stars Judith Hoag as April O'Neal , Elias Koteas as Casey Jones , and Corey Feldmen as the voice of Donatello.The story takes place in New York , where a popular television reporter , April O'Neal , reports of recent rise in crime which she believes there is more to it then what the police department is saying . Of course , the people doing the crime want her to shut up . They are The Shredder and his group of ninjas called The Foot . During an attack by The Foot , April O'Neal is rescued by one of the turtles and taken to the turtles home . Soon Splinter , the turtles master , is kidnapped and they meet another ally , Casey Jones , who helps to rescue Splinter.Most critics will write Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles off as a terrible movie . They always do when it 's a movie directed towards the young ( with Disney Animated features being the exception ) . It may be no Citzen Cane , then again , it is n't trying to be . More people like it then is willing to admit it , I guarantee that . GRADE : B+	1
This was the best Turtles movie . Although a little more cartoony then the comic , it 's entertaining and violent enough to keep your attention . Suprisingly it has some good messages about family and brotherhood .	1
I bought this DVD to replace one I 'd burned from a TV showing . It was described accurately and , quite simply , LOVELY . The thrilling thing , for ME , was that I got to play the games ! ! ! ! I taught in TMNT era & LOVED the movie when it first came out . It reminds me of happy times , before a life-changing car accident.Thank you for selling it to me -J	1
not much i can say about this movie that fans of the movie dont already know ! what i can say is this movie needs better dvd treatment and almost every one can agree with me on that,2disk special edition anyone ? !	1
I have yet to award a five star review , but the original TMNT movie was pretty damn close . Any other TMNT movie after the first is for lack of better word , garbage . The original is on the borderline of classic . An almost flawless flim with nonstop satisfaction from beginning to end . The screenplay was executed with supreme excellence , and the settings ( both city and country ) were perfect . Most main characters played their parts extremely well.The storyline of the original TMNT movie was inline to the cartoon 's original fundamentals . The individual storyline of the flim was pretty creative and entertaining ( Danny turning from thug kid to hug kid ) . I 've watched this flim a dozen plus times , and it never gets old , at all . You do n't even have to be part of the generation that grew up on the cartoon to fall in love with this flick . I would strongly recommend this DVD purchase to anyone . It 's a great movie , at a great value ( currently around $ 10 - $ 15 ) .	1
I can remeber watching this movie for the first time . My dad surprised us to a sneak peak of it on a Saturday afternoon . We thought we were going to see Ernest Goes to Jail when what I got was one of my favorite movies of all time.The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a huge cartoon show . Anybody that was around in the late 1980 's remembers these guys even if they never watched it . The four heros named after the artists have become a pop culture legend and this live action movie of the heros did n't disappoint at all.Leonardo , Donatello , Michelangelo , and Raphael are the Ninja turtles . They were found by there master Splinter in a sewer in green ooze . The ooze mutated the turtles and splinter into walking talking human size animals . Splinter being from Japan had learned karate from mimicking the moves of his master.April O'neil ( Hoag ) is one of the top reporters in New York City . Her big report is on a clan of teenage ninjas who call themselves the Footclan . They are running amuck in the city and come after her one night after work . She is saved when the light in the parking lot turns in pitch black . She has no idea who saved her but is grateful.During the fight Raphael loses one of his Sais . Determined to get it back he starts to tag the reporter and follow her . He rescues her again because the Shredder ( Saito ) has sent his men after her again . He takes her back to the turlte lair and is unaware that he was followed . Splinter nurses April back to health and she befriends the Turtles.Shredder does n't stop and sends the men for revenge . The Foot kidnap Splinter and the Turtles go into hiding with April . Their cover is soon blown and Foot attacks her at her home . The Turtles along with Casey Jones ( Koteas ) retreat . With Splinter gone and Raphael hurt the moral is shot of the group . They must recover save Splinter and stop the Footclan.I loved this movie as a child . I have the old school VHS version with the kid in the pizza hut commercial `` Making It Great . '' I also love the theme song for the movie `` Turtle Power '' by MC Hammer . Thats some good old school . I use to watch this with my bros and sisters a couple of times a week . We could n't get enough of it . The movie has a cheesy script but it has so many great one liners that you will never forget . I could probaly quote almost half of the movie to you word for word and get 90 % of it pretty accurate.Jim Henson 's Muppet Shop did a fantastic job with the Turtles . They did n't look stupid and the fighting scenes with them are terrific . All the costumes are good and Splinter is also real good . Thats the biggest rat I think thats ever been made that was n't a CGI . It 's cool seeing some old school costumes like this instead of CGI.This movie is really easy to get cheap . I found it on DVD for under $ 5 . It does n't have any extras which really stinks . I hope they decide one day to put this on a special edition DVD.If you want to give your kids a great family movie you wil have no problems with then buy this now . If you liked the cartoon show you have to buy this . Your DVD collection wo n't be complete without it . It made a $ 135 milliono back in 1990 which was a ton of money for that time period . That kind of money is still good for now a days . You will have fun with this movie .	1
This is one of those movies that I think has just been misstreaded when beeing put on DVD . The movie is great , but there are no bonus materials : ( Ever since the film came out , we always wondered where that scene was that shows up on the trailer ? a scene where the turtles are in the water , and there shells pop up ... so with this DVD i was hoping there would be deleted scenes to satasfy that curiosity ? But sadly , there isnt even a featurette : ( And i know they made featurettes , i remember clearly all those years ago a guy punching in things on a key bourd , and the robotic head of Raphial it was hooked into was moving the facial features around ... . so where are those features ? ? ? For this decent price , its ok . The sewer game is forgetable , might occupy you for a few minutes ? ! But i 'm very disapointed that there is no bonus features with this great ninja comedy .	1
You 've got to give Steve Barron credit : any other director might 've taken the live-action version of Kevin Eastman 's and Peter Laird 's creations and produced something more akin to the animated , kid-friendly television show that dominated Saturday morning cartoons for years . Not that this film does n't have an all-age appeal , but who remembers the original comic book , which was far more gritty and mature than what public television might 've allowed ? Granted , it 's hard to sell the idea of four anthromorphic , ninjutsu-practicing , pizza-loving reptiles to begin with , but once the magic of Jim Henson sets in , a rather simplistic storyline becomes a most refreshing display of kung fu , comedy , and rubber suits that goes beyond expectations.These rubber suits are , of course what sells the movie . Create a costume of a 6-foot turtle that will look good in casual circumstances as well as in stylized combat , and you 're close to getting yourself a winner . Master puppetry , coupled with fantastic athletic displays and individual voice-acting cements the four brothers ( Leonardo , Raphael , Michelangelo , and Donatella ) as completely believable characters , immersed in an underground ( and , eventually , street-top ) battle with a villian - the armoured Shredder - whose spectacle is kept revered throughout the film by an unfaltering darkness to his character , highlighted by real-life crimes of child recruitment . Insert Judith Hoag into her tailor-made role of the reporter , April O'Neil , and wiley Elias Koteas into the character of suave streetfighter Casey Jones , and both of their abilities to react believably to people in costumes , and you 've got yourself a winner.Well , maybe not yet . Though one ca n't expect much out of an action film when it comes to storylines , `` Turtles '' pulls it off by filling the fast-paced , quick-evented timeline with enough personality to make up for the relative speedy plot , which includes abduction , ambush , capture , retreat , reconciliation , emotional unearthing , return , battle-battle , and victory - all within 90 minutes . While I would have enjoyed certain aspects of the story ( mainly , the time of the story spent between scenes ) to be elaborated on more than they were , you can only praise the film for managing to plausibly tell the entire storyline of the original comic in the time that it did , by giving necessary focus on the multi-dimensional proportions of key scenes ( ex : the reprieve at the farm , the Shredder 's corraling of his recruits ) . In conclusion , the film pulls off the storytelling as well as and maybe even better than most other action films , securely a good mark in the field , but keeping it from being perfect ( maybe if the film had been 30 minutes longer ... ) .By keeping everything in context with the original publication , and by throwing in just the right amount of quirky humor , the film achieves most of its potential . A $ 13 million budget and collaboration with Jim Henson pay off by producing a cult film which sequels have yet to top ( as well as a worldwide profit of about $ 200 million ) , and which cinematic history has yet to render obsolete.For fans of the franchise , this film is an absolute must-buy . Casuals viewers who find nothing wrong with talking , butt-kicking turtles and nifty kung-fu should likewise find no fault in this film . It 's one of the few features that makes up for its shortcomings ( the few that there are ) with sheer fun and enjoyment . You 'd have to be remarkably prim to not give this happy little masterpiece a watch .	1
Yes , this movie is a classic . I feel very lucky to have grown up when the Ninja Turtles first became popular . This was back at a time when thought and care went into children 's entertainment . Unlike the stuff kids are watching today . All of the characters in the Ninja Turtles series have distinct personalities and they 're all lovable in their own way . If you loved this movie when you were a kid you 'll still love it as an adult . Sure , the movie looks dated but it is far superior to the recent kids movies out there like & quot ; Power Rangers. & quot ;	1
Cowabunga ? Lame to many now , but then it was great before Power rangers infested the TV and then Pokemon controlling our kids into some Poke-cult . Well this movie was the last of the rough PG movies . That was before the parent groups got in the way with how extreme things get . This movie came out in a beautiful time when PG movies were worth something . This movie has well choreographed martial arts sequences , pretty funny as the young ninjas characters are , and it had issues . The type of issues that kids and parents share from generation to generation , unfortunately at the time parent groups focused their attention more on the violence . I am not saying that they are wrong . It is a rough violent movie , but I did not see heavy `` actual '' fighting , any blood . Blood as in oozing liquid . There was a death though ( not truly as the next movie proved ) , and a couple in a memory so I understand that part , but in Bambi they shot Bambi 's mother . Anyway , this movie has no `` do n't do this kid , cause it is bad for you '' or `` you evil villain , you will never get away with this . '' This is not like that at all.Ninja Turtles used their trained skills and street smarts to survive and thrive , instead of using machines and alien given powers , or pokedecks . The four turtles were raised and trained by their master , who is more like a father to them , Splinter . Past meets present , where a ninja clan that used to terrorize Japan ` back in the day ' has returned to the streets of New York . The turtles do not go out stopping this ninja clan , the clan goes after them first . The ninja clan strikes hard and does lost of physical and emotional damage to the mutant family and then , things get personal.This movie is good the way it is , but if it was revised in a PG-13 way , a little darker , serious fight scenes mixed with Jackie Chan like fight scenes , some up beat music , then we would have a neat movie for sure . This movie is good as it is . No cheep computer Jar-Jar Binks animation too , machines and puppeteering always looked more convincing .	1
They eat pizza , they practice Ninja and they 're reptiles . Michaelanglo , Donatelo , Leonardo and Raphael are now the movie . Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : the Movie . America 's Favorite green teens are brought to life by Jim Henson 's creature shop . From the comic book and the popular tv show comes the movie adaptation about four turtles who from a ooze substance evolved in walking talking human like reptiles , given renisance artist names by their master who discovered when they were normal turtles , Splinter , a rat who envolved in size and speaking too . They live in a New York sewer den and they meet and befriend Newsreporter April O'Neal . When an Ninja organization called the Foot lead by the turtle 's archenemy The Shredder , finds out about the turtles and kidnapps Splinter , The fighting foursome and their new friend Casey Jones , a former hockey player , must battle the Foot , save splinter and defeat the Shredder . One of the best movies of the 90s and a great movie to start off the 1990s , high kicking fun , action packed , funny , terrific entertainment.One Shell of a time , The Turtles still rule , these boys truly are radical reptiles . If you enjoyed the tv show as a kid like I did , see their blockbuster movie , if you have n't or If you saw the Movie , then see the Sequel , The Secret of the Ooze . The third one not so good , I do n't recommend it . I strongly recommend this awsome movie . Bring home the green teens and anyone who tells you the turtles suck give SHELL ! They 're one of most famous movie fighting foursomes among others like Ghostbusters . This is one of best 90s films known to Man or turtle . COWABUNGA !	1
This DVD is fantastic . I am a public school Music/Dance instructor . I use it as a resource after I have taught poly-rhythms and syncopation . Also , it is simply a great performance .	1
This could have been the ideal version to have on DVD.The opera is presented in a grand and lavish d & eacute ; cor that will be hard to reproduce on a stage performance . Act 1 in Violetta 's house in Paris is if anything too rich , but splendid too watch . Her getting drunk and violent at the end is rather pointless . At the beginning of act 2 , Zeffirelli repeats the music of the opening of act 1 , to show Violetta 's departure for the countryside . Totally unnecessary , as Verdi never wrote anything of the kind . The gardens and the country-house in act 2 are wonderful , so is the photography . In act 2 scene 2 , we are back in Paris in a very similar house to act 1 , too similar in a way . The party is good , the dancers are good and the staging of the drama , excellent . In act 3 , Zeffiirelli cuts away all the music before Violetta 's big are `` Addio del passato '' gaining 5 minutes and loosing the point of her being generous , even on her death-bed by giving all her money to the poor . At the end , Violetta seems to run around too much for a woman about to die from consumption . Now for the singers . Teresa Stratas has an ideal face and figure for the role and her acting is excellent . She copes vocally with most things but really goes to pieces in `` Sempre libera '' screaming instead of singing at the end . Domingo is wonderful throughout , both vocally and visually . Macneil is adequate in every way , but not exceptional . James Levine , in my opinion is a bad conductor when it comes to Verdi , and this score shows his weaknesses . The music simply does not flow as it should , and the climaxes are poor . I do not know who is better on DVD but on CD try Giulini , Serafin , Kleiber , Toscanini , or even Muti to see what I mean.If you want a spectacular Traviata on DVD , I feel this is the one to get . It could have easily been so much better , but this is true of most things . My advice , get it quick because it seems to be disappearing from the catalogues .	1
This video which is a movie , sung and performed by wellknown opera singers taken at luxurious homes and country side scenery as background is really a marvellous combination of the usual opera performance and natural movie shooting.Placido Domingo as the young and romantic Alfredo sung so perfectly , so that he enlivened the tragic story of the young man falling in love to the wayward lady , Violetta . While Teresa Stratas , with her clear full voice , matching Domingo in her superb singing and performance , emphasized the tragic nuance of the music itself . Also Cornell MacNeil as Alfredo 's father , Giorgio sung as beautifully as the others in his deep bass baritone voice and made the whole performance more than perfect.We are especially moved by the magnificent romantic duets of Alfredo and Violetta and also the tragic duets of Violetta and Alfredo 's father , Giorgio . Meanwhile we also adore the beautiful scenery in the luxurious rooms and country side , which can not be viewed if perform on stage.In overall this video is totally so enchanting with magnificent music and singing with excellent and beautiful background scenery from beginning to the end .	1
This is without a doubt the greatest version of La Traviata ever produced.On DVD , it 's unbelievably gorgeous and features production notes and cast bios as well as a trailer . The forces behind this masterpiece are responsible for its greatness- Italian director and designer Franco Zefferelli , tenor Placido Domingo , soprano Teresa Stratas and baritone Cornell McNeil . The singers are at the top of their game , Domingo is a young , sexy Alfredo and Teresa Stratas IS Violetta Valery in a performance that even Maria Callas would envy . Zefferelli had Maria Callas in mind when he cast Teresa Stratas . Like Callas , Stratas has a Greek background through her parents though she was Canadian born , she has the same type of voice and she is in Zefferelli 's own words `` an electrifying actress and soprano of the lyric entertainment '' . The Callas connection is most obvious when Stratas appears in a black veiled gown in Act 2 at Flora 's party where even her hair is similar to Callas ' infamous 50 's performances.Released in 1982 , Zefferelli sought to `` convert '' people into opera lovers through the lush visual seduction of the cinema . This is exactly what he did . The cinematography of this film kills you with excessive beauty . The opening credits roll as we see scenes of Paris in the Notre Dame Cathedral area and surrounding residential district by the Seine river . The interior of Violetta Valery 's mansion , where she hosts the Act 1 party , is luxurious and Zefferelli allows us to be dizzied with the sheer opulence of the house- gilded mirrors , portraits of Violetta , curtains , chandeliers etc . Visually on film we are able to tell things about the characters that stage performances do not , for example as the guests depart from Act 1 's party , an old woman steals a silver box from Violetta proving to us that Violetta is not among real friends , these are only fair-weathered friends and bad ones at that . They were not even there for her when she was dying in the finale.The beginning of the film has Violetta reminiscing about the better days as a desirable and wealthy courtesan who partied all the time . She is deathly ill and already her house is sold and men are moving her things out . The country scenes are incredibly beautiful as Violetta and Alfredo live happily in seclusion . Alfredo rides his horse and Violetta picks flowers for her greenhouse and feeds her white doves in their big cage . Cornell McNeil 's bombastic but fatherly Giorgio Germont is a great support to the refined performances of Domingo and Stratas . The Flora 's party scene is exceptional with even more visual beauty as Gypsies and bullfighters dance seductively and professional gamblers enjoy themselves . The closing ensemble is not to be missed and neither is the melancholy and tragic ending . Conductor James Levine leads the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus . Once again , this is the greatest and ultimate version of La Traviata ever made . It is a must have for opera fans and for curious non-opera lovers . Other films Domingo made after this film are Carmen in '84 and Verdi 's Othello in 86 . Teresa Stratas is the greatest Violetta and she will win your heart with her convincing performance as the sickly , passionate and self-sacrificing courtesan whose love for Alfredo redeems her and gives her happiness even if she dies at the end .	1
This adaptation of Verdi 's opera La Traviata is simply sumptuous and a lavish production . Never before than an opera is transformed into a beautiful film . Ms.Stratas and Mr. Domingo performed and sings with pure gusto and it is a sheer delight . Set designs and costumes are a credit to the production and director Zeffereli excels in his delivery of this opera and presents it as a movie experience . Music performed by The Metropolitan Opera orchestra conducted by James Levine and the music thoroughly shines all the way through.I truly enjoyed this film experience and enjoy the music and performance .	1
I had fun going back to my childhood memories . There is a favorite scene I have . 5 Words . THE GIANT MOUSE OF MINSK !	1
It 's amazing that Steven Spielberg does n't get more recognition for producing one of the greatest animation movies of all time . Although the story is very simple , it rings true on so many different levels . The contrast of the Mousekowitzes with actual human turn of the century immigration experiences is poignantly done . A cartoon where you really care about characters . Great for the kids .	1
Fievel is a young Russian mouse separated from his parents on the way to America , a land they think is without cats . When he arrives alone in the New World , he keeps up hope , searching for his family , making new friends , and running and dodging the cats he thought he 'd be rid off . An American Tail easily one of the best animated features ever made , but it proves to be leaps beyond the efforts of recent Disney movies by refusing to be constricted to an all too familiar formula . A heartwarming story , beautiful songs , great performances and the animation is stellar . This is an excellent movie for all ages that will warm your heart	1
This sequel to `` An American Tail '' is a fine animated film full of Old West Americana ; the stuff legends are made of . It is full of great characters and you may even soon forget that you are watching an animated film . The story and dialogue are that good ! James Horner seems to have really come of age with this memorable score . It is as much homage to Copland as it is to the American West . This was James Stewart 's last theatrical film . This is a good and entertaining family film , which expounds virtues of loyalty and honor . Highly recommended viewing !	1
When these first were released on VHS in the 80 's , they alone almost cost $ 19 , now you get 3 titles in one DVD ! There is no 5.1 mix but it is 2.0 stereo.Manzerik made a few Doors videos in the `` Dance on Fire '' title , `` LA Woman '' is a nice piece of art.The collection shows many live performances and video clips , as well as interviews.The 3 films Combined you gives hours of enjoyment . Until the remaining 3 members sit down for new interviews and create thier own Beatle-like verison of `` Anthology '' , this DVD set is very acceptable .	1
this is part documentary and part concert . it has great sound and pictur quality . it has plenty of special features .	1
The resolution is n't great but this collection gathers up 3 80 's vintage Doors videos which are now out of print and adds some extras , so is worth picking up .	1
I had a lot of this collection on VHS . I sought to convert my collection to DVDs , but this collection has n't been available until now . Apparently assembled under the watchful eye of Ray Manzarek , this collection adds footage to the VHS collection I had as it chronicles the evolution of one of LA 's greatest bands .	1
The Doors Collection ( Collector 's edition ) . Get this for the `` Live at Hollywood Bowl '' performance and consider all the other stuff as wonderful bonus material . This DVD will satisfy your Door 's video desires but it also makes a great companion piece to the `` When Your Strange '' documentary ( which is not a part of this collection ) .	1
Morrison 's misunderstood genius comes to fore in this DVD collection . Much of the videos remastered here are from Jim 's film school days at UCLA when music videos were not even being imagined by the greater public . In fact , Morrison may have been the innovator of music videos prior to MTV and its very large following . Highly recommended for the curious these videos are genius at work long before the on set of music television !	1
For any Doors fan , this DVD is a must have . It 's got essentially every piece of footage ever shot of Jim Morrison ( except for performances appearing on other DVD 's ) . It 's got an audio commentary by Ray Manzarek , Robbie Krieger , and John Densmore . And it 's one of the most interesting and entertaining music DVD 's ever . From a huge fan of The Doors standpoint.It 's three separate segments ( Dance on Fire , Live at The Hollywood Bowl , and The Soft Parade ) . `` Dance on Fire '' features the music videos forBreak on Through , People Are Strange , The Crystal Ship , and The Unknown Soldier . As well as Ray Manzarek 's new video for `` L.A. Woman '' which captures the tone of the song perfectly . It also features the Ed Sullivan Show performance of `` Light My Fire '' . The same one which was the subject of great controversy because Jim said the word `` higher '' on television . It also features a video for `` Roadhouse Blues '' which features some great shots of Morrison . The videos for Break on Through , People Are Strange , The Crystal Ship , and The Unknown Soldier are all great . Then we have the performance at The Hollywood Bowl . This is easily the greatest performance ever captured on film of The Doors . Jim Morrison puts on a brilliant performance , especially during the song `` The Unknown Soldier '' and '' The End '' where he improvises a few lines . The final segment `` The Soft Parade '' begins with a montage of video clips to the background song '' The Changeling '' . Then we see some performances that were part of a PBS special , including the only video in existence of The Doors performing the song `` The Soft Parade '' . There 's also two interviews that were part of the PBS special where Morrison talks about his poetry/lyrics and accurately predicts the future of recording technology , which is very cool . The video ofJim improving a tribute to Friedirch Nietzsche is very cool too . Also , during the audio commentary we 're shown a video of a few girls talking to Jim through the window of a car ... Watch where that girls hand goes to ... Also , this PBS special was featured on another Doors DVD called `` Soundstage Performances '' and for some odd reason , the video quality on this DVD is ten times better than it was on `` Soundstage Performances '' . The audio quality has improved as well . Anyway , as for the Bonus Features ; we get to see the two student films that Ray Manzarek directed while attending UCLA.One of them features a shower scene with a man and Ray Manzarek 's wife , that Ray refused to cut causing Morrison to gain respect for him . There 's some excerpts from John Densmore 's one man play , which is actually pretty funny . One reviewer mentioned that it sucks ( I 'm paraphrasing here ) to hearDensmore sing , because he ca n't . Well , no , he does n't have a very good voice , but the way he 's singing the songs are sarcastic to get the audience laughing . Turns out , Densmore is a pretty witty guy . Then there 's an instrumental version of `` The End '' performed by Robbie Krieger , which is really great . It would be cool to her Jim 's voice added to it for maximum effect though . There 's also an interesting montage of photographs from the `` Morrison Hotel '' sessions with commentary by the photographer . It 's pretty funny to learn how Morrison and crew went into a place called The Morrison Hotel and took some pictures when management told them not to . Another thing , I neglected to mention about the main audio commentary with Manzarek , Krieger , and Densmore is that it 's obvious that these men loved Jim Morrison and still do . To hear them talk about the events taking place on the tapes with such loving affection is great . Also , I forgot to mention the video 's for `` Wild Child '' . The song 's not my favorite ever , but it 's pretty cool to see The Doors perform the song in the studio . Overall , this is the essential Doors DVD for The Doors fanatic . This is the definition of perfection.GRADE : A+	1
While not totally comprehensive , there 's a lot of material here to absorb and enjoy . After you watch the DVD , be sure to check out the band commentary as it 's awesome ; lots of fun anecdotes and insight . I enjoyed the bonus extras as well ; re : Manzarek student films , memorabilia gallery w/commentary and photo shoot for Morrison 's HotelI hate to encourage a further money grab , but it would be nice to have a comprehensive `` ultimate '' collection w/everything available on one edition ; not just material here , but all of The Doors available video stuff on one release . New menus , get rid of some the bad editing/silhouettes from Soundstage ( if that 's possible ) , new material ( there 's got to be some ) etc . DMC is probably planning something like this for the future .	1
No doubt had I watched this series 35 years ago , I would have run out of the room when guests like Bobby Sherman or Steve Lawrence came on . And like many of the reviewers here , I would have questioned the intelligence of putting so many performers of different musical background all on one show . But I remember that Ed Sullivan 's show had a similar mismatching of musical talent every week ( not to mention puppet shows and ballet ! ) . That was the sign of the times . The title of this show sums it all up : Music Scene . It is a terrific time capsule of the entire music scene of that era . It 's all so innocent and unsophisticated to us now , but that 's why most of the show is extremely enjoyable to watch . This show was right on the cusp of the next wave of television that was soon going to splinter into specialized programming . Previous to that , as we can see in this show , there was a lot of pressure to make sure that all the programming had something for everyone . I 'm glad that it did splinter into programming that offered more intelligence and sophistication , but I 'm also glad that there is this record of the America of decades past . One can appreciate how `` radical '' the sixties was on mainstream America when they see its musical extremes back-to-back . I think this series is a wonderful kaleidoscopic portrait of one of the most amazing times in our history , musically and culturally.FEATURED PERFORMERS : James Brown , Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young , Oliver , Three Dog Night , Tom Jones , The Rascals , The Dells , Roger Miller , Smokey Robinson and the Miracles , Bobby Sherman , The Music Scene Singers , Sly and the Family Stone , Merle Haggard , Pat Williams , Steve Lawrence , The Temptations , Jerry Lee Lewis , Smith , Ten Years After , Richie Havens , Janis Joplin , Isaac Hayes , The Archies , and special gusts hosts Tommy Smothers and Michael Cole ( reciting Rod McKuen - aagh ! ) .

What a wonderful discovery on DVD ! There are two DVD 's that comprise the complete series , which was only on from September , 1969 , to January , 1970 . David Steinberg is great as the host , and was one of the writers of the show . What a great showcase of the talent of the late 60 's ! It 's an interesting variety of musical artists , and a neat time capsule of pop culture.One of the coolest episodes , in my opinion , is the very last one , co-hosted by Comedy Legend Groucho Marx ! ! They did a little 'chat ' session with Groucho and David Steinberg which is a classic ! Apparently this show was cancelled due to low ratings and competition from 'Laugh-In ' And 'Gunsmoke ' , and I bet the producers/writers/performers never thought it 'd ever see the light of day in any form after cancellation , but HOORAY for the DVD 's ! ! ! ! Some of the best things about the DVD 's are all the Extra Bonus Material ! It appears to be segments/songs/musicians cut from the original episodes ! It 's some killer stuff , and I 'm amazed that all this fabulous material got the AXE during the original run of the show ! Well , they only had 45 minutes per episode to get so much material in , I guess ... .This is a must-see for fans of pop culture and music of the late 60 's ! I highly recommend it !	1
I initially bought Vol 3 on VHS , because I 'd never seen the Supremes perform & quot ; Nothing But Heartaches , & quot ; being that during Motown 's greatest era , I was living in Germany , and did n't have much opportunity to catch any of their appearances shown stateside . Watching the entire clips brings back great memories.I miss the days of singers who occasionally danced ...	1
This is a great movie with which you can wind your kids down . I like to put it on before bedtime . Most of the movie is slow and serene , but heart-warming at the same time . There are layers of lessons to be learned , all of which come through very well .	1
I 'm not exactly sure why I received a free copy of this DVD in the mail ; this is n't the sort of film I normally buy . I 'm clearly much older than the intended audience , and I have no little rugrats of my own to share this movie with ( to be fair though , this is obviously a kids movie that grownups can also enjoy ) . In fact ( although whatever computer program that decided I should be put on the Disney marketing mailing list would n't have known ) , I 've reached my present age without ever having seen the film BAMBI before . So , for me , this is n't a nostalgic look back at a film I loved as a child . It is n't a happy reunion with something that thrilled me years ago , something which contains many happy memories . For me , it was just another film , albeit one with a grand reputation . But I watched it and enjoyed it ; although I 'm clearly not seeing it in the same mind-frame that others do.This is a very leisurely and pleasant film . It 's willing to feature slow pans across lovingly painted backdrops of forest rather than quick-cuts and lots of action . The script is more interested in presenting a mood rather than telling a story , and it 's offered in a way that I quite enjoyed . The characters are simple without coming across as stereotypes . There 's a quote from Walt Disney that reads , `` Until a character becomes a personality , it can not be believed . '' Well , I think he succeeded ( my favorite character was the grumpy , bad-tempered , old owl ) . I ca n't say that I adored the film , but I 'm glad I spent the time watching it . It covers a lot of the same ground embraced by other children 's stories , but it did so with great confidence and an pure kind of style.In many ways this is a much more innocent movie than what we would expect nowadays . On the other hand , I was vaguely surprised at how dark portions of it were . The sections of the film dealing with the encounters between the animals and the humans are , of course , well known ( even I knew about Bambi 's mother ) and well remembered . And I must admit to being a bit baffled by the sequence in which several female critters hide in the bushes like snipers and one-by-one pick off unsuspecting members of the male animal kingdom for , um , marriage ( or whatever ) . It 's an ... old-fashioned view of male-female relationships , I suppose . A relatively harmless but overwhelmingly male-centric view of the world , I still found it slightly creepy . It would no doubt be handled differently today , though I suspect there would n't feature any actual improvement . The female skunks and rabbits would probably be having wardrobe malfunctions all over the place to attract their men.The two DVDs contain more than anyone who loves this film would ever want and the set gets an extra star just for all the DVD features . Not being familiar with the movie , I really was n't interested in this , although I 'm sure that when the list of features was announced a few months ago there were a lot of classic film buffs ( and Disney fans ) salivating wildly . However , the one item this film-viewer appreciated more than anything was the digital restoration . Whether you like the movie or not , you ca n't help but be impressed by how crisp the picture is , how bright the colors are and how clear the sound is . It really looks and sounds wonderful . I suspect for many people , this is what makes the set worth buying.One thing I did n't like about this double-disc set is the advertising all over the place . It 's bad enough having to sit through ads and trailers before you get to the main menu , but the annoyances do n't even end there . I realize I 'm watching a `` Disney DVD '' and that it 's been restored and that it 's digitally optimized for my magic whatsit converter thingie ! Why on Earth do I need to see giant signs with bold letters telling me this before starting the feature ? I must have fast-forwarded though three minutes of boasting . In addition to the filler on the discs , the DVD case also contains more junk than is necessary . I can understand them putting in fliers promoting release dates for future DVDs ; that makes perfect sense . But posters ? Magazines ? There 's an advertisement for food in here for heaven 's sake ! In any event , I finally got introduced to one of the most famous and beloved children 's movies of all time . Had it not been sent to me out of the blue , I probably would have spent another few decades without knowing it . I 'm glad I did though . I liked it , even if I 'm not sure I 'll ever feel a staggering desire to watch it again . For people casually interested , at least a rental is in order . For the hardcore Disney folk however , I suspect this is a must-buy .	1
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE TREASURE ... . I LOVE BAMBI THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WALT DISNEY MOVIES OUT THERE ! ! ! ! 1I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH THAT I CAN CRY . VERY ENCHANTING ... ... ... ... ... .	1
This movie is a classic and one of the first movies I remenber have seen In my ilfe .	1
This by far one of Disney 's best films ! I cry every time I see it . Those of you who have n't seen this yet , get your tissues ready . Thumper is a wonderful character and the whole film is touching and poignant .	1
Walt Disney 's Bambi is the picture of innocence . This family classic was recently digitally restored to , no doubt , better than its original beauty . The colors remain somewhat muted , though . These are not the vibrant colors of a yellow brick road.Most people know the character Bambi ( and do n't forget Thumper ! ) , but did you know that he was born to be the Prince of the forest and that his father , who was wiser and older than all the other deer was the forest king ? It 's true . When Bambi 's mother is out of the picture , Bambi 's kingly father steps in to raise the prince . When we see Bambi in the end of the movie , he has a family of his own and his given rise to another forest prince . The seasons and cycles of life , death , and rebirth come full circle and repeat.This is an American classic that everyone should see . It 's an indelible part of American culture and one that shows just how innocent movies once were.Treat yourself and your family to the newly restored Bambi and see how innocent American film once was . Bambi is a classic that rises above genre .	1
I was born in 1983 so I missed the `` classic '' Disney era , so I grew up on the Disney formula of late which is to have about 5 songs in the span of an hour and it does get irritating where a character would do something than just break into song . In the classic days , there was usually songs in the background done by a choir or a character in the film but it would n't seem instrusive like Aurora in Sleeping Beauty . Bambi looks like a simple film but there 's quite a lot going on for it.If the introduction reminds you of the Lion King , this is where those guys got the idea for their film . It starts with the birth of the prince Bambi , a deer who 's extremely timid and does n't have the greatest of balance . He eventually befriends Thumper , a mischievous rabbit and Flower , a really happy skunk ( I hate to say gay but you 'll see what I mean ) .From there we explore Bambi as he understands his new world , from knowing the distance between a bird and a butterfly , the slipperyness of ice and other life lessons , including the loss of a loved one . I remember being about 5 watching the scene with Bambi 's mother and since her death ( as if it 's a spoiler at this point ) is offscreen , I could n't understand what happened since as kids , we ca n't really think outside the box and put 2 and 2 together.It 's interesting that when I showed people that I bought this , a lot of them could n't understand that why I , a big fan of Aliens , Terminator 2 and the Godfather would watch Bambi but really there 's 2 things : it is a charming film if you watch it knowing you 're watching a Disney film and 2 , apparently mothers really find it adorable if you watch these willingly.The one thing as usual I ca n't stand with Disney and you probably hate this too is the fact that Disney releases a film for awhile then they completely call back the DVD 's that did n't sell and keep them . I ca n't find Beauty and the Beast anywhere and Alice in Wonderland is extremely rare to find . I found one copy of Aladdin and go figure , Disney forgot to put the damn movie in the case so I exchanged it for this instead . So I 'd suggest picking this up not only for it 's rarity but for it 's charm .	1
Disney 's 5th and final Animated film from the golden years gets a nice looking upgrade for Blu Ray . The film has never looked better , but it is a little light on bonus material , probably due to less material to be found for it . While the film looks fantastic , I will keep my previous Platinum edition because once again Disney has omitted some bonus material that should have made the cut , there is n't anything too important missing , but considering this is a short treatment to begin with they should have included all of it . I also like to compare the two film releases as the older version shows more grain so I can revisit the film the way I remember it from my childhood.One of Disney 's more unique animated films shows labor intensive animation marrying realistic and cartoony looking creatures in one film . The backgrounds are also a standout here with beautiful forest settings and lavish artwork galore . They can be marveled at for hours and I doubt will ever see anything like this ever again . The film looks and sounds better than ever on Blu Ray . Disney 's first 5 films remain the standout features and all hold a place in the best animated films of all time , not saying that later releases such as Cinderella , Sleeping Beauty and Beauty and the Beast do n't hold spots there too , but the first 5 have a certain quality to them that has never been surpassed by the studio . If you do n't own Bambi , the Blu Ray edition is the way to go , but you might want to hold onto your Platinum edition as well .	1
Hard to believe that this modest effort caused so much concern when it was first released in 1942 . It lost money , was not well received by critics , even Walt 's daughter Diane was n't too thrilled with the idea of Bambi 's mother dying . ( Walt claimed that he was only following the book , however loosely , a first for him as Walt regularly played fast and loose with classic children 's literature . Something his daughter noticed , you 've taken liberties before ! Why not now ! ) Some critics called this film `` entirely unpleasant . '' Hunters said it was `` an insult to American sportsmen . `` Yes , the book by Felix Salten is much better . And Walt had no problem putting out a cheap rendition of that book and slapping his name on it : Walt Disney 's Bambi ( that must have been a shock to the poor author who actually created the character ! ) .Still , it is breathtaking to watch decades later , like paintings in motion . A fabulous score/choir accompanies the great artwork . Thumper still remains the star of this little masterpiece . The most frightening scene for me is not the off screen disappearance of Bambi 's mother , it 's the pheasants hiding in the grass , trying to calm one of their own , as the hunters approach , `` do n't ' fly ! '' The pack of dogs was also horrific to watch as a child and still pack an emotional wallop today . This film remains an odd mixture of excessive cuteness/silliness ( Flower , et cetera ) , awesome beauty , and coldblooded realism . It is definitely an incredible contribution to the art of animation .	1
`` Bambi '' is Walt Disney 's 1942 animated feature about a young deer 's first year of life . There is fun , there is joy , there is sadness and there 's love . It was one of the first films my Gran ever saw back when it originally came out , and a favorite of mine when I was little . I loved the golden book too ... It 's a pretty simple plot , a deer ( Bambi ) growing up over a year , but thanks to the animation and the score , it feels pretty dramatic . I remember when I was little , having this feeling that there was something signficant and special in the changing of the seasons , and of the growing-up of the animals . Slipping across a frozen pond , eating clover in a meadow , two bucks battling over a mate , a forest fire , the morning chorus of birds it 's all made to feel so momentous , and it does actually feel that way . A lot of characters ( particularly the birds ) are very cute , in that unique way that they were when Walt was still alive . There 's a lot of humour out of the cuteness too ( the skunk Flower going all red and tumbling backwards when he gets kissed by Ms . Flower , for instance , as well as Thumper the bunny in general . ) The version of the film I saw on DVD ( the two-disc special edition ) has been restored , and I think it looks pretty good . It 's colourful and crisp , as is the soundtrack and score . I did actually think to myself , regarding the score , `` this was recorded back in the 1940s , was n't it ? '' . It 's pretty clear sounding.The special features are nicely done too . There 's two `` deleted scenes '' from the winter sequence , which are basically storyboards with audio of the script . There 's a `` Walt 's Story Meetings '' feature , which is as close as we 'll get from getting an audio commentary from Walt Disney himself . Introduced by Patrick Stewart , it 's basically the film , mixed with rough drawings and the like passing around , while a dramatization of the transcripts of Walt Disney 's meetings are acted out . It 's interesting to get a feel for what Walt was aiming for , and it 's a unique way they 've gone and shown it . There 's also a few other making of documentaries on the second disc . There 's a sequence of games based around the seasons , where you play Bambi , and the owl ( whose a lot friendlier than he is in the film ) shows you round to games and puzzles . It 's point and click remote control stuff , pretty standard DVD games , though it 's very nicely presented . The games in this feature are for kids , and are loosely educational ( memory games , counting games , matching games , etc ) . It 's pretty playable , the only problem with it I think is in the flower matching game , where you have to match the colours of the flowers . The owl asks you to find the yellow one , when the ones that are yellow look kind of light green to me . I 'd find that a bit frustrating if I was younger , but anyway . There 's also a `` DisneyPedia '' mini-documentary on deer.Definitely worth a look for fans of kids films and fans of animation .	1
I have n't seen this movie since I was a kid of about seven or eight . I did n't realize that I was just a couple of years younger at that point than my dad was when the movie was originally released in '42.The beginning shows the superior artistry in telling the story . It comes across as real woods . For the most part , the animals behaved like animals ( though I do n't think deer talk to rabbits in real life ) .The best part of the DVD is the story board , where they go through the movie with the creators telling their thoughts about what to do and comparing it with previous movies.One part of the movie that is fantasy is that man is the only predator . In real life , the old wise owl and Flower would be preadators as well . Coyotes and wolves and mountain lions and bob cats were all absent from this forest.I found this a very scary movie when I was young . Parents would want to watch this with their kids , especially young ones .	1
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas . She has seen it many times before but wants her own copy . A good movie . But sadly Bambi 's mother dies . Wish Disney would stop killing off parents in their movies .	1
I never saw `` Bambi '' while I was growing up . I always knew about it , but it was n't a film that I was compelled to see . As far as Disney goes , I was more of an `` Old Yeller '' and `` Song Of The South '' kid . No matter now , because I bought this classic title for the enjoyment of my daughter , who will turn four in a few months , and I watched it with her.My daughter really enjoyed this movie . It is short , well-paced for children and is crawling with cuddly characters like Thumper , Flower , and every other small woodland creature that makes you feel warm inside . It follows the lifecycle of a newborn deer and his eventual growth into a leader of the forest . If you have n't figured it out yet , that deer is Bambi . We see him face the trials of being little and clumsy . He experiences the loss of a loved one , is taken under his father 's wing , and eventually falls in love and has a family of his own . In a nutshell , this simple flick is a reflection on the human life.The DVD is pretty good . It has the token Disney advertisements that everyone seems to hate . For some reason , my DVD player has no problem skipping these features and heading right to the title menu of the film . It seems that others have a problem with this . Anyway , I watched many of the advertisements this time around and I was n't bothered by them at all . I have n't paid much attention to the extra features on the second disc , because I buy DVDs primarily for the film on them . If a feature catches my eye , though , I 'll watch it.This movie does drag a little bit for older audiences . Since this was my first time viewing this film , I had no memories to fall back on . I still enjoyed the film , but I think that it is definitely a bigger hit with young children.Get this DVD if it brings back fond memories for you or if you want those memories for your own family . I 'm sure my daughter will remember this film for years to come .	1
At first , I was n't sure if I really wanted to purchase this movie or not.However , nowI 'm really glad that I have . I think I was reluctant because when I saw it the first time as a kid I did n't really understand what the purpose of the movie was . In a way , Bambi is a bit dark for kids . I love Bambi because of the simplicity of the storyline and the beauty of themusic . The music on its own is like another character and really describes what 's going on in the movie.This D.V.D . set is wonderful because it goes inside Disney 's private vault and it has some excellent games for all ages alike . I even found some of the games a bit more challenging then I would have liked . This is a really good family movie . However , I would suggest that children be a bit older to watchso that they completely understand what is happening in the movie .	1
the animation in this production is outstanding . you just ca n't compare todays computer enhanced art graphics with the real thing - God gifted artists using their intellect and talent and disipline to create thought provoking master pieces such as this . the beautiful back-drops in the film only add to this classic disney story , filled with all of the usual components that make disneys cachet of the animation market of this vein so successful : a morality story of some sort for young and old alike , lots of snappy characters and music , and lots and lots and lots of `` crayons '' !	1
As any true Disney Classic will , Bambi touches and warms your heart . This is one of those movies that stays with you for the rest of your life , after just one viewing , because of its impact.Bambi was the first animated film to ever touch on the subject of ecology , and man 's effect on nature . However , while it explores such a heavy subject it still maintains a simple beauty and charm . It has all of the elements of an animated masterpiece : beautiful animation , an interesting story line , loveable characters , and great voice acting . However , it also brings the added joy of remembering all of the wonder that the world has to offer . There are very powerful scenes , including Bambi 's well known trama at losing his mother , and its sure to make you stop and think .	1
If film makers could figure out how to make a film like `` Bambi '' every time , the art of film making would be just that ; an art . `` Bambi '' is a tale that is for children . However , that tale contains every element present in the life of a typical child : friendship , love , parental protection , loss , fear of the unknown , and , of course , growing up . I am still astonished at how a film that clocks in at 69 minutes can capture the essence of life . `` Bambi '' is born into the world of the forest . Everyone calls him a prince . Bambi learns quickly that his world is full of friends , but he also soon learns that portions of the world are scary and unknown , with the scariest thing of all , the creature we never see , man . `` Bambi '' alternates between humor and fear , and yet , the theme of the movie is that all these things are a part of life.Of course , we know that in the end Bambi will overcome , giving children and adults everywhere a message of hope . No matter the traumas that we face in life , we have the ability to persevere . We have the ability to change our world . We have the ability to love and hope . We too can be Bambi.Few movies can touch `` Bambi '' in the skill of animation and direction . The plotting is phenomenally focused and fast-paced . This movie is one that every home should own , regardless of whether you have children or not.This review is based on a copy of the DVD provided to me by Amazon and Disney Studios.Enjoy !	1
I grew up watching several Disney movies : Dumbo , Sleeping Beauty , Pinocchio , you name it . But as odd as it may sound , I never saw Bambi . So , I had regular expectations about it when we recently bought it : I had heard great things about it , but it was n't on the same level as the other Disney classics I already knew by heart . Well : I was floored and enchanted like a child , when I saw it.The quality of this movie was unbelievable . It took animated features to a whole new level , with the introduction of new shooting techniques to provide a more realistic feel of depth . The storyline was simple , yet touching , like most early Disney movies . Actually , one of the best features the DVD offers is a recreation of the storyboarding/storywriting sessions between Walt Disney and his team , which gives you a feel for the understanding of the audiences they had , and how the final product came about.I tip my hat to Disney once more , with a movie that is bound to become another classic in our collection , one that our son will grow up watching .	1
Disney classic on DVD . What does one write that hasnt already been written .	1
This movie is one of my favorites . The film arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition . Every family should have this movie on hand for their children and grandchildren .	1
Allright , yes , I 'll admit , I 'm a little past the age when most kids ' Bambi fascination levels are at their peak , and yes , I 'll also admit that I 'm one of those who 've made Bambi a supposed sarcastic answer when one of my friends declared they went to the video store or they went with their little brothers and sisters and asked me to guess what they rented , but let 's just face it , the picture is timeless . While I probably would n't watch the movie now unless I was babysitting , you ca n't argue that it is a bonafide Disney classic and will be for as long as time exists . As Disney 's second ever feature film , ( Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first , BTW ) Bambi is a beautiful , touching , emotional and truly moving film about love and other good character traits all set in the picturesque , lush background of a woodsy forest . Altough new movies come out every year and some cause controversy and stir the movie industry up quite a bit , Bambi was there even before the movie industry had two feet to stand on . It 's one of the conerstone films that really put Hollywood and Disney on the map , and while I do n't think the industry would have suffered if Bambi never was , it was a fundamental building block , a key turning point in Hollywood , and one of the very few and rare films that will forever suit all generations , no matter what their age.The basic story is about Bambi , a young deer who is learning to cope with living in the forest , and who makes friends with Thumper , a rabbit , and Flower , a skunk , two unforgettable characters ; together the three of them have cute , mischievous fun while balancing it with the wise teachings of Friend Owl . Bambi has so many wise character traits to acquire that are not only beneficial to kids at a young age , but also profitable for adults and teens to keep in mind ; for example , who can forget Thumper 's mom telling Thumper `` If you do n't say anything nice , do n't say anything at all . '' Anyway , Bambi has just started beginning to learn how to live as a young fawn when tragedy strikes : his beloved mother , the one who watched him so lovingly and nursed him so selflessly , is shot by hunters . Although his mother 's death is so hard to overcome , a fully grown Bambi wisely acquires what his mother gave him , love , and experiences it himself when he meets a pretty deer . Thumper and Flower also eventually find love , but are harshly and rudely interrupted when the dreaded enemy , Man , causes a great forest fire.In a classic and beautiful conclusion , Bambi and his friends escape the dreadful fire , and realize that life has it 's hardships , but all that really matters are the ones you love . The music is beautiful , and the story about life , love , loss , friendship , toil , forgiveness , and rebuilding could not be told in a more perfect , effective , and gripping manner .	1
Bambi is one hour and ten minutes and was released in theaters on August 13 , 1948 . The story tells of a baby deer named Bambi who loses his mother to a hunter and is brought up by his father , the Great Prince of the Forest . An adult Bambi falls in love with Faline who is a female deer and has to fight for her against a male deer . At the end of the movie Faline has twins and Bambi is standing next to his father overlooking the forest . Basically that is the cliff note version of the movie . The movie itself is less then a thousand words and in any scene there is not that much dialogue.In the two disc DVD set there are some interesting tidbits . I the first disc you get to hear the story meeting that went on about making Bambi ; I do n't know if they are the real voices or just actors . Walt Disney sounds like Walter Cronkite . In disc two the most important one is the Backstage Disney and you learn story behind Bambi . One thing the bunny Thumper was not in the original book but was added in midway into the development of the film for comic relief . This is the first and only animated Disney where a non villain is killed in the movie . Due to World War II and other reasons Bambi lost money in the theaters and thus the next six films were the infamous package films . This is the first Disney film where all the songs are sung off screen and not by the characters themselves . Bambi was nominated for three Academy Awards for Original Song , Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture , and Best Sound , Recording . There are more interesting facts in this two disc DVD set . Bambi is a great movie to watch and gets an AAAAA+++++.DVD FEATURESDisc 1PlayBambi : Inside Walt 's Story MeetingScene Selection1 ) Set Up2 ) Audio Optionsa . Englishb . Frenchc .

Just a notch below the legendary Snow White sits the timeless , sweeping beauty and simplicity of Bambi . Sporting an incredible new transfer this edition shines light years beyond the previous VHS incarnation . Colors appear slightly brighter and the soundtrack rings crystal clear . The extras on this platinum edition are varied and quite enjoyable as well w/the OLD MILL short animated short being my favorite . Another 1 hr and 10 min extra delves deep into the meetings and processes that formed this classic . Deeper than most Disney films and second only to Snow White sits this incredible testament to animation and Walt Disney 's genius .	1
Still , its a classic and the wonderful animation is as enchanting as ever in blu-ray.Great for the whole family ! : D	1
Bambi is one of the greatest Disney features of our time . Every scene in this movie just fits perfectly together , including everyone 's favorite scenes : the ice skating , the `` bird '' , and of course , the death of Bambi 's mother . I do n't usually cry when I see this scene , but it touches me having lost my father at a point in my life . Bambi is obviously a cute cartoon character , and probably the cutest of the early generation of Disney films , next to Thumper . The story is influential , and even controversial . It 's all amazing ! Rating : 5 stars/5 stars	1
First off , I would like to thank Amazon publicly for providing me with a copy & the opportunity to review this much-anticipated release . The folks at Disney have pulled off a remarkable feat in restoring this 1942 classic . Nary a bit of grainy picture nor the usual pops and blips that normally accompany films of this age . It has been completely revitalized and the audio has been given the `` enhanced home theater '' treatment which means you can watch it in a great new 5.1 mix or a restored version of the original mono soundtrack . I found the enhanced version to be much more preferable . This would be a great addition to any Disney DVD collection and look forward to `` Cinderella '' in Oct .	1
It is impossible to believe that any child who sees Bambi 's mother shot to death by a hunter will ever grow up to be one . Will he or she ever want to handle a gun at all ? One might even wonder how anyone who loved Bambi could enjoy a dinner of Veal Parmigiano , but perhaps that goes too far for most . One can also think , as Man destroys the edenic forest by failing to watch over his campfire , of the rivers he is polluting and the atmosphere he is poisoning with equal disregard.Viewing Bambi with my adult mind , I saw it for the powerful criticism of the human species that it was , rather than as a kiddie cartoon . In 1942 nature `` grew back '' despite the devastation , but those days were pre- nuclear . Will it still ? Enough has been said of the magnificent restoration , the digital technology , the behind-the- scenes documentary . We are used to all that by now.I 'm giving my five stars to the `` message . ''	1
one of the best classic animated film from Disney . this timeless movie is one i grew up with . legendary captain hook can never get pan . if you never seen this film watch it . great movie .	1
This was always one of my favorite Disney movies . I am happy to say that it is now one of my 2 daughter 's favorites as well . We got the DVD when it came out and they have watched it over and over . All I can say is that I am glad that DVD movies do n't wear out like VHS or Beta.The clarity of the images is fantastic . Disney re-releases are always beautiful and this is no exception.Special features are great for the adults or older children.A definite must have for any family , but especially for those of us who remember or , more importantly , ca n't remember what it was like to be a kid .	1
Sure Disney has tackled magic storylines before : fire-breathing dragons , talking puppets and wish granting fairy godmothers but in many ways you can say Peter Pan is probably the most `` Disney-esque '' film . It 's got magic , tons of it in fact , far off wondrous worlds and a villain you love to hate . While it does have some un-politically correct moments and our main hero almost seems a bit too abrasive , it 's also a film where you find yourself surprised at just how quickly the film pulls you in.Well we all know the story but might as well tell it : Peter Pan , an elfish-looking boy from the faraway Neverland visits Wendy , Michael and John Darling and takes them on a voyage to his world . There , they find mermaids , natives and evil pirate Captain Hook who hates Peter Pan , especially since he cut off Hook 's hand and fed it and an alarm clock to a crocodile who wants to taste the rest of the captain . It 's up to Peter Pan and his feisty pixie friend Tinkerbell to save Neverland.What makes the film so endearing is just how much you do n't even care about the childishness of some of its scenes . One scene I outright laughed at was the crocodile , with Hook caught in his mouth , actually slaps Hook 's hand in order to get a better position to bite him . Then of course there 's the line `` we were only trying to drown her '' , a line so murderous but sounds oddly cute since it comes from a mermaid . The songs are so catchy , the animation cleaned up and while it 's not as outwardly colorful like Bambi or ambitious like Sleeping Beauty , it 's certainly a worthy effort and a top notch restoration as well . Then of course there 's Tinkerbell who 's probably one of the more instantly likable characters Disney has ( better be since she 's Disney DVD 's spokesgirl ) even though she tends to be insanely jealous and scheme-y.As for its un-political correctness parts , well , it of course involves the use of aboriginal people which the film calls either red man , red skin , indian or injun . But worse of all is the use of the word `` squaw '' which I will tell you now : is highly offensive to native woman and I 'd recommend you do n't say it at all . However I will admit that the explanation for why native people say ugh is quite funny . Also one thing that I found surprising was just how different a hero Peter Pan was . There are times where he seems kind of insensitive to things such as saying Wendy getting picked on by the mermaids as `` a little fun '' and being brash . But then he is in Neverland , where you do n't grow old , so I guess it 's just his inner childishness at play.This is one of those Disney films that you do n't feel embarrassed that you 're watching a children 's movie . You can find yourself having just as much fun as the kids are or even if you do n't even have any kids , you 'll still have fun .	1
To the second star on the right and you will reach Neverland ! Where pirates rule the sea , the Native Indians are the civilized , and meet Peter Pan and his lost boys . This is a true Disney classic that everyone must have ! And do n't just get the VHS , GET THE DVD ! The picture quality is much better , stronger , and sharper , talk about dpi high resolution ! What 's more interesting is that do n't watch it on your TV for best resolution , watch it on your computer for the extreme ! The features are great too , my favourite is the concept art archive , all these original sketches and paintings just make me want to drool . You wo n't believe the ability of these artists back in the 1950s . One of the interesting feature is the history of making of Peter Pan . It shows you how the musical was first started , and Disney transformed Peter Pan into a boy ! Unlike the musical that is played by an actress ( though the musical is excellent too ) .If you are a Disney fan I would n't doubt you will miss this DVD .	1
One of Disney 's best animated features ! He turned it into a ride at Disneyland As usual , the artistic level is very high . I particularly like the background when Peter and the kids are flying over London . A must have for a complete collection .	1
I own the special edition , but Im glad that they are finally releasing this great movie for all those who missed it when it was available last time . This version is probably the best ever released and the price is pretty reasonable . The special edition was only 1 disk and cost a bit more.Hopefully Pinnochio will be coming soon to Platinum . I have the limited edition and it 's a pretty bad transfer ( looks like straight from VHS with no clean up ) . However , Im holding on to it incase they censor the platinum version.I think this re-release of PeterPan is a signal that Disney is seeing the light . They are losing alot of revenue to chinese bootlegs being sold on [ ... ] , and god knows [ ... ] doesnt give a crap about enforcement .	1
An evergreen animated fantasy based on J.M . Barrie 's beloved children 's book , Disney 's `` Peter Pan '' features dazzling hand-drawn visuals , excellent voice acting , and a winning score epitomized by the song `` You Can Fly ! '' Rendered by Driscoll , Peter is refreshingly cocky , and even Tinkerbell has a bit of an impetuous streak ; Hook , of course , is as dastardly as ever . Made by the same team that later created `` The Lady and the Tramp , '' this thrilling , imaginative tale bests the 1923 live-action original , and leaves most other versions in the ( fairy ) dust as well .	1
I love the scene where Peter Pan and Captain Hook are fighting with swords , it is so cool , and when he rescues Tiger Lily and Wendy , kind of a 1800 's Superhero .	1
I never considered Disney 's `` Peter Pan '' to be one of their best animated classics up there with `` Bambi '' and `` Pinocchio , '' and it was while watching all of the extras that come with this Platinum Edition that I figured out why this is the case . Much is made of Walt Disney 's affection for the J.M . Barrie 's story of the boy who would not grow up , and it dawned on me that I always identified more with Tom Swift , the boy inventor , than with Peter Pan . Consequently I have developed a hypothesis that there is a choice to be made between Peter Pan and Tom Swift , similar to those we make between Superman and Batman , Elvis and the Beatles , Ginger and Mary Ann , etc. , as part of our pop culture consciousness . However , that being said , even those of us who were in a hurry to grow up can still enjoy Disney 's unique take on Peter Pan in this 1953 version.As most of us know from `` Finding Neverland '' or our own familiarity with the story of the story , `` Peter Pan '' was originally a stage production with actors being hoisted on wires to fly , Tinker Bell being created by a flashlight , an actor playing Nana and a young woman as Peter . Disney 's animated version has great fun making the characters fly , turns Tinker Bell into a pantomime pixie who would become the icon of the Disney studio , and for the first time had the boy who never grew up being modeled and voiced by an actual boy ( Bobby Driscoll ) . Wendy is voiced by Kathryn Beaumont , who had just done the title character Disney 's `` Alice in Wonderland , '' by vocally the show is stolen by the great Hans Conreid as both Captain Hook and Mr . Darling , and Bill Thompson as the memorable Mr. Smee.One of the things that proves the immortality of `` Peter Pan '' is how many different versions of it work , each providing its own twist on the tale ( my favorite is director P.J . Hogan 's 2003 film version , which I think is far and away the best version for adults ) . Here the emphasis is on Neverland as the greatest playground ever , where Captain Hook and Tinker Bell take turns stealing the film . Peter Pan is a bit more of an imp here than elsewhere , but that is balanced by the gravitas that Wendy brings to the proceedings . The only serious flaw here is the depiction of the Indians , although a consideration of the song `` What Makes the Red Man Red ? '' from the perspective of contemporary political correctness may still find the racism more silly than anything else . It goes without saying that these attitudes are true to the times , and my preference has always been for pointing out these flaws rather than editing or ignoring them.I might not consider this a top tier Disney film , but the DVD extras more than make up the difference , because once again we the studio treating its classic film the way all classic films should be treated on a 2-disc DVD set ( which includes a new digital restoration ) . On Disc 1 there is a sneak peak for the upcoming `` Tinker Bell '' computer animated movie , an opportunity to sing along with the movie 's song , and a storybook of `` Peter 's Playful Prank . '' Then there is the audio commentary track is a compilation of interview clips `` hosted '' by Roy Disney . The commentary bears no relation to what is happening on screen so it really is just to be listened to and you will find that several of the bits appear in the featurettes on Disc 2 . It is fascinating to listen to the likes of film critic/historian Leonard Malting , animators Marc Davis ( Tinker Bell ) , Frank Thomas ( Captain Hook ) , and Ollie Johnston , along with actresses Beaumont and Margaret Kerry ( model for Tinker Bell ) , and others.On Disc 2 you get to the Backstage Disney section , which includes Walt Disney 's own explanation for `` Why I Made 'Peter Pan , ' '' a mini-documentary on `` The Making of 'Peter Pan , ' '' and one of the highlights of the extra features , `` The 'Peter Pan ' That Almost Was , '' that looks at the evolution of the Disney version over the course of more than a decade . There is also a 1952 featurette on the film and Art Galleries considering hundreds of gorgeous pieces of original artwork done for the production . The Music & More section includes the deleted song `` The Pirate Song '' and the lost song `` Never Land '' performed by Paige O'Hara , along with a music video of `` The Second Star to the Right '' performed by T-Square . For Games & Activities there is an Read-Along version of the entire film , `` Camp Never Land : Train To Be A Lost Boy , '' `` Smee 's Sudoku Challenge , '' `` Tarrrget Practice , '' and `` Tink 's Fantasy Flight , '' all of which will appeal to the wee folk who are not familiar with playing computer games on an actual computer . Finally there is `` Peter Pan 's Virtual Flight , '' which I assume takes us over a computer generated London prepared for the upcoming `` Tinker Bell '' movie .	1
This release seems to have drawn out more eloquence and expertise from Amazon reviewers than most . It is clearly warmly regarded as a classic by the great majority . PC issues , or rather the non-PC issues have been debated with well-conceived and finely delivered statements by both sides . As is usually the case in such matters , I do n't imagine that the disputants have moved an inch from their original positions -- or ever will . As for myself , I hold sufficiently warm feelings for Disney 's `` Peter Pan '' to endorse the many five-star ratings it has already earned.I clearly remember seeing `` Peter Pan '' during its first run , once at a grand and lordly downtown movie palace on San Francisco 's Market Street and again , a little later , in second-run at a neighborhood theater on Mission Street . I was ten years old at the time and recollect that the movie was a thing of considerable interest among my friends and schoolmates . The consensus of opinion among discerning ten year-olds was positive but not ecstatic . Much the same was true for the reviews that ran in the old News , Call-Bulletin , Examiner and Chronicle newspapers . ( Why was I pouring over movie reviews in four daily papers at the age of ten ? I have no idea , but there you are . ) The big advertising hook for the film was that FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER ! ! Peter Pan would be portrayed by a boy rather than a middle-aged woman . We ten-year olds were , as I recall , singularly unmoved by that . Most of us were particularly well disposed toward Hans Conried 's Captain Hook and to the Crocodile , of course . Both were authoritatively pronounced to be real zorch . ( A San Francisco nonce-word invented by a then-popular disk jockey . It quickly gave way before the better known `` cool . `` ) On the other hand , we moppet film critics also generally agreed with our elder professionals who held that `` Peter Pan '' represented an artistic falling off from Disney 's earlier masterpieces , `` Pinocchio , '' `` Dumbo , '' and especially `` Bambi , '' all of which had been re-released within our time horizons . ( I 'm pretty sure that the next re-release of `` Snow White '' was much later . ) Compared to those true classics of animation , we thought `` Peter Pan '' looked cheap , cheesy and flat -- although I 'm sure we did n't use those particular terms , relying instead on the ever-eloquent , `` It was OK , I guess . `` In 1955 came the first black and white TV version of the New York musical with Mary Martin . It returned in a new live ( on kinescope for the West Coast ) version and again in 1960 , that time in color , I think . As I remember it , that version had much greater impact . Mary Martin was simply better at everything than Bobby Driscoll was at anything . The musical score was better , too -- brasher and edgier than the Disney tunes , which even in 1953 were moving well along the path to the familiar musical pap so beloved by Uncle Walt.That was then , this is now . Mary Martin 's three `` Peter Pans '' are mere historical artifacts , while this `` Peter Pan , '' like its hero , shall remain forever fresh and young .	1
This is a classic movie that every disney owner needs to have in their collection . I was a little worried about the whole & # 34 ; flying & # 34 ; thing with the kids but no problems !	1
This is a Disney oldie but goodie , with lots of stuff that should keep just about anyone entertained . My parents enjoyed this when it came out , and I enjoyed it many years later . I have to admit that I am especially fond of Captain Hook , and all of the characters and storyline in this film were well-done . Some people will like this more than others - depending on personal tastes - but overall this is a great Disney classic and if you 're a Disney fan , you 'll want to check this out !	1
If you do n't currently own Peter Pan , and love the movie , you still have time to buy it on video and dvd . But hurry up because Peter Pan and along with Beauty and the Beast , Beauty and the Beast The Enchanted Christmas and Return to Neverland are going out of stock on 1/31/03 . Along with some other titles . Whether you believe it or not that Peter Pan 's voice died in 1968 because he had been abusing himself and his body was founde by kids playing in an abanded village bulding but I think it took sometime to to discover he was the voice of Peter Pan .	1
First let me say that I 'm embarrassed to say that I probably have n't seen Disney 's Peter Pan since I saw it as a child in the movie theater ( and I 'm in my 60s ! ) . But watching this new Bluray version brought back many memories for me . But that 's not why you are here to read this review so I 'll try to provide more useful info.First , be aware that Amazon often groups ALL reviews of ALL releases of a video together . Hence there are reviews - 389 before this one - going back to 1999 ( ! ) when it came out on VHS ! So I 'll suggest that if you are using the reviews for Peter Pan that you sort by `` Newest First '' . You can also sort by `` Most helpful '' but look at the date and which version the reviewer is covering.This review is of the new BLURAY Disc . Set . This is the first time that the Disney classic is on Bluray in HD and with a new `` digital restoration '' and - honestly - it looks great on my Standard Def TV and should be `` gorgeous '' on an HD . That is enough to recommend that those who have earlier version upgrade their copies . But there are other features that MAY convince you too . In fact the extras - old and new - run nearly twice the time of the 77 minute film . The menus are set up to first offer the NEW Bonuses ( more in a minute ) and then what are termed the `` Classic Extras '' - the ones mentioned in earlier reviews like the Making of.. , deleted scenes and songs , and Roy Disney audio commentary.NEW this time is a somewhat interesting documentary `` Growing Up With Nine Old Men '' produced by Ted Thomas , the son of Disney animator Fred Thomas - one of the 9 artists who worked for Disney from the 1930s on . For this 41-minute film , Ted travelled to visit the families of the seven artists who had children . You learn what it was like to have your dad work for Disney . I found it interesting to watch once but it 's really no something that children will get too excited about . There is also a NEW Intro to the film by Diana Disney Miller ( 1:09 ) . Other NEW `` features '' - not quite bonuses - are the `` Disney View '' option . Because the firm was made in standard format - the screen image is basically square . There are black bars on either side when played on wide screen TVs . The `` Disney View '' option puts painted `` wall paper '' on either side . Not sure we needed that but it 's there . As you will see reading some of the `` most helpful '' reviews there is discussion - and explanation that I wo n't repeat - as to why it is not wide-screen . The last new feature is `` Disney Intermission '' , this means that when you hit the `` pause '' button you get to hear facts about the film . Nice idea but when I hit `` pause '' it 's usually to answer the phone or go to the bathroom and so I really just want the film to pause . Anyway , that 's what `` Disney Intermission is.Like many of the Blurays I 've covered from Disney lately I do find a few annoyances that may or may not bother you . Every time you insert the BD in your player it asks you to choose your language and them proceeds to play the `` previews '' . There is a mini-menu at bottom that you can use to `` Play '' or `` go to Menu '' . If you stopped the film without finishing it , it will ask you if you want to stop where you left off or at beginning . But all of this happens after the language question and the previews . Again , not a `` deal breaker '' but time waster , IMHO.So there you have it . If you do n't own the film at all and have a BD player , go for the BD version . If you have earlier versions - even with the bonuses and , again , have a BD and HD TV , and truly love the film ( do n't we all ? ) then , again , go for it . I love the Mary Martin TV version - and the various stage versions too - and for some of us `` I 'm Flying '' is the REAL Peter Pan song . But the Tv and play versions are also twice as long as the Disney one . By the way , note all the lyricists and the the artists credits ( presented at the beginning , not the end like todays Pixar films ) and that there were FOUR Directors . All the effort that went into this 77-minute film are now ready in a beautiful print for generations to come ! I hope you found this - somewhat lengthy - review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm '' Anything Phonographic ''	1

Great for all families with younger children and worth many watches .	1
Like others , I truly wish I had been there in person . This film helps , but it also makes me want more . To see so many fine artists , from Sha Na Na and Joe Cocker to Santana appear for just a song seems like we were cheated . The film usually presents entire songs , albeit with lots of cutaways , but in my humble opinion , it does not let the music dominate.Maybe being there , the music was background , with this new `` nation '' of freaks , radicals , etc . gathering together . Just organizing and meeting basic needs ( food , toilets , etc . ) was a big challenge . But those in attendance certainly did not pick up after themselves , as they were urged to do by John Sebastian and others.The film is a bargain at any price . It will take you back to a time when almost anything seemed possible -- and idealists thought new forms of community and sharing might rise up and become institutions . With appropriate musical background and stimulation of course.Will there every be another `` Woodstock '' like that , or have we all changed too much , and the world changed too much ? NOT -- -One of these hot , humid summers , another authentic Woodstock will arise in some remote farmyard , and we 'll again hear all those classic groups from the 1960s rocking and booming and pushing us to new heights . And maybe we can change the world ! ! !	1
In a manner that must shock and amaze us all , this superb documentary catches the spirit and `` geist '' of the sixties counter-cultural movement like nothing else could . As a child of the sixties , and someone involved in all of the activities and social issues described herein , I find myself once again amazed whenever I catch this on TV , usually late at night . For through the space of this seemingly endless concert film are the continuing threaded elements of a very important story , the epic tale of how a separate and distinct subculture in attempted to stand amidst the blaring hostile spotlights of an overbearing and dominating mainstream culture.The parts of the movie I love watching best are not of the performers , but rather are the threads connecting them , the bits and pieces of extraneous events , conversations , and interactions that helped to flesh out the details of exactly what the social ethos of the counterculture were , and how they would inform , describe , and detail its members . The first few minutes of the film , consisting of long and cinematically gorgeous shots of young `` freaks '' congregating to build the sound stage for the concert in an overgrown glen in upstate New York on tractors , horses , and in trucks and cars is breath-taking , and sets the stage for the kind of laid-back presentation that follows.It is difficult to explain or to articulate what Woodstock meant , both to those of us who were lucky enough to be there and to the rest of us who experienced only vicariously through the countless stories and tales that emanated from it afterward , and from documentary evidence such as is provided by this film , that the so-called youth culture existed and thrived , by at least some 500,000 and most likely by many , many more freaks than that . For in truth reality was the coming of age of the youth movement in the same moment it became its funeral dirge , for the dominating mainstream culture recognized both its threat and its opportunity for them , in cultural and commercial terms , and the elements of the youth culture was quickly co-opted by advertising and business . Yet for all of that , what we had was a wonderful moment , however brief , in the warmth of togetherness in the sun . Watch the movie and celebrate . We 've spent the last thirty years mourning our collective failure by letting the Woodstock in each of us die . Enjoy !	1
Having been in Vietnam in1969 i did not have a chance to actually go to woodstock.I waited almost 30 years before i saw this documentary.This is the kind of experience that one has to open the mind and heart and close off all pre-concieved ideas , prejudices , religious and any and all other ideas and thoughts and just ( to quote the hippies ) go with your feelings.This was a once in a lifetime experience that will likely never be back again.360,000 young people ( and some not quite so young ) brought together for three days love , music , drugs and rock and roll.Even disallowing all the illecit drug use ( the reference to the & quot ; bad acid & quot ; ( not poisoned ) just bad.One can watch this movie and maybe get just a small glimmer of what was occuring those three days.I finished movie and for a good week could not quit thinking about what i had seen and heard.Young girls and boys swimming in a lake naked , people getting rained on and instead of griping and complaining making a game of it ! Feeding each other , both physically and spiritually and emotionally and no one getting hurt.My God ! Where has this country gone wrong in the last 30 years ? Maybe only people from my generation can truly understand what happened then.I am passing this movie around to friends and people at work , some whom are my age and others much younger and they seem to really get into it ( oops another hippie slang-sorry ) Watch this movie-if only for your own peace of mind ! ( Yeah i borrowed part of that last sentence also ) P E A C E	1
As I have seen this many times since it first came out on in the theater and then on VHS , to DVD and now Blu-Ray , many times I now just fast-forward chapters to the music , enjoying my favorite performances in this epic documentary of the most famous rock concert of all time . If I want to reminisce about the period , I watch the whole thing . Either way , it 's always fun . ( This review is about the movie only . ) Not only do you get a ton of music , but you see a half million people weathering storms , the mess , drugs , port-o-johns , drugs , dancing , skinny-dipping , drugs , eating , making new friends , drugs ... ..you get the idea.Music-wise , everyone has their favorites so I 'll put a plug or two in for the artists I 've always enjoyed watching the most in this movie : Ten Years After ; Sly And The Family Stone ; Canned Heat , The Who , Richie Havens , Santana , Sha Na Na , Country Joe And The Fish , The Jefferson Airplane and Crosby , Stills and Nash .	1
I saw this film in the theaters on its first run in 1970 . I saw the horrible pan and scan VHS tape versions . I have the 1994 Director 's cut DVD and the 2009 40th anniversary DVD . Now today for the first time I watched the Blu-ray version of the film . I thought it was great . It 's the best looking video of the film I 've ever seen and the audio has been remixed from the original multi-tracks as I understand it . The film has been restored as best as possible and it does n't disappoint.The multi-screen format of the original film has been lovingly followed , like the original theatrical release . I 'm looking forward to the extras but I just wanted to put mu 2 cents here because previous feedback makes this sound like trash and it 's not . It 's a great Blu-ray version of the film all things considered.My only wish is that Warner Brothers would also release the original shorter theatrical version of the film on Blu-ray . This director 's cut is nice with the extra footage but it makes the film rather sluggish . I just prefer the tighter shorter original film version in retrospect .	1
This has all the great bands from the late '60 's , except the Stones and Beatles . Changed the world .	1
This is n't your run-of-the-mill concert video packed with edited performances . This is loaded with performances from the original ( and , as far as I 'm concerned , the ONLY ) three-day festival of peace , love , and music . ( ... ) it 's loaded with interviews of kids coming into town for the festival , enjoying it , and leaving it ( I felt really sorry for the cleanup crew ) . A lot of the time , it 's a split screen so you 'll find yourself using the rewind button quite often to catch anything you may have missed.Interesting to find out that Woodstock was the second performance for Crosby , Stills , and Nash ( in the days before Young ) . Ritchie Havens was out of sight , Jimi Hendrix far out , and Country Joe McDonald a blast . Rock and roll and folk music came together for a once-in-a-lifetime event that could never be duplicated ( why did people botther trying ? ) and , truth be told , I 'm deeply jealous of the people who were there.The coolest part of all was when Max Yasgur , owner of the farm the festival was held on , got on stage and said that Woodstock was proof that young people could get together and have three days of peace , love , and music and nothing but three days of peace , love and music.This video is a first hand glimpse into the turmoil that was the 1960 's ( e.g . older people arguing amongst themselves that the festival was wrong because the young kids were having sex and getting high while others thought it better that they were there instead of being in Viet Nam ) . You can feel the tension and the too cool atmosphere of the festival through the TV.Ah , nothing like the 1960 's . What a decade !	1
GIM ME AN F ! ! ! This is one of the most significant events in modern history , 500,000 people coming together overcoming the elements to enjoy a weekend of music in upstate NY.They have never been able to repeat such a feat , although Live Aid and Live 8 have come somewhat close , on a more global level.The original 3 hour Oscar winning version is classic and the amount of time is just right , and should be available on DVD as well . In my mind , this is the definitive rock concert film ( Stop Making Sense and Last Waltz are more intimate affairs ) , and everyone looks like magnificent rock gods ( or rock cliches ) from beginning to end.They could also do an alternate version that does n't use the splitscreen , and instead using DVD angles to choose which screen to view . Or for the missing footage , they could always put it in an `` extras '' and put the music to the photos.A big reason why there has n't been more footage released from the concert is in big part due to the reluctance for some bands to release footage they consider subpar , and others were n't ( supposedly ) completely filmed . It would be great to see complete performances from all the bands , unfortunately only Hendrix has been the only performance released as complete as possible.There have been documentaries on TV about Woodstock , why not release them ? Or make a completely new one for the box set ? Martin Scorsese has done commentaries on just about everything he 's worked on , and the recent `` No Direction Home '' about Dylan and `` The Blues '' , back to `` The Last Waltz '' all start out with this film ( George Lucas worked on `` Gim me Shelter '' ) . There have to be tons of interview footage left on the cutting room floor as well as new interviews that could be added here.People will want to know how something like this was pulled off , and others have failed miserably ever since , not to mention Woodstock 94 and 99 trying to recreate ( 94 turned out fine , but 99 was another story ) but coming up short . There 's a lot of archive footage of Janis and Jimi talking about it , Joni Mitchell ( on the recently released Dick Cavett Rock Icons DVD ) writing `` Woodstock '' even though she never made it , and countless others that were a part of it.The Grateful Dead have kept their performance off of the video ( they had to stop playing because things kept cutting out , the audio of their set is pretty easy to find ) , `` Dark Star '' is actually pretty good , and it 's not really as bad as they 've made it out to be.There 's very little in the way of CSNY live , makes no sense whatsoever to not include Neil Young . Same thing with CCR , The Band , Mountain ( including a then recently solo Jack Bruce ) , Melanie and a complete set of Janis Joplin . Definitely more Who ( esp . the Abbie Hoffman incident , prob . one of their most intense shows ) , Paul Butterfield , and more Sly and the Family Stone . Footage of a lot of the bands that were there is extremely rare . It would be great to see long-forgotten bands like Sweetwater and Quill as well.Hopefully this will be on Warner 's agenda to put something out to the public as big and brash as this concert was , even if it winds up being 10 DVDs ( or a CD/DVD box kitchen sink box set ) long . It should all be there for the public to see and hear as if they were there .	1
Just got this last night , and I have to say it 's stunning . I purchased Woodstock as an excuse to purchase a blu-ray player , and I 'm happy I did . The colors pop , you see detail you never saw in the original DVD.And yes , some of the songs have been `` repaired '' with added instrumentation , which I have NO PROBLEM WITH . I suppose it would be immoral if they did n't tell us they did it . But they told us . They even made a video to show the process , which is pretty amazing.So quit complaining and turn it up ! And oh yeah , groovy.Kaz	1
always nice to flashback to the good ole days . simply put a great time in life and music that will live forever ... .miss those days ... .enjoy the dvd ... .buy it	1
... this will kindle fond memories ... or nightmares , depending upon your experience.For the rest of you , it gives you a glimpse into the whole blended music and peace movement , everyone wants a better world and music will help make that happen ethos of the time.This version is not the 40th anniversary version . It is the director 's cut . It is my understanding that the 40th anniversary edition will include `` revisionism '' that I find unacceptable.I ca n't vouch , but I have heard that musicians are coming back and re recording parts to make them more `` perfect '' , correcting mistakes and stuff . For example , I 've heard that Santana supposedly is going to correct some bits that did n't come off right.Folks , a concert is not a recording . It will not be perfect . Some of the best concerts I have ever been to have had mistakes sprinkled throughout . They did not detract from the performance.Going in and screwing with a historic documentation of a historic event is sacriledge . Yes , I said it . We lose the essence of the event , we lose the substance , the immediacy of the time , the day , the moment . A lot of people were angry with George Lucas for messing with his films , which were actually just fine as they were.So , what ... Are we going to go into the document `` Gim me Shelter '' and remove the violence and murder that took place that day at Altamont ? That concert , by contrast with Woodstock , was the polar oppposite , a horrible experience . But we need to see the dark underbelly of the movement we older folks often romanticize . It was n't as great as we remember . One should never alter historic documents because they make you uncomfortable.While the director 's cut contains a bit more music and such , I think it is definitive as you can expect . And you just should never `` change '' history because you did n't like how it `` turned out '' , how it `` sounded '' . History is not clean and neat , it is often messy and tangled and fraught with errors.Avoid the 40th , and get this one . It 's more honest and true to the event that was pivotal to the whole `` peace and love '' movement of the 1960s . Sorry for the rant , but you need to be aware of what is being done to historic documentations , how they are being changed and no longer truly represent the moment - which can not and should not be altered to suit some misguided sense of God know what they are thinking .	1
I 'm writing this review just to be contrary . What makes the movie worthwhile is that the music is mixed with & quot ; mundane & quot ; footage - the performances were n't generally outstanding at Woodstock , while the sheer magnitude of the event , and the problems it caused ( food shortages , sanitary problems , disturbance of the Woodstock locality ) , are special and worth including for the permanent record . If you miss more songs from your favorite performers , consider how long this film would be if every artist received generous treatment from the film makers . For my taste , anyway , there 's more than enough music and lots of stuff that most people who attended the event never had a chance to see . Woodstock is well worth the 3 or 4 hours it takes to see it all , and I 'm glad it is n't 6 or 8 hours long .	1
Why this rating ? = It 's been almost 45 years since Woodstock happened ! I THINK it 's fair to say that everyone on earth knows what it was ! Anyone who actually needs an explanation for my or ANYONE 'S 5 star rating of this product should forever be banned from ever , ever , ever , EVER seeing , let alone OWNING this absolute gem of a documentary ! ! ! ! ! ! YOU people should really just put in your earbuds , go back to your Kelly Clarkson discs and leave the grown-ups alone ! ! ! ! ! ! ! - Sadly , Justin Timberlake and Justin Beiber will forever be , YOUR rock gods.There is absolutely no help for you . Sorry.Likes/dislikes = Absolutely everything/absolutely nothing . Mike Wadleigh and his team , summed up , not just the music but the whole concept of the 60 's , in these 3 3/4 hours of film . A massive undertaking that was NOT without it 's hardships and near misses ! The Oscar for best documentary , which the film received , was well earned and deserved ! Recommended to who ? = Absolutely everyone ! FYI - for anyone who bought the & # 34 ; special edition & # 34 ; of Woodstock in 2009 , on DVD , with all the extra & # 34 ; toys & # 34 ; and is interested in upgrading your DVD 's to Bluray , without spending an arm and a leg AGAIN , all you have to do is buy the 40th anniversary edition bluray , that Amazon currently sells for $ 13.49 . Everything that 's on the 3 DVD 's IS on this bluray set ! ! !	1
my husband and I love Woodstock . we played it a few timeswe enjoyed the music and all the artists that were there .	1
Woodstock was the high point of the late sixties . It was a time of innocence and pain . It was a time when we who were young were members of a tribe - we cared for each other and shared visions of a better world . Yes , there were problems - bad drugs , lack of sanitation , and the like . But it worked in its time . The movie captures this mood so well , both in the interviews and in the music . The multiple frames help to show the different aspects of life at Woodstock so well . I 'm not sure if those who are younger now can truly understand why Woodstock was so important - maybe this film will help them to understand .	1
`` Woodstock '' is a nearly four-hour kaleidoscope of unremitting fascination . Musician and `` man/woman-in-the-street '' interviews are interwoven with concert performances , all of it presented in the then-ground-breaking format of multiple on-screen images . The divergent outlooks of adult town residents and visiting hippies shed an amusing light on what used to be termed `` the generation gap . '' What everyone seems to share , regardless of age , is sheer awe at the enormous influx of humanity that fueled this largest of all `` happenings . ''	1
My Son is really into `` old school '' music and after visiting Cleveland 's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , he really wanted a movie about Woodstock . I came across this Collector 's Edition on Amazon and took a chance . HE LOVES IT ! A ticket came inside which he laminated and put up in his dorm . He just loved all the little goodies inside the packaging . The tamborine on top is really sturdy and a nice touch . The footage itself is rich and very well done . The bonus footage includes some of the 'flavor ' of the 60 's as well . Great gift .	1
Roger Ebert got it right : it is both entertaining and poignant as it captures a piece of musical and social history . I was one of the legion who & # 34 ; almost went & # 34 ; ; this makes me feel I am there but with a perspective far beyond me at that time . I 'm sure this is a set I will watch again , to revisit a time that echoes on : music IS memory .	1
wonderfully well done . beginning to end .	1
Without question this was a landmark movie . Some of the greatest acts in rock and roll were able to perform in this movie . The movie going fan was able to see the Who , Joe Cocker , Janis Joplin , Jimi Hendrix , Sly and the Family Stone , Richie Havens , John Sebastian and the Loving Spoonful as well as many other up and coming stars in the world of music . The music in the movie was very good . The on the scene footage was also well shot . You were able to see Woodstock from every perspectivein this movie . That this video is till available 32 years lateris a testament to this event . Buy this and watch it . It is a collector 's item .	1
Wow ! I saw this movie when it first came out at the theater . Amazing film . So many big performers . This has some extras that are worth watching . Probably the beginning of drug abuse/sexually transmitted diseases in this contry and who knows what else . I still would have liked to have been there . Nothing compares to this event . Not something to sit and watch with your kids unless they are in their late teens . This is where Ten Years After really go their big start . I mean you have Janis Joplin , Hendrix , Crosby , Stills and Nash ( who got there beginning here ) Richie Havens , Country Joe and the Fish , Santana ... the list goes on .	1
I 'm going to be as down to the point as I possibly can with this review because ultimately that 's what you , the reader , are going to want to know . So here it goes : PROS OF THIS NEW DVD SET:1 . The picture and sound quality have never looked or sounded better ! 2 . Great bonus disc with many great , ROCKING , unreleased performances ! 3 . Amazon offers a second bonus disc with three more performances ! 4 . The extra features on all three discs are informative about the festival ! 5 . The package design is inventive and fun ! The Life magazine reprint is awesome ! CONS OF THIS NEW DVD SET:1 . Not too crazy about the `` boxing '' on the full screen sections of the film ! 2 . THERE WAS 100 % NO NEED FOR A LOUSY 30+ MINUTE JAM FROM THE GRATEFUL DEAD ! I love The Dead , but this is just a freaking bore ! 3 . No extras of Janis , Sly , Ten Years After , Arlo Guthrie , and no first time seen performances of Bert Sommer , Quill , Incredible String Band , or The Band.4 . The Amazon and Target exclusive bonus discs contain two separate sets of performances.5 . I WAN NA SEE MORE SHA NA NA ! So there ya go ! That 's my take on the new remastered DVD set of `` Woodstock . '' Do you find this helpful ?	1
I 'm a native New Yorker and huge Hendrix fan . The moment the VHS set became available , I purchased one to get the full impact and feeling that was the concert so lauded by NYers as I grew up . What I expected were great musical performers , but what I got exceeded that.Unity . One small , encapsulating word so vacant from any concert event today . As I watched the exceptional performances of Sly and the Family Stone , Janis Joplin , Santana , Crosby , Stills & Nash and of course , Hendrix , I was amazed by what I did not see . Look around for vestiges of corporate sponsorship and you 'll find none . As a concert attendee since my early teens , I can not recall ever attending an event lacking in sponsorship . I 've heard stories from people who attended the event who shared stories of the remarkable spirit of the Bethel residents who brought them food , let some camp out on their lawns and let many use the telephone to let their families know they 'd made it to upstate NY.People got together to share the music , but they also shared whatever they brought with them with the people they interacted with . If you were hungry , you were fed . When thirsty , you were fed . When it rained , you either found shelter or found a friend to slosh about in the mud until it was all over.The performances are amazing , but it 's the spirit of the event that attracts me to watching this DVD yearly on the anniversary of Woodstock '69 . I admire the unity and long for it in these selfish , self-involved times .	1
Is it just me or did n't this just come out on June 9 , 2009 . How can there be so many reviews dating back almost 5 to 10 years ago ? Amazon should purge those reviews from here to give the true picture .	1
If you 're a certain age , the word `` Woodstock '' conjures far more than a place in Ulster County , New York . Advertised as `` The Woodstock Festival of Music and Art , '' the monumental event was held from August 15 to 18 , 1969 , on land belonging to local farmer Max Yasgur . Many of the era 's most popular rock groups and solo performers were signed at huge fees to make the event the biggest rock concert ever held in the United States . `` Woodstock : 3 Days of Peace and Music : The Director 's Cut -- 40th Anniversary Edition '' is reissued on DVD and new to Blu-ray and features the Michael Wadleigh-directed documentary that captures not only the music , but the cultural phenomenon that would become legendary . Designed to hopefully attract 50,000 people , Woodstock eventually drew 500,000 , mostly young , who came by car , truck , helicopter , or on foot . Rolling Stone Magazine called the festival one of the `` 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock ` n ' Roll . `` Artists included Country Joe McDonald , Santana , The Who , Jefferson Airplane , Canned Heat , Joe Cocker , Creedence Clearwater Revival , The Grateful Dead , Joan Baez , The Band , Janis Joplin , Richie Havens , John Sebastian , and Sly and the Family Stone . Performance highlights of the three-disc set include Jimi Hendix 's `` Star Spangled Banner ; '' Richie Havens ' `` Freedom ; '' Sly & the Family Stone 's medley of `` Dance to the Music , '' `` Music Lover , '' and `` I Want to Take You Higher ; '' and Ten Years After 's `` I 'm Going Home . `` The appeal of the movie is twofold . As a concert film , it showcases top acts of the era , many at the peak of their popularity . But it also works as a chronicle of a once-in-a-lifetime happening , as Wadleigh shows us the concertgoers reveling in the atmosphere , excited by the music , making the best of things when rain comes , and even coping with inadequate sanitation facilities . Their youthful exuberance is captured in the smiling faces , flowered shirts , love beads , long hair and occasional nudity that would scandalize nearby residents . `` Woodstock '' had an uninspired DVD release in 1997 that disappointed many rock fans and lovers of the movie . That has been righted with this set , which features 18 never-before-seen-on-film performances , including `` One Day at a Time '' ( Joan Baez ) , `` Flying High '' ( Country Joe McDonald ) , `` On the Road Again '' ( Canned Heat ) , `` Born on the Bayou '' ( Creedence Clearwater Revival ) , `` Mean Town Blues '' ( Johnny Winter ) , and `` Teen Angel '' ( Sha Na Na ) . Also included is `` Woodstock : From Festival to Feature , '' a featurette containing interviews with original concertgoers , promoters , crew , and musicians , and a Hugh Hefner interview with director Michael Wadleigh from the 1970 's TV show `` Playboy After Dark . `` Purists might complain about the remastered soundtrack , but if you recall the record album , the sound was far from perfect . The sound on the discs has been cleaned up and is sharper . The film was shot with a number of different cameras , resulting in differing aspect ratios , but , happily , the 40th Anniversary Edition is uniformly widescreen.Also available is an Ultimate Collector 's Edition , with fringed deluxe packaging , containing the material listed above as well as a retrospective featurette , `` The Museum at Bethel Woods : The Story of the Sixties and Woodstock , '' a 60-page Life Magazine reprint , a Woodstock patch , and a reprint of a concert ticket .	1
This 40th Anniversary collector 's edition is a marvelous paean to what is arguably the greatest documentary ever made . The Warner Brother 's Director 's Cut in 1994 was a drastic improvement over what was already a wonderful film but their dvd version of it did not do the Director 's Cut justice ... ... until now.This set comes with a completely remastered 1994 Director 's Cut ( although the tribute to the now-deceased Woodstock participants at the end of the film has not been updated ) and a bunch of cool extras including a replica of a $ 24 woodstock ticket & a complete re-print of Life Magazine 's issue on the Woodstock coverage , just to name a few things.The film is on two separate discs with the interf'ingmission happening at the end of the first disc , just like that great ol ' Director 's Cut.Also , there 's a great extras dvd that has performances by bands not seen in any version of the film . They include : The Grateful Dead - a 37 1/2 minute jam session that concludes with their speakers blowing out , replete with smoke ! ! Canned Heat - you see the lead singer with the unique voice sing `` On The Road Again '' and Bob Hite saying to the crowd that he has to urinate ( this is only heard in the film but now you get to actually SEE IT ! ) Creedence Clearwater Revival - You see them play 4 songs from their Woodstock set ( most famously `` Born on the Bayou '' ) and you see John Fogerty getting a little testy with the sound crew at the end of the aforementioned song . Classic stuff ! Mountain - if you 've ever owned the Woodstock album , you 've heard their stuff . Now you get to see them perform 2 songs ( not their big hit `` Mississippi Queen '' because it was n't written yet ) and the gigantic fat singer ( The Mountain ) really belts out the tunes.Paul Butterfield 's Blues Band - again , if you 've owned any Woodstock albums , you probably heard this guy ( who died in 1987 ) but now you get to actually see him belt out some blue-eyes soul ! He 's not that remarkable but his back-up band is fantastic.Johnny Winter - Yes , Mr. Albino himself ! You see the master perform a great 10 minute song/guitar solo that is to die for.Other extra footage contains other songs from the performers who appear in the film ( e.g . Joan Baez , Joe Cocker , Sha-Na-Na , Jefferson Airplane , & The Who [ the Abbie Hoffman-Pete Townshend confrontation is not included since no known video footage of it exists ] ) .The extras disc also has a memorable montage of scenes from the festival 's opening and closing with inspiring commentary by the Legendary Emcee himself , Mr. Chip Monck.Included on the extras disc are interviews with Michael Lang , Michael Wadleigh & others ( even Mr . Monck ! ) And you got ta love the swede fringe box ! Well done Warner Brothers ... .you finally got the DVD right .	1
I first saw this film on cable around 1985 or so , and as soon as I knew it was being broadcast , I settled in to tape it . Thanks to dirty tape heads in my folks ' old VCR , the sound quality was poor -- most of the old man 's intro outside the local pub was lost in static . This I endured for years . When I found this version available on DVD , already aware that the director 's cut had been released some years back , I knew this would be a keeper . And indeed it is : The re-edited film , which formerly was choppy and confusing in its running order ( or at least as I remember it ) , now flows much better , and the added performances are very welcome . My only complaint is that this one was issued among the first flood of DVD releases in 1997 , and so is spread out over 2 sides of a disc rather than having been remastered in dual-layer format . ( So I 'm lazy , you say ? Fair enough , but the thing I 've always liked about the CD is that you do n't have to get up to turn them over . ) Otherwise , definitely worth having .	1
This vidio of & quot ; Michael Crawford In Concert & quot ; is one of my favorites . Michael truly has the voice of an angel . He sings with such tenderness and feeling . His music always cheers me up . I could listen to him sing all day . I highly recommend that you buy this video . It 's heavenly ! I 'd give it 100 stars if I could ! !	1
When I was a kid , there were certain movies that I watched so many times I could recite the words by heart -- `` The Lion King , '' `` The Last Unicorn , '' `` Never-Ending Story , '' the Rankin-Bass `` Life and Adventures of Santa Claus , '' and this particular movie , `` The Flight of Dragons . '' Our copy was a home-recorded VHS ( this film must have been aired on TV at some point ) and my siblings and I watched it so many times we ended up wearing out the tape . Something about this movie stuck in my heart for years , and I 'm quite positive that it was at least partly responsible for my lifelong love of dragons and the mythos surrounding them.Now with a VHS copy of the movie in my possession , I can finally relive the wonder and adventure of this forgotten classic , and remember why I loved it so much.In the year 1000 , the world has given up on magic , preferring to rely on logic and science instead . Determined to not let the creatures and beings of magic fade away , three of the four Magic Brothers -- wizards Carolinus , Solarius , and Lo-Tijan -- propose to create a realm where the creatures of myth can retreat and live in peace . The fourth wizard , Ommadon , disagrees , and elects to wage war against mankind and their technology instead . Prevented by ancient magic from declaring war on their brother , the other three wizards , led by Carolinus , find and recruit a modern-day hero to fight Ommadon ... a young dragon-obsessed scientist from Boston named Peter Dickinson . Before he can embark on his quest , however , a magical accident traps Peter in the body of a dragon , and he must learn to control and manage his draconic body before he and his allies -- dragon Smurgl , knight Orrin Neville-Smythe , archer Danielle , talking wolf Aragh , and elven outlaw Giles -- can travel to Ommadon 's realm and defeat him once and for all.Based on two books ( the plot comes from `` The Dragon and the George '' by Gordon R. Dickson , while the biology of the dragons and the visual style of the movie are inspired by `` The Flight of Dragons '' by Peter Dickinson ) and borrowing the name of its title character from the author of the second , the plot of this movie feels somewhat cliche , what with its magic vs. science conflict and the `` Lord of the Rings '' nature of its quest . But the characters win the movie -- they 're a diverse and likable lot , and while they do make mistakes , they use their heads as well as magic and strength to progress in their quest . I particularly liked Aragh , the gruff but friendly wolf character , and Smurgl , the cantankerous and somewhat snarky old dragon who teaches Peter how to be a dragon . And while the entire vocal cast ( including John Ritter , Harry Morgan , and Don Messick ) performs quite well , James Earl Jones wins hands-down as the hammy but sinister Ommadon , in a role that 's just as appropriately villainous as Darth Vader.The animation of this movie is similar to that of `` The Last Unicorn '' and `` The Hobbit , '' and while it 's not as smooth as Disney animation , it does n't sacrifice detail or character expression . The backgrounds are beautifully rendered , both the pleasant green of Carolinus ' realm and the bleak wastelands of Ommadon 's realm . And the style of the movie is remarkably faithful to the illustrations of Dickinson 's book.While not perfect , I still give this movie five stars , because it has great worth to me as a beloved movie of my childhood . And unlike some childhood favorites that have not aged well , such as `` Quest For Camelot '' or `` Ferngully , '' `` The Flight of Dragons '' remains enjoyable for me as an adult , perhaps more enjoyable now that I 've had a chance to read the source material and have developed a much deeper love of dragons and fantasy . And the theme song of this movie , sung by Don McLean of `` American Pie '' fame , still stirs my heart.If you love `` The Last Unicorn , '' `` Never-Ending Story , '' or the old animated `` Hobbit '' movie , give this a shot . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
Another rare classic from Rankin/Bass animation studio , made in 1982 . The same studio animated the Hobbit , and the Last Unicorn , in addition to their great holiday TV specials , A well made adventure yarn involving dragons , wizards , science , time travel , and such . Very enjoyable with good voice work , good music , and art design . The movies concept is loosely based on the book by the same title by Peter Dickinson . And the hero in the story is also named Peter Dickinson ( voiced by the late John Ritter ) . In the story , the powers of good magic are fading away , and they need to figure out why . Carolinus , a good wizard ( Harry Morgan ) summons Dickinson , who is a writer and a role play game inventor from our time/world to help . An evil wizard ( voice by James Earl Jones ) is behind the problem and making it worse . Dragons are killing dragons in a war for good and evil . A good knight , a princess , elves , wizards , dragons , talking animals , this story has all the key elements of a great fantasy adventure . It has some great plot twists and is not the usual story , so it is worth seeing.On the down side , the current release is a `` made on demand DVD-R release '' , copied on a computer . The picture quality does not appear to be remastered like so many other Rankin/Bass titles were when released on DVD . I understand they did the same with `` The Life and Times of Santa Claus '' . If you do not approve of this cheapened attitude towards the movie , hang onto your VHS copy until they make it better .	1
Elvis Presley 's films were a largely a hit or miss affair , but this 1964 gem is easily The King 's best ( in my opinion anyway , since I know a lot of people will tell you it 's `` Jailhouse Rock '' ) . `` Viva Las Vegas '' features great songs ( which include the timeless title song and a sizzling if inferior cover of the Ray Charles classic `` What I 'd Say '' ) , a working plot , and best of all , Elvis ' best onscreen costar and one of the sexiest women ever to grace the silver screen , Ann-Margret . `` Viva Las Vegas '' stars Elvis as Lucky Martin , a down on his luck mechanic who needs dough to buy a new engine for his car , which he plans to compete with in an upcoming race . While working at the shop , he encounters Rusty Martin ( Ann-Margret ) , a swimming instructor who works at a ritzy hotel . Lucky is immediately smitten with her ( best line : Rusty : Can you help me ? My engine 's whistling . Lucky : I do n't blame it . ) , but Rusty at first feels nothing for him ( the duet `` The Lady Loves Me '' is the funniest scene in the whole movie ) . However , Rusty quickly changes her mind and the two become an item , until Lucky refuses to drop out of the race for her , despite her concern that it 's unsafe . When she leaves him for a smoothtalkin ' Italian racecar driver ( Ceasre Denova ) Lucky tries desparately to get her back . The film culminates with some brilliant racing shots and a happy ending.This is absolutely a must have for any dvd collection . Elvis fans or nots , this film will appeal to mostly everybody .	1
VIVA LAS VEGAS is the quintessential Elvis Presley musical , filled with great songs and not to mention his most formidable female costar , Ann-Margret at the very height of her 'sex kitten ' phase.Just like many of his other movie roles , Presley plays race-car driver Lucky Jackson , who gets stranded in Vegas when his money runs out . He meets beautiful swimming instructor Rusty ( Ann-Margret ) and the sparks immediately start flying . The director George Sidney had already guided Ann-Margret through her first major starring vehicle `` Bye Bye Birdie '' , and had also helmed many of the great M-G-M musicals . He brought a great touch to VIVA LAS VEGAS which is one of the main reasons why so many people love this movie , even those who are n't too keen on Elvis . The musical numbers ( choreographed by veteran Broadway and Hollywood dancer David Winters ) are plentiful but the highlights include `` Yellow Rose of Texas '' , `` The Lady Loves Me '' , `` Today , Tomorrow and Forever '' and the Title Song . Ann-Margret also gets to sizzle with the elaborately-designed and jazzily-choreographed `` Appreciation '' . Also featuring Cesare Danova , William Demarest and Nicky Blair .	1
What more can I say ELVIS . Nice story very good music , Buy it enjoy it just like me . Always been a fan .	1
Ann Margaret and the king obviously clicked in this movie.. The music and dance was great and Elvis was really good in this movie .	1
What a beautiful , video transfer . It is like looking through a window . This is the first older movie I have purchased on Blu Ray and if they all look as good as this one I am afraid I am in trouble , as I will be rebuying a lot of Dvd , s .	1
I love this movie ... .it 's one of my all time favorite 'mindless ' films . It 's just a fun easy way to kill 90 minutes and enjoy some great musical numbers by Elvis and Ann-Margret.Does anyone know if Ann-Margret will do anything ( interview/commentary ) on this delux edition ? That would truly make it a special edition for me !	1
here is another great elvis movie lots of race cars in this one very good songs in it i really like the song viva las vegas the bluray is excellent .	1
`` The Secret of NIMH '' told a self-contained story ( and an epic one , at that ) , but a few loose ends were left to tantalize the imagination.Part II picks up the threads of that tale , and weaves an equally stirring saga , while adding a few shocking plot twists and rousing musical numbers for good measure.In the tradition of one of my favorite plot devices , we learn that young Timothy Brisby has an important destiny to fulfill -- he is a `` chosen one , '' if you will . He journeys to the Rats ' new home , Thorn Valley . After seeing the first film , I always wondered what sort of utopian society the Rats would be able to create , liberated from the need to hide in a farmhouse rosebush , and `` NIMH 2 '' delivers a greater spectacle than I could have conceived.In the wondrous splendor of Thorn Valley , he meets ( for the first time ) his old benefactors Justin and Mr. Ages . Brutus the Guard also makes a welcome appearance , and finally speaks ! Providing much more characterization than his appearance in the first film , `` NIMH 2 '' made Brutus one of my favorite animated characters ever.New characters are added , including Jenny the Mouse and Cecil the Bug.A few surprises pop up along the way . I do n't want to spoil anything , but remember the mice who got sucked into the ventilation system while attempting to escape from NIMH ? Well , not ALL of them were killed ... But the most gut-wrenching shock of all is the revelation that Timothy 's brother Martin has turned to the `` dark side . `` All-star talent contributes to the journey , with Ralph Macchio and Eric Idle ( who continues his tradition of lending his voice talents to awesome animated sagas ) providing depth and feeling to the charming characters . Best of all , Dom DeLuise returns as Jeremy the Crow ! ! ! The animation is quite artful , for a movie that went direct-to-video . It 's absolutely on par with Disney 's video sequels . It looks even better on DVD.Not only is `` the Secret of NIMH 2 '' a satisfying sequel in its own right , but it also leaves a small thread to be picked up by a third film . The mystical amulet that saved the Brisby home is never mentioned . Perhaps it 's gone missing ...	1
I watched and enjoyed this movie when I was an elementary school child . I saw it on Toon Disney and I really loved watching it . I do n't enjoy it as much now , but I still have a few feelings left for this movie . I was a little disappointed to hear that critics and fans hated this movie . I actually watched this BEFORE I fully understood the first film . I liked the hero story , and more importantly , what I still enjoy Timmy and Jenny 's relationship . That 's my highlight for the film . I am grateful that this was not scary like the first film , especially with the cats . Dragon was menacing , but the cats in this film are funny . My only problems with this film are the faded animation , and the fact that there is no real villain . I still enjoy the first film , but I do n't think this sequel is horrible . I definitely liked it better than the Disney direct- to- video sequels . There is a good movie in here , I know there is . If we just come up with a bigger story with Timmy and Jenny in it and include a real villain , we could get a sequel as brilliant as the first film .	1
Jonathan Demme directed this and frames it as the most intimate of live portraits . This is probably what MTV used to aim for but not got to , what Storytellers wants to be but ca n't be ... a true picture of an individual and artist in his element . Using only his art to explain itself , Demme puts his cameras to Robyn Hitchcock in a way that would probably have been intimidating to many other performers , but Hitchcock accepts these intrusions and fearlessly treads forward in his usual uncompromisingly idiosyncratic way . The movie really hits home the issue for me that he 's so far from bland that he could never be popular the way many are . People have to choose to like or look into Robyn Hitchcock , so many things become popular because of their blandness , safeness , trends . None of that is found in his music , or lyrics . At the same time , he 's brash , intelligent , tuneful , and most importantly humorously unconventional which is the big appeal . Normally , there is no upside when people think unconventionality and tuneful in the same sentence , they immediately think , `` that 's not for me . '' A shame for them , because he 's such a stout artist , he 's just fun to listen to or watch whenever you pick him up no matter what album you choose . Have a few albums of his and none of these songs are on this , so it 's refreshing to hear other material I also really like .	1
I love Storefront Hitchcock . However the DVD was released in Standard format only ( full screen ) which is way lame.And Hitchcock performed many other songs that were filmed that could 've easily been included here . the Soundtrack CD contains a bunch of songs not in the film ( and the Soundtrack Vinyl LP contains a few more ) .It 's nice that Demme would make this film but why is it SOOO brief ? I mean his Talking Heads film Stop Making Sense is nearly two hours in length.Come on , 77 Minutes ? ! ? It 's shame that it took so long to be released on DVD/VHS to begin with but why itwas given such a half baked-release is beyond me.Hitchcock deserves much better .	1
This is a great DVD to give as a gift for an expecting couple , or someone with a newborn ... even if it is you ! I just gave this one , and also included a copy of the book , in case they need to make notes.Getting right to the point , the Dr. Karp explains that in many cultures a baby is carried with its mother , as she goes through her day . They are carried in slings They can suck their mothers breast at anytime . The author says that this constant motion and constant body contact , along with the snug sheet , making the baby feel secure as it mimics the conditions in the womb.He goes on to say that months 0-3 of baby 's life are the missing & # 34 ; fourth trimester & # 34 ; , hence his methods of the following the 5 S 's work well , since they imitate the womb environment:1 . Swaddle - he describes and illustrates an excellent swaddle technique , the tighter , the more womb-like2 . Side / Stomach - laying baby on side or stomach.3 . Shush - I found this one interesting as you always hear parents saying that to there baby . He says it is mimicking the sound of the blood flow the baby heard for 9 months ! He also suggests turning on a vacuum ... same sound.4 . Swinging - rhythmic , jiggling motion . That simulates movement in the womb.5 . Suck - sucking on a pacifier , nipple , your finger , etc ... The idea is these five things is they all initiate the calming reflex in the baby . Of course he goes into much more detail , which I found very interesting . Great gift idea .	1
This video is awesome ! I could have watched it in the hospitol when I had my baby , and I didnt , and I really wish I had ! We thought that our baby hated being swaddled , but that wasnt true ! You have to swaddle and rock him ... . and put him on his stomach or side , its amazing watching these babies in the video just immediatly stop fussing and become calm . There IS a calming reflex , and knowing how to trigger it is a very important part of parenting a newborn . This video came too late for my first baby , but I will CERTAINLY use it for my next one ! I really wish that I had known about it before . EVERY PARENT should watch this video before and shortly after having a baby . It is amazing how well it works for newborns . I did try it with my 2 month old , and it did work , but he was a little old to be used to it anymore ! BUT I HIGHLY recommend this video to EVERY PARENT ! its AWESOME ! ! ! !	1
the ideas in this book are so useful and really practical we used them when the & # 34 ; grands & # 34 ; were little folks and often with great success	1
Very calming . Is great for my anxiety . Soothing voice , relaxing back ground music . Some really new ideas to help you cope and quiet your thoughts . This Cd is great during the day . or to help you get to sleep . It is perfect !	1
The Calming Collection / Goodbye Worries is excellent for patients with chronic insomnia . I find these CD 's to be a very useful tool in my practice . By Gregg L. Friedman MD , Psychiatrist , Hallandale Beach , Florida	1
A classic of jazz , the studio work of these 2 giants together in this mid to late 1950 's period put forth some of the greatest sounding music ever layed down.Hawkinks the master , Webster , the sweet soul bluesman on these tracks are an amazing display of blues , and jazz with the great Oscar Peterson on piano.There are a whole slew of recordings done in this 1950 's era for Verve comprising a similiar lineup of these stellar musicians and many are on the Veve master-editions issue ... not to be missed for those exploring are the Genius of Coleman Hawkins , Ben Webster and Associates , Ben Webster meets Oscar Peterson , Ben Webster 's Soulville..these releases were all repackaged with liner notes and given great treatment..All of these `` senior '' masters were given their due late on in their careers but the greatness of their youth is revisited on this and the other fine releases .	1
When I first saw the ad for this delta sleep system , I figured why not , I 'll go ahead and see if it works if it doesnt oh well . Well , I 've been using it for the past year and I will say that for me , it actually helps me get a deeper , more restful sleep than not using it at all especially if I have problems getting to sleep . My favorite cd is the first one and to be honest I have never & quot ; heard & quot ; the entire cd . If I had to guess about the time period , I would say that 15-20 minutes after the cd starts I fall asleep . My routine is that I start the cd , lay down , turn off the lights , and listen . I can feel my body relaxing and the next thing i know it is morning . I wake up feeling like I actually had a great nights sleep instead of the usual groggyness I use to feel . I dont know if this works on everyone , but I do know it works for me . : )	1
It is not 100 % guaranteed , but the recording is relaxing enough to make sleep a real possibility . Be warned : The Delta Sleep System is NOT designed for a room-sized music system ; in fact it can be downright irritating coming through big speakers . It works best with a headset on personal players like ipods and mp3 players . ( Yes , you can fall asleep wearing headphones - if you use the in-the-ear buds instead of the monster head sets . ) My biggest gripe is that the recording has an abrupt break in the middle - like the company is still making vinyls with only 30 minutes per side , not cds . Wish they 'd made it a single , seamless recording . If I 'm not fully in the zone , that break is especially annoying .	1
This CD is invaluable to me . I work at night , so I need all the help I can get to sleep during the day . I put a mask on for darkness , then put the headphones on with this CD . I definitely recommend this CD for quality , refreshing , deep sleep .	1
If you want to watch Scooby Doo with your children , try `` Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders '' , `` Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico '' , `` Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness Monster '' , `` Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase '' or `` Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School '' .This is far too dark , and scary , for most young children , or even older children.I adore this movie now that I am a teenager , though . It 's great for older Scooby Doo fans .	1
We love the Scooby Doo movies . This one is really adorable . My kids had it on vhs and loved it so much we finally replace it with dvd .	1
In this new movie it is the 90 's . The whole gang are grown up with their own careers . Daphne is a reporter who has her own talk show . Freddie is a writer who produces her show , they are also dating . Velma owns a mystery bookstore . Shaggy is still exploring his career path . Scooby Doo still likes eating those scooby snacks . They take the mystery machine to New Orleans to find a real haunted house on a mysterious Bayou . They find that the ghosts and Zombies haunting the island are real ! They must solve the mystery of Zombie Island.I grew up with Scooby Doo in the late 70 's and the 80 's . It is great to see Scooby Doo making a comeback in the 90 's . The characters are still funny . I like it that they are not stuck in a 70 's timewarp . The characters are grown up with careers . They wear 90 's cloths and listen to 90 's music . The music goes with the action in the movie . This is a great movie for anyone who has grown up watching Scooby Doo .	1
One of my favorite Scooby-Doo movies that I like to repeat view ( again and again ) .A Pup Named Scooby-Doo ended in 1991 . The forgettable Arabian Nights movie appeared in 1993 . The live action theatrical release Scooby Doo and new series What 's New Scooby-Doo ? would not brighten our days til 2002 . Thank goodness Warner Brothers took pity on us Scooby fans and released Zombie Island in 1998 ! Adrienne Barbeau and Mark Hamill lend their voice talents to this excellent release . I like that they made the monsters real this time . This is an excellent first release for a new generation of fans .	1
Scooby Doo makes a comeback from his 3 films in the late 80 's . And this time they added Scooby Doo Where Are You ? But the movie is short . The first 3 was between 90-95 minutes long . But it seems that that it got cut down short . The movie clocks at about 77 minutes . Scooby Doo and Shaggy star in this you must love to watch me eat movie.This time there is no Scrappy Doo . But the whole gang is here . But they have broken up because the monstars/ghosts are bad guys in maskes . Daphne has her own show while Fred runs it . Velma opened her own mystery bookstore , and Scooby and Shaggy has both gotten jobs at the same airport . But get fired when thier boss catchs them not working . A few seconds later Shaggy gets a phone call from Fred . Shaggy cliams that Scooby and him was just thinking of taking some time off.Fred is inviting Shaggy and Scooby along for the ride to find a real haunted house for Daphne 's viewers . The show is entering its second season . Fred aslo invited Velma along too . And she was saving a box of Scooby Snacks for a long time . But now they are no good . Daphne wishes to find a real haunted house . She is tired of finding fake ghosts.And just so happens that she gets her wish . A young woman was listening in on the talking and decides to show them her bosses haunted house . Shaggy and Scooby are off eating at the time . ( of course ) . Her name is Lena . And her bosses name is Simone . But Simone does n't like dogs . So she has cats . Lots of cats . How does Simone keep track of them ? And the house is really haunted . And with lots of hot peppers . Simone does n't have tv on her island . Scooby Doo gets Simone all shook up after he chases her cats . So she wants something done about Scooby . Simone welcomes Scooby to her kitchen if that will keep him from catching cats . I think this must be the scariest Scooby Doo film of all the films so far . Some secens make give little kids nightmares . But still good movie .	1
This is the last of three in a series of detailed reviews from the videos comprising the Powerpuff 3-Pack . Video : Bubblevicious.In the title story , Bubbles , frustrated of being seen as the baby of the crime-fighting trio , takes it upon herself to be just as hardcore as her sisters . The scene where she gets a real workout in the simulation room ends with her in an adrenalized frenzy , crying : `` Who else wants some ? '' It 's a good action-packed scene . However , she newfound determination also carries with it some pent-up rage , which alienates her sisters . Buttercup 's fight against a slug-like monster also demonstrates why she is the toughest fighter . ( Rating : 5 ) . `` Uh Oh ... Dynamo '' shows that not even weekends are sacred . The Girls have to deal with a giant , multiocular fish monster who seems to have been a reject from a Godzilla movie . The Dynamo referred to in this story is a titanic robotic Powerpuff Girl that the Professor builds to protect the girls . After watching this story I put Townsville down on my list of cities most frequently destroyed , probably even beating the number of times Godzilla has destroyed Tokyo . ( Rating : 4 ) . '' Mr . Mojo 's Rising '' is a condensed version of how and why Mojo Jojo left Professor Utonium . It does not contradict the opening sequence of the PPG movie . Basically , Mojo feels that the professor 's attention to the girls was what forced him out and he wants to be included . The Professor thinks maybe this will stop him from being an evil genius bent on destroying mankind . And no , Jim Morrison does not make a guest appearance despite the title . ( Rating : 4 ) .In `` Cat Man Do '' , a scientist who has created a ray gun and is about to unleash its power on Townsville is stopped by the Powerpuffs . As the laboratory turns into an inferno , a plaintive meow is heard . Bubbles , ever the animal-lover , rescues a long-haired white Persian and brings it home . This story turns the concept of Blofeld , the head of SPECTRE in the James Bond movies , and his pet , on its head . ( Rating : 5 ) .As for `` Powerpuff Bluff '' , oh dear ! A trio of burglars foiled time and again by the Girls get the bright idea of continuing their crime wave by impersonating the girls . Oooookay . I know this is for kids , but it does show that sometimes , the people of Townsville are n't exactly the smartest olives in the salad . ( Rating : 2 ) .Overall rating : ( 5+4+4+5+2 ) /5=4 .	1
I have to admit that I have always had a soft spot for the Powerpuff Girls . I find the frequently tongue-in-cheek humour to be very witty and like most good cartoons are , this one is thoroughly entertaining for both kids and adults alike . My favourite Cartoon Network character is actually Dexter 's Lab but until they release that on DVD I guess this will have to do as second best . This DVD has been very well thought out and designed and contains good bonus features as well as 10 great episodes . Highly recommended for a good laugh !	1
Dame Joan obviously could not be compared to her prime at her farewell performance . However , that was a very good decision to say farewell to all her fans in this glorious and very seldom performed opera.She still had a very good stage presence and did not have to `` die or go mad `` at the end.The final farewell scene was impressive , I do n't think any opera singer ever had such a sumptious farewell occasion . It showed how her fans loved her and would missed her.That was in sharp contrast to how Pavarotti bid farewell to her fans in New York.Both occsions would be well talked about and remembered.I wished they have taped the OONY concert performance of the same opera at Carnegie Hall last year.That was a memorable performance .	1
It 's pretty hard to add to all the positive comments noted in the other reviewers pieces . Yes , one could nitpick a bit here and there , but why ? This is tremendously enjoyable and showcasesnot only a wonderful group of dancers but a fascinating selectionof ballets of all styles and periods.The title Variety and Virtuosity sums up the DVD perfectly.Just GET IT !	1
Earlier this year I reviewed the documentary about the original Woodstock Festival in 1969 . In that review I noted that some of the performers ' works had held up very well over time and others seemed merely topical for that colorful time , or bombastic . The same sentiment expressed there can be used to evaluate the performances here . Although Monterey pre-dated Woodstock by a couple of years and was on a different coast the seemingly obligatory ` filler ' video of the crowds as they assembled in all their splendor could have been shot in either locale . This moreover was the Summer of Love of 1967 , the last gasp effort to create an alternative lifestyle that might have a chance to survive . We know it did not but nevertheless have to salute the effort . ` Oh , to be young was very heaven ' to quote Wordsworth but did we really wear those outfits . Yes , we did as a measure of our awkward attempts at independence and individual expression- but enough of nostalgia . The real point is that Jimi 's work passes the test of time . As does The Jefferson Airplane ( I might add that I made that same comment in reference to their Woodstock performance ) . The Mamas and Papas and Otis Redding I put a question mark on . The Who definitely has not aged well . The Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar 's performance is , of course , timeless ( all approximatelt 15 minutes of it ) . For those who were young then and for those who have only heard the myths this is definitely worth spending some time watching . The disc three outtakes is a real bonus , as well .	1
One of the best documents of the sixties and the music that affected people and society . D.A . Pennebaker who also directed Dylan 's Do n't Look Back and later The Rolling Stones Altamount Concert Gim me Shelter has crafted another winner . Highlights include The Who smashing their guitars , Eric Burdon and his new version of the Animals , Janice Joplin , Otis Redding and of course Jimi Hendrix with covers of Wild Thing and Dylan 's Like A Rolling Stone among his heart pounded numbers . But the scene where Jimi & quot ; sacrifices & quot ; his guitar is the most unforgettable image left on the viewers consciousness , simply mesmerizing .	1
This is the best Darin DVD available - Bobby died several months after this performance . This incredible DVD showcases better than any - and better than many of his CDs- the range of talent this man embodied . From `` Beyond the Sea '' to `` Midnight Special , '' you get 200 percent of everything Bobby had to give . His energy in this performance is incredible , almost as if he knew it was his final . What 's more , this performance had not been thoroughly rehearsed , Bobby had his oxygen sitting backstage to take hits from between songs , and if you watch closely , you 'll see him working to get blood circulating through his hands . This is Bobby Darin at his cumulative best and shows what he could do with a song that no other vocalist can do .	1
Having had the absolute pleasure of attending many of Bobby Darin 's performances in person , as well as , being in posession of MANY of his LP's/CD 's , he has proven over , and over again , to be the consummate all-around entertainer/actor/singer/musician . Although I have been a fan of Sinatra and Sammy Davis , Jr . for many years..NONE could surpass his magnifcent artistry . He just absolutely ran `` circles '' around EVERY great performer who has ever lived . His untimely death on Decemmber 20 , 1973 was an absolute loss to the entertainment industry ... . '' bar none . '' That date will be forever etched in my heart and soul , as well as , in my mind . Personally ... that was the day `` the music died . '' Never , in the future , will there ever be an all-around performer that could EVER come close to this phenomenal TALENT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! May GOD BLESS YOU , Bobby .	1
Seen most of the footage before but it was still nice to see and hear it again . Levon Helm did a wonderful job narrating . Checked the details against the stories in books I have about Elvis and found someinteresting tidbits I had n't known.Elvis Presley Cultural Icon ( Facts , Figures and Fashions )	1
A gift that was purchased for a friend who is a Elvis fan , who advised she enjoyed the book very much .	1
Of the two versions of IOLANTHE available this is bar far the best . The purists will certainly balk at some of the tampering , but ever since the Joseph Papp Broadway version of THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE nobody seems to be able to leave the G & S works alone ! All things considered this version is easy to digest and captures the spirit of the thing ! Now that The D'Oyly Carte is long gone all we Savoyards have is our memories of traditional productions .	1
This review is mostly written for people who do n't know `` Iolanthe '' because over here in America the musical is n't very famous and is seldom put on . I only learned about it myself by accident several years ago when it was produced by a local college in my area . I went to see it without knowing anything about it nor even having heard anything about it . I was bowled over by the genius of the music , comedy , story , humor and everything about this masterpiece as portrayed by the college music and drama students ! After seeing the play at the college , I started looking for CD music and VHS tapes and DVD 's of Iolanthe . Apparently there are only TWO versions on video -- - VHS or DVD -- -this one and one done in Canada by `` The Stratford Festival Company '' . I have both of these . Is this one and the Stratford any good ? Some reviewers apparently think not . But , the play -- -the words and music -- - are `` almost indestructable '' in my humble opinion because of the genius of the two creators , Mr. Gilber and Mr. Sullivan . Of course , `` they could be better '' in this aspect or t'other on the tape and DVD versions . But , I am just grateful that there are ANY video versions of this masterpiece available at all ! Buy one or t'other of these ... do n't be too critical ( `` the glass is half full rather than half empty '' type of attitude ) , listen to the music and the clever words , and I know you 'll enjoy ! Afterword : One part of the musical play that I thought was especially funny and clever is the song , `` Loudly Let The Trumpets Bray '' . This is the song and music when The Arrogant Lords , who are really silly things , come arrogantly marching on stage with their Beefeater Costumes and their noses arrogantly in the air . As they march on stage they sing : `` Bow ye tradesmen bow ye masses , bow ye lower middle classes . '' They are acting as though they are `` superior '' to these `` masses '' thus telling the masses to bow to them -- -the Lords of The House of Lords . And , of course , these `` noble lords '' are actually very silly and stupid ! The effect of being told to `` bow '' to these silly guys is very funny I assure you ! : o ) One more word , I see the price of the DVD is $ 126.00 ! ! ! Actually , you can get the VHS Tape version for less than $ 10.00 used on Amazon . Email Boland7214 @ aol.co	1
Only three of the tracks have lyrics : the two versions of `` Original Sin '' , and `` Some Kind of Mystery . '' I do n't consider the first and last tracks to be proper music ; one 's just Baldwin reading the trademark line , while the other 's Orson Welles from the original radio show doing the same . Apart from the bookend tracks , the extra `` Original Sin '' recording , and `` The Tank '' , the tracks appear in the same order as in the film.As usual , I 'll identify which portions of the film correspond to each track.Several shorter musical passages from the film have been omitted , but most of the music has been included . If I do n't mention it , it 's not in here . Among the noteworthy omissions are : the drummers ' fanfare at the temple ; Khan 's emergence from the crypt ; the mandala scene , when Khan summons Professor Lane ; the butcher of Lhasa dream sequence ; and the final battle . `` The Shadow Knows '' Not a song , just the Shadow 's line after a *lot* of processing . `` Original Sin '' ( Theme from the Shadow ) was n't written by Goldsmith , but by Jim Steinman . This first version on the CD is about a minute and a half longer than the version from the closing credits of the film , but otherwise very similar . `` The Poppy Fields ( Main Title ) '' picks up as the letters of the title begin floating onto the screen , with a horn carrying the theme and an accompaniment that gives the effect of an elaborately ticking clock . The track runs all the way through the opening poppy field sequence ( hence the name ) , through the rival 's confrontation with Yin-Ko , ending with the abrupt closing of Yin-Ko 's moving little speech , `` Wu , you are a wonderful friend , like a father to me ... '' '' Some Kind of Mystery '' ( written by Diane Warren , not Goldsmith ) is performed by Sinoa , and appears in the film underlying the first Cobalt Club scene , as the song sung by the lady dressed to match the Club 's blue theme . The dialogue of the rest of the scene obscures most of the lyrics , but they 're quite appropriate : `` You look into my eyes/steal my heart/read my mind ... you cast a spell on me ... '' Very mellow voice with a lot of sax accompaniment . `` The Sanctum '' begins with our first view of the ring on the cop 's hand at the museum murder scene , tracks all the way through the message-tube delivery , ending as the Shadow receives his report from `` the switchboard guy '' in the Sanctum itself . `` Who Are You ? '' picks up a beat after the Sanctum , as the Shadow turns to face Shiwan Khan . It continues ( with occasional pauses on the soundtrack , though not in the music , for better emphasis of the dialogue ) all the way through their conversation , ending with the coin toss . ( Unfortunately , this omits the nice dramatic flourish that accompanies Khan 's little speech to his minions , which is visually a nice scene even if somewhat oddly placed . ) '' Chest Pains '' begins just as Khan 's minions shoot the laboratory bodyguards , continues through the subsequent battle between the Shadow and the flunkies ( including the heavy percussion passage during which the Shadow himself is wounded and becomes visible ) , ending with the Shadow 's departure from the laboratory building . `` The Knife '' ( a.k.a. , `` Oh , *that* knife '' ) begins just as Shiwan Khan rams it into the table between the Shadow 's fingers , continuing through the confrontation ( including the corny exchange of shots ) , ending with `` It 's just an empty lot , boss . '' Consequently , this contains a little chase music , followed by a variation on what I call the 'Hotel Monolith ' theme . `` The Hotel '' ( a.k.a . `` Hotel Monolith '' , and should follow rather than precede `` The Tank '' ) I tracked down the CD on the basis of the opening bars of this one track , because I *really* enjoy the scene where the Shadow finally realizes where Shiwan Khan 's headquarters are . *That* is a dramatic musical passage , beginning with the cut from Margo 's report to the vacant lot , and ending as the Shadow confronts Claymore in the ballroom . `` The Tank '' begins with the cut from the Shadow 's conversation with Margo to the tank by the docks . The music is swamped by dialogue and FX on screen until Claymore begins sealing up the tank , when the claves cut in , so it may take awhile to reach a point the listener is familiar with from the film . `` Frontal Lobotomy '' begins as Khan opens his eyes in hospital after the final battle ( *that* sequence was omitted from this CD ) , and runs all the way through to the beginning of the closing credits , when `` Original Sin '' kicks in . `` Original Sin '' The version from the closing credits , same singer as the previous recording on the CD , who 's listed as Taylor Dayne on the jewel case . I 'm fond of it , although I think it 's been arranged with too much percussion accompaniment . `` The Shadow Radio Show 1937 : Who Knows What Evil Lurks in the Hearts of Men ? '' delivered by Orson Welles , the trademark opening of the original SHADOW radio broadcasts .	1
This DVD recorded in Amsterdam comes from Tina 's Wildest Dreams tour which was a spectacular success playing over 150 concerts to some 3,000,000 people . By the time this concert was recorded everything had become so familiar to the performers - instrumentalists and dancers , that the whole event progresses with all the natural ease of breathing.The track list contains 20 of her most popular hits as well as one bonus and features her regular band who perform with totally slick professionalism as one would expect . The three dancers complement Tina with dancing of great precision . Tina herself , is the ball of energy that she always is , with a tremendous ability to communicate through her songs and with her rapturous audience.The recording is in 4:3 visual format but is clear and captures the excitement and immediacy of the event . The sound is presented in DD 5.1 and stereo . This is cut at a slightly lower level than usual so the volume needs turning up to compensate and to add body to a slightly bass-light recording.As a compilation of a considerable number of Tins 's most popular hits performed at white heat this disc will be hard to beat . I would therefore expect it to be much appreciated by anyone who warms to the Tina Turner phenomenon and would suggest that this is a good 5 stars worth even allowing for the slight sound reservations as above .	1
Okay This is just amazing ... .I was a little bit skeptical about getting it at first because Tina was in her mid 50 's . However She is the LIVING PROOF that AGE does n't Mean a Thing ! . She TORE it up on every Single song ! This is Why she is the most successful Black Touring artist of all time . LEGEND	1
Make this your precursor to Tina 's Twenty-Four Seven tour this spring/summer ... Digs Tina 's steamy performances of & quot ; Goldeneye & quot ; and & quot ; Nutbush City Limits & quot ; here ... I can watch this twenty four seven , how 'bout you ?	1
Neil Diamond at his best , captured for my personal enjoyment . I may have to buy more for my family and friends .	1
Again my wife enjoyed watching and listening to the talent of Neil Diamond right in front of her as thisDVD again demonstrated Neil Diamond 's talent .	1
Gloria and her Miami Sound Machine are glorious . This is a phenomenal concert with highlight after highlight . `` Oye Mi Canto '' and buy this DVD .	1
What a career she has had , song after song and hit after hit.To own this dvd and see her in concert , is almost as good as being there . A great addition to my music collection .	1
OMG , I finally received the first part of my order today . It took more than a month for it to arrive but as soon as I got it , I put it on I could not stop crying . I felt just like the little girl I used to be watching him on TV while screaming and crying . I still can not believe MJ is no longer with us . Get this DVD you will no be disappointed ! It 's so clear the videos chosen are perfecto . I just wish that it was n't a two sided disc so I dont have to flip the disc over for the rest . Nevertheless , MJ will live in film & history forever . I am so grateful to be able to obtain this collection my only regret is that I did n't get it years ago .	1
This DVD by Michael Jackson , features 13 of his greatest music videos and television performances , from 1983 to 1997.The most outstanding performance on this DVD would have to be the live version of & quot ; Billie Jean & quot ; , which was performed way back in 1983 . This was the very first time that Michael ever performed the & quot ; moonwalk & quot ; in public , and the rest is HIStory.Other highlights include 1989 's & quot ; Liberian Girl ( from BAD ) & quot ; & quot ; Smooth Criminal ( short version ) & quot ; , a & quot ; 1995 MTV performance & quot ; & quot ; Scream & quot ; , & quot ; You Are Not Alone & quot ; , and & quot ; Blood on the Dance Floor. & quot ; It was great to finally have & quot ; Smooth Criminal & quot ; on DVD . I also own the VHS & quot ; Moonwalker ( 1988 ) & quot ; , but the tracking on the video has gone to hell . Now I can watch & quot ; Smooth Criminal & quot ; , whenever I want to , along with & quot ; Billie Jean ( live ) & quot ; , & quot ; Beat It & quot ; and & quot ; Thriller & quot ; , which I also own on VHS as well.Any fan of great dancing , catchy beats , R & amp ; B , and phenominal directing , would enjoy this treat by the King of Pop , & quot ; Michael Jackson. & quot ; Hopefully , he 'll put out another DVD in the near future ( maybe & quot ; Moonwalker ? & quot ; ) .	1
I have watched this DVD at least 20 to 30 times already and it is worth every dollar , every cent , every penny ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Of course you have to get the volumn 1 dvd to have all the classic music videos but this one has the Motown performance and 95 MTV performance ! ! ! ! ! ! AND this is the only dvd with the `` You are not alone '' angel version ! trust me , I have all MJ 's dvds and this one is the only one showing MJ as an angel in the music video ! ! ! ! ! You wo n't regret buying this !	1
If I could only pick one dvd of music videos from all of my favorite artists , this would be what I would pick . This dvd is the real enchilada . It comes packed with MJ 's most recent and cutting-edge videos , along with several classic videos that brought him to be known not only as the king of pop , but the also the king of music videos . He set a deadly precedent from early on in his career , with such videos as `` Beat It '' , `` Billie Jean '' , `` Smooth Criminal '' , and of course , `` Thriller '' . It is tough to consistently live up to such great expectations when so many prior videos have been legendary , but I feel Michael certainly did not fail to please with the newer videos that went with his `` HIStory '' CD . Most of us at one point or another have seen the majority of Michael 's older films . This dvd offers a look at several of his videos that were rarely seen on television in the U.S. `` Scream '' , a duet with sister Janet , is probably the best known short film from the HIStory cd , and rightfully so . The special effects and dancing is simply amazing , and the song itself is quite intoxicating . Another great video that is lesser known is `` They Do n't Care About Us '' . This song features an awesome percussion beat along with rocking guitar sounds . The video is directed by Spike Lee and features the Brazilian percussion group Olodum . It was shot on the streets of Brazil , and is a very powerful video . Perhaps the most emotionally moving video is `` Earth Song '' , which is a deep and soulful song , mourning for the Earth as we do various things to destroy it . The video shows various kinds of destruction , ranging from the clearing of rain forests , industrial pollution , poaching , and war . The presentation is absolutely astounding.The video works to show how several factors come together to impact people and animals all over the world . I am not a man to shed a tear very often , but this video was a tear-jerker even for me . The video is beautiful , with the overall message that there is still time to turn things around . `` Stranger In Moscow '' is yet another marvelous video , trading dancing and blatant messages for a more subtle symbolism . Even in the absence of MJ 's signature dancing , this is a more than satisfying video . `` You Are Not Alone '' is another of his newer works on this dvd . This is a poignant song that really showcases the range of Michael 's voice . The video features his then-wife Lisa Marie Presley . It is a solid video , but this reviewer feels the video does n't quite do the song justice . The two live performances included on this dvd are a special treat . The `` Billie Jean '' performance from the Apollo is when Michael first debuted the moonwalk . In this day when we are used to seeing a singer on stage accompanied by tons of backup dancers , it is refreshing to see Michael , on the stage alone delivering a stellar performance , singing and dancing his heart out . The 15 minute MTV performance is yet another jaw-dropping show . Michael performs a medley of `` Do n't Stop Til You Get Enough '' , `` Scream '' , `` Beat It '' , `` Black or White '' ( featuring Slash ) and `` The Way You Make Me Feel '' . He delivers full performances of `` Dangerous '' ( mesmerizing dancing ! ) and `` You Are Not Alone '' . The newer videos which are overall stellar , combined with some of Michael 's best earlier works make this an unrivaled music dvd . Morever , there is all kinds of music here . Some songs make you want to get out of your chair and dance , some are smooth and relaxing , some are very thought-provoking , some are rebellious , and some are even lugubrious . Overall , it is a tempting schmear for the emotions and the senses . The vast majority of the videos are as awesome to see as they are to hear . Even if you are not an MJ fan , the entertainment value is still outstanding with this dvd . If you are n't sure why Michael is regarded as the King of Pop , watching this dvd should leave you with no questions .	1
TEASER - This is why I say that Michael ca n't do anything small . Just watch it and you 'll see what I mean . He takes something as small as a music video DVD release and turns it 360 degress with this teaser into a whole lot more than that . Only Michael , folks , only Michael.BILLIE JEAN - Motown 25 . Live . Michael Jackson and Billie Jean . They go together perfectly . And when you can see the wheels in Michael 's head turning , you know that something special is about to happen -- and that 's when the debut of the moonwalk -- very spontaneously -- happens . Very historic performance , very historic that I 'm glad that they put on this DVD.BEAT IT - This is one of the video 's that broke the color barrier on MTV , and it has very good reason to have done so . I love the plot of Michael breaking up a gang fight by using the power of dance -- only Michael could get by with this stuff , in all honesty.LIBERIAN GIRL - I love all of the celebrity guest appearances -- we even get a guest appearance from Bubbles ! Everybody is looking around for Michael , and then he descends from the sky on a camera . So simple , yet very effective ... and actually quite fun.SMOOTH CRIMINAL - This is one of Michael 's most known songs , and one of the more beloved from the perfect Bad album . And this video is proof of why . It 's the full moonwalker version , and it contains the ever famous anti-gravity lean . When I was younger , this video did n't make any sense to me , but now that I 'm older and finally understand what I 'm seeing , I can say that I really do appreciate and love this video.1995 MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS PERFORMANCE - Wow . Michael is DEFINITELY the greatest entertainer that ever lived . Songs include `` Do n't Stop Til You Get Enough , '' `` The Way You Make Me Feel , '' `` Jam , '' `` Scream , '' `` Beat It , '' `` Black Or White , '' `` Billie Jean , `` Dangerous , '' and `` You Are Not Alone . '' This is 15 minutes , 16 at most , and Michael simply does not stop . He proves here that he 's the greatest entertainer in the world.THRILLER - You ca n't make a Michael Jackson video collection WITHOUT including this video . I 'm sure it 's been on all of them ( except for Dangerous ) in the past , and I 'm sure that it 'll be on all of them in the future . This is the ultimate music video , and , for that matter , it 's the ultimate Michael Jackson video . So it HAS to be included here.Now we flip it to side two ... SCREAM - The most expensive video at the time of it 's making , featuring his sister Janet , Scream looks like technology come to life ... especially for 1995 it looks like technology come to life . You can tell that Michael and Janet are having the time of their lives , too , which is always something good to see.CHILDHOOD - The theme from Free Willy 2 , the video does n't really do much for me . Quite possibly my least favorite video on the entire collection , but that 's not saying that it 's a bad video . It just , to me anyway , does n't feel too much like a typical Michael Jackson video.YOU ARE NOT ALONE - I LOVE this video . This video just has to be seen to be believed . Trust me , for 1995 , THIS is Michael at his absolute best ! THEY DO N'T CARE ABOUT US - Ah , this was so controversial . It actually had two video 's made for it , but the one included on this disc is the publicly released video . It 'd have been much more cool if they 'd have included the banned video , but I love the song and I love the video , so I 'm not going to complain too much.STRANGER IN MOSCOW - Remember what I said about `` You Are Not Alone ? '' Now , take that down here , change the title to `` Stranger In Moscow , '' and you have my thoughts on this video.BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR - It 's HIStory in the mix , ya know ? I love this video . It just goes and goes and goes and goes -- and then , when you think it 's done , it goes even more ! Michael simply does n't stop -- of course -- and the atmosphere of the video is completely awesome . One of my favorites on this set.BRACE YOURSELVES - Yep . You should always brace yourself when it comes to Michael Jackson , because you never know WHAT in the world is going to happen !	1
this dvd is a great collection of a great artist that passed before his time . love that i can relive my youth	1

Great songs , lots of energy and Ozzy of course doing what he does best `` going crazy '' . plus the encore with sabbath is classic .	1
Ozzy Osbourne 's live video , Live And Loud , documents some of Ozzy 's behind the scenes antics as well as the awesome shows he puts on live . This video shows the madman doing what he does best , aside from using a curse as every other word : getting on stage and playing the music that made him a star.The concert scenes are awesome . Taken from 3 different shows , Ozzy and his band pound through the hits from his solo work and Black Sabbath as well as playing his latest songs ( at the time ) from the No More Tears CD . Ozzy does his usual water tossing and clapping . Drummer Randy Castillo rocks the drums while Mike Inez plays away masterfully on the bass ( especially on No More Tears ) . And , of course , Ozzy has his right hand man on stage with him , also going by the name Zakk Wylde . With his bullseye guitars , Zakk blazes through each song , adding his own touch to the songs written by Randy Rhoads while adding a new innovation or two to his own.As I said , it is an excellent video . Each song is great and watching the band play is always a treat . The behind the scenes parts are simply little tidbits of stuff Ozzy does while not on stage . Some are actually quite funny . A good thing about this video is that they keep most of Ozzy 's between songs talking . Its not much but its still cool.Any Ozzy fan should own this just to simply have it . It showcases Ozzy 's ability to entertain and delight the fans while he has his own fun on stage . It also shows how tight and intense the rest of the band is at shows . Definitely pick this video up . Its a must .	1
I think this is a great dvd . There are songs on this DVD that Celine might not perform live again ; - ) Its a great one to add to a Celine fans collection .	1
The British Music Hall possessed a very strong unifying / communal experience component ... . a real jolly sing-a-long to help the masses to temporarily escape the shortcomings of their often very difficult lives . This outstanding concert by what is undoubtedly the greatest living pop/rock band in the world nobily takes the British Music Hall outside under a contemporary sky . Oasis tunes are for the masses ... ... are played for the masses ... . and arethoroughly embrassed by the masses . The music on this disc is , simply , infectious ... . you can not help becoming involved . It reaches deep in the the social friendly part of your soul and places you in the joyous company of your social and cultural peers in celebration of the moment and all that is good in life . Carry on lads .	1
It 's hard to believe but it 's been 15+ years since Oasis crashed onto the music scene with its debut album `` Definitely Maybe '' , which now sounds to me like a greatest hits album in and of itself . Over the years , Oasis has releases 4 official live recordings on tape/DVD : `` Live at the Sea '' ( recorded in 1995 ) , this one ( recorded in 95-96 ) , `` Familiar to Millions '' ( recorded in 2000 ) and `` Lord Do n't Slow Me Down '' ( recorded in 2006 ) . '' ... There and Then '' ( 17 tracks ; 95 min . ) is culled from 4 shows , 2 from London in November , 1995 , and 2 from Manchester City in April , 1996 , when the band was touring relentlessly behind the `` Morning Glory '' album . Now looking at it , it is clear that this is the band at its absolute peak . Just take the 2 opening numbers , the searing `` Swamp Song '' instrumental , and `` Acquiesce '' , a B-side that is as good as any song the band has ever made . The 17 songs on here are mixed pretty evenly between the 2 albums the band had made so far . Liam is in top form , as is the rest of the band . I bought this when it first came out on VHS , and it 's now even better on DVD , with the sound clearer and crisper . The editing is a bit herky-jerky at times , but in all this feels like a slice of history , frankly , as the band has never been better ( The `` Live at the Sea '' was recorded earlier than this , although released later , but the band is not yet as good as on here . ) I saw Oasis for the first time live in the Fall of 1996 at the Murat in Indianapolis ( only months after part of this was recorded ) , and what a great show that was . The band was hungry to conquer the US , and it showed . If you want to watch the band at its peak , do n't hesitate and buy this .	1
If you 're a huge Aerosmith fan or like learning about great rock bands then I highly recommend this DVD ! Aerosmith is my favorite band of all time . This DVD has 2 sides . I loved learning about how much time goes into making an album and how they come up with songs . I 'll definitely be buying other Aerosmith DVD 's and learning more about them since they have n't been on Vh1 's Behind The Music in forever . I highly recommend buying this . It 's definitely worth your time and money .	1
I 'm a big fan of Carpenter , who has developed a nice mix of fine interpretations of other artist 's songs and a substantial number of her own . She is a fine live performer and her studio work is high quality . It 's not like you have a lot of choices on Mary Chapin Carpenter DVD 's , but this DVD has some defects that might give you pause.Let me say first that there is nothing wrong with her performance or the band . When it 's MCP 's music that is on screen , it 's a lot of fun . But there are three things wrong : ( a ) it 's too short , ( b ) it 's chopped up by interviews , commentary and nattering , and ( c ) there are segues that make no sense.Too short : this is a moderately old concert ( c. 1995 ) and the focus in on songs from `` Come Con , Come On . '' There 's nothing wrong with that , but a number of fine songs from earlier albums are n't touched , and , of course , thee 's nothing from `` Party Doll '' or `` Time * Sex * Love '' . It 's not a ridiculously short playlist , but it 's mighty short.Too chopped up : The DVD seems shorter than it is because it 's mixed with interviews , commentary and annoying nattering . It comes across more like a TV special than a concert . Not all of the interviews and commentaries are bad ; some is even insightful . But listening to it during a song is doubly annoying.Bad segues : A specific example - There 's a bit with Joan Baez where they talk about songs they 've done and you can just sense there 's going to be a nice duet . And they talk some more , and Baez shuffles lyric sheets in her laps . And they cut to a song -- and it 's just Carpenter . Huh ? What ? But as annoying and frustrating as these lapses may be , the DVD still does a fine job of showing MCP in concert , having fun , and making excellent music with a fine band . It just could have been better . Too short , bad mix , too bad .	1
This captures Mary Chapin Carpenter at her best . In beautiful surroundings , MCC is relaxed and loose , laughing and telling stories and interacting with the audience . Watching her perform adds another layer of integrity to her music . There is a good selection of her music and the performance itself is a delight . Interspersed with the music are clips of behind the scenes preparation and interviews with other singers . I think MCC 's greatest gift is her ability to connect with those who listen to her ; this video makes it all the more evident .	1
If you never had a chance to see Rage Against the Machine live , you really missed out . There was a time when Zach de la Rocha was the most frightening performer in the land . I caught them twice in '93 , just as they were hitting - the shows were incendiary . Zach was wrath in the flesh , a live wire , ready to strike at any moment with unbridled fury . The pit was as wild as any I 've ever experienced ( I almost had a tooth knocked out ! ) I saw them once again in 1999 during `` The Battle of Los Angeles '' tour . The band was much tighter , and Zach got down , but I felt like they had lost much of their menacing edge . Still , they were absolutely captivating.This DVD captures Rage somewhere in between these two states . Most of the performances are from 1996/1997 , their `` Evil Empire '' tour , with the exception of a couple from 1994 ( pre- '' Evil Empire '' ) . Zach comes off as monstrous in '94 , and more human in 1996/1997 . Throughout , his intensity is at peak , especially on `` Freedom '' and `` Tire Me '' where he just goes absolutely nuts . It will give you shivers . Tom Morello is an extraordinary guitar player and is fascinating to watch as well.The live stuff is the reason to get this , but they 've also included six music videos as a bonus . The early videos , like `` Killing in the Name '' , are so poorly dubbed and low budget that they 're almost painful to watch . The later videos border on jaw dropping they 're so good ( my favorite is `` Bulls on Parade '' . ) Unfortunately the special features are a little bland . One , for example , is a reading list . Another is a list of non-profit organizations that the band supports . Noble , sure , but both are already available on the Rage web site , where they are more legible . The best special feature is the ability to view the lyrics during the songs - all music DVDs should have this feature ! The biggest thing lacking from this DVD is behind-the-scenes footage . I 'm sure it 's out there - why not include it ? If you were lucky enough to see Rage live , this DVD will bring back memories and have you pining for a reunion . If you missed them , brother/sister , I ca n't help you . In fact , you probably should avoid this - your envy for those of us who saw them could easily grow to unbearable proportions . Anyways , if you 're a big fan , this DVD is a must-own . Do n't hesitate to purchase it .	1
In case you did n't already know , this is n't just one full concert . It 's several live performances , and several music videos . There are also clips of the lead singer narrating over what looks like clips of confrontations and injustices throughout history . Now , of course this just may seem a little random and head-ache inducing . Do n't get me wrong , at times it is . But it 's all very well compensated for during the absolutely amazing live shows.Considering this package was originally released in 1997 , do n't expect any new hits to be on this ( `` Testify '' , `` Renegades of Funk '' ) rather your old favorites ( `` Bulls on Parade '' , `` Killing in the Name '' preceded by a hilarious introduction ) . The performances are all supercharged . Every member of the band puts every last bit of their energy into every song . It 's like it 's the last time they 're ever performing as a group . Wait till you hear `` Bulls on Parade '' . The way they do it is phenomenal . Even if you 're not a huge Rage fan , you 'll still be knocked on your butt by these amazing performances . These are some of the best live performances available on DVD.The second half of the DVD is music videos for most of the songs that are featured in the live portion . Each music video is unique in its own way , even though they are a little disturbing at times . If you 've ever seen one of their videos before , you know that they have strong political messages to them . It may seem that they 're just a bunch of anarchists who want to brainwash you ( much like Tyler Durden from `` Fight Club '' ) . But if you 've never seen one before , you 're in for a treat . And we 'll leave it with what I 've already said.Now for the technical aspects of the disc . First off : the video transfer . Since almost each performance is shot separately , some spots are better than others . Some look like they were shot on a 1983 home video camera , and others look they were shot on a modern DV ( not DVD ) camera . Throughout the entire thing , there seems to be murkiness in certain aspects , with too much shadowing . The colors are a little drab and do n't necessarily jump off off your screen . But the video quality adds to the factor of anarchism.The audio is much better than I thought it would be . It 's not as LOUD as it should be , but it 's still very nice . It has Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0 and both sound great regardless . Fans screaming behind you , guitars coming out of the left , drums from the right , vocals from the front , and the subwoofer packs so much bass , your pets will run for cover ( well , at least mine jumped off the couch ) . Again , some spots are better than others . The music videos have the better sound to them , but the whole package is nicely played.This is n't the music DVD you 'd want to buy to show off your home theater ( try `` U2 : Live from Boston ) , and it 's not one to show off your brand new progressive scan DVD player and projection HDTV ( try `` The Matrix '' or `` Fight Club '' ) , but it 's definitely fun to watch , and worth a go for anyone who enjoys modern hard rock .	1
Now this DVD of rage is tight . You get to see everything live , and the early videos of rage . none of the battle of la or renegades songs are on there , but the previous songs are so good that you wo n't even notice , and also you see exactly why they are called RAGE against the machine . Zack 's unbridled energy on stage along with Tom 's guitarwork is just beautiful to watch . You just have to see it .	1
I love RATM . I was at the Irvine Meadows concert shown in this video - unfortunately , that one is the worst of the ones shown . It was a great show , but it 's just poor quality . Part of that is because it 's at night , but it also seems kind of poor anyway . The other shows are pretty good , but the video has flaws . The video collection is cool though , although the ones from the first album are basically just Rage live , they 're awesome .	1
Since others have well covered the music and playing ( and , yes , I too have a lobe in my brain dedicated to SRV and the fellows of Double Trouble ) I 'd like to comment on the quality of the product . This applies to the VHS only , although I suspect that the DVD would be similar.The 1989 Austin City Limits show lacked & quot ; Tightrope & quot ; , which was later tacked on as a & quot ; Tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan & quot ; to another PBS show , which featured Buddy Guy . I was able to tape both at the time of broadcast . The 1989 SRV PBS broadcast had reasonably punchy sound ( although SRV 's tone was most unusually fuzzy and buzzy on this show , and I can compare this to MANY shows recorded elsewhere ) . The sound and visual were in perfect synchronization.I wondered why it took a company SO LONG to release SRV 's '89 show , since reportedly this was one of the most-requested Austin City Limits shows . I was happy at the VHS release , since now SRV lovers who were n't bootleg collectors , could enjoy a live show ... and immediately disappointed : the sound is sub-standard , compared to TV broadcast I 'd taped , and OUT OF SYNCH with the visual.Hard to believe , folks , but this is a poor transfer . Yes , get it , but if able , acquire a tape of the original PBS broadcast . Incidentally , the SRV boxed set is supposed to have a DVD with several other outtakes from this show.Wish the releasing company would get it all together.That said , the performances from 1989 are of classical-music level achievement . What do I mean ? He is improvising less on the & quot ; In Step & quot ; songs ' solos , rather playing well-worked out solos with classical perfection . ( The House is a'Rockin ' , Crossfire , for example ) . On the other hand , he introduces a few new licks and turn-arounds on the Tightrope solo and it 's great fun to compare THAT solo to versions of the song caught elsewhere ( studio and concert bootlegs ) .His version of Buddy Guy 's & quot ; You 'd Better Leave My Woman Alone & quot ; almost out-does Buddy Guy ( who can be seen doing the song on the PBS Austin City Limits show that presented & quot ; Tightrope & quot ; ) DO BUY the & quot ; Live from the El Mocambo & quot ; circa 1983 VHS ( or DVD ? ) . That is astonishing , with great camera work , many close-ups of his fingering ... watch out for flying sweat ! ! Several of his renditions ( Texas Flood and So Excited ) are absolutely among the finest he recorded . Since many , many SRV concerts are traded on videotape by collectors , I hope more might make it to commercial release before another decade goes by . To my thinking , & quot ; El Mocambo & quot ; shows a wonderful human being at a peak of ingenuity , creativity , and physical mastery of a demanding musical instrument . To a question & quot ; what are people capable of at their very best ? & quot ; , I 'd say : & quot ; Watch this ! & quot ; .	1
The descriptions of this vidio say Stevie Ray was nervous or not sure in the first 1983 and confident in the last 1989 . Stevie Ray Vaughan was tremendous throughout this entire video . Stevie Ray Vaughan is not a man performing for an audiance , but a man pouring his soul out before an audiance . You can see a before and after change in his appearance ( life change ) , but his guitar work was great on both sides .	1
to me this is one those dvds you just cant get enough of . when you listen to it ' you just want to listen to it once again and again thats how it is for me . stevie really shows his stuff on this one . leave my girl alone theres no words to put on here how good that one is . you just listen and watch for your self and find out . the second part to the 1989 videos can be found on the srv box set 2000.i wish they would have put it all on there as well . theres been talk about other dvds to come out soon and well like every other srv fan im still waiting ? and then theres the movie talk to caught in the crossfire . now we all know he should have had a movie about his life come out a long time ago . buy this dvd you 'll be glad you did . a fan always	1
Stevie Ray Vaughan was one of the best guitarist that ever lived . He died 1990 in a helicopter and alot of people missed a chance to see him perform live . Most of Stevie Ray Vaughans best guitar playing was when he played live . Now on DVD every one can see a Stevie Ray Vaughan performence once and for all . This austin city limits performence is filled with great songs . The first set Stevie Ray Vaughan played Pride and Joy , Texas Flood , and Voodoo Chile ( slight return ) . I have to say on the first set on this DVD Stevie seemed nervous with the crowd . When the second set occured in 1989 things seemed much better with Stevie 's performence playing . He came out with Tightrope which was off of his In Step album . Then he played You Better Leave My Little Girl Alone stevie went crazy on his fret-board playing his with his blues abilites . Stevie was a great blues guitarist Texas Flood and You Better Leave My Girl Alone were two of his best blues songs ever . Stevie played cold shot and a few more songs before the concert was over . This performence to me was one of his best Stevie always played his heart out which you will see on this DVD . There is also a bonus video Little Wing its very cool going in a guitar factory including Hendrix and other great guitarist . I rated this 5 stars it deserves it I first saw this on VHS the picture quality was crappy when I bought the DVD the picture quality was out of this world . For any guitarist buy this also another great SRV DVD is Live At Elbacomba check it out in my other reviews . Enjoy !	1
one of the best dvds i 've ever seen ! i love stevie ray vaughan , and this is just amazing ! wish it was the whole concert , but being his last in ausitn , it has alot of meaning to it ! play it all the time	1
This excellent video is done in two parts . The first three songs are from the 1983 performance on Austin City Limits and they are excellent . Stevie Ray rocks all out on `` Pride and Joy '' , `` Texas Flood '' , and the Jimi Hendrix cover of `` Voodoo Chile ( Slight Return ) '' ( only SRV could do the latter song justice ) .The songs from the 1989 show are , `` The House Is Rockin '' , `` Tightrope '' , `` Leave My Little Girl Alone '' , `` Cold Shot '' , `` Crossfire '' , and `` Riviera Paradise '' . `` Leave My Little Girl Alone '' is the blues at its very best . Stevie Ray plays the guitar with such passion . `` Riviera Paradise '' is a great jazz flavored instrumental . I think it 's awesome . The keyboard part reminds me of something that Lyle Mays with the Pat Metheny Group would play . Really nice.Also included at the end of the video disc is a montage video of 'Little Wing ' , this is the Jimi Hendrix song that SRV covered which was previously unreleased . The video is awesome as it shows rare footage with SRV and several blues greats including BB King , T-Bone Walker , Albert Collins , Hendrix , Big Bill Broonzy , Leadbelly , Eric Clapton , and more.All in all , this is an excellent collection of SRV songs . A must have for the SRV fan .	1
If you are a guitar player , you know what a talent Stevie was.A huge loss to the music and more specifically the guitar world.This was my first DVD pruchase and I love it.If you critique the sound , and are dissapointed with it , you are missing the point . Simply watching Stevie play was enough for me . Makes playing the guitar look easy , which it isn't.The contrasts between the two Austin performances was good , giving us a look at two phases in Stevie ( and DT ) music career.A & quot ; must & quot ; purchase for the guitar player , and , a great addition to anyone who can appreciate good blues and rock music.Missin you Stevie .	1
The dvd was as advertised - excellent musicians playing Stevie Ray Vaughan music . It reminds you what a talented musician SRV was and how sad it is that we lost him at such a young age .	1
If you want to hear an allstar jam of top guitarists doing Stevie Ray , you ca n't beat this . The CD 's for your ipod , but the DVD is a must to experience the concert as if you were there , seeing what the artists are actually doing , and their joy .	1
When Stevie Ray Vaughan passed , we lost the greatest blues guitar player the world may ever experience . This tribute , and others like Eric Clapton 's Crossroad Festival Concert DVDs , keep SRV alive for those of us that are true fans .	1
This film , shot in Texas in June of 1995 , features a whole host of talented musicians . The littany of names is enthralling . Buddy Guy , B.B . King , Bonnie Raitt , Jimmy Vaughan , Robert Cray and Eric Clapton , who was nominated for best male rock performance in 1997 at the Grammys for his performance . Each musician performs his own incredible piece and the film also includes each performer 's reflections on Stevie and all culminating to an incredible blues guitar jam with each musician having a solo . Filled with beautiful slides , riffs and solos and heartfelt thoughts each artist pays tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan in his own way . A befitting tribute to a once in a life time bluesman .	1
... I was not disappointed with this DVD . Being a native North Carolinian , graduate of Carolina ( Taylor went to Chapel Hill High School and his father was head of the medical school ) , plus a fingerpicker who has actually played a cedar/rosewood cutaway Olson guitar virtually identical to the one James Taylor plays after intermission on this performance , I 'm a huge Taylor fan . [ Heck , I 've even got a record of Alex Taylor , his virtually unknown brother ( everyone remembers Livingston ) ] .I suspect Taylor has influenced my guitar style more than any other player , Paul Simon and Jose Feliciano being next.Anyway , this DVD is fabulous . The sound is so good , I 'd buy this one without the video . Taylor surrounds himself with great musicians , inc cello , horns , backing vocalists , the great Louis Conti on percussion , drums , bass , a fabulous lead guitarist , etc . Plus the two great videos , including Copperline , in Special Features , are a nice addition . Also , and thankfully ( since I have three young sons ) , he leaves off the `` MF '' word he injected in Steamroller Blues on the Greatest Hits album.The only fault I can possibly find is that Taylor does n't play Sweet Baby James nor Carolina on my Mind . Plus this DVD is full screen and not widescreen .	1
Sweet Baby James is back , this time with another terrific concert performance of his ever-growing catalogue of unforgettable songs . While he is easily one of the most successful of all of the record selling artists of the last thirty years , he is also one of the hardest working live performers in the business , and is in perpetual demand throughout the country , indeed , the world , as a first class draw for huge crowds . I have n't had the pleasure of seeing him sing live in decades , but always anticipate his new record releases and DVDs such as these in order to stay in touch with this most singular talent . Like the late John Denver , Taylor approaches the stage with enthusiasm and a charismatic charm that is simply hard for me to resist . Needless to say , I succumbed to the temptations herein pretty quickly.Included here are many works not previously available on DVD , all delivered with the typical flawless Taylor rendition . Of course , the panoply of perpetual favorite favorites like & quot ; Fire And Rain & quot ; , & quot ; Copperline & quot ; , & quot ; Everyday & quot ; , & quot ; You 've Got A Friend & quot ; , and & quot ; Sweet Baby James & quot ; are all here , as are many others , for a total of some two dozen songs or so . Old JT is aging , as are we all , but he has mellowed even more over the years , and by prevailing over his own demons and continuing to do what he does like no one else can , has once again offered us a gift that I urge you to go out and grab for your very own . Enjoy !	1
to begin with a well-worn cliche.. look up `` tasty '' in the dictionary and there will be a picture of this disc . I only wish I had bought it sooner Was put off at first when I heard that this is a re-mix from a PBS special ( and it is ) , my thinking being `` how good could the audio be ? '' Well the answer is.. very very good indeed ! JT 's performace is excellent , but it 's the outstanding musicians and performances behind him which propel this disc to the top of my repeat playlist . Astonishing players ; I particularly loved the gorgeous colors laid down on keyboards and guitar , and you may know the drummer from the earlier days of the David Letterman band.To cut to the chase , the audio mix is pristine ! Crystal clarity combined with an unexpected ( and very welcome ) warmth and power in the bass . Your subwoofer will enjoy the workout ! Wonderful audio imaging of the entire stage positioning . The only wish I would add to the audio is that it was in DTS , and unlike discs such as the Eagles or the Steely Dan dvd , `` Beacon '' isnt mixed so that the band is in 3D using the rear channels to surround the listener with performers ; in this production the rear channels largely accomodate audience ambiance . But what a mix to the front channels ! The production on James ' guitar work is so good it places the instrument in the room with you . Note : the same guy was at the helm on this one as was on Taylor 's recent Grammy winning album . The arrangements are fresh and very interesting musically , with a setlist to match ! I 've listened to this disc quite a few times , and I must say , the `` surprise '' in Shower the People still gives me chills . In short , a master performance from a master songwriter . If you enjoy this genre and/or looking for a disc to showcase the power of your system , stop reading reviews and rush this disc to your doorstep at once ! It 's on my blu-ray wishlist .	1
This DVD is absolutely incredible and possesses one of the best images I 've seen on a music DVD so far . The musical content is magical as Gloria Estefan takes us through her journey as a dance diva with 12 of her greatest and latest videos including & quot ; Oye & quot ; & quot ; Heavens what I feel & quot ; & quot ; Do n't Stop & quot ; & quot ; Turn the beat around & quot ; & quot ; You 'll be Mine ( Party time ) & quot ; & quot ; I 'm not giving you up & quot ; & quot ; Higher & quot ; & quot ; Everlasting Love & quot ; all ranging from the years 94 - 98 , 5 of these videos are taken from her already multi platinum release & quot ; gloria ! & quot ; . It also takes us behind the scenes of her recent promotional tour of the album with a look at rehearsals for such shows as VH1 diva 's live and The world music awards . The DVD has also been nominated for a Grammy for best long form music video at this years ( 2000 ) ceremony . A must have and worthy addition to your DVD collection .	1
What a phenominal collection ! ! ! I have been waiting for a long time to see these videos.Originally I had the vhs version of this collection but it did not have the same videos as the dvd.The dvd contains some excerpts from interviews and awards shows with the Latina Diva herself . It also contains behind the scenes on most of her videos . The quality is first rate . The sound is clean and the picture ( color included ) is fantastic.But let 's get to the meat of this review : the videos.First of all she contains videos with remixed songs . Those would be Turn The Beat Around ( she is even sexy pregnant ) and I 'm Not Giving You Up ( one of my favorites from Gloria ) . She also includes a few `` live '' videos ( disappointing that they were lip synched-but who cares ) . They are Do n't Stop and Party Time . Also included in this collection is the first release from her multiple platinum , all dance cd GLORIA ! : Heaven 's What I Feel.She also has a few of her Spanish videos : Tres Deseos ( very cute theme for a video ) and the Spanish version of Oye.Speaking of OYE-what a hot , hot , hot , Ricky Martin has nothing on Gloria , hot , hot video . OYE was probably the only real reason I purchased this dvd . This is unlike the Gloria we have all grown to love . OYE is steamy , sexy and incredible.If you are truely a Gloria fan , you must own this dvd .	1
who am i kidding ? if you 're a PJ fan , you already have this album . if you 're not , what i say in this review aint going to change a thing.for the fans out there : well , i was just like the rest of you when i heard about this release . outright giddy . PJ ducking exposure all these years and not much media coverage about them , it was a pleasant surprise when they annouced this video release along with their album , yield . being that i was sorta tired of all the unofficial bootleg videos , i wanted something professionally shot , something with a clear view of the band . and we got that and more . this video gave us fans much insight into the recording of yield , jampacked with interviews from the 4 members and the beloved jack irons.why not five stars ? well , if you are comparing it to other music dvds out there , then by far , this is a five-star product . if you are comparing this to other pj dvds , then it falls a bit short . this dvd contains no extras and runs less than an hour .	1
This documentary shows how the band created the album yield without entering in too many details ( The film lasts about 45 minutes ) .	1
I 've been a longtime AIC fan but never really felt the need to buy this Unplugged DVD . Only after hearing Pearl Jam 's acoustic CD did I begin to want this DVD . I eventually did buy it and was moved beyond words by the performance . Layne and Jerry 's voices playing off of each other created a mood no other Unplugged performance will ever rival , and the guitars , bass , and drums are all hauntingly beautiful . What makes this different from the much more publicized performance of Nirvana 's is that this entire set is beautiful and mellow whereas Nirvana 's changed between somewhat upbeat and then depressing . Through the entire run time each time you look at Layne you feel pain and emotion flowing through his voice , particularly in Rooster . There are no low points with this set , every song is played perfectly and fits with the other songs like it should , nothing feels out of place . Jerry 's voice at no time overpowers Layne 's , and it sounds great throughout . No bad things can possibly be said about this DVD , performance , or this band . This is essential listening , you can tell from the 5-star average rating after over 60 reviews that everyone loves this performance . It does n't matter if you 're a fan of AIC or a fan of grunge , if you have any feelings at all , you 're bound to experience them while viewing this .	1
The title of this review , of course , is to reference the messsage bassist Sean Kinney wrote to four patrons of their MTV Unplugged set , Metallica . That is one of the many highlights , humorous and saddening , that you will find on this DVD . Of course , as mentioned may times over , the obvious fact is the deterioration of Layne Staley . The man was clearly on his last legs ; the power and conviction in his voice is all but gone , and what is left is essentially a mouse-like figure , trembling and quivering his own shame and sorrow . Perhaps , at least for this performance , is for the best ; the changes underscore the gravity and moxy that this band once had . `` Would '' , `` Down In A Hole '' `` Rooster '' and `` Killer Is Me '' are some of the better performances that are featured is this must-own DVD .	1
I have only been a fan of AIC/grunge music for about a year ( I 'm sorry I missed it 's youth but I was still hung up on classic rock at the time being forty-____ . ) but I am now a firm fan of grunge and especially of AIC . Rarely will you ever see such gut wrenching emotion in music and emotion is what I love . If you want to just plug in something and let it be wallpaper do n't bother with AIC . If , on the other hand , you want to plug something in and be riveted by the sheer power , professionalism , and musical prowess try AIC.Few things AIC have ever done demonstrate this better than `` Unplugged . '' Rarely do you see a group perform studio recordings as near flawless as does AIC . The repeoduction is almost exactly the same as you would hear if you listened to a studio recording cd , with the exception of course that they are using acoustic guitars instead of electric . The tempi is as near exact as the ear could detect unless of course one is a music expert . I find that many bands play their songs either slightly or quite noticeably faster live that they are on their records . Not AIC as far as I can tell . The acoustic instruments take nothing away from the power of AIC 's music either . In fact , the subtleness may even add to the emotion of the songs . It 's like someone whispering , it may not be as loud but it gets your attention more that if they yelled.I was totally parylized by this performance when I first saw it . I could not take my eyes off of Layne when he was on screen . Rarely do you find a performer who can elicit such feeling by just the sound of his voice alone . Of course his tortured persona adds to this but I 'm sure I would be just as captured by him if I were listinging to the `` Unplugged '' cd rather than watching the dvd.I think the three songs that best demonstrate this are `` Nutshell '' , `` Down In A Hole '' , and `` Rooster . '' Astounding ! I firmly agree with an earlier reviewer who said you do n't have to be an AIC fan to enjoy this dvd . All you have to be is a lover of good rock music and if you are also a lover of good rock music performed really well live you will be richly rewarded by this dvd.P.S . Sean Kinney is indeed a fantastically gifted drummer . He knows that drumming is about timing rather than noise and he an Mike Inez are like the siamese twins of rhythm sections . Watch , listen and marvel .	1
This is one of the best concerts I 've ever bought on dvd . Alice In Chains put on a hell of a show , hauntingly beautiful , but watching it is a little sad knowing how things ended for Layne Staley . A must have for any Alice In Chains fan .	1
If you like music of the Strauss family , this is a superb concert with great sound from 1987 . The concert lasts about 90 minutes , with very few interruptions between pieces . The camera is mostly on the orchestra and conductor ( who looks like he is on his last legs ) and the playing is incredibly beautiful . Kathleen Battle is on stage for the & quot ; Voices of Spring & quot ; waltz and has a perfect coloratura for the part . The sound on the DVD is great and the program notes are good too . This is a definite buy .	1
Many critics find the CD of this performance to be one of Karajan 's worst , but I fail to fathom why . Perhaps having the visual as well as aural changes the perception . This is a stunning work . The choral arrangements are the strongest I have ever heard , not watered down like on Norrington 's 9th . Being able to see the singers makes the perception that much better . I hope that in the future all classical music is recorded in this format . It could certainly help pick up the lagging sales in the market . It could also revolutionize pop recordings , as artists could release an audio album complete with accompanying videos . This is where the Sony/Philips SACD could really make an impact : artists could release a single disc which would allow CD play of the music in cars , on portable stereos , etc. , and also allow audio and video in a home theater system . Let 's hope the industry catches on ! ! !	1
If I could have less words I could , but this is fantastic ! Watch the talented Mutter play the four seasons beautifully and have Karajan conducting from the Harpsichord -- what could be better !	1
Buy the DVD version . I made the mistake of buying the VHS version of this it had barely anything . I am going to order my DVD version , and shelf my VHS version somewhere . This is a must for any Mariah fan , also buy Mariah 1 's on DVD that is great also . I am glad that more people are supporting DVD over VHS . If that does not convince you to buy it , it 's Mariah enough said !	1
Fans of Mariah are also critical of this DVD , and I am well aware of its shortcomings . The primary concern here is that they wanted to film Mariah literally `` All Around the World '' , and the results are less than spectacular . I also had a problem with the song selection and the portions of stage banter they decided to include ( Mariah in Australia for example - a huge portion of dialog was n't very interesting even if you ARE a Mariah fan ) .The standout was definitely her performance of `` Fantasy '' with the ODB bit thrown in - some nice choreography here and Mariah actually dances . Its amazing to think she used to be this skinny ! Also of importance is the performance with Olivia Newton John singing `` Hopelessly Devoted to You '' . I 'm in no way a fan of this overwrought song , but here it sounded pretty good and you can see the two genuinely like each other.But really , you should n't be getting this for the concert . What you should be looking forward to is owning the rare video for `` The Roof '' ( a criminally underrated track off her `` Butterfly '' album ) . In fact , the entire DVD is from the 1997 `` Butterfly Era '' , so you have the remaining videos ( `` Butterfly '' , `` My All '' and of course the amazing `` Breakdown '' all included here ) . `` The Roof '' has NEVER BEEN ISSUED on DVD before , and was n't aired much on TV either , so this is the only way to own it . I would say , this ranks as one of the best Mariah videos ever , so get it now.I still think the ultimate Mariah DVD is the 2007 release of her 1992 MTV Unplugged Concert , but considering the extras on this DVD , you ca n't quite go wrong . Highly Recommended .	1

Watching the old videos brings back so many memories . It made me break out the old CD 's and I 've bought & # 34 ; 10 & # 34 ; that was released last year .	1
This is a must have for any new kids on the block fan . You must add this to your collection . I really enjoyed this videos , these videos brings back memories . All of these boys are cute .	1
... we also agree that Rosie is a bit toooo much for this prime time Sesame Street outing , but , that 's okay because , things like Chris Rock bantering with Oscar the Grouch , and the Fugees jamming with Big Bird and the Mayor of Margaritaville literally kickin ' it with Kermit and the Amphibians , and tunes from the Mighty Mighty Bosstones , and Shawn Colvin ( not to mention Muppets ' two straight men in this , the sardonic Jon Stewart and the always funny David Alan Grier ) makes this a show that most parents and grand parents do n't mind watching with the youngsters ... .a musical , magical 55 minutes of fun .	1
I can never say enough about Tony Bennett the Artist's.He truly has a Voice that is timeless to me.on this Unplugged Showcase Tony brings it & His Voice just brings a strong warmth & Presentation.a Must have .	1
While I enjoyed the original release of this recording , I was not overly impressed by it . But it was a different story with the SACD version . With a surround sound system and good speakers , this recording makes you feel like you are sitting in one of the best seats at a Tony Bennett concert . This is what Super Audio is all about !	1
Certain short moments change everything . One was when the promoters of Woodstock declared the massive concert a free show . Some say that August 1969 weekend was the apex of the hippie dream : a communal and no cost weekend of peace , love , flowers , and music.People tend to forget that Woodstock was declared a disaster area and that the New York State National Guard was called in to distribute food . The promoters of the festival took an absolute money bath . The Who almost did n't get paid , and it was not until the film and album came out in 1970 that Wooodstock made money.You know what else can change everything ? Hell . That is how Jerry Garcia described what happened four months later , when in December , the Rolling Stones asked the Hell 's Angels to provide security at their festival at the Altamont Speedway , which they hoped would be Woodstock West . Every creepo in Calafornia seemed to show up that weekend-I love the imbecile whining outside the Stones trailer like a three-year-old `` I wan na see Mick Jagger , G-dammit '' - and were beaten with pool cues by the Angels . Paul Kantner of Jefforson Airplane got knocked out , and a fan with a gun , Maradith Hunter , was killed . To see this mess , getGimme ShelterYet somehow , promoters in England sought to try it all again in 1970 , and thus held the Isle Of Wight Festival . This show had sets by The Who , Jimi Hendrix , The Doors , Jethro Tull , and Family , among a lot of other rock and folk royalty of the era.These sets are documented on this DVD , along with the behind the scenes workings of this massive undertaking.Message To Love is a fascinating look at why the Woodstock Dream did not and could not make it past the 1960s . Not even past December 1969 . Even in the counterculture days of 1970 , rock royalty expected to be paid . Paid well.The problem : fans who came to Isle of White did not seem to get that putting on a massive rock concert was a massive financial and logistical undertaking . They wanted Woodstock In England . They wanted communal utopia . They did n't understand why they had to pay to get in . 'Can you blame them . Maybe . Maybe not . In 1970 , rock was politics , money was politics , and rock festivals were , most absolutely politics . Massive showings of hippie potential set to music . It seems laughable in 2010 , but there was a real tension between hippies , capitalists , and hippie capitalists . This is best shown when Joni Mitchel sits on stage , tries to calm the crowd , make sense of what was going on.No one was killed at Isle of Wight . There was no riot . Despite the anxiety about potential disaster that seems to run through the film , the disaster never came . Isle of Wight was unfortunately no Woodstock , and blessedly , no Altamont.But if you enjoy the music , or if you enjoy the story , Message To Love works either way . A movie about when rock and youth thought they could change the world , and why they actually could n't , so very long ago .	1

The colorful sights and sounds of the 600,000 stoned hippies attended on the small island for the 5 days wild stoned celebration of the `` British Woodstock '' , are truly amazing . Add to that the interesting , and , somehow amusing interviews held by director Murray Lerner with the flower children , and you 'll get a pretty decent and fascinating picture of the hippies culture , style and way of life back in 1970 , a naive view which said it 's all there for the take . The only thing that 's missing is the music . Lerner and his crew seemed to forget something along the way . There is simply not enough music , and many parts were brutaly cut out and heavily edited . Lerner was , sometimes , concentrating too much in the never ending disputesand conflicts between the long haired Marijuana and L.S.D struck hippies which refused paying the 3 pounds admission and the festival promoters and their helpless , useless security stuff.Donovan singing one of his beauties , `` Catch the wind '' , has been shown for 20 seconds only , but the good thing while the song went on was stoned hippies smoking dope in the backgound which was cool : ) Jimi hendrix was fantastic , in anabsolutely blazing performance , and so were The Doors , Jethro tull , Ten years after , Miles DavisFree , The Who , Taste , Emerson Lake & Palmer , Joan Baez , Leonard Cohen , Joni Mitchell and The Family . they were all great and proved that Freshwater Down was as good as Woodstock , maybe even better .	1

Great concert and keeps the memory of the personality of a legend alive ! ! Vintage John Denver ... you ca n't fail here ! ! Vinyl to CD and the voice of a legend ! Ca n't beat it for great sounds ! !	1
I just received JOHN DENVER - THE WILDLIFE CONCERT ( DVD ) from AMAZON.COM . My wife and I turned the lights down , cranked up the Bose surround speakers , and were enraptured for the entire duration of that outstanding performance . This was John at his very best . The concert was performed in front of a small audience in a cozy setting , and we felt every bit a part of that audience . If you 're a John Denver fan , I do n't believe you can go wrong with this excellent DVD . As it says on the package : the video is crystal-clear , as is the CD quality sound . My only regret is that he is no longer with us .	1
My wife loves this DVD of John 's greatest hits . Very well done recording with some of his best tunes ! Great musicianship as well .	1
If you are a John Denver fan or a fan of acoustic singer/songwriters , then you will love this DVD . I know many people consider John Denver & # 65533 ; cheesy & # 65533 ; but I 've always loved his music . To me , he is able to bring emotion to his written words better than any other singer/songwriter . Most performers really struggle after the heat of their career flames out . Having read Denver 's biography , he did have those problems that may have led to some of his DUI charges.But when John Denver hit the stage , he always gave a great performance because he really connected with the audience and it showed . And since this concert was for the Wildlife charity , his performance was close to his heart with personal testimony between some of the songs that drew John to tears.The stage presence and set-up was excellent and the DVD includes the audience participation by the mostly middle-aged fans . For novice guitar players like myself there is plenty of film of John and the lead guitarist to help discover the magic of how he gets beautiful sound from his instrument . While all his old standards are here , there is plenty of off-the-beaten path material if you have n't watched Denver in concert . My particular favorite is the song written about the Alaska couple that dance after her husband 's death . Denver had a unique ability to project great imagery.Most of his songs that deal with wilderness and the west are here which leaves out two of my favorites , his ode to the astronauts of the Columbia tragedy and his anti-war song with the Russian singer . With that aside , this DVD will always be a great memory of John Denver 's career and his passion for the outdoors . I strongly recommend this DVD if you like singer/songwriters of the 70s era .	1
Wish I could have seen him when he was alive in person . This is a really good concert to substitute .	1
I Love this DVD Concert , Lots of great songs , some I had NOT heard of before . Audio in 5.1 is quite good BUT would have liked it in DDS coding just that much more , none the less quite enjoyable . Clear crisp great to watch and here on my 56 '' DLP Projection TV & my Bose Life Stiles 35s Home theather system ! If you are a fan of John , THIS IS A MUST HAVE ! Bill M PS See my Video review of the concert DVD as well as several others on You Tub . Put MrWm2800 in the you tub Search box to bring up this as well as several other DVD concerts !	1
THESE TAPES ARE THE ONLY REASON I KEEP MY VCR ! DEMAND ITS RELEASE ON DVD !	1
I liked the music video tape more than the convert footage , but I enjoyed both of them still . The Music videos I was impressed by the cinimatography of the music videos in general . Be warned though , there is some real graphic stuff on this tape .	1
Honestly , I expected much better out of an NIN video . Closure is good , but it has its flaws . My first qualm would be the concert footage . Some of it is down right ugly , and they could 've chosen better songs to play for it . Do n't get me wrong , I love all NIN songs , but some of the ones they chose to record for this video ( The Only Time , Piggy ) are n't the best live songs.The backstage footage is n't all that great . Trent Reznor is the real highlight here , but other than him it 's just really uninteresting . Lots of the stuff contained was unnecessary.The second tape really holds up Closure . It contains all of the NIN music videos up until The Fragile ( excluding Burn ) . Yes , even The Perfect Drug . All the videos are uncut and unedited , including Happiness In Slavery . But one question ... where 's The Broken Movie ? All in all , worth the money if , A ) You are a hardcore Nine Inch Nails fan like myself , or B ) just for the collection of music videos . Although by this review it sounds like I hate Closure , I actually like it very much . But expectation is the key to disappointment .	1
a personal look at what went on backstage at NIN 's self-destruct tour . although not as huge a NIN fan as I once was , I 've probably watched this set at least a hundred times , and I continue to watch it on occaission just because it truly captures the band at their best . the live performances are so perfectly sloppy and intense ... the shabby film quality in parts fits the music and the images so well it is hard to desribe . the whole thing just seems so natural . the second video featuring the actual music videos for NIN 's songs are wonderful as well , in particular , the video for GAVE UP . this video , which simply depicts the band plus marilyn manson recording the song in the studio , is my favorite for some reason . maybe just because it humanizes the artists and shows where the music actually comes from .	1
NIN MUST HAVE : inside you will find two videos , unlabeled . one is the entire music video list ( with the exception of ones made in the last five years ) and the other simply footage . actually there is nothing simple about it and i have heard it called vulgar before . However I do not agree . It is full of on stage , behind the scenes footage that is to die for . Definitely a must for all NIN fans , and a great , really , introduction to the guys . My favorite piece of NIN paraphilia next to And all that could have been the vid and , in the same edition , the 2 cds- and all that could have been .	1
I was n't very impressed with the first video . It showed NIN on the road during their Self Destruct tour , but Trent Reznor did n't open up enough . Contained in it was footage from their performances , fans , and behinds the scenes looks at the band in preperation for their shows . I was pleased with some of the performances.The second video contains all of NIN 's videos up until The Fragile ( excluding Burn ) . I was dissapointed to find out that The Broken Movie was n't contained . Yes , it is extremely graphic , but without it the video is imcomplete , because The Broken Movie was the defining production by Trent Reznor around the 92-94 era when Broken came out . Without it , the videos do n't tie in very well and do n't move along as seamlessly . But still , all the videos are great , and the uncut versions of Down In It , Happiness In Slavery , and Closer are all here.All in all , this is a video that all Nine Inch Nails fans should own . It is somewhat incomplete , but it does give a good look at the band 's performances , music videos , and other goodies . Trent Reznor never fails to entertain me either . The only thing preventing this video from receiving 5 stars is the glaring absence of The Broken Movie and the slightly dissapointing first video .	1
Before I begin , let me just say that finding this VHS set was borderline impossible . My parents bought it for me as a birthday present from someone who was selling it off amazon for , I think , $ 36 ( not the site but someone who was selling it on the site . Even amazon does n't carry this ! ) . And their money did n't go to waste . I 've been wanting this set for a while so the though that I was getting it in the first place thrilled me.Closure video 1 is a collection of all of their videos up to the point this was released , including some bonus live material that was Eraser , another version of Wish , and Hurt without David Bowie . The way the whole thing is put together is pretty cool . The best part is that none of the videos are censored , either . The second VHS is a short documentary of NIN 's '94-'98 Self-Destruct tour . The concert footage is Pinion , Terrible Lie , Piggy , Down In It , March of the Pigs , The Only Time , Wish , Hurt , and Something I Can Never Have . In between each song there is backstage footage and some short clips of them playing at Woodstock '95 and other venues . A lot of it is pretty funny , especially the part where Trent , Robin , Charlie , Jerome , Danny , and some of their crew and friends are seeing who can knock a cord phone ( not sure if that 's what it is but I do n't know what else it could be ) off a cord it 's hanging by ( Trent wins ) . Like And All That Could Have Been and Beside You In Time , the footage is taken from various concerts ( especially on this one , since it 's all taken from '94 to '98 ) . The concert is great , as Trent shows off how maniacal of a showman he was back in his youthful days : trashing instruments , throwing his bandmates everywhere and sending them to the ER , etc . The songs are also played perfectly , with virtually no errors.Now , in all fairness , it definitely has its share of flaws . The footage is grainy , sometime REALLY grainy , especially on Piggy , Hurt ( with David Bowie ) , and on interview with Trent talking about his Woodstock performance . The rest is better , but not by a whole lot . Also , on And All That Could Have Been and Beside You In Time , the quick outfit changes are obvious , as they are on this one , but unlike the aforementioned DVDs , on Closure , sometimes the transition between scenes gets kind of awkward . For example , on Down In It , when the scene changes from Trent to Danny singing `` Rain rain go away , come again some other day , '' it cuts into `` Come again some other day '' with a noticeable switch in the notes everyone is playing . This seems like a very foolish mistake if you ask me . Lastly , I wish there could have been more than 8 live songs ( 11 if you include Eraser , Wish and Hurt on the second video , even though the last 2 are already included on the concert part ) . I mean , there just could have been so much more ... .Nonetheless , Closure is an great video set , and no NIN collection is complete without it . It falls just a little short of perfectly documenting the Self Destruct Tour , which is why I had to dock off 1 star , but that 's still only a minor flaw . And as for the DVD version of Closure that Trent made of this . Do n't bother waiting around for it . There are too many legal problems with his former manager ( who , if you ask me , is just pissed that Trent beat him in court after he selfishly kept millions of dollars that rightfully belonged to Trent ) , so it wo n't happen . However , you can find most of the bonus material that was on the aforementioned unreleased DVD on Youtube , including the infamous Broken movie ( a disgusting masterpiece , by the way ) .So , yeah , just buy this and do n't wait a second more for its release on DVD , which will never happen .	1
all of you people who are saying that & quot ; closure & quot ; is very graphic then i guess you have n't seen nin 's & quot ; The Broken Movie & quot ; now that is graphic ! but still this video is awesome	1
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT VHS/DVD ! DEFINITELY BUY IT ! YOU 'LL BE SO GLAD YOU DID ! MANSON 'S THE BEST PERFORMER OUT OF ANYBODY , AND HE GIVES THE BEST CONCERTS OUT OF ANYBODY ! MANSON 'S TRULY THE MAN ! SOME SONGS HE DOES FIRE.SOME SONGS HE WALKS ON HIS HIGH STILTS.HE DOES DIFFERENT THINGS ALL THE TIME.HIS CONCERTS ARE NEVER BORING.HE 'S ALWAYS EXCITING.THERE 'S SOMETHING ABOUT MANSON WHEN HE MOVES , AND DANCES.THIS VHS/DVD ALSO SHOWS SOME OF WHAT GOES ON BEFORE AND AFTER HIS CONCERTS.HE ALSO TALKS ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS .	1
I was shocked when I was the opening scene for this tape . I was only fifteen when I first viewed this tape . The drugs , nudity and disturbing images were pretty cool to me then , and are even more intresting now than ever . I give this one four stars because most of the concert is recorded with an open mic thus making the sound a B+ for quality . Here you get ten live songs and back stage footage . Get this if you have n't seen Manson live that 's all I have to say .	1
When i was younger , the tour on this tape came to the civic center in my city , and that was the first i had heard of manson . I did not go ( it sold out pretty quickly ) , now after watching this video , i am mad for not going ! The video starts out with protestors and then cuts to the concert footage with & quot ; Angel with the scabbed wings & quot ; , then it has backstage footage , and more concerts , and so on . He does amazing on stage , he sounds good , and is not afraid to go to the extremes . If you are easily offended , this video is DEFFINETLY NOT FOR YOU ! ! ! But , if you are like me , and love both marilyn manson and shock factor , then you must get this tape . I have watched this tape almost more than i have listened to the cds . I am addicted , and i am loving it ! ! YOU MUST BUY IT NOW ! ! ! !	1

So many negative reviews seem to only pretend to know much about ambient music , and it 's really sad because this is an excellent collection of ambient/drone/noise compositions . I personally am an enthusiast of experimental/non-conventional music , and am perhaps one of the biggest fans of Metal Machine Music around , so when I first learned of this release I jumped at it ; mind you that I did n't simply say to myself 'Lou Reed does ambient music ? I already love it ! ' or something similar and equally pretentious ; actually , I heard Wind Coda on Reed 's myspace page a few years back ( decades past in terms of social networking ) and I really liked it.The big point in defense of the noisy equivalent , MMM ( it even looks menacing when abbreviated ! ) , or any ambient/noise record , is you have to listen and appreciate the subtleties , the quiet moments that bring about the atmosphere or change it somehow , the warming or cooling of the tone , or your ear suddenly picking up on a sound that had always been there ; these are all things I listen to and look forward to every time I pop on a record of this sort , just the same as with MMM , or really any other Lou Reed album ( because he has profound subtleties , whether he lets you in on them or not ) .To name , for example of ambient music gone bad , the latest David Lynch album ( yes , the mastermind behind Eraserhead ) , called Polish Night Music , is a totally bland 'finger holding a note on a keyboard while another randomly pokes at the keys of a piano ' that goes on for an hour , it 's really , really awful : no subtleties , the contrast between piano and ambient tones are irrelevant and often conflicting enough to be painful , and virtually the same thing the entire way through . This album however has two very lengthy compositions filled with quiet electronic wisps and howls , but changes gradually , almost evolving as an organic thing . The other two tracks , much shorter , are slightly less 'involving ' in way of meditation but are equally relaxing.The last thing I would like to point out is my terrible problems of insomnia ; one reason I enjoy ambient music is that it helps my mind at ease as I try to sleep . This album does just that , I can enjoy while reading , walking , etc , or use it as a functional tool . As a piece of plastic , it does more for me than others can.And now , really the final thing is this : this is not The Velvet Underground , Transformer , Rock N Roll Animal , etc . It simply is n't meant for that specific -- or rather the Lou Reed -- audience . I luckily can enjoy Lou Reed and this in equal shares , but it most likely wo n't be for the vast majority of Lou Reed fans . I think a good test to see if you like this is ask yourself how many times you 've willingly listened to the entirety of 'Like A Possum ' .	1
The Blondie fan pack is great for any fan of the band , new or old . I 've liked their music since I was 4 and my mom bought The Tide is High single for me ( on 45 ) . I have all the albums and some compilations , but I do n't collect everything on them . However I really enjoyed this package . It contains 6 pins with vintage images , postcards , a poster , a big magazine , and of course the new album ( including two bonus tracks ) .The magazine has lots of info , pictures , track by track comments on the new album , and reviews on all their albums which is fun to read . I have n't finished looking through it yet . The button pins are retro and fun.The album is very good . It 's got a variety of styles from rock , synth , pop , Latin , reggae . I think the weakest songs are Words in My Mouth and Le Bleu . They may take time to grow on me . But the rest of the album is good all the way through on the first listen . The bonus tracks are actually more enjoyable than those two tracks , imo . Especially Horizontal Twist . My favorites are What I Heard , The End of the End , Girlie Girlie , and Love Does n't Frighten Me , all excellent , very catchy songs . Hopefully What I Heard will be released as a single . It 's got an 80s new wave sound that I love . I 've listened to the live versions many times . The other songs are good too but these four stood out most to me so far . I think the album is strongest in it 's first half . Horizontal Twist probably would 've worked on the standard edition of the cd rather than just a bonus , because the album really picks up again when that one comes on . Debbie 's voice is as strong as ever . She sounds very youthful especially on songs such as opening track D-Day and the other faster & upbeat songs.I think the album will grow on me even more as I play it . But I really am enjoying it after just a couple listens so far . I bought mine when it was on sale on Amazon UK , which was cheaper than the import here . ( With shipping , it came to about 23 dollars . ) If you like Blondie , new wave , 80s rock/pop -- you 'll find something to like here . Fans will especially love this deluxe package , of course . Recommended . **I want to add to my review that Sunday Smile is another favorite-it has shades of The Tide is High in the horn sound . Bonus track Mirame is also becoming a favorite .	1
Blondie remain classic as well as fresh with this new little masterpiece.Standout tracks : D'dayWhat I heard ( should be the first single ) Love does n't frighten meMotherSunday SmileHorizontal TwistThe fan pack is so worth the expensive price . Filled with new interviews as well as reviews on all the Blondie catalogue as well as reviews on all the Debbie solo work . Loads of cool photos too . The guys get an A++++ on delivering such an incredible package .	1
The criticisms of Chickenfoot 's self-titled debut ( including shallow , half-baked lyrics and a lack of depth ) can not be said of Chickenfoot III . Better songwriting , a good deal more depth both musically and sonically , plenty of late-1960s/early-1970s classic rock vibe , and slicker production make for one hell of an album , and this sophomore effort marks a definite and big step forward.The highlights : Last Temptation , the opener , is hard , bluesy , and chunky , with a good dose of attitude and a guitar solo that comes out of nowhere . Satriani must have been thinking Hendrix when he wrote the music for Up Next , a dark , thumping song with one hell of a guitar solo . Lighten Up is even darker , and might be seen as Chickenfoot plus Deep Purple ; it has a killer hook and a killer vibe . This is a big damn song with a lot going on . Big Foot , on the other hand , is a straight-up , no-BS driving tune with some funny lyrics . Dubai Blues : Sweet groove with a sweet , bluesy , dirty hook and excellent back-and-forth between the vocals and Satriani , who provides a couple of solos that are among his best . There are three songs that tilt toward the lighter side ; Different Devil , Come Closer ( a great , soulful track ) , and Something Gone Wrong show Chickenfoot 's deeper side . The album closes by kicking things back up , with a hidden track called No Change -- push past the political lyrics , and you 'll find a killer song with a killer vibe that showcases everyone in the band giving 110 % . And that 's the essence of Chickenfoot III : Sammy Hagar , Joe Satriani , Mike Anthony , and Chad Smith all have had amazing careers full of amazing moments . Here , the band sounds as tight as any other band in peak form . Chickenfoot III will stand as one of the best things any of them has ever done.I will say it again : This is one hell of an album .	1
An amazing album . Actually better than the first album . The band has really jelled together and the music is tight .	1
This CD is great.When Chickenfoot arrived in 2009 with the excellent dayview cd and the `` Get Your Buzz On Live '' DVD/Blu-ray , they got noticed by rock music fans.The question with all sophomore CDs is will it be equal or better than the first ? While I am not ready to say it due to the limited plays so far ( the first was on my car on heavy rotation for a long , long time ) , this new CD sounds promising . It is growing on me with each play.Standout tracks are Lighten Up , Alright Alright , Dubai Blues , Come Closer , Different Devil , Up Next , Three and a Half Letters , Something Going Wrong and the excellent hidden track No Change . The rest are also great , so bottomline , this is a CD to be heard from start to finish.As attested by the excellent Get Your Buzz On Live , Chickenfoot is a band best served live , as their musical prowess comes forward tenfold , so I will be eagerly waiting for the new tour starting out this november and any subsequent Live DVD/Blu-ray.Extremely recommended .	1
I never understood the praise that Chickenfoots first album got . With the exception of a few songs ( Down the Drain is just a great tune ) most of the songs were about as original as dirt . I mean `` Oh Yeah ! '' is about as poorly written a song as you could get . I probably gave that disc a total of 7 to 8 spins and never went back to it . I wanted to like it but just could not . I think you can tell that these guys got together and took about a two days to write these things.So when it was announced that III was on the way I did not get all that excited . Then I heard Bigfoot . Pretty great riff in a pretty good song . But still one song does not an album make ... ... or break for that matter . I then heard bits of other tunes and thought that the album had a chance to at least be better then the first . Of course that 's not saying much but it was a start.I got the album on release day and gave it a spin . Pretty good . Better then the first to say for sure . I then gave it another listen . I thought 'Yeah I like this album . It 's got some good and some skippers but it 's good overall '' Then I gave it a third spin and fell in love.What a great album . It is full a great grooves , catchy choruses , great guitar solos and Michael Anthony 's backing vocals ( oh those wonderful volcals . This is by far Sammy and Michaels best work together since OU812 and by far Joe 's most fun album.1 . Last Temtation - this is one of those tunes that takes a bit but once it hooks you it sticks . Great chorus and a great tune to start off the album - Much better then `` Avenida Revolution '' from the first album.2 . Alright - First listen I thought this was going to be the albums `` oh Yeah '' tune with a repetative silly dated chorus . Well it 's not . It 's a fun song not to be taken to seriously . Mike 's backing vocals help lift this song to a higher plain then just some ol regular throw away track . Great tune.3 . Different Devil - Probably my least fav track but it 's not bad . Just not up to the standards of the rest of the tunes . It 's a slower song and Mike 's backing vocals are great . It sounds the most like some of Sammy 's solo stuff.4 . Up Next - This was another track that i did not love at first but now i find it to be one of the albums best tracks . Such a great bridge with Michaels vocals and a great grove by Satch . Good stuff here.5 . Lighten Up - I really thought this would be my least fav song but I actually enjoy it now after repeat listens . I thought the chorus was dull but each chorus builds a little more and makes this song a keeper.6 . Come Closer - This might be my fav song and I never pick slow songs . I usually skip them . But this is a great GREAT tune . Sammy 's vocals , Micheals harmonies in the bridge , Satch 's guitar plaing in the chorus all make foer an all time classic . Great tune . I love it ! 7 . Three And A Half Letters - Right off the bat this tune opens with Athony 's great harmonies so thats a plus . Sammy just talks the verses but belts out the chorus and helps this song stand out . Not a great tune but not a skipper.8 . Bigfoot - Great grove - Nuff said9 . Dubal Blues - Another great tune that I did not care for on first spin but love now . This is a Great tune . Again Michaels backing vocals bring this song to another level . Great riffs and solos in this tune also . love it ! ! 10 . Something Gone Wrong - A slower tune to end the album . It 's good but does not stand out . It 's the only tune I ca n't remember at any given time.11 . untitled track - This is really how to end an album . A great song and probably the heaviest on the album.Now with all the praise I gave this album you may say , `` Why only 4 stars '' well I like to wait and give 5 stars to all time classic albums . albums that have stayed great through the years . This album has a chance . Get back to me in 10 years .	1
Sammy Hagar 's been entertaining me since his & # 34 ; Bad Motor Scooter & # 34 ; days with Ronnie Montrose . Here he joins again with friends Joe Satriani , Michael Anthony and Chad Smith to produce a very current record . As a longtime fan , I 'm not about to say I turned it up to ear-bleeding levels . But I could . The tunes rock consistently , and there are n't any flat spots . The music created by these veterans shows that they are truly monsters of rock and roll . And they 're creative . Still . Master craftsmen .	1
I love Chickenfoot . Since their inception I 've been a fan . The first album was a great rock album , but with III they Foot has hit a home run ! It totally rocks ! What I really noticed about this album was how much tighter of a band these guys have become . They 've gotten to know each other and they 've really stepped it up lyrically and musically from the last album . Not saying the first was n't amazing but III shows a greater unity.So , why should you buy this album ? First , how can you go wrong with the awesome vocals of Sammy Hagar , the brilliant guitar work of Joe Satriani , the thumping bass of Michael Anthony , and the hard-hitting drumbeats of Chad Smith ? You ca n't , pure and simple ! The second reason ? The great musicianship and songwriting abilities of Sammy , Joe , Mike , and Chad . These guys are masters of their craft . The vocals are perfect , with Michael Anthony 's backing vocals brought out more . Joe has written some great guitar parts and Chad and Mike have done wonders with the rhythm section . The lyrical content of this album has taken a more somber tone , especially on tracks like `` Different Devil '' and `` Three and a Half Letters . '' The latter is an awesome song , although I was skeptical at first when I 'd first learned about it . But , it works and it is terrific ! You 'll know what I 'm talking about when you give it a listen.When Sammy came out saying that the second album would be called III , I thought he was jumping the gun . I thought that maybe he was being a little egotistical ( he was ) . But rightly so because III is worthy of its title ! This album will rock you from top to bottom ! Some of my stand out tracks are : `` Alright , Alright '' -- a rockin ' song with a great chorus , you will catch yourself air guitaring and air drumming ! `` Different Devil '' -- A slower track , but the lyrics are awesome and so are the instrumentals . `` Big Foot '' -- If you 've heard this first single and were n't sold instantly , you need to take a listen again . It 's a great song ! `` Three and a Half Letters '' -- It 's a different kind of song , with mostly spoken word but it 's VERY powerful . `` Something Gone Wrong '' -- One of the best tracks on this album , it has a really interesting feel at the beginning ! I honestly think anyone would be crazy not to give this album a listen . I love that these classic artists are still around . As a 19 year old I missed all of these guys ' heydays but I 'm glad I have the opportunity to hear new music from these old artists ! With their first album in 2009 to this one , I hope these guys stay around as Chickenfoot for a LONG time ! While you 're in a CD buying mood , you should also check out Sebastian Bach 's `` Kicking & Screaming , '' the Red Hot Chili Peppers ' ( of which Chickenfoot drummer Chad Smith is drummer ) '' I 'm With You , '' and Night Ranger 's `` Somewhere in California . '' Keep the faith my friends and happy listening !	1
This album is solid . You kinda of know what to expect , but it 's still a good time . Van Halen is still much better .	1
This is Real `` Rock and Roll '' at it 's best . Sammy and Mike 's vocals are better than ever and Joe 's guitar playing will blow your mind .	1
Just when you thought that ` album rock ' was dead four of the baddest mothers on the planet get together and made a rip your heart out rock n ' roll album . The songwriting , the playing - hell , there are three musicians here who are considered among the best on their instrument of all time - production and recording and , maybe more than anything a feeling of a band , jelled , tight , and in in psychic communication with each other . this might just be the best album any of these guys ever played on.A super-group to be sure , but perhaps never before in rock history has a super group been such a cohesive unit . These guys had a huge hit album in 2009 which hit the charts at number three and almost immediately went gold . It contained ( if just barely ) the high-octane hook laden singles `` Oh Yeah '' , `` Sexy Little Thing '' and `` My Kinda Girl '' . from there they embarked on a string of live shows that ended a year later . They proved with that one album that a super group could do more than show case four super star , virtuosos.During that whirlwind tour , as Hagar put it , `` We went from being a weekend fun-time thing to making a record and touring the world . Our learning curve was fast - even for us ... .We earned everything we got , and along the way , we established a trust in one another that happens rarely in bands . `` So , Chickenfoot set out to make a high minded heart pounding follow up , they did it right . They challenged each other to be even better , and that is exactly what they accomplished . There 's a cohesiveness on this album that demands that it be listened to in its entirety . Do n't get me wrong , there are plenty of tunes that will no doubt be radio favorites , make great singles , but to really appreciate it , listen to it all the way through.There is bluesy , ballsy stadium rock , there is earth quaking , riff driven monstrous rock anthems , there are bone crushers , but with a spiritual undertone , there 's also biting sarcasm and social commentary.theere 's Joe Satriani at his shredding best , there is Michael Anthony at his lowdown best and Chad Smith everywhere he should be and there is Sammy Hagar , singing in ways I am not sure I ever heard him sing.There are great rock ballads , country dipped pop , and straight ahead classic rock.Most of all , this is album rock that will take a long time to get old .	1
Instead of hitting the dreaded sophomore slump , Chickenfoot decided to go ahead and name their 2nd album III . As with the first album Chickenfoot III is exactly what you would expect from a band that features Sammy Hagar , Joe Satriani , Chad Smith and Mike Anthony . No holds barred classic party rock with the occasional more serious lyric thrown in for good measure . Hagar 's voice is still amazing at his advanced age and Satriani can still shred with the best of them . Mike Anthony 's background vocals along with Satriani 's pyrotechnics make many of these tracks sound very similar to Hagar era Van Halen . Overall I think the songwriting on this one is quite a bit better than their debut . Highlights include , `` Up Next '' , `` Three And A Half Letters '' , `` Big Foot '' , and `` Dubai Blues '' . Some of Sammy 's lyrics are actually rather cleaver , and thought a bit beyond his his usual good time Hagar party songs . If you liked the first album I would think you would like this one . If you did not like the first one , you might want to give this a chance as it is a rather significant improvement .	1
What a great album ! Sammy is 65 and still sounds amazing ! I did n't think they could top the first album , but I think they did with this one . Favorite tunes are Last Temptation , Lighten Up , Big Foot , and Somethings Goin Wrong . Got to seem them live in May in Minnesota and it was a great show , they sounded extremely solid . Go buy the album ! It will make you very happy ... .	1
love slash and this cd does n't disappoint . One great riff after another . very pleased with this purchase . I give it a B+	1
I 'm surprised at how many negative reviews there are here ... they are more than welcome , of course , since everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion , but this album sounds so killer that I was sure it would receive more universal acclaim . Well , to me it 's an absolute stunner ! `` All killer , no filler '' ... that phrase can be applied to this album more than any new album I 've bought in some time ! While offering some variety in musical styles here ... songs with a touch of punk , some with a touch of melodic pop metal ... ALL with a basis in good ol ' hard rock ... this album is a musically cohesive and well produced body of work , and I daresay is Slash 's best effort since GNR 's Appetite for Destruction ! ! The songs here sound fresh and new without ripping off other songs , yet retain that hard rock edge of GNR . Slash dishes out plenty of incendiary solos , and Myles Kennedy has REALLY come into his own as Slash 's vocalist ! What a range that guy has ... I am NOT missing Axl at all here ! Some say Slash just is n't Slash without Axl , but Myles is his own man , and fits into Slash 's music as well as Axl did , IMO . I really liked Slash 's last CD , and while having all the guest vocalists on that one was an interesting move , I thought the cohesiveness suffered a bit as a result . Needless to say , for me Apocalyptic Love is a little better than his last album , and that 's saying something ! And not just because it 's more cohesive , it 's the songs themselves ! The songs on this CD are so good , I thought , `` OK , what outside writers did Slash utilize for his material here ? '' I looked on the CD notes , and nope , NONE ... all written by Slash and Myles , with the partial exception of one tune contributed to by the producer Eric Valentine , who btw did a GREAT job of producing and mixing this album ! Amazing ... Slash and Myles just knocked it out of the park here ! ! I know I sound like a fan boy here , but I have listened to this CD multiple times to make sure it really is as good as I thought it was after the first listen -- lol . As far as I 'm concerned , this is the album that picks up where Appetite left off ! Anyone who thinks Slash 's creative juices dried up long ago is sorely mistaken ! INDISPENSABLE for all Slash , Velvet Revolver , and GNR fans ! ! !	1
This review has been way overdue on my part - finally at 34000 ft from London to LA I am able to put this out.If anyone remotely knows my musical tastes of recent , you know I have been repeatedly listening to heavy metal stuff for the past 24 months . Life happens I suppose and manifestations of newer tastes takes over the human condition- musical tastes too move onwards.I have picked up slash 's solo albums since the snake pit and of course the velvet revolver fiasco . In my circles a heated debate always brews about the best guitarist etc . I am sure any avid rock listener has experienced this - clapton , van hailen , Stevie ray v , Steve via , the edge , page and countless others lead the debates.This much I do recall at one point in one of these `` rock '' brothel debates someone uttered : slash is not in this group ! He is a best sidelines at best ! Of course I was appalled and got into a fiery fist of words on this ! I am not looking for street crud either . While listening to all his albums since GNR I noticed something amazing with Slash . He really carries himself in that `` guitarist mentality '' mantra and thrives at it ! The proof is in the rock n roll pudding ! I want anyone to nominate anyone else besides Sir Clapton forward whom successfully had immersed himself with other Grade A artists and made amazing projects ! ! ! Slash brings a certain style of humility and creativity all in one . I absolutely see his work as being a collective of many directions . Yet again I must emphasize the basic core from which he has grown : he gracefully has written `` his '' material and went to all the artists and not the other way around . That takes humility and a certain fineness to showcase when playing with Ozzy or Lemmy and the countless others ! And the best part is when he plays `` his '' material alongside with these artists , you can still hear remnants of the guest artist in Slash 's guitar playing ! If thats not artistic growth then I do n't know what is ! But enough goofing off and let me congratulate him on his latest project with Sir Kennedy ! In one word from my ears : MOTHER-Effen remarkable ! Sound - I am not sure what the boys are cooking behind the mixing board but this stuff on Mp3 and Cd just sounds in-freaking believable -- KUDOS on soundSongs - each song written on this album with the solid collaboration with a `` hand '' picked band is just riveting and heartfeltSolo style - can one spell SOLO without Slash ! He and the guys I guess on the album gave him the space to have that `` slash edge '' even in between verses and strange places - simply hair raising and ear popping guitar blissAlbum art - I am like a kid again with this art ! I want giant posters of it everywhere in my life - car walls iPhones and iPads -- best ever album cover I truly enjoyed immersing in ! Creative freedomThis part is my favorite - so he goes all out on this album ! It just sounds like he brought it all around without ever really looking back at anything he has done previously ! ! Total Slash+Guitar+band mates+full throttle creativity ! This album has just been non stop pumping for me on all levels ! Bravo chaps ! ! ! Bravoooooooo !	1
Slash has somehow managed to keep it going for over 25 years now . Most people burn out by this point . With his latest band , he yet again steps up to the plate and cranks it out of the park . Apocalyptic Love , You 're a Lie , Standing in the Sun , and We Will Roam are heavy standouts tracks from this album . The other songs are great as well , those are just my personal favorites . With the great Myles Kennedy on vocals , Slash has once again managed to snag one of the best voices in the business . A credit to Myles , his lyrics explode from the first track and he does n't stop until the last track . Not a lot of ballads on this ( one song comes close ) . This is all about explosive energy , incredible guitar attack , and unforgettable solos . Keep it up , oh top-hatted guitar god .	1
I did buy this CD for me boyfriend . He really liked most of the songs on this CD . Then he played some of the songs for a few friends and they wanted the CD also . He told them we bought it on Amazon .	1
On the outlook Slash 's second solo effort ( and the first one under the exhaustive band name Slash Feat . Myles Kennedy & The Conspirators ) Apocalyptic love is in a way much more of a Slash album than the 2010 solo release was , which was more of an experimental album in which Slash was playing with different singers and the result was nothing short of fantastic and ambitious . `` Slash '' was one of my favorite releases of 2010 and I enjoyed it and played it a lot that year ( and since ) . Myles Kennedy sang two songs on Slash 's solo debut and his vocals fitted the songs very well , I was n't aware of him or Alter Bridge before and learned about him through that album . Slash announced a tour which would have Myles Kennedy as the singer , I liked his voice but I found myself wondering if he could sing all of Slash 's previous bands/projects , Guns N'Roses and of course the new album with different singers . The answer is yes , Myles could handle all vocal duties and proved to be a very capable singer ; the 2011 Made In Stoke live album certainly asserts that and more . The self-titled album was interesting because it featured a variety of different singers and more experimentation . Apocalyptic love sees Slash going back towards what is he is known for and thrives on . This one is more raw , back-to-basics and straightforward type of deal with one singer throughout and a more Classic Rock fueled straight ahead Rock N'Roll vibe.The title track kickstarts the album and is more or less what you would expect from Slash ; classic rock styled sound with a nice breakdown not that there 's anything wrong with that , it works quite well and the song itself is great . `` One Last Thrill '' sees Kennedy going for a Johnny Rotten type of rant , fast paced and with the speedy riff it 's one of the faster songs on Apocalyptic Love , something about the punkish-riff and attitude mixed with Myle 's vocal delivery . `` Standing In The Sun '' has a great summer feel to it , it 's slightly on the softer side but it works and ends up as different track with a great `` just chillin ' '' attitude and was one of the highlights for me . `` You 're A Lie '' was a good choice of single , it 's fast , heavy , catchy and the riff is terrific ; the track is explosive and is in your face , only praises for this one . `` No More Hero '' has a fantastic guitar riff that makes me happy just by hearing it ( actually it sound a little like Sweet Child meets 8 but video games music as weird as that may seem ) and a delightful chorus . `` Halo '' is one of my favorites and has teeth and attitude , it 's been praised by many and the praises have been earned . Myles sounds really great on this one . `` We Will Roam '' has a nice chorus going for it and while it does n't stand out is a very good song as well with a neat solo . `` Anastasia '' deserves all the praises it 's been receiving so far , without a doubt one of the highlight of AL and it starts out with classical with a touch of flamenco flavored guitar building towards another terrific riff and ends up being the great epic of the album at 8 minutes . `` This Life '' is more of a solitude song and it works very well at that . I liked the `` devil and me '' kind of lyrics here , a tip to the hat of some great blues guitarist . The rest of the album is not bad either , please believe.The deluxe edition digipack has extra songs . In my opinion `` Crazy Life '' should have been included on the album to begin with , it 's at least as good the rest and one my favorite songs overall . There 's also a DVD that 's a making of which offers a pretty cool behind the scenes look . It 's a great view of the creating process for fans , it 's not `` essential '' shall I say but hardcore fans will find this interesting and it 's fantastic to see them tune up and work those songs and see them fool around and play . There 's also a code for a free Slash Apocalyptic Love T-Shirt ( the shirt is 24.99 , they ask you to pay for shipping ) .Apocalyptic Love is not an outstanding effort and I ca n't say that it blew me away but it 's a very good effort from Slash , Myles & co and there are some tracks here that I will keep playing for some time I am sure of that . There are 13 tracks on the regular version and while none of them are bad , I have the feeling that had the album been somewhere around three tracks shorter it would have been stronger as it runs a tad overlong , sometimes less is more ( ironic considering I bought the deluxe edition ) . Slash 's backing band is tight and it seems that he found a stable hard working unit in these musicians and it 's apparent that these guys have fun playing together . Slash has a great partner in Myles Kennedy and I 'd like to see them do work some more together . With Apocalyptic Love Slash plays the kind of music he loves to play and it clearly works . 4/5 stars .	1
First things first : spring for the Deluxe Edition . The 2 `` bonus '' tracks are songs that feel like they should be on the regular album anyway , and with them included the album clocks in at 61:27 ( an hour is basically my ideal time a record should last ) . The `` behind the scenes '' DVD ( which has a close up of the angel/demon/guitar cover art on the disc - it looks SWEET ! ) is only about half an hour long , but being a musician myself , I ca n't help but love it . Slash & the guys talk about various aspects of the record and working as a band ( only a few songs are discussed at any length ) , but the best part is watching them play/practice , which is done throughout the 30 or so minutes . While watching Slash play a concert is incredible , watching him rehearse is equally awesome . It just is . The booklet has NO LYRICS , which some people do n't care about , but I 'm a lyricist as well as a guitarist so it does irk me a little . Myles is n't always the easiest singer to try to decipher , ya know ? Also , it comes with a coupon that 's redeemable online for a free T-Shirt ( which , judging by the picture on the coupon , is a white shirt with the album cover on the front in black & white . I personally think it 's cool that it 's not in color , 'cause I 'm sure you 'll be able to buy that anywhere ) , but you will have to pay shipping . I 'm in Cali , so it was about $ 5 . Still a great bonus , especially for the price of the total package . It expires 5/21/2013 , just so you know.Now as for the tunes themselves , it really is Slash 's best work since the original Snakepit . Yeah , better than the last album ( which was too diverse for my tastes , though the guitar work was amazing as usual ) , better than VR , better than Snakepit 2000 . And I do n't mean just guitar work , I mean the songs themselves are better . Bold statement , I know . My favorite is `` Hard & Fast '' , which I 'm actually listening to as I type . Easily the most rockin ' song , it feels like Chuck Berry on speed during a pornstar gangbang while driving 100 mph in traffic . I do n't know how else to describe it . My least favorite , though I do n't hate it by any stretch , is the next track ( which I 'm now listening to as I type ) `` Far And Away '' . The only real ballad on the album , it certainly stands out and is kind of an awkward slowdown from the rest of it . Admittedly , I love the phrasing of the solo , as is the case with basically all these songs . Slash is going out of his way to not only not copy himself too much ( I say `` too much '' because a little here & there is inevitable ) but to raise his own personal bar , and it shows . Great riffs , great solos , great songs . That 's really all you need to know.On a personal note , it 's a shame that Axl bailed on the Rock N ' Roll Hall Of Fame induction ceremony , because now it 's confirmed that there will never , ever be a GN'R reunion , and as I listen to this record ( for the third time now & it just arrived today ) I ca n't help but think that these songs would be so much better coming out of Axl . But it 's probably better to not make the comparison , so forget I said anything.4 1/2 stars . Great Rock N'F'N Roll album & made even better by the timing of it 's release because this feels like an ideal summertime record ! Buy this as soon as you can afford it , and if you do n't love it then do n't claim to love rock n ' roll . Straight up .	1
Wow . I have to honestly say this album ROCKS and that is a really nice thing in a world inundated with Rap and R & B . Not that I have anything against those 2 musical styles ... it 's just that the world ( America especially ) is filled with trendy people who are like rats following the Pied Piper . Whatever is 'in ' at the time is what they like . If a certain artist or sound is 'hot'-they like it . I have never subscribed to this mentality . And thank God Slash has n't either . The same can not be said for his former GNR partner Axl Rose . We gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited for his new 'GNR ' lineup to prove their worth . And we waited . And waited ... finally after OVER a decade , we got 'Chinese Democracy'-WTF ? ? ? Samples , loops , and SUPER over production with ballad after ballad and nary a rocker in sight . Yes-the opening track rocked a bit , but has more in common with punk than the sleazy R & R we were used to with GNR . The only track that stood out for me was 'Better ' . Axl -- you have failed us . If it took you THAT long to write and release the album it should have been TRACK AFTER TRACK of masterpieces ! Now here comes Slash . While he has been with us all along and released some pretty damn decent stuff-THIS is the definitive album by the man . It is by far the most cohesive album in his solo arsenal . It rocks , it rolls , it has all of the elements that made GNR what it WAS . What Slash needed was a steady singer-not a bunch of 'guests ' ... and he chose well . I 'm sure it had much to do with Myles Kennedy showing his stuff on Slash 's last release . In short , 'Apocalyptic Love ' can be considered the GNR album we have waited almost 15 years for . I wo n't go into a track by track description because we 'd be here all day . All I will say is this is hard rocking music at it 's finest with a fantastic vocal performance from Mr. Kennedy . Axl has nothing on this guy ! So if your like me and you long for the GNR of yore and you also were majorly let down by that lame 'Guns & Posers ' album-do n't walk-RUN to the nearest music store and grab this cd ! Or just click that mouse right here and now on Amazon-you wo n't be dissapointed ! Thank you Slash ! ! !	1
This is a great Rush album . All the songs are very good and a few are great ( Seven Cities of Gold , The Garden ) . These guys just do n't run out of ideas . I saw them on tour last year and and they sound great live too !	1
A rich , interesting , strong , and riveting album , `` Clockwork Angels '' has been approaching for a long time now , with its first two songs appearing many months ago , and the crazy-good `` Headlong Flight '' popping up as the true first single . There 's so much here , I 'm grateful for some early exposure . It was a great and welcome marketing move.The songs are all great , from the complex to the downright old school ; it 's a great blend . Geddy sounds great in voice and bass ; Alex is flourishing a wicked guitar with taste and class ; and Neil does everything right , with inventive driving rhythms and decorative percussion mixed in everywhere.What a great album ! Thanks , gentlemen .	1
I had pretty much given up on Rush ever since their Grace Under Pressure album . Though there were a few songs I considered decent ( Big Money and One Little Victory for example ) the rest all seemed like filler music to me . But then Snakes & Arrows came out and I said to myself with much reserved , `` hey , maybe they have found inspiration again '' . It was a pretty good album IMO . But with the arrival of Clockwork Angels I 'm fully convinced that this band is serious about putting out the great music we all know these guys create . Snakes & Arrows was no fluke ! Warning : This work is not for folks who need light Sunday listening music , Nickelback\Foo Fighters generic rock or bubblegum pop . It 's like sitting down to a steak dinner and a heavy dark porter . When you 're done listening you 'll know you 've had one hell of a feast.I give this album a 4 out of 5 only because nobody believes 5 out of 5 reviews even though this is a 5 out of 5 album .	1
Take a minute to think about Rush out of context . They are a trio of old farts that have been peddling largely the same , inaccessible progressive rock/metal sound for thirty-eight-plus years now . So does that make them a band that is fresh out of ideas ? Absolutely not -- you should have known better than to think that ! Somehow , even with band members that are well into their sixties , they still manage to sound fresh and innovative . And their instrumental prowess still manages to blow minds , even if it is n't QUITE as godly as it was when they recorded , say , `` 2112 '' all the way back in the mid-Seventies . Add to this exceptional musicianship a batch of drummer Neil Peart 's most imaginative and inventive lyricism ( his lyrics usually adopt a concerted sci-fi feel ) , and the end result is `` Clockwork Angels , '' the nineteenth ( ! ) studio album of the band 's influential career , and quite possibly their best effort since 1981 's `` Moving Pictures . `` Lead single `` Caravan '' elegantly pins a catchy , bobbing guitar hook against a bed of deft , technical , warbling bass lines and soaring melodic vocals . It also makes room for one especially memorable chorus , too . But if this song is very good , then the next track , `` BU2B , '' is positively great ! It is a huge highlight on account of it being easily `` Clockwork '' 's heaviest song , and also one of the heaviest tunes of Rush 's whole career . It has a weird , proggy intro , sure , but it then storms back with massive , thunderously pounding ( and actually quite crushing ) riffs and funky , slapped bass lines . The next handful of tracks , however , find the band 's rhythm section taking over , with the title cut and `` Carnies '' ( a raucous romp ) adopting an almost Motorhead-worthy , punk-derived bass tone that drives the song forward with more really clever fills and riffs . ( But only the former of these two cuts is also highlighted by some more excellent melodic vocals , tasty , harmonic guitar solo work , and a really proggy , unplugged guitar-break , where the acoustic guitars are heard noodling away endlessly . ) And `` The Anarchist '' is also highlighted by a particularly noteworthy rhythm section , with a bouncy , propulsive drum intro that flows into muscular , bass-driven territory.Frontman Geddy Lee 's exceptional bass work also comes into the spotlight on some later tracks . Take , for example , `` Seven Cities Of Gold , '' because it marries an excellent bass solo ( in its intro ) with memorable electric guitar riffs , a crashing drum beat , and memorable vocal patterns . Some strong , jazzy , stop-start bass lines coarse throughout it , too . Elsewhere , `` Halo Effect , '' a proggy acoustic ballad ( and a fairly brief and compact one at that , as it clocks in at just over the three minute mark ) , `` The Wreckers , '' which features some more colorful acoustic strumming , heavy bass lines , and a really big and memorable , sing-songy chorus , and `` BU2B2 , '' an 87-second long interlude-type track that finds what sounds like a violin accompanying Geddy 's clean , soulful singing , are a few other standouts . But it is `` Headlong Flight '' that takes the cake for being the set 's pinnacle . It is a surprisingly up-tempo and hard-rocking , nearly seven-and-a-half-minute long epic piece that is highlighted by an excellent ( and really deft ) , four-second long drum solo/fill from Neil , and a totally air-guitar-worthy , shredding solo from Alex.Challenging ( both for the band and the listener ) , lengthy ( its total playing time is 66 minutes ) , brilliantly-written ( it almost never adheres to standard verse-chorus-verse structuring ) , and impeccably performed , `` Clockwork Angels '' embodies pretty much everything that progressive music is all about . Therefore , this album just might be the best prog rock/metal release of the year ( 2012 ) , and it certainly is one heckuva way for a band to begin their fifth decade of existence . Indeed , if this is n't the sound of a band that is aging gracefully , then I do n't know what it is !	1
I got this cd and immediately downloaded to my iPod to preserve the disc . The album works on so many levels it is astounding . To just listen to the songs one is struck by the musicianship that is obvious on this masterpiece . Neil has been pounding those drums live for years but this is the first time I truly can feel like they have somehow captured his playing on a studio disc . If you compare any of the other discs to his live renditions of the same songs you can tell that he adds so much more energy live and he has always said that capturing the real drums sound on disc has been difficult . I feel that this is not the case this time . Peart 's drum work throughout is nothing less of astonishing . The man does not let up at all . Geddy 's voice has never sounded so rich and warm and inviting as he does on this disc . He is truly telling a story and the tonal colors he paints with are gorgeous and lilting . I can feel his anger in the Anarchist , his bewilderment in Carnies and his despair in Halo Effect . Alex Lifeson has reinvented for me what a guitar master can be , it is not just shredding which Alex has proven time and time again , it is using your guitar like a one man orchestra . Lifeson gives me so much to chew on with this disc that it is difficult to swallow on even just one listen . I pre ordered this from over the pond through classic rock magazine and I have been listening to nothing but this disc since Saturday and I believe this is one of those cd 's that will still be revealing its secrets two or three years from now , yes , there is that much music . Now that is just one facet of this recording the recording itself is pristine and crisp . How I wish Nick would re produce Vapor Trails for us ! Another facet and not one to be overlooked or outdone is the story of this cd . It literally took me two hours to sit down with the disc and read the lyrics and the short snippets Neil gives us of the complete story which will soon be revealed when the novel comes out by Kevin Anderson . The story is at times wonderful , scary , glorious and sad . Hmm ... just like life ! Thank you Rush for the greatest cd of your career and I for one can not wait to see what you do with this in the live show . I vote for an evening with Rush with Clockwork Angels in its entirety followed by Signals anniversary in its entirety and end the night with 2112 . If I never hear Tom Sawyer or Closer to the Heart live in concert again it is okay with me . I met you guys in Syracuse on the Time Machine tour with my wife and my brother ( RIP ) and it is a night that will stay with me and closer to my heart now that my brother is gone . I love you guys for doing that for your fans .	1
I became a Rush fan in 1971 . As a drummer myself I can never get enouigh of Neil . Through the years I have watched Rock and Roll go the way of the dinosaurs , leaving only a few real talents . Eventually I became a Rush FREAK . Of the 500 or so songs on my Walkman over 50 are Rush.This newest album was not as good , in my opinion , as earlier ones . I have never really been carried away with the whole concept album concept ( pun intended ) and this album is no exception . Sometimes the songs have a strained quality to them as if they are struggling to write a song which fits the concept rather than just letting the Rock flow.Rush still demonstrates tremendous virtuosity and song writing ability , but they are slowing down and becoming more technical , electronic , ... and mellow ( ? ) . I miss the force of their earlier songs , the hard-driving full-speed-ahead Rush ( pun intended ) of music which grabs you and takes you with it.This is a really good album but I guess we 're all getting old , huh boys.UPDATE : I have now had an opportunity to listen to this album several times , and I got ta say , it really grows on you . Despite attempts to stick with the concept of the album , the songs all stand on their own merit and are unmistakably Rush . They continue to amaze as both musicians and writers . Neil is a great lyrics writer , if he does sometimes wax deep and philosophical . The arrangements are spot on . I 'm not crazy about the orchestral arrangements , I do n't think Rush needs them . One of the amazing things about them has always been how much music could be generated by only three men.That said , I will never fail to buy every new album they produce . And I will never cease to love and respect both the band and the music .	1
I have always liked Rush since I found out about them in 1978 with the release of Hemispheres . A buddy was already listening to them known through his older brother . His brother took us to school one morning and was jamming to hemispheres . I was hooked . Bought the album asap and began buying their other albums as well . Their music has a much different feel for me now days and it seems although the album is still good , it lacks something that the members of Rush had in the earlier days . Not disappointed in the album , it is more or less my taste of music has changed as well because I have not heard a big winner from the last several albums from Rush . I may like a song or two but that will be it . In the past , I usually liked the entire album with maybe one or two songs that I did not like .	1
A very good album . Rush usually delivers , but this one is a step up from usual . This CD is the best next thing to being there live !	1
Clockwork Angels confirms the relevance and talent from the Canadian based trio . I personally have not missed a concert since Moving Pictures and do n't intend on ever letting the hundreds of original tracks out of my music rotation . There are some artists that you just buy the CD . Rush is one of those ! !	1
I have n't liked one of their albums so much since the Signals/Moving Pictures days.A solid peice of work they can be proud of , lets hope it 's not their last .	1
51 year old 'fossil ' RUSH fan here . First saw them live during 'A Farewell To Kings ' tour , and was blown away and 'hooked ' by their masterful sound , and world class approach to rock music . This October will be my 50th live RUSH concert since the 70 's in 4 states ( states of euphoria , ecstacy , intensity , and incredulity ... just kidding ! ) . That said , I wo n't analyze the songs on 'Clockwork Angels ' , as that has already been done here ad nauseum , and besides , this can be subjective based on personal tastes and poetic interpretation . RUSH has always been about quality and musical evolution and change , given their many memorable forays into different sonic styles and elements . 'Clockwork Angels ' is no different . Musicality and song writing is top notch , and CD sonics are above average ( for all you audiophiles out there ) . The songs are excellent , and if I had to pick a standout favorite , it would be 'The Wreckers ' . What a gorgeous , emotive , and introspective tune ! I ca n't get it out of my mind ! THANK YOU Geddy , Alex , and Neil for sharing your immense gift of music all these years , with the rest of the world ! You guys are timeless ! Now , PLEASE play Greece and Israel ( I have cousins there who are HUGE , longtime fans , and would love to see you ) !	1
I 've been pouring over the reviews of Rush albums on Amazon . There is n't a single studio album that has below a 4 star average . There are six 4 1/2 star albums ( 2112 , A Farewell to Kings , Hemispheres , Permanent Waves , Signals , and Clockwork Angels ) and one 5 star rated album ( Moving Pictures ) . I know reviews do n't mean anything but the reviews on Amazon agree with my personal preference when it comes to Rush . The 4 1/2 - 5 star rated albums are absolutely my favorites ( with Counterparts being the only exception to the rule ) .I would honestly propose that Clockwork Angels is the best album since Signals . To me Rush has finally found the perfect balance between what was , what is , and what can be with Clockwork Angels . The musicianship is at an all time high , Lee has finally found a balance between his vocal comfort zone and belting it out like he did in the 70 's , Lifeson is given a chance to shine on several tracks providing some well crafted solos , Peart is as good as ever ( despite his track being just a bit too quiet ) , and most importantly this album feels like Rush . Let me explain that last point a bit.In my opinion Test For Echo , Vapor Trails and Snakes & Arrows did n't really have the same flavor as previous Rush albums . Do n't get me wrong they are still good albums . There were parts that sounded like Rush , however on a whole the albums were off when compared the previous entries . Clockwork Angels , on the other hand , has a feel that is much closer to what Rush sounded like in the 70 's , 80 's and early 90 's . I know this point is very qualitative but there has to be at least one Rush fan out there that understands what I am talking about.So , whats the only thing this album desperately needs ? Extra care during the mixing process . The mixing is good ( tweaking the equalizer to the exact perfect values can help a bit ) but could be better . Put on a decent pair of headphones , sit back and relax , close your eyes and listen to The Camera Eye , Freewill , or Analog Kid ( and many more songs ) and you can easily spot the difference ( I 'm completely inept when it comes to sound quality and even I can tell a difference ) between the the past and the present when it comes to production value . The Wreckers and The Garden were instantly put into my Rush Top 20 songs list but they can sound obnoxious when listening at loud volumes.Rush needs to run with the momentum gained from this album and put more emphasis on production values in order to get an album that is dubbed `` best album since Moving Pictures '' rather than `` best album since Signals '' .	1
FOR MY RUSH IS TREMENDOUS BAND HIS MUSIC , HIS LETTERING ARE THE BEST BAND OF PROGRESSIVE ROCK GOOD CD ... . SIMPLE RUSH : : : : : ! ! ! !	1
2012 's Clockwork Angels is the new concept album from the legendary Canadian band Rush . It is the band 's nineteenth studio album of original material ( twentieth if you count the covers album Feedback ) and follows up their last two albums in bringing out the more Hard Rock/Metal aspects of their sound . It takes Snakes And Arrows ' variety and Vapor Trails ' power and combines them into a very strong album indeed , one that is n't ever dull or plodding . The story that it tells is also available separately as a novel.If you have already heard ` Caravan ' and ` BU2B , ' which were released a full two years earlier than the record was , then you should have some idea of this album 's musical direction already . The songs have since been re-recorded to fit in better with the rest of the album though , so even if you 've played them to death already , you wo n't feel cheated that they are part of the album.Despite concentrating on the band 's heavier side , the album is still very dynamic and varied . Sometimes things will be melodic and sweet , sometimes there are synths and keys in there , sometimes you 'll hear little touches that remind you of Hemispheres and A Farewell To Kings and then of course sometimes you 'll hear more of the direction from Snakes And Arrows ' and Vapor Trails ' heavier moments . The opening to ` Carnies ' even has a big fat riff that could almost fit on a Monster Magnet or Down album.Each song on Clockwork Angels contains a lot of different parts ; you could hear a funk-like break down in one track , an acoustic intro in another , some proggy feedback scrapes in another and straight rock beats in yet another , or you could hear all of that and more within one single track.Highlights include the closing track ` The Garden ' which opens with acoustic guitars and has a grand orchestral feel in places , as well as the amazing single ` Headlong Flight ' , which mixes variety with focused hard rocking ( similar in a way to ` Far Cry ' off the last album but with more parts packed into it ) and the fun track ` The Anarchist ' that really takes off in a neat passage that revolves around tom-rolling.As a general rule , I always find that the best Rush songs are the ones where a lot of time has passed without you knowing it , for example a five-minute track that feels like it is only two-and-a-half minutes long ; and the worst ones were the ones where a lot of time passes without enough ideas used to justify the song lasting as long as it actually does , for example a six-minute track that could have worked a lot better as a three minute song.The best thing about the whole Clockwork Angels album for me personally , is that every song justifies its own length . When this plus is added to the superb musical direction ( I prefer the band 's heavier side personally ) , the superb production and the as-always superb musical and vocal talent on display , it makes for an absolutely captivating record that hits hard on first listen and has a lot more to offer on subsequent spins as well.Then on top of that , you have the interesting steam-punk story to get to grips with across each early listen , which just adds yet further intrigue and replay value . It would be tempting to say that this is almost guaranteed to be loved by any Rush fan , but then you have to consider that their audience is so wide and diverse and their catalogue is so varied that pleasing any one type of fan may cost another type of fan to loose interest.If you are an early-prog or synth-pop fan first , and a Rush fan second however , if you hated Vapor Trails and the heavier parts of Snakes And Arrows and are generally the type of person who hates all Metal , then Clockwork Angels may not be for you . I can see how it may be leaning a little heavily on one aspect of their sound and that maybe that 's the one part of Rush 's style that you do n't personally enjoy . Maybe even the conceptual nature of the record or the variety within each track is n't enough to save it for you , if you simply do n't like Rush when they get all loud and distorted . If this describes you , then my advice would be that maybe you ought to give this one a miss.Otherwise however , this is a pretty essential album and no matter the size of your Rush collection , this should probably be a part of it.In summary ; Clockwork Angels is a strong and fresh album , it is energetic , entertaining and focused , it is heavy rather often and has enough ideas per song to justify each song 's length . It just sounds vital and has enough depth to reward repeat listens . Overall , its a pretty top-notch release and it 's definitely something you should consider getting if you like Rush , especially if you like their heavier side .	1
Let 's be honest , you 're either a fan of Geddy Lee or you ca n't stand his voice . There really is n't any middle ground here . While I love 'Snakes & Arrows ' and think it 's one of their best albums 'Clockwork Angels ' has a lot to live up to . After repeated listens of S & A ; that album just got better and better and even though I 've heard `` Caravan and BU2B '' numerous times and in concert this album will undoubtedly get better and better as I listen to it each time . For now , a five star album and that is n't because I 've listened to Rush since the beginning . This is a great album all around . While some fans want Rush to keep delivering `` Tom Sawyer '' and `` The Spirit of Radio '' the band has learned to evolve with time and age . Geddy Lee , for me , sounds better today than he did in his early years and while it may be that the guys do n't pump out an album every year or two they still deliver when they do . I 'm more than thrilled to hear 66 minutes worth of new music from the band . And while they might not have delivered the epic song on this album combine `` Clockwork Angels '' , `` The Anarchist '' , Carnies '' and `` Halo Effect '' and you just might have your epic song clocking in at 22 minutes . One reviewer ( trash review ) compared Geddy Lee to Elton John as time has marched on . So off the mark that it 's laughable . Has anyone heard Elton John sing lately ? Maybe Geddy Lee has lost his shrieking or the high end but his voice still remains intact and he does n't need a host of back up singers to sing on any of Rush ' songs . Overall , for any Rush fan this is an instant classic . Great job guys and looking forward to seeing you live in the Fall.On a side note to all the `` fans '' who have posted the one star reviews . I must be listening to an entire different album than you . I listened to it again today on earbuds on my iPod and am thoroughly enjoying this album . I just do n't understand what 's not to like on this release . As far as Geddy 's voice , I guess I 'm missing where he 's singing horribly because I just listen to 'Headlong Flight ' and his vocals say it all there , especially near the close . If he could n't sing , he sure could n't do that . But once again , I guess the one star reviewers just want another repeat of 'Tom Sawyer ' or 'Close to the Heart ' or 'The Spirit of Radio ' . Time to get out of the past . If you ca n't , then just listen to those albums over and over and over and over ... ... ... and over again .	1
You have to listen to this album a lot to figure it out . It can be very depressing and sad , but the band is definitely making a statement about the futility of everything . This album really shows Neil Peart 's predisposition to trust in anything religious-like . However , music-wise , I think this album may contain some of RUSH 's best work . It is not a classic rocker like Moving Pictures , but the complexities of this album will keep the listener constantly engaged .	1
Wow , ,just Wow , purchased this CD yesterday , and was blown away from the start , anyone else detect a lil 70s style in a few songs ? as Bu2B and Caravan were already released , every single song after is amazing , and in my opinion , some of the best music Rush has ever recorded , the band is still sounding so awsome , so crisp , and right on the nugget 's , i recommend this to any and all Rush fans , Thank You Rush for an unbelievable CD , heres hoping for more in the future ... .This CD alone should wake up those morons over at Rolling Stone magazine and say Hey ! ! its time for Rush in the Rock and Roll hall of fame , hands down ...	1
Clockwork Angels is Rush 's first full concept album ( 2112 and the like were only side-long concepts ) . This is a very fun album , and well worth picking up . The story is strong , but loose enough that the songs stand on their own . Highlights are Clockwork Angels , The Anarchist , The Wreckers , and especially The Garden . This album is one of their best and gets pretty consistent rotation on my music player , I think you will enjoy it too .	1
This has quickly become one of my favorite Rush albums . I liked it at first , but after a few listens , I 've come to love it ! It is a great concept album that tells a neat story .	1
This is the best Rush album since what Signals maybe ? every track is good and i love the steampunk concept .	1
I HAVE WAITING FOR THIS CD TO COME OUT ..AND THE 5 YEARS WAS WORTH THE WAIT ! ! ! This cd rocks ! ! ! i have been waiting for Rush to go back to their harder music and this cd has done it..Geddys voice is as good as ever..especially on the track Headlong Flight..wow..his range is still great ! ! KEEP ROCKING GUYS..YOUR A 5 STAR WITH ME ! ! ALOHA	1
This album is 100 % Rush-it rocks in the best way possible . Rush just does n't age , they keep getting better and they rarely disappoint , ca n't wait to see them in concert again , because they are AMAZING live . The title track is my fav , and the two tracks that were previously released are also standouts .	1
UPDATEIt 's been well over a year since I wrote this review , and did so against my usual nature ( after one listen ) . But I was in the moment and ran with it.Clockwork Angels is , in fact , one of the finest works by Rush . And I can say the live experience did more than due justice to all these songs , as some simply sounded better live . That should n't happen , but this is , after all , Rush.To my specific gripes from before : * Innovation : The band did innovate . It 's a pretty clear contrast from Snakes and Arrows for sure , but it is tighter and clean , and in time the familiarity has set in so well that I frequently listen to the whole record . I ca n't say that of Snakes and Arrows or Test for Echo 18 months after their respective releases . * Expectations : I had hoped this would be more inspired by their 1970s work -- not a derivative rehash mind you , but real inspiration as found in Headlong Flight and even BU2B.This truly is a cohesive , thoughtful effort . I think having seen it live with almost all the songs performed helped in some subconscious way . The music is rewarding , the story is engaging , and the wholeness of the record is most gratifying.____________________________________________ORIGINAL 3-STAR REVIEW ( after 1 listen ) I 've only given it one listen ( and you know I need at least three ) . So this is not an official review from me yet , hence the three stars.The problem with music is that the genuine artists ( like Rush ) are doing what they really want to do and that does n't always align with what we expect . I know you know that . If we ca n't all get along , then we 'll listen a while and move on -- or move back to the comfort zone of Moving Pictures , 2112 , Permanent Waves , and ( of course ) the death-metal remix of Tai Shan ( or , you know , not ) . Stepping back from the production , I appreciate that they have attacked a theme , gotten behind it and pulled it off fairly well . They have ventured well outside of their musical comfort zone here ( in contrast to say Test For Echo where they really did n't push forward ; it 's a very good record , but more of a melting pot of ideas and virtuosity drawn from the preceding decade or so ) . Snakes and Arrows pushed some boundaries , but it was overproduced and felt a bit restrained - say , in contrast to Vapor Trails which , despite the tragic audio issues , was raw , threw discretion to the wind , and took a lot of chances and prevailed ( Ghost Rider , Peaceable Kingdom , Vapor Trail , Earth Shine , Nocturn , Freeze -- great songs and all atypical Rush : no solos , really , understated bass , layered vocal textures in lieu of synths , and very personal lyrics throughout ) . The songwriting on that record exceeds anything they 've created since Grace Under Pressure ( or maybe as recently as Counterparts , or maybe even further back to Moving Pictures ) . But that 's my opinion ( and I have a review of the record elsewhere on Amazon ) .The other problem for Clockwork Angels was that of too lofty expectations , that this record would be more of a throwback to the Rush of the 70s -- not to double-dip into their legacy per se but to simplify the sound and extend some of the songs a bit more ( and granted , most exceed the traditional 5 to 6 minute mark ) . We get some of that , but we also get a lot of sonic nuances and twists that is fresh versus familiar . Headlong Flight is probably what most of us expected , but we were pleasantly caught off guard by Clockwork Angels ( title track ) and The Garden , among others.The solution is to just look at it for what it is : A very mature , dynamic record that weaves a story with tracks that can stand on their own , produced by musicians who have been touring and tiring and trying and triumphing like , well , clockwork , for decades.In record reviews , some speak to the Rush Fan and some speak to the record buying public . I 'm just speaking so far to what it is : The 20th studio record by Rush . TWENNNN-TYYYY-ETH . My formal review is pending . But my first impression is that it is indeed impressive and worthy of many more listens and reflection.To think Clockwork Angels could become someone 's first experience ever hearing Rush is comforting , simply because there is so much there already that inspires.Even after one listen .	1
There is ALWAYS something familiar about RUSH to Rush fans especially ; but this time it is very familiar ... the idea of a concept album ( that they said they would not do again ) . Geddy 's vocals like them or not , ( more on this in a bit ) Peart 's unmistakable percussion..Alex 's timely guitar playing ... yet ... as familiar as it is `` Clockwork Angels is as fresh as when they began . This is perhaps one of their greatest disks yet ! Firstoff , I need to say , Geddy Lee can sing ! And he sings very well ... on this disk he does exactly what he wants with his voice exactly when he needs to ... .some people do not like the tone quallity of his voice and that 's fine ... whatever ... I do n't like opera , does n't mean Rene Flemming ca n't sing . ( he just compared Geddy Lee to Rene Flemming ! Oh no he did n't ! ! ! ! ) Bottom line is the voice is one of Ged 's instruments and as a musician , you need to have control of your instrument ; WHATEVER that is ... ..and he does ... ..so all the haters can go home ... .or ... in the words of Stephen A . `` Just Stop it '' ! Back to `` Angels '' : The typical RUSH virtuosity is really restrained throughout most of the album . A lot of it occurs in the 1st piece `` Caravan '' which by the way is a remix of the one released last year ; as is BU2B . RUSH fans already know these are both outstanding pieces.So if you bought those last year , in the album you are n't getting the exact same thing ... .although the differences are subtle . Bottom line is they are both great additions to the RUSH repertoire . The title cut follows that and is really what RUSH has always been about ... ..longer pieces that do n't seem long and when they are over you want more ! At this point somethings started to stand out ; 1 ) Although a concept album , it 's still cut up into individual pieces ( which is not unlike RUSH ) but as the entire album is the story , it 's a bit different ( 2112 was one side , so was Hemispheres ) 2 ) the song writing is the main focus , not necessarily the concept ... there are very few musical themes on the album that popup anywhere else ; this to me is one thing I would have liked to have seen , but it takes nothing away . 3 ) Rush is still exploring with sounds and technique ... .the use of virbrato in several songs is an example as they use it more on this album that they have in all of their albums put together.The next 2 pieces could have been on many of RUSH 's previous albums ... . '' Anarchist '' and `` Carnies '' show equal quality of songwriting and again , Rush forgoes vituostic soloing for the sake of the songwriting ; they could have done more ... but they were restraineed ... and it does n't hurt the song one bit ... mostly because everything the do is STILL virtuostic by most standards . Another thing the resist on this album is their tendancy to throw in a midsong solo break in 7/8 or some other odd time signatures . Personally , I did miss that part ! But , again , I do n't think it hurts the compositions at all.In a few places it seemed to make room for David Campbell 's string arrangements which are absolutely brilliant in the way they fit in and put the songs over the top . This also points to perhaps a next direction for RUSH as David Campbell was the arranger of the Sydney Austrailia Symphony Orchestra for the outstanding `` KISSYMPHONY '' concert ... ..How about a RUSH tour or even one off show with and orchestra ? Just a thought ... Anyway , `` Halo Effect '' shows that softer side of RUSH we dont often see but they can be really great at . `` 7 Cities Of Gold '' is again a reminder of Rush at their best with heavy riffs and wailing vocals . The next song starts off with almost 60 's sounding guitar chords and a Keith Moon like beat ... then continues in a very melodic way again with a cathchy melody I could n't stop singing ... .Not what I expected from a song called `` The Wreckers '' '' Headlong Flight '' is again , Rush doing what they do ... or did ... ..it is a VERY familiar tip of the cap towards themselves in the early days ... .you can hear bits of `` Bastille Day '' and `` Working Man '' Listen to this one a high volume ... you 'll thank me later.BU2B2 : is RUSH 's version of a Sgt Pepper Reprise ; but more like the end of 2112 ; it sets you up for a sad ending ... .. '' Life Goes From Bad To Worse '' ... ... but this is RUSH 'now ' ... so right away they follow with ; all the you can do is `` Wish Them Well '' ... this disk could have ended with `` Headlong Flight '' ... .but the RUSH philosophical words of wisdom need to be imparted ... this of course concludes in totally atypical RUSH fashion with the beautiful 'ballad ' `` The Garden '' ... .in which they leave you with the words I hope all of you take to heart ; `` The measure of a life , is a measure of love and respect ; so hard to earn , so easily burned '' ... .hold onto that ! The one constant thing that always amazes me is how they manage to turn a strange melody with atypical words into a singable catchphrase ; much like a chorus ( but calling it that seems to cheapen RUSH ) ... ex . `` Clockwork Angels . spread their arms and sing ; sychronized and graceful , they move like living things '' , or `` A wheel of fate , A Game of Chance '' ... or `` I have stoked the fire of the big steel wheels , steer the airship right across the skies ... .. '' ... Really ... who writes stuff like that AND makes it so you want to know the words so you can sing along ! Only RUSH ! Fantastic piece of work ! BRAVO !	1
This release is modern science looking out for us music lovers . As well , the great friendship thriving among these men have paved my road for a concert trip . I hope they play most of this album on their fall tour . New sounds abound from all three . BRAVO ! ... I should add that the lyrics are poetry and should be read . And for those that refuse , maybe a band-aid box would provide some entertainment , and I mean attainment . Sorry , it just seems that some humans are struggling and I do n't mean to be cynical , I mean to just say ... .WAKE UP ! ! ! ! !	1
Unlike a lot of other Rush fans , I really did not care for Snakes & Arrows . In fact , I thought it was one of the worst albums that the band had released . One of the things that I 've always loved about Rush is that they are able to take incredibly complex musicianship and thoughtful lyrics and write them into a song that still has a great melody and hook . They seemed to have lost that ability on Snakes and Arrows , with the exception of `` Far Cry . '' Honestly , Vapor Trails before it was n't a whole lot better in that department either , and really only about half of Test for Echo was good.I was excited for the new release , as I am with every new Rush album , but based on their recent track record , I was skeptical as well . I was hoping that playing Moving Pictures on their Time Machine tour would inspire newfound creativity in the band that would show up on the new album , much like how revisiting past great albums might have helped inspire Our Lady Peace on their newest release.Admittedly , I will still need some listens with Clockwork Angels to fully appreciate the album , and so far I seem to be enjoying it a bit more with each listen . However , I feel 4 out of 5 stars is a pretty accurate rating for this album . It 's not great , but it is a very solid effort . I think it oversteps the previous three albums that I had mentioned above . Rush definitely seems to have found and channeled new inspiration in writing and recording this album . The individual performances by the band members are the best that they 've been in a long time , and the album as a whole sounds cohesive and inspired.Song by song:1 . Caravan ( 7/10 ) - This song is a very cool opener to the album . Musically , there are a lot of ideas in this song and a lot going on . This is a heavy song with plenty of complex transitions and time signature changes . My complaint with this song is that the melodies are not very strong or memorable . This is a good song , not a great song.2 . BU2B ( 10/10 ) - Great song . This song is heavy and driving . This song is the first proof on this album that Rush can still churn out a memorable hook . When the song comes out of the bridge section and goes into the final chorus , I ca n't help but say `` Yeah ! '' Lyrically , I think this song has the double effect of advancing the story and also being a bit personal to Neil.3 . Clockwork Angels ( 4/10 ) - Musically , this song sounds a lot more like the Rush of the 70s and early 80s . Like Caravan , this song has its share of complexities and interesting transitions . Again , though , the melodies in this song are just not very strong.4 . The Anarchist ( 10/10 ) - This is probably the best mix of Rush 's older sound meeting their newer sound . It 's a heavy , driving song with a great hook and some very cool guitar and bass riffs . There is also an excellent middle-eastern sounding solo from Alex . Like BU2B , this song is just fun to listen to.5 . Carnies ( 3/10 ) - This song starts off with a great guitar riff reminiscent of `` Working Man . '' The problem with this song is that even now that I 've listened to it a few times , I still ca n't tell what part is actually supposed to be the chorus . The hook in this song is incredibly weak , if there is one at all . Musically , though , it is a cool song.6 . Halo Effect ( 6/10 ) - This semi-ballad that features the acoustic guitar in the verses is a breath of fresh air after the heavier , faster , complex songs that dominate the first half of the album . It is a nice , melodic song . It feels like it should lead somewhere else , though , like the song wants to lead you into this great hook that it just does n't do.7 . Seven Cities of Gold ( 7/10 ) - This song finds a cool groove and features some good guitar riffs . This is another fun song to listen to . Geddy proves that he can still belt out the high notes.8 . The Wreckers ( 10/10 ) - Whoa , where did this one come from ? ! This is probably Rush 's most melodic sounding song since `` Nobody 's Hero . '' Dear Roadrunner Records : Release this song as a single.9 . Headlong Flight ( 9/10 ) - This is another song that throws back to Rush 's earlier sound . All around very good song with a good hook and a shredding solo from Alex.10 . BU2B2 ( 5/10 ) - This is more of a transition song that brings reintroduces the theme from the first BU2B track.11 . Wish Them Well ( 7/10 ) - This is a pretty rocking track with a decent hook . Geddy hits some notes in the background toward the end of the song that I did not think he was still capable of hitting.12 . The Garden ( 9/10 ) - This is another left field song . It is a lengthy , melodic ballad to end the album . The final two minutes of this song are entrancing , and a great way to end the album.Ultimately , I doubt that I will regard this album in the same class that classics like Moving Picture , Permanent Waves , or 2112 are in , but this is definitely a very solid album , and a pleasant surprise for someone who was not expecting a whole lot. -- -- -- -- -UPDATE -- -- -- -- -After having allowed this album to sink in for a couple more weeks , I am ready to update my previous review . I stand by my initial reaction to the album of it being about a 4-star album . I could tell that I would most likely enjoy it more with each listen , but really , what is the point of posting a review of this album several weeks after its release ? Rush fans [ like myself ] are going to pick this up in its first week . The album did not jump out to me like it did to some of the reviewers who posted 5-star reviews . I did really like it , but I still saw flaws.Now that the album has sunk in for a couple weeks , I have grown to really love this album . It truly does get better with each listen , and even the areas that I had complained about above do not seem so glaring anymore , especially in the grand scheme of the album as a whole . I am editing this review and changing my rating of 4-stars to 5-stars ( assuming Amazon lets me do that ) .As I stated above , I look for a good mix of complexity and melody in Rush 's music . The prog rock fan in me enjoys the complexity of the songs ; the hard rock fan in me enjoys the heavy songs ; and the general music fan in me looks for a good melody and a catchy hook . One of Rush 's biggest problems over the last couple of albums is that they have n't been writing very good melodies or hooks . With the first couple listens of Clockwork Angels , I could tell that this album was a vast improvement in that category over their last few , but it still left a lot to be desired . Now that I have listened to it a lot ( and I do mean A LOT ) , many of the melodies and hooks that I found initally to have not been very strong have been embedded in my head . Assuming that I am able to change the rating of this review , this will now be a 5-star review , as I am confident in saying that this album is in my top-5 by the band.Also , in case you 're wondering , I 'll update my song-by-song rating as well : Caravan - 8/10BU2B - 10/10Clockwork Angels - 9/10The Anarchist - 10/10Carnies - 8/10Halo Effect - 7/10Seven Cities of Gold - 10/10The Wreckers - 10/10Headlong Flight - 10/10BU2B2 - N/AWish Them Well - 8/10The Garden - 10/10	1
Ok , self admitted Rush fan-boy here . Things got a little sideways with Grace Under Pressure , still had the magic but it was a little obscured ... I got it , some did n't . I still stood by the guys . Thick and thin , they were still Gods among Gods and forever did I pledge my allegiance . Counter Parts hurt ... Presto was quite divergent as was Hold Your Fire . Roll The Bones had a measure of magic to it but still ... Test For Echo was a bit better and then Vapor Trails just screamed redemption ( except for all those great guitar solos ... Exactly ) Having been to every concert since GUP , the proceeding releases were of slight consequence ... With their long standing catalog ; did a few misses really matter ? Not really , they still brought the place down every night.I held off buying Snakes and Arrows as I did not want to be disappointed ... Went to the concert and did n't quite get those songs . After nearly a year , I gave in and got it . I admit , it took a while and I was able to get about 4 good songs out of it ... I should say great songs , not in any way saying the others were `` bad '' .Enter Clock Work Angels ... I went into it skeptically , hoping for a song or two . What came next just blew my mind . I popped in the CD and proceeded to drive to work . I figure this would be good use of my 40-50 minute traffic sitting session . Never before have I experienced what I did ... By the time I made it to the middle of `` Head Long Flight '' I was in a total frenzy ! You know when you 're at a live show and about half way into it your favorite song comes on and everything around you just fades away and you are just absolutely swept away in rapture and existing on a primal level with the music ? That whole ego-loss primitive part of brain thing ? Well yeah , I was there . I could n't believe it ! I could n't believe what I was hearing or what I was feeling . Never do I do this cause I think its lame ... But I actually had to play that song over again , needed to feel that `` rush '' ( pun intended ) one more time . And yes , the Bastille Day reference was not lost ... ah , to be a fly on the wall for that one ! LOL ! ! ! This album takes a palate of emotions and mixes them into obscure shades that I really have n't felt before or can really explain . The true meaning of art is the ability for the artist to illicit an emotional response and the degree of response defines the degree of success and talent . In that regards , they succeeded immensely.The main thing that stands out with this effort is they took BIG chances and it paid off massively . The new sonic direction that they took is just freakin great . No other Rush album even sounds close to this one.What more can I say ... My ears are ringing right now as I just wrapped up yet another listen . Is it all great ? ... Almost . There 's a couple of tracks that are `` less '' than the others but the bulk of it is just pure Rush bliss.I just wish their tour manager had more confidence in the guys and booked bigger venues so tickets were n't $ 300 a pop ... .That 's a bit ridiculous ... But I 'm going . After all ... food is over rated .	1
Guitar World named Rush and Van Halen the top 2 albums of 2012 , and it 's well deserved . ( as much as I hate lists , this one I agree ) This is pure Rush . It reminds me of classic Rush , it 's like nothing has changed . It 's a reminder of why we love Rush in the first place.Rush has continued to make great music after so many years with the same lineup , that 's not easy for any band.I wo n't go into why this album is great as so many other reviewers have mentioned already.Just listen for yourself .	1
Over the years , I have come to appreciate Rush much more than I did when they first appeared on the scene . The last few releases , Clockwork Angels included , have been solid efforts that have only added to the band 's legendary international stature . A friend purchased this one the week of it 's release and loaned it to me after enjoying it several times himself . I agree with his positive assessment and so a copy is in my cart.There have already been hundreds of reviews , most of them favorable . So all I can do is add my thumbs up to an already enormous amen corner . When I first listened , I mentally gave it four stars , but with each listen I hear something new so I 've bumped it up to five . Though I enjoy the entire album , my favorite cuts are Caravan , The Anarchist , Seven Cities of Gold , and The Wreckers.The CD is packaged in an attractive digipak and is accompanied by a fat booklet containing album info , the lyrics , and a number of cool images . If you were n't already a Rush fan , you probably would n't be reading this . So what are you waiting for ? Order it , you ca n't go wrong .	1
Not an exagerrated review , and not a long one . Rush 's latest release is far better than anything they have done in a loooong time . They have meshed what was brilliant about the 80 ; s..Avante garde about the 90 's and fresh about he 2000's.There are some wonderful keyboard work and some wonderful melodies.Anybody who states differently have earwax stuck in their brains.All of them are on top of their game and play fabulously . Get this now .	1
I was a big fan of Rush in the late 70s and early 80s and then drifted away . Recently I bought this album to see where they are today and I am thoroughly humbled by their phenomenal talent . The songs are awesome and seem to weave , on a few occasions , several melodies into one piece , something that can only be done after many seasons of musical poetry , experimentation and orchestration . Let this album grow on you and be amazed at where time has brought this band after all these decades .	1
This is the best Rush album since the early 80 's ... most diehard Rush fans know that there 's really not a bum album in the whole lot besides a couple of their early live albums ( which sound like they were , to quote Sublime , `` Too drunk to light the bong , too stoned to write the song '' ) , and that horrific , thankfully short-lived blunder into rap known as Roll the Bones , but hey , nobody 's perfect ! This album is definitely one which gets better and better which each hearing , these guys never cease to amaze me with their individual and collective talents ! Power Trios Rule ! !	1
Veteran prog-rockers Rush ( Geddy Lee , Alex Lifeson , Neil Peart ) follow-up 2007'sSnakes & Arrowswith their ambitious concept effort , 2012 's highly anticipatedClockwork Angels . Clockwork Angels has a weighty ` concept ' and storyline , but despite it 's heady ambitions , Clockwork Angels easily delivers one of the year 's strongest efforts . This effort joins Van Halen and Jack White to deliver an intriguing rock effort in a time where rock itself seems ` down . ' Memorable , cerebral , and consistent , Clockwork Angels is superb . Lee ( vocals and bass ) and Lifeson ( guitars and keyboards ) handle the musical composition while Peart ( drums , percussion ) handles the lyrics . `` Caravan '' opens the effort spirited , opening with bell sound effects and then introducing a rhythmic groove . Lifeson 's guitar have a superb timbre about them and are well mixed within the production . Ever restless , `` Caravan '' features changes of pace instrumentally following the verse with different key , mood and tone ; very creative . Harmonically , the progression employed on the bridge section is superb . The refrain adds to the programmatic conception : `` ... The caravan thunders onward/to the distant dream of the city/the caravan carries me onward/on my way at last/on my way at last ... I ca n't stop thinking big ... '' The array of instrumental sounds plays as vital a role as the lyrics and Geddy Lee 's vocals to `` Caravan 's '' success . `` BU2B , '' released a couple of years ago , continues the mysterious , ambitious and complex nature of Clockwork Angels . Opening with ominous synthetic keyboard effects , soon Lifeson 's acoustic guitar enters in . Geddy Lee 's vocals begin muted in effects , eventually repeated to their full glory : `` I was brought up to believe/the universe has a plan/we are only human/it 's not ours to understand . '' Incorporating the Watchman , a figure within the narrative with the storyline , the heat further picks up within the effort . The title track is a tour de force by all means , incorporating the use of various styles and sound effects . Of the most interesting shifts , the incorporation of a blues , driven by Lifeson 's acoustic guitar virtuosity , is sheer brilliance . Peart 's drumming facility and lyrics are as clever and vital as ever , particularly as Lee deliver 's the refrain : `` Clockwork angels , spread their arms and sing/synchronized and graceful , they move like living things/Goddesses of light , of Sea and Sky and Land/Clockwork Angels , the people raise their hands as if to fly ... '' The lyrics reference spiritual and the scientific , also exploring and conveying Peart 's atheistic beliefs . `` The Anarchist '' continues to allure , opening with pummeling drums and dirty sounding guitars . Lee 's bass is noticeably present within the mix , which is yet another pro of the album as a whole . Continuing to help their audience understand the crux of the narrative , programmatic notes are included within the jacket : `` Walking among the people - who are so content , so blind - The Anarchist hears the pedlar 's call and sneers derisively . `` What do I lack ? '' Ah vengeance . '' Definitely deep . `` Carnies '' does n't miss a beat , incorporating carnival sounds at the onset to contribute to the ` tone poetic ' nature . Again , the lyrics in tandem with the overall production are the selling point . `` Halo Effect '' is a more sensitive turn from the band , though a smart and successful contrast . The program signifies love/relationships within this cut , and the use of strings and tamer sound confirms this . Lee 's lead vocals are clear as a bell . Even the title references back to ` angels ' and further serves as a nuance of the tightly-sewn nature of the program . `` Seven Cities of Gold '' gives the title track a ` run ' for it 's money delivering perhaps the album 's valedictory moment . Overt from the onset , driven by Lee 's bass and the employment of angular , muscular riffs , `` Seven Cities of Gold '' is nothing short of superb . The bite and the sheer resolve of the cut remind and reminisce back to2112 's `` Passage to Bangkok . '' Again , is it coincidence that the ` seven , ' a biblical and oft-cited religious number is central here ? `` The Wreckers '' finds more play into Peart 's atheistic agenda , with references to salvation , even if they be ` indirect . ' Within the program , the notes read : `` ... We seemed to find salvation in an unexpected signal light . Steering toward it , we soon learned it was false ... '' Read into it as you may , it is no secret that Peart 's lyrics have always been sharper and laden with messages deeper than what appears . `` The Wreckers '' shines brightly , even after following a juggernaut the likes of `` Seven Cities of Gold . `` `` Headlong Flight '' delivers superbly , joining top echelon cuts like `` Clockwork Angels '' and `` Seven Cities of Gold . '' Opening with a minimalistic groove and a driving , uptempo nature , `` Headlong Flight '' is Rush at its best . Angular , slick , virtuosic musicianship , `` Headlong Flight '' is CLASSIC . `` BU2B2 '' again focuses on more ` realist ' ambitions , as evidenced by it 's program : `` ... No more boundless optimism , no more faith in greater powers , too much pain , too much grief , and too much disillusion . '' Albeit brief , `` BU2B2 '' is as much part of the totality of the project as anything else . `` Wish Them Well '' incorporates asymmetric meter brilliantly and Lee 's ` lungs ' sound as impassioned as ever . As good or possibly better is the culminating closer `` The Garden , '' which closes the epic , well epically . Standing strongly upon the program the liner state : `` I have now arrived at that point in my own story . There is a metaphorical garden in the acts and altitudes of a person 's life , and the treasures of that garden are love and respect . '' Another spiritual reference , nonetheless.What else can be said ? Clockwork Angelsis one of 2012 's masterpieces . For the prog-rock fan dying to go back to its heydays in the 1970s , this is like ` Heaven . ' Well crafted , well executed , and as cerebral as any classic prog-rock album , Clockwork Angels is excellent .	1
The individual tracks have been reviewed and commented on so well here that there is no need to rehash . I just wanted to add my voice to those who stand in amazement that a rock band with so much mileage behind them can still create something so vital and full of life and thought and possibilities.Even the most open minded listeners will probably find this a challenging listen for the first few times , but stick with it and it will keep rewarding you . Use the CD booklet , follow along with the narrative and the lyrics . Then it will be easier to `` hear '' all the great music that is going on around it afterward . At least , that 's what worked for me.This is a much different vibe from Snakes & Arrows , so if you liked that one , do n't expect a repeat . This is a band that never repeats itself and values changing and growing and evolving more than any other rock band I have followed . That philosophy definitely appeals to my taste for the `` new '' and the `` different '' .Congratulations to RUSH on a monumental achievement .	1
This album is beyond good . Buy it , study it , treasure it . I waited to write this review until I could absorb what I was hearing over several listens - and then several more . It 's startling to think how long I 've been a Rush fan at this point , so I wo n't dwell on it . But long enough to have been an early adopter of the majority of the band 's catalog . If there 's one thing you learn being a Rush fan it 's that your first impressions are never correct , especially if you 're writing off whatever you are hearing as lazy or unformed . These are 3 of the most intelligent people in modern music , and they do n't take their music lightly . So chances are that if you 're not getting it , it 's most likely because there 's too much IT to get in a casual or early listen . However , I did n't really have that issue in a first run through CA because the sound of this record is so mighty there 's no way any human with a pulse could not have a visceral reaction ( provided the means of delivery is n't some sort of tinny iPod ear nubs ) . Rush is in the house - in your house at max power.But in a way , that 's a problem . When somebody grabs you by the throat and yells in your face , you are n't exactly prepared to contemplate the subtle nuances of whatever they might be saying . In other words , it 's an amazing sonic experience , with peerless musicianship and incredible production , but does that mean the songs are any good ? And actually , beneath the atomic resonance of the sonic tidal wave , these are some of the band 's catchiest tunes ever . I did n't even realize it until I found myself looking forward to singing along with choruses and bridges . `` All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary ... '' `` I ca n't stop thinking big ... '' `` Distant as a comet or a constellation ... '' I could go on and on . Just a master class of subtle tunecraft in an era that has forgotten melody ever walked the earth.This is also a very nice PRODUCT . The booklet is gorgeous . It 's been a long time since I bought an album that also felt like an artifact worthy to be unearthed by future archeologists . Along with the music you get the feeling that this might be the first ALBUM to be made since OK Computer - that is , this is a piece of art which can only be understood and appreciated as a totality , with the booklet and lyrics an indispensable part of the whole . Nobody does that anymore . It defies the iPod shuffle , but if a listener ca n't spin the circle on something that jostles his innards then there 's no way he will ever get the impact of the music no matter how he slices it.All in all , I get the feeling that this album is a tribute to the fans - not just the Rush fans , but fans of music . By making something that dares to be distinctive , in the vertical plane of modern music and in the long horizontal of Rush history ( which is now a large chunk of hard rock history ) , Rush proves that they care - they care about their music , they care about their fans , they care about remaining vital in a world that has only recently started to even acknowledge their existence . That 's not just a testament to the band and its fans , its an inspiration we can all draw from .	1
I have been a Rush fan since 1981 . This album is a masterpiece . Not that most of the others are n't , but you 'd think they 'd have run out of steam by now . : - )	1
Name another band that made what could be their best album after 38 years together . Ca n't think of one ? Nor can I . What was this album they made ? A progressive rock concept album . In 2012 . Now , in a time where auto-tune is a given and no one is famous for more than a season , this trio made an album that could 've climbed the charts just as easily in 1976 . And the lyrics ? A journey through a sprawling dystopian sci-fi world told with absolute sincerity . Perhaps that 's why the horn-rimmed hipster set branded them uncool . They do n't know how to be ironic . They just play great music and tell some honest and interesting stories with a point . That 's a shame , maybe if they 'd sneered at the fantasy and wore skinny jeans they might be played at some parties in Silverlake or the East Village . Maybe if they 'd burned themselves out in a blaze of excess and insanity after Hemispheres , they 'd get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Nope , these guys ( who are almost 60 and at the top of their game ) just belted out what might be their best album in almost four decades . To me , that 's a big deal .	1
Ah , Rush fanship , a sort of shared rite of passage among white , nerdy outsider types who grew up in the 1980s or 90s . We bond over how awesome Moving Pictures was and still listen to it through headphones every so often , transported back to a time when the signal telling guys like us ( for we were mostly guys ) that we were n't alone in the universe was coming from Canada , and contained instructions to rock.To my high school self , they were the one band that made music about serious things ( well , them and U2 ) in a teenage wasteland of brain-dead jock rock , pop cheez-whiz , and low pants hip-hop . Of course , I learned as I grew older that there was other music worth listening to , but faithfully continued to buy all of Rush 's new releases . And to *like* most of them , while still hoping that the next one would feature a little less of the alternative rock crunchy granola and a little more of the rocket sauce ( to quote Jack Black ) that had made the classic stuff so addictive.Maybe it 's the fact that geekiness is now in and you can openly play 2112 to your heart 's content ( if not your girlfriend 's ) with your friends in Guitar Hero , maybe it 's that no one wants to hear old guys trying to sound hip -- in any case , Rush has decided that they might as well embrace the past , kimonos and all , and make another old school science fiction concept album.And , man , the result is the closest thing to `` classic Rush '' since , well , classic Rush . This time , they play with the considerable musical athleticism that they still bring to marathon concerts . This time , Geddy Lee does n't try to do annoying extra things with his voice , but delivers spot-on vocals . They make extensive use of strings , echoing the lushness of several of their mid-career releases . The energy of the songs reaches all the way back to the big laser show arena rock spirit of the early 1980s , blissfully free of any pretenses at a `` current '' -sounding record ( not that anything `` current '' is n't a pastiche of things from the past 's garage sale ) , and it 's fantastic.Among the instant winners for me were `` BU2B '' , whose driving , double-edged contemplation of the idea of an intelligently-designed universe speaks right to an ex-Catholic Rush fan like me ; `` Clockwork Angels '' , whose soaring vocals , martial drums , and ethereal guitar are a strong echo of Hemispheres ; `` The Wreckers '' , in which Geddy delivers one of his most emotionally-charged vocal performances ever , to a dramatic string backing ; and `` Headlong Flight '' , simply a soaring , all-out rocker.Other songs offered up their rewards with repeated listenings . `` The Anarchist '' and `` Carnies '' feature furious guitar work from Alex and some theatrical atmospherics . `` Seven Cities of Gold '' constructs a winding , wandering-in-the-wilderness vibe with some tripped-out , La Villa Strangiato-sounding passages . `` The Garden '' is so achingly beautiful , it overcomes somewhat cheesy lyrics.Is there sand in the aural picnic ? Well , is n't there always . The song `` Wish Them Well '' makes me marvel that a guy who is friends with the creators of South Park AND name-drops both Voltaire 's `` Candide '' and David Foster Wallace 's `` Infinite Jest '' in another song can sometimes manage to crank out such preachy , self-help pap . The fragments of story in the liner booklet are somewhat of a disappointment , too , being kind of clunky and cliche-filled . Then again , Peart emphasizes larger themes over plot detail in the actual songs , so it 's not a big deal . Finally , the recording sounds a bit muffled and flattened to my ears , particularly the drums . Not Vapor Trails bad , but not quite ideal.Hardly fatal flaws , though . All in all , I think this album will stand as a fine homage by Rush to its own glory days , containing plenty of bliss-out moments for long-time fans -- and perhaps a few younger ones . If it 's to be their last studio effort , it 's an impressive final hurrah for a now-legendary group .	1
Off the top , I want to comment on the production , as that seems to be more polarizing than ever . Bottom line : it is straight-up 21st century . If you do n't like modern production values , if you believe there was some golden age of audio 30 years ago and as such ca n't hear songs for the sonics , this one 's not for you . That said , the production is ( in uncompressed formats ) clear , meaty , and driving . Also delicate when needed . To my ear , there is plenty of dynamic range , and the band sounds more `` live '' then they have in years . The drums sound like real drums , the guitar 's actually more focused and less layered than on the last couple albums , and the bass is pitch perfect , fat and rumbling but also clear , with plenty of mid-punch ; when Alex drops out for a solo , you do n't even notice the rhythm guitar missing . Which is quite a feat . Yes , this is mastered louder , per current standards , but it does n't digitally clip like 'Vapor Trails . 'Production technicalities aside , what we have here is that rarest of albums , one that can easily stand alongside the band 's `` classic '' releases . Have n't seen a band pull that off since Iron Maiden 's 'A Matter Of Life And Death , ' back in 2006 . Rush even surpasses their own legacy in some ways , as there is an element of maturity here that would have been impossible 30 years ago . The songs are for the most part uniformly strong , with even the slightly weaker ones ( `` Halo Effect '' and `` Wish You Well '' ) being buoyed up by the conceptual tapestry surrounding them . At the same time , Peart has given us a batch of songs that ( for the most part ) can stand on their own absent knowledge of the concept.Speaking of that concept : whether intentional or not , 'Clockwork Angels ' is something of a sequel to '2112 , ' thematically if nothing else . Different protagonist , different backdrop , different plot development , but the same notion of the individual pitted against an overarching system that thinks it knows what 's best . He struggles , learns , finds , loses , and then finds hope again . But whereas '2112 ' was the band 's furious reply to the idea that they needed to compromise to survive , 'Clockwork Angels ' is an examination of where you are when the dust has settled , when you 've been through the best and worst life has to offer . '2112 ' asked this question as well , but the answer was one of conjecture , one of howling , suicidal escape rather than capitulation . 'Clockwork , ' on the other hand , is a story of just how much a person CAN survive , and ultimately , in `` Headlong Flight , '' sees its protagonist proclaim , `` I wish that I could live it all again . '' All . Not just the good parts . Which is hugely relevant , both to the fictional storyline and what lyricist/drummer Neil Peart has lived through in his real life . The album ends with `` Wish Them Well , '' a surprisingly turn-the-other-cheek response to those who would wear you down via relentless negativity , and `` The Garden , '' a gorgeous closing meditation on the need to tend to one 's own sense of meaning and satisfaction . `` Happiness is where you find it '' becomes `` happiness is where you grow it . '' A far cry ( reference intended ) from slitting your wrists just as the elder race shows up to save you.But , before we get to closure , we get the fury of beginnings . And there is plenty of that anger , albeit not as scathing as '2112 's onslaught . `` Caravan '' kicks off the proceedings , establishing both the main character 's motivation and the band as a still-towering paragon of musicianship and chemistry . The main riff and chorus are great , but its the instrumental bridge section that really lets us know Rush is back in a way we have n't seen in awhile . Much like `` Show Do n't Tell '' some 20+ years ago , the song gets its melodic hooks in you and then lets the band loose for a good two minutes in the middle . Tight , punchy , borderline-funk riffs , capped off with a daringly atonal guitar solo from Alex Lifeson.Next is the album 's heaviest track , lyrically and musically : `` BU2B ( Brought Up To Believe ) . '' An attack on the fictional plot 's Watchmaker , an attack on pre-determination , on the enemies of free will ... an attack even on God , if you choose to read it as such ; `` BU2B '' imagines an overlord who `` loves us all to death , '' and the band backs it up with verse slabs of down-tuned guitar , juxtaposed against an unexpected 'Grace Under Pressure'-esque bridge.From there we hit the title track , the album 's promised epic . And while it does n't quite live up to the hype that it would be a multi-parter in the vein of `` Natural Science , '' `` Clockwork Angels '' still stands as the band 's longest , most varied song since 1981 's `` The Camera Eye . '' Characterized throughout by a rolling 6/8 ( or swing , depending on how you look at it ) feel , the song moves through a series of moods with great efficacy , with another great Lifeson solo and even a lyric lifted from an In 'N Out Burger shake cup . This song also brings me to another point of contention regarding this album : Geddy 's vocal melodies . They make this song . I 've seen a lot of reviews claim his voice is shot , and that there are no real melodies on the album . I could n't disagree more ; while its true that his range is n't what it once was ( and has n't been since 1980 , really ) , the melodies on this album are incredible . Very complex and varied , much moreso than the early years , but absolutely there . I half wonder if the confusion stems from people WANTING simpler melodies . There is some legitimacy to this , in that the simpler melodies of yesteryear were a significant part of what helped make Rush 's otherwise complex and sometimes downright bizarre music more accessible , but for the purposes of this album , I think the busier lines work perfectly , revealing themselves almost exponentially on repeat listens.Moving on , we hit `` The Anarchist '' and `` Carnies , '' the former executing a clever bassline-that-becomes-vocal-line trick and featuring another riff that hearkens back to the chorused-out 80s , and the latter doing a pinch-harmonic take on what could be a rhythmic reference to `` Working Man . '' Nowhere near as blatant as the `` Bastille Day '' tag in `` Headlong Flight , '' but still arguably there . Lyrically , both songs serve to back our protagonist into a corner as he is manipulated by one of the story 's villains , though `` The Anarchist '' also sees a perhaps embittered version of 2112 's hero lamenting a world where there was never `` time enough to sing that song . '' Its the guitar being smashed at Syrinx all over , but with a different character outcome . `` I never wanted to belong/I was so strong , '' he proclaims , the eternal mantra of the outsider who decides to hate the world before it can hate him . `` Halo Effect '' is the album 's first soft spot , and would be something of a throw-away if it did n't serve as a bridge to the rest of the story . While not a bad song , it does n't have much variation and comes across more as an interlude than a stand-alone piece . The song it leads into is another of the record 's epics , `` Seven Cities Of Gold . '' Reportedly equally influenced by Cormac McCarthy and the Spanish myth of lost North American cities of gold , the song opens with a straight-ahead riff that would n't have been out of place on 'Fly By Night . ' This is a solid , satisfying song , though it plods a bit in comparison to the preceding heavies ( and also sends the story off on a something of a lyrical tangent ) .This brings us to `` The Wreckers , '' a story of murderers who causes deliberate shipwrecks for the purpose of plunder . This song to me is more significant for the light it sheds on Peart 's current philosophy than it is for its place in the narrative . For the most part a ballad , it features a beautiful chorus where the the protagonist laments `` All I know is sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true ... Because sometimes the target is you , '' and ultimately that `` sometimes memory can be too much to carry / Striking down like a bolt from the blue . '' One of the album 's most powerful moments , without a doubt.And then we get to where I started , `` Headlong Flight . '' A rollicking , 7-minute barn-burner , with the already-mentioned `` Bastille Day '' reference front-and-center , this song is as close to pre-'2112 ' Rush as we are ever going to hear , ever . Featuring a spiraling , Tool-ish opening bass riff , absolutely ferocious drumming ( including a fullblown solo ) , and a wah-drenched Lifeson shredfest that really could have been airlifted in from 1974 , this is the band giving it all they 've still got on the straight-up attack front . And of course , tied together with Geddy 's belting of that great line , `` I wish that I could live it all again ! `` In closing , I think Rush have made an album for the ages , one that I 'd be as comfortable giving a new listener to the band as a starting point as I would , say , 'Permanent Waves . ' Perhaps the most successful group to ever have its fanbase defined predominantly by those who want to see their favorite band evolve with each release , Rush have made good on that promise , consistently , for almost four decades , and Clockwork Angels not only is no exception , but , should this be the last go-around , will serve brilliantly as a summation . It is also , for all its conceptual grandiosity , possibly the most lyrically personal album in the band 's catalog . Neil Peart does n't give many interviews , and when he does , his personal tragedies are explicitly not touched upon . And while I respect that , particularly in that he has n't given in to the current memoir culture of misery voyeurism , its been hard not to wonder how such events affect a mind so given to exploration of ultimate meaning as Peart 's . This is n't to say the world is n't full of people who have suffered as much or more , but rarely are they in a position of similar intelligence , eloquence , and public exposure ; I contend the man 's two-cents on these matters bears more resemblance to gold doubloons than actual pennies.Lastly , Geddy and Alex . Neither has lost an ounce in instrumental ability : if anything , Geddy is more fluid than ever , and Lifeson 's solos are still exercises in a glorious sort of transcendental freneticism . Geddy 's voice has lost some range , and he has trouble keeping up vocally live , night after night , for three hours at a pop , but he sounds great on this album . If this is to be Rush 's final album , let it be said they went out bringing the same intelligent fire that put them on the map in the first place , way back when their first A & R ; man said , `` I do n't hear a single , '' and three guys from Willowdale responded : `` We Have Assumed Control . `` ( Lastly lastly : a note on format . This album sounds far and away the best on vinyl . If that 's too cumbersome , definitely track it down lossless ( FLAC , wav , ALAC , or on good ol ' CD ) ; it does get a little brittle in compressed formats like MP3 . Still plenty listenable at 320k , especially in a car or in the background , but for the full experience , you 're gon na want all them wavelengths intact . Matter of fact , I half wonder if a good chunk of the people who do n't like the album 's sound have only heard it compressed ; that 's becoming more and more common , I 'm sad to say . )	1
I had read some reviews on here proclaiming this to be Rush 's best album ever . I thought that was high praise , indeed , and impossible considering the classics of their past . I 've since listened to it repeatedly , and honestly , I love it a little more with each listen . This is brilliant and beautiful and engaging and hypnotic . Think of your favorite rock albums that just you just love to listen to over and over - they never get old for you . This is certainly one of those instant masterpiece type of albums , and I ca n't imagine how any Rush fan can possibly be disappointed in it . As far as their best album ever , I can not go that high . Their best is and always be the incomparable Moving Pictures . It is an immovable force and deserves recognition as their magnum opus . But I will go so far as to easily put Clockwork Angels in my top five . I 'd probably place it third , behind Moving Pictures and Grace Under Pressure , and ahead of Power Windows and Permanent Waves ( yes , I do love 80 's Rush . ) This album just flows so nicely ( as it should , being a story-telling concept album ) and listeners are just carried along by the genius of both the story and the melody . My absolute favorites on here are Caravan , BU2B and The Anarchist . Right behind those are Headlong Flight , Carnies , the title track and Wish Them Well . Congratulations to Rush for silencing any critics who think this band 's time is past . Rush is eternal .	1
This album in my mind is top 5 best in their discography . The sound is amazing , vocals are a strong as ever , and each player are at the pinnacle of their craft . It 's disappointing to hear so many complain about some songs being too `` complex '' or having `` too many changes and sounds going on at once '' . Last I checked , Rush is still a progressive rock band ; The whole point of being labeled `` progressive '' means they are not taking the road most traveled and are creating material unique to themselves and the genre . 2112 anyone ? Hemispheres ? If you want simple time signatures and radio friendly melodies ( There is ton of beautiful melody on this album by the way ) , go listen to alternative/pop non-pioneers like Nickelback . Their is a lot of creativity and effort in this album and it deserves more than one listen . The liner notes also illustrate an pretty intriguing concept/story as well and really add to the overall experience.Moving on , a great album by a great group of guys . I have to say I 'm enjoying this album a lot more than snakes and arrows and really feel that if this were their last album ( let 's hope it 's not ) that it would be a great final chapter to their 38 years together . Just listen to the last track , `` The Garden '' and it 'll leave you feeling more than satisfied .	1
This album is only a few days old , i dont think thats enough time to understand the 'whole thing , so people giving it a five like me arent being very honest at the moment , i think we all know its potential and complexity that it will lead to a 5 . But i will be honest and give it a 3.5 right now , but i will give it a 5 because i dont feel like coming back and changing this review to a 5 in a few months . I did that with Vapor Trails .	1
Rush have taken their time having put together `` Clockwork Angels '' over the course of the past several years . The first two tracks `` Caravan '' and `` BU2B '' were both released as internet singles more than two years ago and have been a part of their live show for the same time period . Both tracks have been slightly improved here with some added flourishes not found in the originals . To my ears Rush has been on a bit of a creative comeback of late . I thought their last album `` Snakes And Arrows '' was their best in years , and `` Clockwork '' continues moving in the right direction . All of Rush strengths are shown here revolving around a concept that will be eventually expanded into a novel . This album took a few listens to really click with me , but I am really enjoying it now . There are a few tracks here , ( `` Headlong Flight '' is a good example ) which rate right up there with the best the band has ever done . Instrumentally the band , as always , is still on fire with all three guys showing off their chops throughout the disc . Geddy 's vocals have changed a bit over the years , but he still has good range and can belt it out . My one criticism with the production is the sound . As with many modern albums , everything is compressed to death and comes out muddy on my system . One thing you do not want on a Rush album is muddy sounding drums , and unfortunately they are nearly as clear and crisp as they should be . Hell , some of the band 's old 70 's albums sound better than this . Other than the sound issue I think this is a very strong release from Rush . These guys defiantly still have it .	1
Rush 's 20th studio album , CLOCKWORK ANGELS , finds the band revitalized and reinvigorated . It is hard to believe , listening to this album , that the band at work here has been kicking around since the 70 's . While the songwriting here suggests that the band is experienced , the energy and passion feels very young . Lee 's vocals are strong , his bass thudding , Lifeson 's guitarwork is just as interesting , and Peart 's drums are mindboggling . CLOCKWORK ANGELS is one of the best Rush albums in several years.Beginning with the excellent `` Caravan , '' the album chronicles a tale about a time traveler journey 's . The motif of `` time '' is apparent throughout the album ( even in the album 's name and artwork ) . Neil Peart 's imagination fuels the lyrics here ; part science-fiction , part fantasy , part sweeping epic , apparently a novelization of CLOCKWORK ANGELS is in the work . This opening track announces the band 's energy ; it 's stomping , chugging , and energetic . Many of these songs coalesce with one another -- these tracks are strong on their own , but they work the best within the context of the album . The album ends with `` The Garden , '' a primarily acoustic number that doubles as a thoughtful meditation on the mediation of life and time . Perhaps it 's an unconventional way to end such a heavy album , but in retrospect , CLOCKWORK ANGELS could n't end any other way.My only real gripe with CLOCKWORK ANGELS is the production . As with most of Nick Raskulinecz 's production , there seems to be a lot of compression going on . It chokes the dynamics of the band , but it makes them sound louder and rawer.For fans of Rush , this album is a treat . For listeners unfamiliar with the band , CLOCKWORK ANGELS turns out to be a good place to start listening ( along with MOVING PICTURES perhaps ) . Listeners who do n't care much for Rush will probably not find a lot here to convince them otherwise ; it 's a lot of what made the band important in the first place . Standout tracks to sample/download : `` Caravan , '' `` Seven Cities of Gold , '' and `` The Garden . ''	1
Rush keeps on challenging themselves and keeps growing musically . This is one of their strongest albums . The songs have the common thread and at the same time each have their own distinct flavor . Excellent album ! ! !	1
Clockwork Angels is Rush at their best . I was very happy to hear a return to their roots with strong guitars and powerful drums . As always , the lyrics are a bit ... intellectual to say the least . The digital booklet contains fantastic `` steampunk '' art . This was my first Amazon digital album purchase . I have to say the process was seamless to integrate the music with my iTunes and Google Music applications , and the sound quality blows away anything I have purchased from iTunes .	1
Generally you either love Rush or hate them . For whatever reason , some people do n't `` get them '' of the quality and variety of their work . So be it.But ... If you want to see what 38 years of musicianship , craftsmanship , and striving to be better gets you in the world of rock , I can think of no better illustration than 'Clockwork Angels . ' It is singularly their best work , and I dare say , better even than '2112 . ' From the opening chords of `` Caravan , '' which pushes you into the intriguing and introspective steampunk world of the album , feeling the steady thrum of Geddy 's bass , counter-pointed with the thunder of Neil 's drums , and overlain with the siren song of Alex 's guitar , right through the final dying , plaintive notes of `` The Garden , '' you are wrapped up and enthralled in a sonic exploration of an amazing and vibrant world.What is even better , is that while each and every song glues this world together , taking any one song out of the context of the album does not diminish them , but opens them even more relevant interpretation in today 's society . This multi-textural form of music is simply astonishing to feel rolling through your mind with every beat , punch , and jam.And to top it off , the band does something it may not have done since the days of 'Fly By Night ' or 'Caress of Steel ' -- the band cuts loose . At once the most proficient purveyors and players of their instruments in all of musicdom , the band seems to feel enough freedom , joy , and above all , confidence , to pour themselves into every song with a barely-contained reckless abandon , that makes it sound like they are a band of twenty-somethings fresh to the circuit again.If you are looking for rock-and-roll that rocks , thunders , jams , and impresses , you could do far worse than Clockwork Angels . Rush has built a masterpiece for the 21st Century .	1
Another Masterpiece from Rush.Still lean more toward the Concept Lp 2112 for me , but it grows on you with repeat listening .	1
I truly wish I could have seen him in person . Witty , without a single foul word , Victor Borge reminds us that there is a ton of humor all around us , and that a truly quality comedian does not need to resort to garbage language to have his audience laughing until they cry . - Author Claudia Newcorn	1
First of all , the title puzzles me because this is actually *not* a total clip show like some others out there - it is basically just a Victor Borge concert , and that 's how I like it . No stupid narration or pointless black-and-white photo portraits , no interviews with fellow musicians or any other time fillers . This is Victor Borge on the stage and up to his antics . Some people complain that portions are edited out , but my Borge DVD collection is starting to get big and I can safely say that the editing on this item was still done with a MUCH lighter hand than some others out there.As to the picture/sound quality , I do n't know if that 's the fault of the DVD . If they originally filmed with subpar equipment ( not uncommon in `` live '' settings ) , it 's only going to be so good when you put it onto a DVD . I 'm not saying they could n't have improved the film a little more , but film is only as good as the original quality . You ca n't turn a decaying , scraped-up wax cylinder into a sparkling 21st-century mp3 , and you ca n't make medium-quality film look like a high definition Blu-Ray . I 'm not defending the editing/production guys , I 'm just explaining that technology ca n't do EVERYTHING when your source material was n't a perfect quality.That aside , I do really enjoy this DVD heads above some of my other Borge programs . For one thing , as I already mentioned , this one does n't have stuffy narration . Borge just comes out on the stage , starts his schtick , and keeps on going . Yes , the skits themselves will be familiar to the uber-fans out there , but they were executed with gusto here . The Salieri opera cracks my parents up every time , and having sung classical music myself , the gentle but unflinching musical humor usually makes me laugh sideways . The `` Rigoletto '' skit is likewise very dear to my heart.When Borge finally gets down to business on the piano , he plays a very lovely `` Claire de Lune '' and a charming Danish lullaby.There is no one perfect Victor Borge DVD , but this is better than some of the others out there .	1
Brian Regan is a hilarious comedian . His ability to bring his jokes in a circle add a level of intelligence and humor not many comedians can achieve . I would highly recommend all of his work . Also , very safe for kids .	1
I first saw Brian Regan on Comedy Central talking about simple things like IHOP and trifocals ... absolutely hilarious . This is a very funny disk ... especially the name and spelling bee bits . I really like this guy because he does n't curse and he is n't dirty at all . Comedians these days think they have to be vulgar to be funny . In my opinion , vulgarity is n't funny at all ; Profanity in comedy has been rubbed into the ground . It 's annoying and a sign of a lack of creativity . Brian Regan is clean , ingenious and hilarious .	1
Funny Guy ! I enjoy listening to it in my car - good , clean humor that anyone would enjoy ! I enjoyed it so much , I ordered another one of his CDs !	1
Fans of Jim Gaffigan , Jerry Seinfeld and other observational humorists will enjoy this excellent CD . It is original , funny and clever .	1
Excellent fun . My whole family enjoyed it . Brian does an excellent job capturing the kid experience . I am so there with his take on Gentle Ben .	1
This guy 's a loser ... and he knows it ... that 's what makes this guy so funny .	1
Brian is one funny guy ; I could not stop laughing . I first heard him during a long flight back from Japan and I must have looked like a moron sitting in my chair laughing as hard as I was ; there were tears running down my face . That was 2 years ago & amp ; I 've been looking for this CD ever since . I finally got my copy & amp ; listened to the whole thing driving from San Antonio to Austin and just cracked up the whole way - it was almost dangerous for me to be on the road.He reminds me of what my life was like growing up - back then a lot of it seemed pathetic , but now it seems pretty darn funny ! Great CD & amp ; you 'll like it - no foul language too . That 's a real plus these days .	1
I listened to this CD for the first time in its entirety on a car trip to Tennessee from Michigan and it made the time fly by . I have seen bits and pieces of his routine on Comedy Central and such , but it is really nice to have his best stuff at my fingertips . Although Regan is almost like Jim Carrey in that he relies a lot on facial expressions and physical comedy , the CD is still really funny to listen to.My favorite parts of Regan 's routine have always been the one about the doughnut lady ( `` well how many do I have left now ? '' ) and the last track on the CD with the dogs barking for no reason in the middle of the night . My new favorite is his bit about Flipper and how their should have been an evil dolphin who moved the channel markers . Another really funny part is about when he was in school and how unfair spelling bees are because..well I do n't want to give it away . Buy this CD - Brian Regan is really hilarious ! I remember him having a brother ( Dennis ? ) who was also a really funny guy . That makes the Regans like the Partridge family of comedy - but they are funny on purpose ! !	1
Every time I see his performance on Comedy Central I laugh . 5 times maybe and I am still laughing hysterically . His humor is witty , yet he does n't always pick out things like current events . I love his pop-tart bit . The things that make him the best are his facial expressions , eye movements , and the tone of his voice . It 's masterful , and it 's too bad that this CD does n't show him doing all of that . His dvd is coming out soon though , so cross your fingers for that.This cd does n't have the poptart though ... Still , it has alot . All his talk about animals is funny . Especially spider webs . The car stuff is funny too . `` Blasting Zone Ahead '' and `` Seatbelts '' are 2 of my favorites .	1
I heard of Brian Regan many many years ago , I believe he did an HBO special with his brother about 15 years ago ... .I had n't heard much more about him in the years to come , but he came to Phoenix to do a show , and I heard him on the radio , so I bought his CD , even though it 's a few years old already ... .I loved the CD , and my wife laughed throughout it even though she tends to get bored listening to comedy CDs ... .It contains mainly observational humor about growing up , so I listened to it in the car while driving the family places , and my kids love it too ( aged 11 & 6 ) ... .It is family friendly humor , which is hard to find ... .and it does wonders for long distance family road trips ... .He seems to be actively touring the comedy club scene , I just wish he would put out a new CD soon , considering this one is going on 8 years old now ... .	1
Why Chris Rea has never toured the States is a mystery . I ca n't find the words that could possibly pay justice to this man . He has an amazing voice , plays a mean guitar , composes great songs and yet is unknown in this country . I just do n't get it . But for those who want to see what England has somehow managed to hide all this time ( an undiscovered gem ) , check any one of his albums out . You 'll soon be asking the same question .	1
After my review of `` The Very Best of Chris Rea '' , I received this 11-cd set . The reviews gave me confidence in my purchase . I have to say that not only does Chris Rea successfully separate the Blues of various areas , he continues to surprise me . I keep asking myself if he has ever made any musical duds . My favorite discs would be the 60 's & 70 's ; Chicago Blues ; Memphis Blues ; but , and this may seem strange to the rest of you , but the absolute highlight for me is the DVD documentary that runs 70 mins . It is well made and entertaining while providing a rare insight into what an artist goes through to have his music heard . This in and of itself made the entire purchase worthwhile . The music is excellent and there are real gems throughout the collection . I just ordered 3 more Chris Rea cds ; Thanks , Chris for all you do !	1
I must admit to being a dedicated fan of Chris Rea for many years and had not heard anything from this group at all . I came across the collection purely by chance and decided to give it a try . It has three Cd 's and two vinyl albums . Have not heard the vinyl as yet but the first of the three cd 's is instrumental and takes you back to an earlier time in rock where the feel of the beat and the sound was all important . It is fantastic . The next two cd 's are a variety of rocky and bluesy tracks which are equally as good . On top of that you have the bonus of being able to read this very good quality book . A very good collection from quality muso 's .	1
This three cd packet of music delivers just like all of Chris Rea 's music . His last endeavor of 11 cds of music on the history of the blues is a must in any collection of the blues . If you have not discovered Chris ' , then buy this bundle of extremely enjoyable music . He includes three LPs in the packet as well . His writing , singing and total professionalism have always come through into his music . Buy this and any other work he has done . His voice is a credit to the blues as is his mastery of many instruments that he plays on many of his cds . The total performer . If you like Mark Knopfler and Eric Clapton , then you will enjoy Chris Rea .	1
If you wonder where Stevie Ray Vaughn got his outstanding guitar licks on & quot ; Texas Flood & quot ; , listen to & quot ; Blues Power & quot ; . They 're all there in this original by Albert King . I saw B . B . King on TV a few times around 1970 , but on Sunday nights around 1971 there was a show on PBS of rock concerts from the Filmore . One night Albert King was on there , a film of part of this very performance ! That is what cinched it for me as a blues fan . I 'd never heard guitar playing that touched so close to home . Every phrase was dynomite . I ca n't recomend this album enough .	1
Well the Blues is meant to be played live . It was never a genre for three minute radio songs . When Albert king signed at Stax he produced several hit singles beginning with `` Laundromat Blues '' and going on from there . This was his first live album- ever . He produced three recordings from it , this one and `` Wednesday and Thursday Night in San Francisco '' . The latter two were not released until 1990 when the Stax label was ressurrected under the Fantasy organization . Albert plays a host of new material and reworkings for this LP . It was his first outing at the Fillmore where he was the headliner . He woos the young audience and introduces them to what the blues is all about . He opens the set with Herbie Hancock 's `` Watermelon Man '' , a tune he used for about a dozen years after this as his opening with his line `` take off your shoes and slip them under the seat '' . He goes into the title track `` Blues Power '' from here . This a Talking Blues , a type that Albert excelled at . B.B . and Freddie never did any talking blues , Albert loved to talk ! It is interesting that this type of blues originated in Appallacia with white players in the 1920s . Albert is the all time virtuoso of the talking blues witness `` Matchbox '' , `` Cold Feet '' and others . This ten minute outing contains a comprehensive overview of his guitar style . It is very excellent and the tone of his guitar is fabulous . It of course has his signature stop break he first recorded at Chess in 1961 with `` Wo n't Be Hangin Round '' . SRV used it in Texas Flood ( Live ) ! This song has a lot of jargon that places Albert as an older player with a young audience , such as `` Soda Fountain '' and `` Guys and Gals '' ..however , it 's over their heads , they were into his guitar . The title `` Blues Power '' is of course the catch phrase of the sixties various `` Powers '' ( Austen Powers ! ! ) and like `` Born Under A Bad Sign '' ( Age of Aquarius ! ! ) these attempts at contemporizing the blues were lost in the fabulous guitar work outs . No one cared about the lyrics or content only the sound.Albert does a reworking of his first minor hit with King Records `` Blues At Sunrise '' with a small amount of Hendrix type feedback ( he 'd been doing this for a long time ) and it 's a great slow blues offering . He also does the closest thing to a slide riff he 'd ever done with B.B . King 's `` Please Love Me '' . `` Night Stomp '' is an interesting reversal of the famous 9th chord runs he did in Overall Junction . He wrote this tune with the album 's producer Al Jackson , Jr , the famous drummer of the MG 's . He also wrote `` Cold Feet '' the talking blues , with Albert ! The album closes with `` Look Out '' which was of course `` Overall Junction '' redone . This is interesting with the strange almost Buddy Guy bends he produced- it 's different from anything he ever recorded.This is a classic recording . It was at a time when the blues revival of the sixties was waning and Jimi Hendrix ( who played with Albert ) had taken the blues to a new level of blues-rock . Albert became accepted as an innovator of modern urban blues with his soulful recordings for Stax records . However , live he always played traditional blues and often his set included tunes from the 1940s ( check out the other two albums e.g . `` Driftin Blues '' ) . I saw him in 1990 and his set included `` Stormy Monday '' and `` Move To The Outskirts of Town '' . Get all three of these CDs , they are an historic record of the blues influence on music of the 1960s .	1
I just unwrapped this CD this afternoon , popped into the player and ... it 's EXCELLENT ! What an inspiration Mr. King must have been to Clapton et al . Each track on this one SMOKES BIG TIME ! The guitar is perfect , raw , loud and captivating . This is what I 've been looking for since I expired all of Michael Bloomfield 's stuff . If you love Bloomfield , you 'll love this and vice versa .	1
I could bore you with compiling a list of the musicians in the rock , blues , jazz , and new age field who were influenced by this master of electric blues but I will refrain from doing so . Albert King was one of those whose playing inspired me to learn guitar . I thought `` heck , it sounds easy enough for me to play '' . Aah the naive thoughts of youth ! Truth be told often the easiest sounding parts are the hardest to play and play with authority . Albert plays a lot of the same licks but inflects them differently in delivery - a talent that is in and of itself notable . He finds ways to transcend the patterns that all - himself included - fall into when playing . To quote Robert Palmer , his solos combine both `` torrential power and striking freshness '' and his style works not only in traditional shuffle style blues but also with r & b , funk , soul , jazz , and rock stylings backing him up.No offense intended to BB King partisans with the title of this review ( or to BB himself ) , but the truth is the truth . BB is ( and has been ) a wonderful ambassador for the blues . However , if we are talking about whose stylings have been most influential , Albert comes out ahead . No one has ever played the guitar with more authority for one thing . Also , Albert combined an impeccable sense of timing , the ability to utilize dynamics effectively , a penchant for economy of notes , and the ability to subtly inflect the notes he played with an individuality that few have ever approached . His style was akin to a wrecking ball slamming into a building but also encompassed the delicate touch of a feather : one reason he was given the well-deserved nickname `` The Velvet Bulldozer. '' . Many have sought - and still seek to - emulate these elements in their playing . As Robert Palmer astutely pointed out in the liner notes , Albert 's playing is never cluttered . On this album he plays uptempo jazzier tunes , scorching slower blues , and songs where he combines his approach with music stylings then current ( circa 1978 ) .More could be stated but perhaps the best tribute to Albert King was from Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh ( who also eulogized him at his funeral in December 1992 ) . Joe Walsh stated quite bluntly that `` Albert King could blow away Eddie Van Halen with his amp on standby '' . Obtain this CD and listen to King live employing the various elements of his unique style . If you are infected with `` MTV-itis '' be warned : the songs on this disk average about 8 minutes per with some surpassing 10 minutes long . But then if you enjoy good music and biting soulful playing , you will not be disappointed .	1
Ok , first off , Enya rocks . If you do n't know that already , go buy her compilation album , Paint the Sky with Stars . It will enlighten you . If you already know how good she is and you are n't desperate to buy everything she 's ever done , there is something wrong with you.All right , so maybe Enya is n't for everyone . But you will likely appreciate her if you have ever been truly moved by a dreamy piece of music . She is soft , soulfull , and dynamic . And yeah , so her music all sounds the same , but when it 's so good , how can you complain ? Highlights from The Memory of Trees include & quot ; The Memory of Trees & quot ; , & quot ; Anywhere Is & quot ; , & quot ; Athair Ar Neamh & quot ; , and & quot ; On My Way Home & quot ; .	1
Okay , so I 'm spreading my # 1 rating around . & quot ; The Memory of Trees & quot ; for this Angel Man is my favorite of Enya 's . When it comes to her music , however , it is very difficult sometimes to pick # 1 . & quot ; The Celts , & quot ; if I absolutely had to narrow my choices down , would be second only to this album . The title track , like many of Enya 's beautiful lyrics , simply melts the world 's hatred off my soul in a mere ninety seconds . I am in disbelief that anyone could not fully appreciate Enya 's best work , often imitated but never truly equalled.Track six , my all time favorite single is a case in point : & quot ; I know that if I have heaven , there is nothing to desire ... & quot ; Who else has even dreamed of such perfect prose ? There is not a single track on & quot ; The Memory of Trees & quot ; that does n't have something unique , and whoever could possibly call that & quot ; depressing & quot ; must be truly depressed . This album is only one of the three possessions I would take with me if I suddenly had fifteen seconds to escape an approching disaster.I can not say enough good things about this album , except buy it , buy it , buy it ! I am having a difficult time as it is restricting the length of my commentary , except that this album is the closest thing to my home ( ... & quot ; angel & quot ; ... , remember ) that I have heard to date . If the album is disagreeable at first or sounds monotonous , do n't worry . That 's just Enya 's way of knocking off the hard shell that has encased your soul . Listen to this album with REPEAT ON for three months , and you should be a new person as a result . I am . Because of this single music work , without equal , I have changed only for the better . It may sound like corny philosophical meanderings , but it 's a fact.Everything that I have to say about Enya , whom I am very glad to call a beloved relative , will be nothing short of a love letter . Buy this album today ! Or anything Enya , for that matter .	1
This is my favorite Enya album , having to do more with a part it played in my life than just its stunning contents . I listened to The Memory of Trees constantly during a very blue period of my life , when I got my heart broken for the first time . All of the myriad emotions running through me found a voice in songs like Hope Has a Place and Once You Had Gold . Even On My Way Home tugged at my heart ; it conjured up hope in the wake of a bittersweet seperation . And , if that were not enough , I felt the reverberation of Tea-House Moon and the title track in the core of my being . Through it all , there was Enya , an artist without parallel . Her grace , serenity , and raw emotion washed over me , healing my bruised and fragile heart.Sorry for the soppy , sentimental words , but this is the God-honest truth . I like each and every one of Enya 's albums , some more than others , but The Memory of Trees will always stand apart from the rest , for me personally . Some people will find the album too sad and bittersweet , but I 'm convinced that more will treasure it for a long time to come .	1
Music from Heaven ; her songs touch your soul like none can .	1
Many times , AND WITH GOOD REASON , the `` new age '' label gets slammed for lacking originality and conviction . Enya is not an artist who blends in with the rest and this release is , in my opinion , her best to date.There is certainly an ethereal quality associated with new age and Enya is certainly a new age artist , but she has strong writing skills and gorgeous and very unique voice that sets her apart from her peers . And if you look at what is being released these days , many groups are ripping off elements of her uniqueness and plastering them on down tempo songs with session singers who do an ok job of copying Enya , but do n't reach the depths of beauty and passion that only Enya seems to find.What makes this a 5-star review for me is that the songs work independently and even better as a cohesive set that keeps you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know . I know this sounds ridiculous , but take this review from someone who usually prefers an entirely different type of music . Al the songs are great and although this CD can be great background music , it works even better when it 's in the forefront of your attention because the production work is so masterful.Many artists/fans are critical of the work that the producer brings to the table , but I am always very appreciative when the final product does not sound like it was manufactured by an assembly line , but rather reflects a balance of the artist 's intent with the listener in mind.Thanks for reading and I would like to thank ALL reviewers as their opinions ( even when I disagree ) give me clues as to what I may like and even more importantly provide exposure to artists who I may have missed if it were not for work . Also , thanks to Amazon.com for providing this forum as I think that it clearly benefits the company , but ultimately it also can be a great place for a potential buyer to find his or her next favorite CD .	1
Some people wonder if a 24kt Gold CD is worth buying . Let me tell you , being that I own the regular version as well , it 's almost like going from stereo to Dolby Digital . This disc also comes with a bonus booklet with some very beautiful pictures of Enya , many I 've never seen elsewhere , with japanese writing all over it . This has my 2nd favorite cover ( Shepherd Moons is my first ) . After you see the cover and open the case the inside reveals the same picture but with her head down ( as if she is crying ) . Pax Deorum sounds really good . Many people do n't realise it was used as music for the trailer to the film , Dragonheart . One technical note for those people buying Paint The Sky With Stars to save money , when you buy it , the China Roses track is cut off by Shepherd Moons . You only get the complete fade out here on this disc . There 's not more to say other than I am 25 and have been listening to Enya since I was a teenager . She 's beautiful and has the voice of an Angel . I wish more female vocalists would aspire to be more like her instead of , well , you know . Bottom Line:24kt Gold Discs are worth it .	1
What an enchanting collection this is . I fell in love with Enya 's music right from her first hit ` Orinocco flow ' and have been a fan ever since.Enya 's haunting and ethereal voice , coupled with rich , magical musical arrangements , layered dreamy sounding backing vocals , and lyrics sung in English , Latin , and Gaelic , set her aside form all other new age artists.Opening track ` Memory of trees ' is a beautiful instrumental with angelic voices flitting in and out. ` Anywhere is ' has an upbeat tempo , cutting strings , lush instrumentation , and poetic lyrics. ` Tea-house moon ' is an instrumental with a Chinese sound . Magical keyboards ( I think ) set against a delicate backdrop . Beautiful ! Just as delicate is ` La So & ntilde ; adora ' with very ethereal vocals against a gently brooding soundscape . Then there 's the tender piano instrumental ` From where I am'. ` Pax deorum ' ( sung in latin ) will have you checking to see you 're not in a monastery . Very religious sounding ! The absolute standout has got to be ` Athair ar nearmh ' ( sung in Gaelic ) . This song is stunning ! Angelic vocals , delicate piano , with delicate strings sweeping in and out . Mournful sounding but outstanding ! A magical , delicate , angelic experience !	1
It seems like anyone can listen to Enya . I 'm a college student , and I constantly hear her sweet vocals coming out of many dorm rooms . This album just proves that she still has it . I ca n't wait for the next one ! : )	1
I have been a fan of Enya 's music ever since the release of her second album Watermark and after listening to this particular offering , I can safely say it is the most exquisite music I have ever heard . The vocal layering and music form an absolutely magical sound that is uniquely Enya 's own ; and in combination with Roma Ryan 's poetic lyrics , this is definitely a match made in musical heaven . There are no misses here as every song can stand on it 's own merit . If you enjoy Enya 's music this is an absolute must have for your collection . She just keeps getting better ... .	1
The Memory Of Trees begins with the stunning titletrack , a great mix of voices and instrumental sounds , this is one of Enya 's best songs . Anywhere Is has a great rythm and is catchy . Pax Deorum is a latin song and very haunting . It 's like you 're in a storm finding a place to schelter . The fourth song is Athair Ar Neamh ; it 's sung in Gaelic , I think . I see that it means & quot ; Father In Heaven & quot ; . Thank you other Amazon reviewer ! From Where I Am is an instrumental track and it sort of lulls you to sleep . Then there is China Roses , a very romantic song about a dreamlike world , a sort of dream , I think . Hope Has A Place is another highlight of this record . Just great lyrics , and a soothing atmosphere . Thea House Moon is another instrumental track . It 's not my favourite track , but still good . Track number nine is Once You Had Gold . Listen carefully to the lyrics again , just magic . La Sonadora is a spooky ballad , sung in Spanish ? I do n't know , but another highlight of The Memory Of Trees . And then there is the final track , On My Way Home . On Paint The Sky With Stars.. The Best Of Enya , you can hear the edited version . This one is longer and much more beautiful . A great ending to one of the best cd 's ever made !	1
I bought this because my hubby heard one of their songs & he thought i 'd enjoy this band . Boy , do i ever enjoy their music ! I had to listen to the album a few times , but i 'm really into it now . The female lead vocals are great & the male vocals are blended nicely . The sound is varied : from more mellow to harder rock ... Each song is unique . The lead vocals go from singing to screaming ( at times ) , but it 's all put together so well . The music 's over/under-tones & her voice reminds me of several bands/artists , such as : Evanscence , Crisis , Scarling , Veruca Salt , & some male bands too . This album seems to have a lot of influences & would appeal to those who like rock , alternative , metal , even pop . My only complaint is that the songs are shorter ; the album is just over 30 minutes in length . I wish they would of lengthened a couple of the songs & put some more on the album . Overall very entertaining & awesome album/band-i recommend them !	1
I 've been reading the reviews for this CD and have seen all the comparisons and so far most of them are way off . Kittie ? No way , Lacey ( Flyleaf ) screams very little while Morgan Lander ( Kittie ) screams nonstop and even roars . Avril Lavigne ? Um , no . Let it be known that Flyleaf is their own band , with one of the most distinctive vocalists I 've heard in a long time . On my first listen I would n't have given this more than a four star rating because I thought that maybe the band as a whole was trying a bit too hard in places , but after countless listens I 'm hardpressed to recall any truly weak moments . At moments this CD feels like nothing more than pop with a heavy backdrop , and other times it has an actual heavy feeling , and that 's what keeps this CD from getting bland.Flyleaf is one of the few bands that plays this type of music and can keep it fresh . Take Evanescence ( for no reason at all ) , their debut was wonderful , but once you listened to it enough it got boring . Since I bought this CD I 've played it countless times and still love every song just as much as the first time I heard them . You could take just about any band on the radio right now and put this CD against one of their 's and Flyleaf will no doubt blow it out of the water . Song for song , this CD does not disappiont . From the heavy opening of I 'm So Sick , to the introspective There For You , this CD covers both ends of the emotional spectrum.My favorite songs are Fully Alive , Cassie , All Around Me , There For You , and Breathe Today . I 'm sure most people can find something to like about this CD , and band , but I will also say that Flyleaf may not be everyone 's cup of tea , for instance when I first heard it I thought Lacey 's voice got a bit agitating . But it 's also Lacey that gives this band a lot of credibility . Her lyrics are excellent and so unlike what 's out today . There 's even times where the band steps up and makes some great melodies that go far beyond the typical radio band riff , so kudos also goes to them . So basically you 're getting one of the best releases of 2005 with this CD , so enjoy it .	1
it is very rare for me to find a cd that I can play the whole way through and enjoy and this is one of them . I love this cd ! !	1
This is a pretty cool cd ! It 's all rock and a little bit of screaming , plus theres some cool acoustic songs at the end of the cd ! The riffs are catchy as well as the lyrics ! You will definetly get into it and be movin to the beat ! I would say they will play this CD on the classic stations 20-30 years from now ! haha ! Get this cd !	1
I heard a cut from this album on Sirius satellite radio and immediately went out and bought the album from iTunes . I really did not know what to expect but I have been listening non-stop for the past three days at work.The music is very hard and driving but still very easy to listen to over and over . The vocals are amazing and the music is incredible as well . I can not find anything that I really dislike about this album and I like every single track , which is a pretty rare find lately.I think that the comparisons to Evanescense are way off mark . There is nothing alike between the two save the fact that they both have female lead vocalists , but in my opinion Lacey blows Amy out of the water in all resepects . I really hope that there is going to be more to come from this band as they are one of the really great ones out there currently.Many people may be put off by the fact that they are a `` christian '' metal band , but they are on tour with Korn and I am making the journey to see them just to see Flyleaf ( although I do like Korn ) .Give this one a chance and I suspect that you will not be dissapointed .	1
I heard the single , `` I 'm So Sick , '' on the radio a few weeks ago . I bought the self-titled album . I went to their concert a couple of hours ago ... And now I ca n't help but write a review.Flyleaf is young , raw , still growing , and full of energy . On stage , they are passionate and fun to watch . In their songs , they are honest and searching , spiritual and hopeful . Are you tired of bands who wallow in despair or rage ? Flyleaf goes to those places and then comes out on the other side . They show there is a way out.Most of the songs on this album are worth repeat spins , and two or three are exceptional . Lacey 's voice is able to draw you in with fragile emotion , then jar you to life with an unleashed scream . I love that in a female singer -- and it 's a rare trait . There is something here on this album for most rockers . I believe , in the future , we 'll see more and even better things from Flyleaf .	1
I picked this up because the local radio station , 897powerfm.com , plays some of this bands songs on the air . I LOVE this entire CD ! What GREAT vocals and lyrics ! I am a new fan of this band and I look forward to picking up their EP and future releases.The best way that I can think of to describe them is Broomtree vocals with Tree 63 or Benjamin Gate tunes . The lead singer 's voice is incredible , I admit that I like the fact that a woman can yell like that.This one is going on my MP3 player and on my review forum at [ ... ]	1
Ilove this band , i would have gven this 5 stars , but the Acoustic videos on the dvd are not hat great , the videos of the free singles , helped save this fom 3 stars.If your a fan like me , this is a good cd/DVD pack overall .	1
I fell in love with `` Im So Sick '' immidiatly after seeing the video.I bought the CD and can not put it down .	1
Flyleaf has found quite a bit of success touring with bands like Deftones . Their lead singer is female , and she is tiny at that . But do n't let that turn you off . This is n't another average girl fronted metal band , like Kittie . She is able to convey so much emotion into every song it is unbelievable . It is a very solid cd . No filler . I 'm excited for their next one too , because I think they have tons more potential . I mean , they 've already sold over 500,000 copies of this one , which is pretty darn good . I do n't think that everyone will like them , though . But if you 're looking for something different as far as vocals go , try them .	1
Flyleaf 's self-titled debut seems promising in the tight structure of the songs and the catchiness of the melodies in them . For the most part , this CD is somewhere between poppy metal and more melodic rock . The guitars work excellently together at creating heavy riffs that sound catchy at the same time . Their lead singer is a female , so some of the songs have a more gentle sound to them ( like the ballad `` There For You '' ) and the somewhat-awkward `` So I Thought '' . They know how to write a catchy song , though , and mixing the hooks with the occasional heavy-metal scream and grinding guitars works very effectively on almost every song . Downsides : The frontwoman 's voice can get too lulling at a few points , as if she 's trying to sing you to sleep . That really grinds the songs to a halt . Also , the best songs are far too short , and the entire CD is only 33 minutes long . That 's not quite enough to make it great , since I got the impression they were afraid expand theirselves musically . I noticed that the lead singer 's voice basically controls the album : I thought the musicians could have stepped into the forefront a bit more . For the most part , though , the entire album is a catchy listen that should please both metal and pop fans .	1
i saw flyleaf a few nights ago in baton rouge , they opened for cold ( and 10 years did as well -- awesome by the way ) . i bought there album that night and listened to it the next day . i was pretty impressed with the album . i see most people say the EP is better than the LP -- i may buy the EP because i like harder music . but the band is great ( lacey 's vocals are unique and pretty pleasing , but the band is just AWESOME -- very catchy music ! ! ) . all in all , flyleaf 's debut album is a pretty good buy ( i got it for $ 10 and its well worth it ) , and i recommend it . Hopefully this isnt the last we 've heard from the group , and hopefully they continue to grow and make even better music in the future ! !	1
I have n't been able to stop listening to this cd for three days . it 's got a very new sound to it , which is awesome . It 's not bland or boring at all , unlike some cd 's these days . All four of the band members are great musicians , and will be around for many years . Now i 'm going to rate each song ... [ 1 . REBIRTHING.10/10 ] [ 2 . THE LAST NIGHT.9/10 ] [ 3 . YOURS TO HOLD.8/10 ] [ 4 . BETTER THAN DRUGS.10/10 ] [ 5 . COMATOSE.9/10 ] [ 6 . THE OLDER I GET.6/10 ] [ 7 . THOSE NIGHTS.7/10 ] [ 8 . FALLING INSIDE THE BLACK.8/10 ] [ 9 . SAY GOODBYE.7/10 ] [ 10 . WHISPERS IN THE DARK.10/10 ] [ 11 . LOOKING FOR ANGELS.9/10 ] .	1
This CD was the last out of three to come . Although it took a bit longer to get to me , it did come within the time frame originally given . I may have been anxious to get it because Skillet has some beautiful songs on it . I enjoy it very much , thankyou . CL	1
This CD rocks . Crank up the volume and jam while you drive . The lyrics penetrate your soul , and the message points straight to Jesus.Good stuff .	1
This is a very different cool heavy rock/metal band with huge rocking tunes , and their style often changes slightly from each album . This one is one of their more heavier ones with some great tunes , thoughtful lyrics . Good rock metal to try .	1
I 've been a Skillet fan for years now , and this is most definitely their best CD to date ! VERY good . I love the use of strings in a few of their songs , like `` Rebirthing '' - what a song to open with ! : - )	1
Great beat . No bad language . Great to run to . I highly recommend this band . I will be buying their latest soon !	1
This CD is from Skillet , a rocking christian rock band . Their singles from this album can be heard on christian radio stations .	1
Skillet is no new band to the music scene , and yet this CD got them more exposure that they deserve . This CD is arguably their best yet . Catchy melodies , agressive backdrop , and sweet guitar solos to add the spice on top . If you are new to the band , check out this CD and work backwards . If you 've heard of Skillet before but forgot about them , I encourage you to give this CD a listen .	1
This album is a great album for your collection . I have known skillet for a long time and have all their cd 's and I recommend it . If you struggle with drugs or know someone that does the song `` Your Better than Drugs '' is a good song to listen to or to give to someone to listen to . I personally know people that this album has helped them through struggles they are having in life and not only that the music is just very well written and performed if you have ever seen them live . SRE records has done a great job with this release along with Disciple , Decyfer Down , Jonah 33 , and Flyleaf . Skillet 's Comatose album is by far their best so far in my opinion and God is using it for His benefit .	1
This is suprisingly good . Most bands today have the problem of sounding the same . However , this album is actually really good . It 's not really original , but I like it anyway . The girls voice in this makes it really interesting .	1
Skillet is a great hard rocking band with a much needed message . The words are heartfelt and powerful , helping one to understand life 's many challenges	1
So a must own for any Skillet fan . Skillet is able to use great rock beats to uplift and keep putting truth in every song amazing rock for any music fan .	1
This is one of my favorite CDs . for the full experience , though , you have got to see them live ! ! ! !	1
Skillet 's sound changed a little on this one and I support that but I still prefer Collide . I really enjoy the combination of heavy guitars with violins and stuff . The message in these songs is the best part though . Songs like Rebirthing ( the best track on the album ) , Comatose , and Falling in Black combine deep lyrics with great rock music .	1
This is an addictive listen , with nothing that you 'll want to skip while listening . This band may call itself christian , but the music on this cd is accessible to non-christians as well . You wo n't hear god-this and god-that anywhere in the lyrics , which ( I can tell you ) is refreshing ; as so much christian rock has an amazingly inspiring sound , but falls short lyrically . Buy this album now . It is one of the most solid releases the genre has ever known . And it will constantly find its way into your ears again .	1
I had the CD Alive , then decided to go back in time and get Comatose . Awesome CD . Skillet rocks ! Among the best of Christian Rock bands out there today .	1
Let me start off by saying this album is absolutley amazing ! ! ! ! There are no fillers here . Every single song could be released as a single ! I highly recommend this album to all lovers of Christian rock . This album defintley ties with there 2004 album `` Collide '' for there best album yet . Skillet is really the best christian rock band out there hands down ! From the very moment you hear the first track and single `` Rebirthing , '' you 'll be left absolutley speechless and amazed at how wonderful and breathtaking it is . It will suddenly make a christian remember the first time they accepted Jesus Christ into there life as Lord and Savior , and became a new creation and are now living for love just as he did.So please do yourself a favor and buy this now ! You wo n't be disappointed by any means ! ! Skillet continues to deliver great awesome Christian rock tunes with each album and this album continues that . BUY NOW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Nice worship CD , very uplifting and energizing , keeps our eyes focused on Christ , our salvation . Chris is one of my favorite musicians and he does not disappoint with this one.See the Morning	1
I got this cd recently and I have been listening to it ever since I got it . Every song is beautiful and wonderful . I think a few of my favorite songs on here is `` Everlasting God , '' `` Amazing Grace ( My Chains are Gone ) , '' How Can I Keep Singing , '' and `` Made to Worship . '' This is my first Chris Tomlin cd and it 's beautiful .	1
Wow . This one might take a lot of listens to be comfortable with , but it 's definitely worth the effort . In 1972 , Robert Fripp must have decided he 'd had enough of `` Islands '' -style directionless classical-rock noodling/cacophony , because `` Larks ' Tongues '' , recorded with a completely new band of highly professional musicians , is focused and hard-hitting . Former Yes drummer Bill Bruford really widens his scope on `` Larks ' '' and plays like he never had before , John Wetton contributes his cool voice and great bass playing , violinist David Cross brings in an unexpected but effective element to the music , and mad percussionist Jamie Muir bangs and rattles away on everything in the studio that he can hit.Of course , at the center of the band stands Robert Fripp , who tears up `` Larks ' Tongues In Aspic Parts One and Two '' with the guitar he seemed to have forgotten about since recording `` In The Wake Of Poseidon '' . The title track instrumentals are terrifically threatening , and although they might sound like random improv at first listen , they are actually well-constructed pieces . `` The Talking Drum '' , which leads into `` Larks ' Tongues Part Two '' , is probably my favorite of the album ; slowly building from a quiet drum-beat to a raging rocker with Bruford and Wetton holding down the piece , Fripp ripping away with his riffs and Cross swooping about with his violin.The remaining three tracks are actual songs , albeit with much jamming included . `` Exiles '' is a beautiful ballad , and while John Wetton ca n't beat Greg Lake at belting out such epic lines ( but who can beat Greg Lake at this style ? ) , he gives a great performance anyway . The playing is excellent as well . `` Easy Money '' steers more into rocking territory , with some aggressive vocals and a long mid-song guitar-led jam that does n't get boring for one second ( I especially like the part around 6:02 or so , although I could n't tell you why . ) I ca n't forget to mention the funny sound effects throughout the song , which I guess are courtesy of Jamie Muir . Finally , `` Book Of Saturday '' is really quiet and unremarkable when compared with the rest of the album , but it 's a nice ballad in any case.Despite all my praise , this really should n't be your first King Crimson record . One album reviewing website called `` Larks ' Tongues '' `` unfriendly music '' , and I do n't think there 's a better description for it . This album is cold , inaccessible and not inviting at all . You 'd better go for `` In The Court Of The Crimson King '' or maybe `` Red '' first if you 're not familiar with the band . If you find yourself loving these albums , however , do n't hesitate to get this one . Listening to `` Larks ' Tongues In Aspic '' is quite a jarring experience , even after a hundred spins .	1
It 's no secret that King Crimson was never known for a stable lineup . Even by the time Lizard came out , the band was basically Robert Fripp and whoever he could find at the time . Well , the band disintigrated by the time Islands came out . While many fans enjoyed Islands , some thought it was a bit weak , and the rock critics were obviously less than kind about the album . But of course even the criticisms of Islands are mild compared to their live album Earthbound that came out around the same time . But then Fripp decided to resurrect a new King Crimson . New drummer was Bill Bruford , fresh off of Yes , we can bet he left Yes because he sensed the band was to go off the edge with something like Tales From Topographic Oceans ( an album reviled by critics and divided by fans ) , so he left around the Close to the Edge tour in '72 . John Wetton was previously in a band called Family ( he 's on their 1971 album Fearless ) , and prior to that , Mogol Thrash ( which featured former Colosseum vocalist/guitarist James Litherland ) . Jamie Muir handles the percussion , and David Cross handles the violin and viola . Since Pete Sinfield was out of the picture , a new lyricist was brought in by the name of Richard Palmer-James . It might be a bit weird but this guy was an original member of Supertramp and appeared on their 1970 debut ( as a guitarist , if I 'm not mistakened ) . Anyway , Larks Tongues in Aspic starts off with the first part of the title track . I loved the sound of the kalimba ( an African thumb piano ) , and somewhere in the background is David Cross giving us some violin . Then the music gets loud with Fripp 's distorted guitar . It stays that way , until the music gets more experimental with violin . `` Book of Saturday '' is a vocal cut with Wetton handling the vocals . Pretty mellow and laid-back . `` Exiles '' is a Mellotron-centered piece that harkens back to the band 's earlier sound , almost like this album 's `` Epitaph '' . `` The Talking Drum '' features some talking drum in the background , but basically this is an experiment with Wetton 's bass and Bruford 's drum . For some reason , I could n't get in to `` Larks ' Tongues in Aspic Part II '' , it seems to exist as just guitar distortion , but the rest of the album is great , and for anyone in to Crimson , this is a must have .	1
With this album King Crimson sheds the gothic melodrama of earlier progressive groups and invents its own inimitable genre . Bill Bruford , whose idiosyncratic , off-kilter , but always right-on emotional percussion forms the backbone of the album . His pulsing , shimmering syncopations are enhanced by John Wetton 's thrumming bass , overlaid and brought into sharp focus by Robert Fripp 's powerfully creative musical innovations . Unlike many so-called classics of the era this album still sounds fresh and original 35 years later .	1
NOTE : THIS REVIEW APPLIES TO THE NOVEMBER 2012 15-DISC 40th ANNIVERSARY BOXED SET OF LARKS ' TONGUES IN ASPICI was skeptical at first about buying this 15-disc set , and at this writing I 'm still working my way through it , having surprised myself by purchasing it at a local retailer who was wise ( or foolhardy ? ) enough to order it as a stock item . LARKS ' TONGUES IN ASPIC was an important King Crimson recording , and not just for the band itself , but it just misses being as iconic as the original group 's debut , IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING ( and I did , indeed , buy that gargantuan box , and was eminently satisfied with it ) . But this set does do right by the album and the music , just the same , even if it does n't demand quite the same degree of fixation for as many people ( Note : IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING was a stunner of a record in the summer and fall of 1969 , and for years after -- as one can attest from experience , if it really got to the listener without scaring them off , it left one kind of `` whited out '' mentally , the equivalent to what happens to astronaut Dave Bowman 's eyes at the end of the `` star-gate sequence '' in 2001 : A Space Odyssey -- getting back to the topic at hand , LARKS ' TONGUES IN ASPIC has similar impact , and is even more daring and ambitious , but it also came out in a different environment , a little later and with a lot more competition in the field and , most importantly , AFTER Robert Fripp and King Crimson and everything they 'd helped kick-start in 1969 had already taken place [ including several fine , if not as bold or well-focused Crimson albums ] , though it was , indeed , head-and-shoulders above most of it . Hence , my initial resistance to its obvious allure , and skepticism ) .The remasterings/remixes of the studio material are awe-inspiring in their clarity , no argument there -- but most of the key parts of that are available on the more modest two-disc anniversary edition . What makes this box stand out , apart from the handsome packaging , is the inclusion of all of the live material of this version of the band from 1972/73 -- mostly from bootleg sources ( and much , if not all of it , previously available as separate CDs from Robert Fripp 's own on-line outlet ) -- this is total immersion , or as total as it 's ever likely to be , in this version of King Crimson . And then there are the studio rehearsals and early run-throughs which , for true fans of this record and this band , all combine to tell a story of how a record and a sound were built , as well as the construction of the foundation for what became the STARLESS AND BIBLE BLACK album that followed LARKS ' TONGUES . In other words , this is roughly the equivalent , in terms of this version of King Crimson , what the super-deluxe IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING was for that edition of the band.And this reviewer found the list of shows on the box , holding it there in my hand , quite overpowering -- it was like that scene in The Manchurian Candidate where Sinatra starts to trigger Laurence Harvey 's post-hypnotic programming using individual red queens in a game of solitaire and then confronts him with a whole deck , 52 red queens . . . . Anyway , the restoration work on the live material makes it all worthwhile in this listener 's book -- despite some harshness and imperfections , it 's all more listenable than it seemed back in the 1970s when these tapes were first circulated . And one can hear , from their very first public performance , just how substantial and inventive a band this was , and how they worked out the finer points of the repertory that became the album at hand . The concert material is not state-of-the-art sound or anywhere near it , but it gives us what we need to hear , and no one is going to feel cheated -- there are a lot of lesser bands that one wishes would assemble chronicles of their sound like this.Recommendation to all fans who can afford it : Plunge in -- head first -- and see how long you can stay under . You 'll love it -- moment by moment all of these beautiful musical nuances just appear , spontaneously , off the stage and out of the five personalities , and we get to hear how this version of the band evolved virtually from day-one . Every album of significance should only get this kind of treatment .	1
Just from the title you can tell this is going to be a little different from your average Rock & Roll excursion . And different it is . Is this even Rock ? Well whatever it is , I like it . This is probably my favorite KC album , although `` In the Court '' and `` Starless and Bible Black '' are barking at its heels . I do n't think words can convey the sound of this album so you 'll just have to listen to it , but be forewarned , it is not for everybody . If you tend to like the Top 40 stuff off the radio you may want to take a pass on this one . If you tend to be a bit more adventurous might I suggest a darkened room , an easy chair , and the volume cranked rather high . Herbal supplements are optional .	1
Compared to In The Court of the Crimson King , and even In The Wake of Poseidon ; Lark 's Tongues definitely measures up . The band was essentially playing in the style of their earlier hits when they made this one . If that was their aim , then I would have to say that they accomplished their aim . Notice that the volume is n't cranked on this one , and that is the sound of music before we had compressors . I personally am fed up with the prevalence of compressors . I think that they take away all the dynamic from music , and spoil it just to be loud . In my opinion , if I want my music loud , then I 'll just turn up the volume , and there is no need to compress anything.If you want to know where bands like Dream Theater and so many others got their sonic ideas , bands like King Crimson and Return to Forever were definitely influential to their sound.Also , you may notice that I essentially wrote the same review for both Lark 's Tongues and Islands . That is because I felt that the music of both of these cds is very similar . Which is not to say that these albums are identical , but in my opinion , by the instrumental music alone , one would not be able to tell perhaps an unreleased B-side one of these cds from the other . They are essentially the same in greatness .	1
The little chime sound you hear at the beginning is a kalimba , an african thumb piano . After being hypnotized by this you will then hear a very well played , quiet , fluttering violin ( the sound of lark 's tongues ? ) Do n't turn the volume up too loud here , because you will split your speakers when the crescendo of acid guitars come wailing into your brain . This is music of a sort you have n't heard , a classic example of acid rock , classical mixed with rock , and some sophisticated noisy percussion and jazz thrown in . Hey , relax , thats just the first track .	1
I am listening to it right now . KC does n't compromise . They are the Wagner of rock.Buy this and the complete King Crimson catalogue . If you do n't like it , one of your grandkids will . Like lots of great music , King Crimson is n't appropriately revered in its time . One day , you 'll be able to walk into any bar and there will always be least one Crimhead in the room.Music is my life . The music I am most passionate about is King Crimson.KC forever !	1
Jamie Muir , Crimson 's wild Scottish percussionist , entered a monastery soon after making this album . Perhaps he felt that nothing besides God could surpass this piece of perfection . This was Crimson 's greatest line-up , recorded at a time when a huge audience was prepared to make the effort to appreciate this kind of music . As drummer Bill Bruford said , Crimson was one of the few bands where you could play in a time signature of 17/16 and still get to stay in a decent hotel . Almost no-one , short of Radiohead , tries to create music like this any more.The opening track 'Lark Tongues in Aspic Part One ' perhaps comes closest , of all studio tracks , to the live Crimson of the time . ( You need to buy THE GREAT DECEIVER to discover precisely what live Crim was . ) It 's an extraordinary track , actually a very tight composition , but on the first few hearings , it sounds like a disjointed assembly of unrelated improvised duets and trios . ( You even gets to hear a lark , although the mood of this track is utterly different from Vaughan Williams ' 'Lark Ascending ' . ) David Cross 's violin provides the continuity . ( Why do so few of today 's groups use violin ? When I think of Van Der Graaf 's Graham Smith , Curved Air 's Darryl Way and Eddie Jobson , it seems to be a lost art . Maybe kids just do n't automatically get taught violin in schools any more . ) Although not a guitarist , John Wetton was an excellent voice-and-bass replacement for Greg Lake . I suspect he also composed the more melodic tracks ( e.g . 'Book of Saturday ' ) on this epic album.LARK TONGUES IN ASPIC was the first of a brilliant trio of classic albums , consisting also of STARLESS and RED . None of the single-CD Crimson compilations that I 'm aware of contain any LARKS ' TONGUES tracks . And rightly so . You have to hear this classic album in its entirety .	1
This is the band reformed after a year 's breakup with a new lineup except for Robert Fripp . Joining the band for this classic are ex-Yes Bill Bruford on drums , ex-Family John Wetton on bass and vocals with David Cross on violin , viola , and mellotron and Jamie Muir on all kinds of percussion . This is the band 's best album since Lizard . Both Larks , Tongues ( parts 1 & 2 ) are unlike anything I 'd heard before or since , Book Of Saturday is a nice laid back jazzy tune . Exiles is a very pretty ballad that had been an instrumental back in the band 's early days . Here it has lyrics written by new lyricist David Palmer-James . Easy Money which is a great rocker . A must have for anyone who even likes music .	1
This latest version of Larks Tongues is so close to the 30th anniversary version in how it sounds that I almost have to say I do n't hear a difference . I know , all of you Crimson folks out their are just a rabid as all of you Gentle Giant fans reading this . If it 's a new version you MUST have it . NO Choice . Well I can say that I did notice a huge difference when I listened to the 5.1 . That is where this release really shines . Get it for that and the videos . You have NO choice !	1
Larks Tongues in Aspic is the third King Crimson album you should buy ( RedandIn the Court of the Crimson Kingshould be your first and second purchase , in that order ) . This album features the classic Crimson tune `` Easy Money , '' as well as the two part `` Larks Tongues in Aspic . '' Like most Crimson albums , each track is rather lengthy , with the exception of the short ( 2:56 ) `` Book of Saturdays . '' This can only be a good thing , since there 's more music to love . I highly recommend this album for any progressive rock fan , or for anyone exploring the King Crimson experience .	1
like all the other KC remasters , stephen wilson unwraps the hidden gems of this rock masterpiece , bringing to a new life and enjoyment level	1
This album is definately in my top10 with such masterpieces as Ozzy 's Diary of a madman , Dylan 's Slow train coming , Alice Cooper 's Dada , Rolling stones ' Let it bleed , Genesis ' Lamb lies down on Broadway etc . This is simply a great mix of imagination , exotic instruments and virtuosity . Exiles is so full of passion and tears flow from eyes when I hear its beautifull melody . Violins are just from heaven on that track . Talking drum builds up slowly , but it grows to a powerfull instrumental track with eastern influences . It is the almost hypnotic tune and I love animal voices in the end . Book of saturday is probably the most simple song K ? ng Crimson have ever done along with Matte Kudasai , but it works as well as more progressive tunes.Easy money is a song about prostitute and lyrics are kind of clever , but it is also probably my least favourite track on the album . I think vocals are kind of lame , but it is still excellent track and it has brilliant windinstruments section and some great riffs . But the real meat of this album is the two instrumental tittle tracks . Larks ' tongues on aspic part one goes from exotic percussions section to heavy metal to chamber music just in 13 minutes . It contains so many moods and some Classical violin by David Cross . The song is unpredictable as hell . You never know what happens next . The second part of the tittle track is brilliant combination of crunchy Heavy metal riffs and screechy violin . Violin sound is so schreechy and loud in some places that it could explode your ears . It is no wonder that it is standard on their live shows . It is so dynamic song.In the nutshell this is the very original and diverse album . You get basic rock 'n ' roll on Book of saturday , heavy metal influences , eastern music and countless moods ranging from mellow to aggressive to mysterious . This is a very imaginative work and more mysterious than many psychedelic albums . This album inspired me to write a poem with the same name in Finnish . I personally think this is the best Crimson album .	1
To worship at the sonic temple of King Crimson always meant dispensing with preconceived notions , and Fripp and company proved more than ready to lay waste to their more staid contemporaries on this 1973 masterwork.The recording itself , which won technical awards way back in 1973 , is clear as bell : every nuance from Jamie Muir 's eccentric percussion to John Wetton 's vocal growls comes through crisply ( no doubt a better vocalist for his going at it with Roger Chapman during his stint in the mighty Family before joining KC . ) Bill Bruford obviously loved this band , and unfettered of the art-rock formula that Yes was starting to fall into , he unleashes some powerful drumming that , along with Wetton 's meaty bass lines , help hold together this sonic supernova . David Cross sometimes plays against Fripp 's leads with great effect , his violin swooping and soaring like a flying prehistoric reptile chasing its next meal.And Fripp , well , praise be to whatever the source of his muse here , for it is both balm to the jaded nerves of those disenfranchised by the corporate takeover of FM radio and anathema to the lobotomized program directors who have laid waste to creative playlists.I 'm keeping a star back because the two versions of the title track sometimes veer off so far that the music dissolves into a vapor . Still the explosiveness of Easy Money clears the mind and feeds one 's bellicose instincts , while Exiles calms the soul of the wanderer and hermit found somewhere deep down in us all.Like any King Crimson outing , `` Larks Tongues in Aspic '' is not everyone 's cup of tea , but everyone needs to sample this one as a reminder of the power of imagination fueled by technique .	1
This album changed my life . I did n't think music could sound this way . But it can ! This has been the gateway to tons of great music , led by this giant avant rock record . Thank you John , Robert , Bill , David . Thank you so much .	1
Robert Fripp 's musical vision is a dark , uncompromising place . There 's no room for frivolity in this dense , shadowy but fertile undergrowth . This is serious music . Songs to listen to reverently ; with headphones , in solitude . Ideally , Lark 's Tongues ... should be experienced one-on-one . And turn up the volume - there are a lot of quiet bits - specifically the intros to Exiles , Talking Drum and Lark 's Tongues Part 1 - can easily waft by in the background if , like me , you generally listen to music at modest volume.And here 's the crux - whereas Red comes charging out of the speakers like an enraged rhino , Lark 's Tongues is a restrained creature by comparison , its subtleties demanding more a active listening ear . This is one of the reasons why this remastering is so crucial ; the crystal clear top-end provided by the digital remastering is crucial for getting the most out of this album.As with most King Crimson albums you get long meandering - but never self-indulgent - passages punctuated by proper songs with verses and choruses . Exiles and Easy Money are both classics . Book of Saturdays is a particular delight . The title track needs no further introduction , forming an integral part of Crimson live shows to this day.I would definitely class this as one of Crimson 's best albums , better than Red , even . David Cross 's violin , Jamie Muir 's imaginative percussion work , Robert Fripp 's fluid guitar playing and Bill Bruford 's crisp drumming mesh perfectly to create the consummate King Crimson record . This is a rich , compelling and , dare I say , cathartic musical experience .	1
Maybe . One of the critics of my review of ITCOFKC suggests it is . Hard call.The fifth of the early KC sets , certainly , at worst , my second favored . Steven Wilson has worked his wizardry again , and the set is available here in a number of fomats.Of course , most prospective buyers will be KC afficionados , looking for further sonic insights into this seminal band , so I see no joy in a bar by bar analysis of the music , which even for its time and place , nay even for KC , truly new ; barely premonitored at all in its predecessors . I still hear it as Jazz-Rock Fusion , utterly alien to , say , the sonic landscape of Weather reoprt , or Colliseum , or RTF later . Seems , in my mind , a more organic soundscape , if you will allow.This is where Jamie Muir played with Fripp for a period.DVD A gives us a rare glimpse into the band playing ... video of & # 34 ; Life 's Rich Tapestry & # 34 ; , Exiles , and LTIA part one.Revelatory , and highly entertaining . Fripp may have become the & # 34 ; leader & # 34 ; of KC , but his stage presence was not exactly rivetting ! Muir , for all his eccentricities , is highly entertainingto watch.So , the video alone is worth the price of the set . Highly recomended .	1
Truly , one of the absolute best that has ever crept out of Robert Fripp 's mind/imagination/and song-writing skills . This album is scary-beautiful ! Scary-perfect ! Scary - bad trip for anyone who might be a little too depressed - I would n't recommend listening to `` Lark 's Tongues in Aspic . '' if you are depressed/and or upset . It captures the pure essence of scary drama , of stuff you may not want to readily hear . Fripp and King Crimson nail some very interesting emotions . They not only nail them , they snare them , and once that 's done , there is simply no escape ! ! ! It 's like dragging your head through a spider 's web ! For ALL Robert Fripp fans , Crimson 's `` Larks Tongues in Aspic '' is the epitome of Crimson at their absolute best . It still frightens me . it still gives me incredible goosebumps that I 'll never be able to simply shrug off ! ! I ca n't describe it in simple terms . I ca n't even explain it , at all ! Listen to it in the comfortable setting , and with ( hopefully ) an open mind . Otherwise , it will ruin your night.It 's magic . it 's perfection . It 's Fripp and company at their absolute best , and most sinister ! ! Truly , the most sinister that Crimson ever achieved , at least , with this line-up ! Enjoy ! ! You ca n't help but to enjoy it after several listenings ! Just beware . This is one hell of a beautiful and dark album - and after repeated listenings , you , too will come to greatly understand the darkness behind these recordings ! ! It 's simply Fripp at his best ! Though , how many , many times has Fripp been at his best ( throughout his numerous releases ) ? I 've lost count ... ... ... ..	1
This album really is something different , even when compared to the bands previous output . The production here is murky and searing , while Fripp 's guitars are crunchy and heavy , with a peculiar tone . the addition of david Cross on violin and Bill Bruford on Drums gives this album a more complex and polished sound than many of its predecessors . The nightmare soundscape of Larks Tongues in Aspic , Part One is the highlight track on the record and epitomizes much of its content well : delicate percussion slowly builds to a roaring crescendo , with Fripps guitar puring out rounds of spiky noise and Brufords drums thundering in the background , then slows into a violin interlude before winding back to a conclusion . The bands newfound tight focus and compatible personnel ( alhtough Muir would leave after this album ) imbues the album with a polish and maturity which belies the fact these musicians havent been playing together for years , much like another magic King Crimson record , 'In the Court of the Crimson King ' . While 'Larks Tongues in Aspic ' may not surpass this legendary album , it is still the strongest other thing King Crimson had produced at this point . I find it hard to imagine many bands today capturing the menacing tone , riddled with moments of beauty , that this record posesses.I highly recommend this album to prog fans or metal fans willing to broaden their outlook .	1
This album will blow your mind.It ca n't be described accurately . The closest I can get is that a bunch of classical musicians started listening to dark heavy metal albums and then recorded this one . ( I know that 's not what happened , but that 's what it sounds like ) .1 . `` LTIAP1 '' Starting with Muir-dominated twinkling sounds , a noise grows and builds , finally erupting into that classic `` DUH-DUH-DUH-DUH DUH DUH '' riff that lets you know you 're There . From what I 've heard , the rest of the track is improvised . Sounds fabulous.2 . `` Book Of Saturday '' In contrast , this track is extremely short . But who would have thought that a backwards guitar could escape from the stereotype of LSD-inspired tripping music and actually sound BEAUTIFUL ? 3 . `` Exiles '' Based on his performance in this track alone , William Bruford is the greatest drummer EVER . Restrained understatement combined with transcendent grace . Simple fills.4 . `` Eay Money '' Impressive build-up and fantastic solo . The sound at the beginning was made by David Cross plunging his fists into a bucket of mud and quickly pulling them out again.5+6 . Here comes the mind-gnawing part - the longest crescendo I know of . And so perfectly controlled too . The crescendo ends with the sound of the larks getting their tongues cut off . And then the amazing part 2 to the title track comes on . More fantastic drumming by Bruford . Cross ' best violin solo . And is that the last note of `` The Heavenly Music Corporation '' at the end ? But it 's great . My favorite Crimson album , even over their cosmically fabulous debut . It blows my mind .	1
Among the nicest Box Sets to ever be issued by any musical unit . Get it while you can find it . A Stunning display of presentation , performance , and value . The Video alone is worth half the cost of the box . This is something to celebrate . One of the peaks of 20th Century Music , epic , and timeless .	1
Steven Wilson is one of today 's musical geniuses . He sat with Robert Fripps and re-mixed the original master tapes onto numerous formats ... stereo , 5.1 etcetera . A DVD included can be played through your home theater system ... good stuff .	1
`` Lark 's Tongues in Aspic '' is one of King Crimson 's mostly highly acclaimed albums , and it 's also one of their best . While not as accessible as , say , `` Red '' , it explores numerous musical avenues that album does not . There are so many dizzying moods and textures here . It 's almost overwhelming on the first listen ( maybe the first several listens for some ) , but it is an exciting musical journey.The album is bookended by two mammoth instrumentals `` Lark 's Toungues in Aspic '' parts 1 and 2 . Part 1 begins with odd tribal percussion , building into a menacing heavy riff , and from there moving into odd passages of ambience . It is , I think one of the band 's best and most exciting instrumentals . Part 2 is more rock-oriented , with crushing rhythms and insane time signatures . It makes for a really great ending to the album.In the middle , we have three songs with lyrics , and one other instrumental . `` Book of Saturday '' is a short ballad , with great guitar and vocal melodies . `` Exiles '' is epic beauty , with acoustic guitars and strings , to create mesmerizing atmospheres . `` Easy Money '' is very catchy and slightly funky , with a hypnotic grooving intrumental section in the middle . `` The Talking Drum '' is a fun instrumental , with killer percussion , wicked basslines , and some nice melodic guitar soloing.With an album that is half instrumental ( actually , more than half ) , you might think there 'd be a sense of imbalance to it all , and with many bands , that might have been the case , but KC are masters of composition , and the way they bring everything together is simply magical . This is not from the Dream Theater camp of throwing in a bunch of fast noodling just for the sake of it . The music here is very rhythmically dense , with multiple layers and textures , and the interplay between the musicians is brilliantly organic . Bill Bruford 's subtle jazzy drumming , Jamie Muir 's alien percussion , Robert Fripp 's understated but complex guitar work , and John Wetton 's nimble basslines all fit together into a magnificent musical beast.The only bad thing about this album is the production . Some of the louder parts sound fuzzy and restrained , and the quieter parts are at times nearly inaudible . But that 's not really a big deal . After all , it was the 70 's , and production quality generally was n't as good back then as it is today.Ok , I 'm done yammering now . This is classic prog , and there 's nothing else like it . Recommended to all fans of exciting and unusual music .	1
Like the other Crimson reissues , this hits the mark perfectly . There really is n't more you could ask for . You get a remixed album , bonus tracks , original mix , DVD-Audio , audio DVD-Video and video . Again , the content on the DVD seems to go on forever and I still have n't finished exploring . Having both formats is good because almost no-one has DVD-Audio , although it 's obviously great if you do - I do n't , sadly . Steve Wilson does a great job with this project , an album often upheld as the band 's finest hour . I like many of the early albums but I also get why it 's so esteemed . First impressions of the 5.1 mix are that it 's fantastic , although I know that this is a matter of opinion in most cases . Crimson fans need it , casual listeners should get a single disc version .	1
What can be said about the King 's gospel music . Moving , heartfelt and truly spiritual . There are simply not words enough - you have to hear to believe .	1
I really like this Cd . It has a great range of gospel music that Elvis recorded . I think its great	1
Once Shatner 's Capt . Kirk character was described as 'a swaggering dictatorial braggart with delusions of godhood. ? That pretty much describes the performances on this CD ! If you love the 'Golden Throats ' type of comedy albums that were n't originally intended to be funny as they obviously are now , this is probably as good as it gets . Speaking of things that are unintentionally hilarious , given the ridiculous prices some people think they can get for a used copy , this CD just SCREEMS to be reissued . Until then , if someone offers a used copy at a reasonable price , who knows , someone out here may actually buy it !	1
Captain Kirk not only saves entire galaxies while impressing buxom beauties , but also manages to bare his soul in the most extraordinary collection of song and poetry the universe has ever seen . I dare you not to cry at the aching despair of `` Spleen . '' It 's okay , let it out , because in a few moments you will rejoice with sheer exuberance to the strains of `` Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds . '' Captain Kirk truly makes this psychedelic gem his own . I personally wish he would cover every Beatles song , because only with his magic touch could they achieve greatness.Bob Dylan and Shakespeare also benefit from the genius of Kirk , as do many others . I 'll be honest . I actually feel my I.Q . soar to superhuman levels when I listen to this disc . You owe it to yourself and society to bring this glorious masterpiece into your life . Under the guidance of the Captain , you too will be ... TRANSFORMED !	1
I found this DVD very inspirational in terms of motivating students of ballet to really work hard and strive for perfection . It was interesting and informative to see how the Russian students were picked and what happens to them in their schooling , up to a final performance where they are seen by the public and how they later become successful dancers . There is a wonderful segment showing the older student and how she learns old choreography from an older former great Russian ballerina , like it is handed down reverently from generation to generation . I loved the dancing of these students , as well as the joy they showed in their training .	1
For a friend who 's daughter is going to a well known ballet school . This is quite a nice piece , especially for someone considering a career as a dancer .	1
This DVD is specific to dance audiences . Good for children and adults interested in the history of the Kirov and how ballet dancers are selected from an early age . Very informative for students studying ballet seriously .	1
I love to listen to symphonies play classical music and I also love to watch a beautiful ballet . I enjoyed this dvd very much .	1
This is an entertaining video - I was delighted to see the concert clips of Janis singing . I 'm glad someone was recording her singing live in concert ; it truly shows the powerful and passionate performer that she was . However , I came away with the feeling that deep inside , Janis was really a sad person despite her success and free-spirit . This is evident in the interview at her high school reunion . One can also tell in the various interview clips whether she was on something , drunk , or straight.Janis was truly a unique and gifted yet tormented woman who , to this date , no other singer can surpass . She embodied the spirit of the 60 's and there will never be another like her . It 's such a shame she died so young .	1
If you can get a hold of this rarity - do . Someday this should be digitalized and remastered on to DVD , but right now we 're talking about them ol ' VHS tapes . What makes this worth your while ( the technically better footage of Janis singin ' and tearin ' up the joint can be found on the Monterey Pop complete collection , the Festival Express film , and extraordinary appearances with songs and interviews on the Dick Cavett compilation DVD ) is some good interview footage , some memorable moments from a European tour , one song ending up with the first several rows of fans dancing on stage with her , and most of all her triumphant return to the Port Arthur , Texas high school reunion to face the prom set that had once persecuted her - Pearl among swine . Enjoy .	1
Janis contains footage any Janis Joplin fan will appreciate . There are roughly a dozen killer live performances that really show how she belted out that emotion , including songs performed at Woodstock , Monterey Pop , and the Dick Cavett Show . There are also alternate versions of a few songs , such as a slightly different & quot ; Summertime & quot ; . You get a glimpse into the recording studio and even get to see clips from her ten-year high school reunion . This video is worth every penny , especially since video of Janis Joplin seems so scarce ... all that I have found is Monterey Pop VHS , Janis VHS , and the Woodstock DVD . Technically , I guess I could also count American Pop .	1
How disappointing that this remarkable performance film is not currently on DVD ( in North America anyway ) .What 's notable about JANIS is that while it 's billed as a documementary , it really IS a performance film ( mainly ) . After Janis died in 1970 , there was so much analysis over WHO she was and WHAT she meant , but the subtitle to this film ( at least for the video version is simply `` THE WAY SHE WAS , '' and after all the verbiage that proliferated in the early to mid-70s , it turns out that the best way to find out `` how she was '' really is to see her in her performance -- and while it 's truly unfortunate that there really all that much performance footage available from Janis ' relatively short career , the filmmakers managed to assemble much of the best available stuff for this 1974 classic rock'n'roll film.So , yeah , it 's technically a documentary , and the interview segments give you additional insight into Janis ' personage AND persona , the assumption is that the viewer pretty much KNOWS most of that stuff anyway . Do you need someone else telling you that beneath that tough exterior was a ( hyper ) sensitive interior ? I doubt it . In the intervening years , the `` mean mean mama '' of a tune like `` Turtle Blues '' has become inextricably mingled with the `` Little Girl Blue . '' Actually , it was ever thus . The trick was how those tensions all played out on stage and in the recording studio . It was in her performances that all her contradictions came out and blended seamlessly , for the most part.Interesting too that the clips from her final months show Janis to be in good voice , for the most part , and reasonably energized onstage . One of the reasons her management supposedly refused to have the existing footage of her Woodstock performance ( a bit more than a year before her death ) included in the documentary of the same name was that her performance was iffy at best . ( Some say she was strung out . ) The clips included here show her perhaps not at her absolute best , but solid enough . I do n't know how many bands you could say were in absolute top form at that event . And at the time , inspired performances seemed to be almost beside the point -- when what was INSPRIRATIONAL ( allegedly ) was just being there.As for the Full Tilt Boogie clips from her final year , well , it has been stated that that group WAS tight and , in many ways , the most technically proficient of all her three bands . Still some of the live tracks that surfaced in audio form on the posthumous JOPLIN IN CONCERT album showed considerable vocal strain . Turns out that some of the video included in the film is from the exact same performances ( the Canadian train tour ) and with the visual to augment the performances , you 'd swear she was in rare form . So she ca n't quite duplicate live the scathing wails from the studio version of `` Try , '' for instance . She 's working the band -- and the audience -- and ultimately making it WORK.Back in the late 60s , it would have been next to impossible to do a film of a single concert . The marketing of packaging an entire show on film or video seems to have mainly come about only later -- as a by-product of the home video revolution . In format , JANIS really is n't all THAT different from WOODSTOCK , MONTERREY POP or MAD DOGS AND ENGLISHMEN , say . It is basically a compilation of various performances , some on stage some from television , tacked together in less-than-strict chronologial order.But since it was compiled posthumously , there may well have been a temptation to do interview segments with , I dunno , people like Chet Helms or Sam Andrew -- or more peripheral figures in Janis ' life ( like Grace Slick , say ) or maybe people you 'd never heard of but who claimed to be close like publicist/biographer Myra Friedman . Wisely , they avoided that trap . By 1974 , I think people were all talked out ( and had heard enough ) about Janis ' troubled life and hard times . What they needed a sense of was what was it about her live performances that was so magic.If it ca n't quite capture the magic of an actual live performance , this film at least gives the contemporary audience a clue as to what all the fuss was all about . And it does a pretty good job of it . Kudos to filmmakers Howard Alk and Seaton Findley for taking the mainly-music approach . It may not tell the whole story . But it does pretty much show you `` the way she was .	1
The first sight I ever had of Janis Joplin was in 1977 when I was 11 years old , and with my pocket money one day I bought a book , 'The Illustrated Rock Almanac ' . The photos were tiny , but I marvelled at a woman who looked to be wailing like a wild animal - hair frizzy and flying , mouth open wide enough to swallow the rest of the 8 X 10 book ! Then my first experience of hearing her voice was in 1980 - I heard 'Move Over ' on the radio one Sunday lunchtime , and I could not continue eating my food ! I had n't heard a woman sound like that and I was enthralled . Then this film was shown on TV here in the UK and I finally saw Janis in action.Now , all these years later , I am still awed by her power , soulfulness , humour and raw sensuality as a performer . This film is a joy for fans and a fine collection of essential footage . Janis is unique . Still my Soul Sister No1 - She 'll never be eclipsed .	1
Jimmy Buffett . Live By The Bay.Good album , but fidelity suffers from live performance and VHS videotape . I wish it were on DVD or Blueray to improve the sound and video quality.Jimmy Buffett 's live shows are more singalongs of crowd favorites rather than introductions to new compositions , so if you have seen one show or viewed one tape , you have pretty much seen them all .	1
This tape is a must for any serious Buffett fan ! I have owned this tape for many years , and I still watch it over and over again . It was recorded in the mid-1980 's , so Buffett 's newer stuff is not included . However , most of the songs that have made Jimmy Buffett a household name are included . The video contains one hit after another . I especially liked & quot ; One Particular Harbor & quot ; . Buffett is awesome ! If you are a Parrothead , YOU MUST PURCHASE THIS TAPE !	1
It 's actually kind hard to understand -- at this point in r'n'r history -- that the Doors were thought of as being `` theatrical '' in their day . I mean , in the late '60s we had light shows and all , but the real rock extravaganzas did n't really get off the ground until the mid-70s ( with KISS and their ilk , although I guess you can create a case for people like Alice Cooper a bit earlier than that ) . The only little acting bit in this concert performance is a brief moment in `` Unknown Soldier '' when Robbie Krieger uses his guitar as a gun , and standing in for an entire firing squad , shoots Jim Morrison dead ( well , dead for about 30 seconds , but then he 's back to life with all his glowering intensity ) .Not exactly elaborate staging , but effective enough . Morrison 's affect had less to do with frenzied stage movement than with his sullen , sneering stance . Actually , his footwork -- such as it is -- is pretty stiff and uninspired . He 's not Prince ; not even Iggy Pop . The `` dance on fire '' bit was mostly in his head . And in yours . At the time , that seemed enough.There has been a lot of revisionist criticism of the Doors . Lots of people who were taken in by all the Lizard King jive are embarrassed about their youthful enthusiasm for Morrison 's brand of rock shamanism now . But this performance video shows that the group WAS tight and that Morrison did have a commanding presence and a solid if limited vocal delivery . For a brief moment , they were on to something . It was n't the revolution -- but maybe it was n't such bad theater after all .	1
This is one of the best Doors performances ever caught on film . It is the only COMPLETE filmed concert of theirs and shows Jim Morrison at his poetic , comic and visceral best . It also shows how The Doors were great in the intricate compositions of their sound and how they were also a great band because Morrison apparently had an idea of how to make a performance visually interesting in his movements , acting and singing . The performances of & quot ; When The Music 's Over , & quot ; & quot ; Light My Fire & quot ; and especially & quot ; The End , & quot ; show the talent these guys really had . Morrison sings the lyrics with intensity and the sense of their poetic worth . & quot ; Moonlight Drive & quot ; and & quot ; Five To One & quot ; ( which is connected in medley with & quot ; Backdoor Man & quot ; ) are especially well-performed . There is also a curious entertained feeling when Morrison begins reciting weird , but effective pieces of poetry . This is evident in the original execution of & quot ; The End , & quot ; where Morrison begins improvising ( I think ) , adding new words instead of the typical lyrics you hear in the album version . The band is also plays incredibly well . Ray Manzarek 's organ is haunting at times and the drumming of John Densmore and guitar playing of Robby Krieger are sub-par . This is an entertaining , well-done performance by a great band .	1
Deuter : try the soundtrack for the tunes cut short by the movie..five discs have all the movie stuff plus all the extra's.The movie itself is awesome . I 've been waiting for years ... my Laserdisc version holding me over until this fabulous release . The remaster with the improved sound is excellent and the extra stuff is a great bonus . David Lemieux ( dead archivist ) promises that they 'll be more to come from this set of historic '74 Winterland `` farewell '' shows.P.S. , the Dead wanted to document the ENTIRE Dead Head concert experience so all the audience coverage was deemed necessary as it aint a show without the Heads !	1

Disc 2 ( 175 minutes ) is packed with extensive never-before-seen concert footage , bonus songs , a `` making of the animated sequence '' documentary , a photo gallery , production notes , and more . An absolute must-have for Grateful Dead fans , filled to the brim with excitement , majesty , and thrilling music .	1
I seen the whole movie , and its great one , the music rules , etc , Anyway I really love music , by far the Grateful Dead and Frank Zappa , mothers of Invention R both of my all tyme favorites.Some of the instrumentals has elements that souinds like Zappa.Probably because both bands were made around the same time.Dead songs I can list prenty..Daek Star , Casey Jones , Freind of the devil , etc.And if you get the late 1980s album live one , some of the songs on second disc def . sounds like Frank Zappa doing the guitar but its Jerry Garcia . Space is the name of one of the songs.Anyway I 'm in my mid 30s and dislike most of todays crap music.Both of the guitarist Jerry and Frank rules over gayga , I mean Lady Gaga	1
Grateful dead movie a rock concert consists of two dvd'.the first being the movie in dolby digital lasting 132 minutes the second dvd has 95 min of classics like uncle johns band sugaree scarlet begonias i know you rider and dark star.this two disc dvd is terrific and is very highly recommended	1

( Jerry is gone , sniff ) a real cool experience - for sure . Dead-heads - buy it . curious ? buy it .	1
My favorite Ballo ! Katia Ricciarelli is a brilliant Amelia . Pavo and Quilico both sing very well . I recommend it highly .	1
Finding an appropriate locale for the setting of Verdi 's UN BALLO DE MASCHERA has been as replete with melodrama as is any of the composer 's operas . The original site was to be Sweden , after Eug & egrave ; ne Scribe 's libretto that narrates of the assassination in 1792 of King Gustavus III at a court ball . Planned to be held at Naples in 1848 , the premi & egrave ; re of UN BALLO was cancelled after an attempt upon the life of Napoleon III was made in Paris , a reactive Neapolitan government then banning any representation of regicide upon its stages . Verdi withdrew the work rather than accede to offered censorship , thereby becoming a nationalistic symbol of independence to all of those Italians who were striving for a unified Italy . Verdi produced the opera in Rome after agreeing to shift dramatic action outside of Europe , in this instance to Boston , where Gustavus was metamorphosed into a colonial Massachusetts Governor , but since an eighteenth century northern European court does not blend very well into Calvinist New England , no matter how skilled the writing , most subsequent productions have reverted to Stockholm . However , for this version , filmed during a performance of the Metropolitan Opera Company on 16 February,1980 , Boston with its environs is the setting once again , and although decor from Peter Wexler does seem to be a trifle grandiose , costumes by Peter J . Hall are designed beautifully , a viewer nonetheless realising that the cast might be clad as representations of provender for a salad bar for all of the actual effect that could have upon the melodious masterpiece of Verdi . This is the first Metropolitan appearance for Luciano Pavarotti as Ricardo , `` Count of Warwick '' and , for that matter , also the initial Met performance by Katia Ricciarelli as Amelia , while sprightly lyric colouratura Judith Blegen as the page Oscar ( after Thomas Gainsborough 's Blue Boy ) , is only in her second season with the Company , having debuted as Papagena in THE MAGIC FLUTE during the year prior , and each of these singers benefits from this pan and scan taping , not often a hospitable form of cinematographic method for opera . Pavarotti , who had not performed at the Met since its 1978 Tosca , is at the peak of his career , completely free of vibrato , and acts with enthusiasm . Ricciarelli 's voice is a trifle lacking in the thrust that is beneficial for singing Amelia , but she as ever displays a musicologist 's care for her part , while people 's choice basso Louis Quilico 's limited acting ability is less significant than his note perfect singing as Renato . Contralto Bianca Berini has a bit of trouble with the bottom range in her turn as Ulrica , the fortune-teller , but this results from a natural insufficiency rather than a poor performance , and dramatically she is sound . As Silvano , a sailor , sturdy John Darrenkamp is able to imbue his brief appearance with his vivid personality . Perhaps the brightest star of this production is maestro Giuseppe Patane , who leads his charges in the pit with intensity while giving perfect support to the singers during their most harrowing moments . The five act work has been altered into an opera for three acts for this version and many arias receive graceful treatment . There are very few negative aspects to this film : the customary applause after vocal solos that halts the action , freezing the singers ; tiresome taking of multiple bows by principals following each act , even when they have n't performed much at all ; sporadic lighting and camera placement flaws . Briefly released as part of a DVD set , now out-of-print , a Bel Canto VHS version is also no longer in print but yet can be found . It offers accurate subtitles and a valuable booklet that features notes by Andrew Porter .	1
for whatever reason with CHARLOTTES WEB it hase n't been digitally restored.this movie is just as good as any disney movie.but has n't got the same treatment as one of their animated features , i do n't knowwhy.i normally prefer the widesgreen versions of most movies but in the case of this original classic i believe the full screen is better its clearer and brighter.so until this movie gets a well deserved digital clen up full screen it is . the movie is as wonderful as ever great story for children of all ages.great music and a wonerful family film . the original classic dates back to 1972 but surpasses the 2006 live action nick remake .	1
Hello all ! I must first admit that I like a lot of the Disney animated films . Sleeping Beauty is probably my favorite . I also like a lot of the Japanese anime , of which Princess Mononoke and Ghost in the Shell and Akira are my favorites . This film , Charlotte 's Web , is actually a 1970 's Hanna-Barbara production and looks like one moreso than the graceful , delicate Disney animation style or techno Japanese style . That being said , I think this is one of the best animated films ever released.The reasons it succeeds are multi-fold . First , it is based on a classic children 's story and is very faithful to the story . Furthermore , it does a superb job telling the story - Disney films tend to concentrate around special effects and musical production numbers nowadays , but Charlotte 's Web emphasizes the story , which makes it a superior product . Granted , the animation is not up to Disney standard , but everything else is . Also , the songs are very good - I can still remember the lyrics and tunes now , even though it 's been ages since I saw the film . The story is not childish and does n't insult our intelligence - anyone who has read the EB White novel knows that the ending is rather poignant , and as I said , the film is quite faithful , as it deals with a lot of serious themes . To those who have not read the novel , it is basically about the friendship between a farm pig ( Wilbur ) and a common spider ( Charlotte ) and how she works to save Wilbur from the slaughterhouse.Okay , it 's a strange concept for a novel or a film , but it works ! And I 'm excited about the upcoming DVD . I 'm been waiting ages for this film to show up on DVD , and I 'll be the first to buy it in my neighborhood ! I highly recommend this film - your children will love it , and you will love it , too ! If you do n't believe me , pick up the classic children 's novel first and read it . This is one of those rare occasions where the film is AS GOOD AS the original award-winning book .	1
Wilbur , the pig , is the loveable main character in this animated film based on the classic children 's novel . Newborn runt , Wilbur , is saved from certain death by farm girl Fern , but it is really Charlotte , the spider , who becomes his friend and ensures he will live a long life . A year in the life of a pig and a spider was never so entertaining or sentimental as in this movie.This is a great movie that both you and your children can enjoy . There are some nice songs and the action is true to the book . Henry Gibson is sweet as Wilbur , Debbie Reynolds is a no-nonsense Charlotte , and Paul Lynde is very funny as Templeton the rat . A fun movie about the true meaning of friendship .	1
I first saw this movie about 20 years ago , when my children were young . It immediately became one of my 5-year old daughter 's favorites ( as well as one of mine ) . Now , I 've bought it on DVD for my 3-year old grandchild , and he absolutely loves it too . Though he 's a bit young to appreciate the story itself , he enjoys the songs and the some of the humor.The truth is that there is a lot to like about this cartoon adaptation of E.B . White 's classic story . It 's more of a ` family ' film than a kid 's story , as the script is literate enough so that adults can enjoy the movie , too . Henry Gibson as the voice of Wilbur and Paul Lynde as the sly Templeton are especially good , and Agnes Moorehead has a blast voicing the repetitive goose , Good story , good voice acting , good music ... the makers of the new live-action version of this story will be hard-pressed to outdo what Hanna-Barbera were able to put together in this classic .	1
Sometimes , while living our lives and going through our normal daily routines in adult life , we come across something by accident that takes you back to fond memories of your childhood . For me , one of those things is this timeless masterpiece by E.B . White . While channel surfing the other day , I came across an afternoon showing of this movie and found myself enjoying it just as much , if not more so , than when I used to watch it as a kid . Memories of happier , care-free days as a child all came flooding back and left me with a warm , fuzzy feeling and kinda made my day . I highly recommend you sharing this movie with any kid in your life and I guarantee it will be an experience that will forever be a part of their lives . The story is so endearing , powerful , and transforming ( particularly to young , impressionable minds ) that the experience of viewing it for the first time will be unforgettable.I also want to add that most reviewers commented on the dated animation quality in this film and I ca n't tell you how much I disagree with this . The movie 's story is the most compelling part of the movie as well as the superb acting voices used in the film . The pictures are almost secondary but absolutely adequate , and I believe , at times extremely appropriate . It goes to show how a timeless classic that is well done does not have to rely on special effects and visual wizardry to tell a good story . In my opinion , the artwork and animation suits the movie extremely well and is visually satisfying . It also helps keep the viewer focused on the story and its characters as opposed to the visual elements of the production.I love and appreciate this film now as an adult just as much as I did when I was a child and ca n't wait to someday share it with my kids . It 's a classic and should never be absent from any family 's video collection !	1
I can remember seeing this movie back in the Seventies , and enjoying the Peanuts gang in an outdoor setting . I 'd say it 's probably the last good Peanuts movie that was created - the music is great and represents the time period well . Also notable is that Charlie Brown finally gets to display his skills as a leader and organizer , while Peppermint Patty plays the `` heavy '' of the group . My kids , who are enjoying a bit of a Peanuts renaissance in our home , really dig this film .	1
My second favorite peanuts movie and it still to this day puts a smile on my face whenever i watch it . this along with bon voyage , charlie needs to be released on dvd or have both of those movies on one dvd .	1
This was a fun movie . I used to enjoy watching this when it came on the Disney Channel . So nostaglic . I loved the Peanuts gang and everything to do with them . `` Snoopy Come Home '' and `` A Boy Named Charlie Brown '' were my person classics though , I loved those movies to death . These were my films back in my kiddie days . I will always love them and I will give them to my kids when I get older .	1
Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to see Renata Scotto live in the theatre , but I am told that she is an excellent singing actress . Witness that for yourself in this magnificent production of one of my favourite Puccini operas . When Scotto is on stage you ca n't take your eyes off her , and watch her face at the end of Act III as DeGrieux pleads with the Captain to let him join her on board ship - what an amazing actress she is . She makes you laugh , she makes you cry - what more can you ask for ? There is a chemistry between her and Domingo that inspires him to give one of the greatest perfomances I have ever seen from him ( and yes I was at his Covent Garden Otello in front of the late Princess of Wales ) . The other principals are excellent , but this is an opera about two people , and they carry it off to perfection . The production is near perfect and the Met Orchestra give a faultless perfomance . I urge you to buy this DVD at once - you will see and hear no better .	1
My brother Pablo owns this DVD . I watched it last year for the first time in 5 years . And I was very entertained not because it 's my favorite band of all , because I learned more about KISS than I ever did . They show videoclips I have never seen before , like : `` Who Wants To Be Lonely '' and `` Uh ! All Night '' .I 'm dying to wstch the videoclip of `` Unholy '' , it is one of my favorite KISS songs . But those who do n't know , I think that a DVD is comin ' out this January 25th , a KISS DVD that contains both `` KISS KONFIDENTIAL '' and `` KISS EXPOSED '' .Anyway . The videoclips on this DVD have an excelent resolution for being `` 80 's '' videoclips . There is a footage of KISS 's last concert on make-up of `` I Love It Loud '' .I only wished Bruce Kulick and Eric Carr apeared longer on this DVD . This DVD is also humorous and some of the parts are funny.You should buy this one . It is a great DVD and perfect for KISS fans or not.KISS RULES ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
If you hate this video comp then you take yourself and the band way too seriously . It 's a funny , sometimes dumb , sometimes hilarious and sometimes cheesie script but it 's still a really great home video from the band , their first ever released . I 've read that most of it takes place at Paul Stanley 's house in Beverly Hills . I 'm not sure how true that is but it makes sense and probably kept production costs down . The interview at the end with Gene and Paul talking about the early days of the band is really great and Gene 's room the chamber of horrors is a funny scene . I always get the feeling it 's mocking the section of people who called KISS `` satanic '' in the 70s and early 80s and who read things into the band 's image and music that really was never there but in their own heads . The KISS archives and video vault scene is entertaining and a lot of fun it was the first exposure I had to a lot of the concert videos out there of the band from the 70s and early 80s and this comp really delivers in that area .	1
Yes , I did buy this on VHS back in 1987 . Yes , I loved it . But KISS has released some other long-form videos since then ( Extreme Close-up , KISS Konfidential , etc . ) that were more informative , more interesting , and less juvenile by comparison . `` KISS Exposed '' contains a lot of their videos from the 1980 's , and the crisp DVD picture really enhances the colorfulness of them , especially `` Uh ! All Night '' and `` Tears Are Falling '' . I got ta admit , they look really good - much better than they ever did on VHS . And the interview segments with Mark Blankfield are kinda interesting , too . But the filler segments - with the girls , the pool , the breakfast table , etc - seem a bit silly now when you consider how much better the other long-form videos are . At best it is all goofy boys-will-be-boys fun . Nothing wrong with that , I guess . But the more serious direction they went with `` Kiss Extreme Close-Up '' in 1992 was much more to my liking and interesting .	1
At least this release has a semblance of production to it.The greatest moments are the Classic KISS footage , and not the throw away non-makeup material . It has taken KISS 20 years to realise that the best and most lucrative material is the out and out concert footage , with all of the blasting phantasmagoria that is the original KISS.This video comes close to that original fantasy in some of the scripted material , but falls flat on oh too many ways , however , just before it goes through the floor , it gets rescued by another classic clip.There definitely should have been more of Eric Carr in the Video , but not of Bruce Kulick . However , the original is still the best , and that footage is why I give this disc 5 stars . Unfortunately it would still be better in the bootleg version , but its nice to have the Authorised version . Pity they can not do more releases of the Classic and Re-united KISS ( However short lived that fabulous fanatasy was ) .	1
I love the music , and I love the way that DG does SOYCD at the beginning , and his new song SMILE is great too , but all the covers of Syd tunes just sets this set apart , and to my opionion make it a great cd , but those in the camp that just want to hear commercial floyd may be upset , but relax and listen to Those SYD BARRETT tunes , they are great and DG does them total justice ... remember Syd started PF ... I have returned to say more about this recording . David seems very loose and ready to play . Seeing the special items in the DVD such as him and his backup singers in the studio/boat Astoria going over vocal arrangements and seeing his deft gentle hand in instructing them is really an added treat that was totally unexpected ... most extras are cold and boring or just plain stupid , but this addition to the mix was fantastic.Again , if you enjoy Syd Barretts contributions to PF you will be in for a treat . I have read a couple other reviews and seen some rather low star ratings , with the comment ( s ) like 'If you are expecting PF or classic DG you wo n't find it on this cd ... 'or something written similar to that . I contend that this is really a true statement to how PF was started , or as close as we can get it through a surviving member of PF . The songs are all crafted and sound fantastic.This is totally worth your purchase on two different levels:1 . It is a good recording of Pink Floyd and associated music.2 . It gives a good brush up on a lot of Syd Barrett tunes that we did n't have up until this point . { Plus , David Gilmore was a friend of Syd 's just like Roger Waters was in art school , so he knew Syd before he actually joined PF . Dave was a guitarist in the band called 'Jokers Wild ' when recruited ) So , with all that said , go get this and enjoy .	1
David Gilmour shines in this wonderfully produced and filmed live concert . Every song is special . If you like Pink Floyd or just good guitar , this is a must buy . The extras are also quite spectacular . Hearing David sing a Shakespeare poem was a real treat . The home movies really give you insight into his life and music . Oustanding ! Then , of course , there are the funny bits ! Like when Bob Geldolf ca n't remember the words for Comfortably Numb and has to read them off of paper ! OMG ! He really needed paper ! Thankfully , that was an extra and not part of the main concert footage . Buy and enjoy .	1
Many of the reviewers have already gone deeply into individual song reviews and what they liked , what they did n't like and the nonce . Allow me to say that this is one of the finest live solo albums ever . David Gilmour takes a collection of songs from Syd Barrett , Pink Floyd , himself and a few others he just wanted to perform and blends them into a great DVD.The players and singers he surrounds himself with are first rate and the performance showcases everyone . What is predominately showcased is the music itself . Comfortably Numb is one of my all-time favorite songs ( or in that stratosphere of musical numbers that I consider all-time greats ) and the version , actually two versions , on this DVD leave no doubt to the greatness of the song . The arrangement of it is wonderful and includes subtleties not generally heard in rock music , and yet , it kicks butt.David Gilmour is one of the masters of guitar tone whether playing acoustic or electric guitar and this DVD is no exception to the rule of great tone . His relationship with the guitar is one of pure magic and , as such , brings out the magic in the performances of others.The additional bits are also quite excellent . I particularly enjoyed the `` Digits '' as one for those of us that play the guitar . Not many guitarists would release close up DVD images of them playing . The `` Home Movie '' is also wonderful as it shows us a rehearsal of a work in process . How good can it get ?	1
Who needs the big production of Pink Floyd . David Gilmour covers it with acoustic guitars , simple amplification , and great backup musicians .	1
Today is my 50th birthday and I treated myself to a great show of David Gilmour . Yeah , I 'm getting older and so is David . But I 'm so tired of my Pink Floyd CDs , and this great DVD allows both myself and Floyd to age gracefully . These versions are actually fresh to hear and to see . And the biggest treat for me was when David brought fellow Pink Floyd member Richard Wright up on the stage to sing a beautiful version of his song Breakthrough from his Broken China CD of 1996 . So far as I know this is Rick 's only performance of his solo work . Too bad ! But at least we have this one song to cherish . And also along for the show : Floyd saxophonist Dick Parry . It 's just Gilmour and Parry opening the show with a spare but beautiful Shine On You Crazy Diamond . It 's a wonderfully intimate show , beautifully filmed and recorded . Every Floyd fan should have this .	1
This DVD is an absolute must have for any Pink Floyd or David Gilmore fan . It 's awsome . Comfortably Numb is incredible ! Shine On ... is also mind blowing . Just get it ! The crowd roaring in 5.1 Dolby Digital makes it a & quot ; real & quot ; experience .	1
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE DVD 'S FEATURING ONE OF THE BEST GUITARISTS GILMOUR WHO PERFORMS ALL THE GREAT FLOYD SONGS.I WOULD RECOMMENDED THIS AWESOME DVD TO EVERYONE.FIVE STARS .	1
There was a time when I went nowhere without a Pink Floyd album close at hand . & quot ; The Wall & quot ; and & quot ; The Final Cut & quot ; formed the crux of my listening habits for nearly two years back in the days when such things mattered more than they do now . Eventually , I picked up every Pink Floyd album I could lay my hands on , along with solo albums from Roger Waters , David Gilmour , Richard Wright , and Syd Barrett . Probably the capper of my Pink Floyd listening days was finally getting to see them live in 1994 . I do n't listen to this stuff as much as I once did , but anytime I get a chance to check out something new I usually do it . That is why I decided to watch & quot ; David Gilmour in Concert , & quot ; a collection of concert footage shot between 2001 and 2002 in London 's Royal Festival Hall . There are no fireworks , no huge video screens , and no massive sound system belting out the hits to tens of thousands of people here . Instead , you just get Dave along with a small group of musicians and a few backup singers . Those used to seeing Gilmour blasting out Pink Floyd hits with the rest of the band -- sans Roger Waters , of course -- will still enjoy how effortlessly he cranks out the music in a much smaller venue than he is probably used to playing.Arguably the most notable songs on this DVD are the Syd Barrett tunes Gilmour adds to his play list . Hearing & quot ; Terrapin & quot ; and & quot ; Dominoes & quot ; performed live really thrills , even if it is n't Syd Barrett doing them . Gilmour has a perfect right to play these songs , in my opinion , because he helped produce Barrett 's solo albums back in the early 1970s . Heck , he even provided back up on more than a few of them as well as performing live with Barrett during a few abortive live shows . History has it that Gilmour and Barrett were very close friends , and the two even spent a summer slumming through France playing tunes for pocket change years before Pink Floyd morphed into the stadium powerhouse we are familiar with today . Fans know that several Floyd albums pay tribute to their crazy founder in one way or another , so finally seeing someone from the band play some of Syd 's solo songs provides more than an additional reason to pick up this DVD.Gilmour certainly does n't stop there . Several Pink Floyd tunes find there way onto the play list . There are two separate versions of the guitar anthem & quot ; Comfortably Numb , & quot ; both of which are excellent renditions . On one of them , none other than Bob Geldof -- looking very old and sporting a huge comb over -- walks out on stage to recite a few of the lyrics , on the other version Soft Machine member Robert Wyatt ( I think ) does the honors . The guitarist performs a stellar interpretation of parts of & quot ; Shine on You Crazy Diamond & quot ; from the Wish You Were Here album along with several lively cuts from the Division Bell album . The real treat , for me at least , was finally hearing a live rendition of & quot ; Fat Old Sun & quot ; from the Atom Heart Mother recordings . I have always considered this one of Gilmour 's finest contributions to Pink Floyd 's body of work , and he does n't disappoint with the treatment given to it here . Well , he disappoints slightly because the version is acoustic . The vocals sound perfect , but hearing that soaring , groovy electric guitar would have been nice . Gilmour proves that he still has what it takes to make it all look effortless . Pink Floyd fans should not express much disappointment with these performances.A few odds and ends make their way on the disc . & quot ; Smile & quot ; is a nice little tune that Gilmour says is new . Before playing the song , he goes so far to advise bootleggers to & quot ; start recording now. & quot ; & quot ; Hushabye Mountain , & quot ; & quot ; Je Crois Entendre , & quot ; and a Richard Wright tune , which the Floyd keyboardist turns up to play , & quot ; Breakthrough , & quot ; rounds out the DVD . Also included is a nifty little tune , & quot ; Sonnet 18 , & quot ; on the disc that shows us the inside of Gilmour 's floating recording studio while letting us know that his voice is as strong as ever . It is always nice to hear Gilmour play some non-Pink Floyd material . My only problem is he did n't do enough of his solo songs , songs that are often excellent in their own right.You have completely lost it if you can not find something to like on this disc . Pink Floyd fans often see Gilmour as a lesser force , usually submerging his talents and importance under the contributions of master lyricist Roger Waters . That 's true to some extent , but Pink Floyd would never have made it this far without Gilmour 's stellar guitar work . This disc underscores what an excellent musician this man is even without any Pink Floyd influences to fall back upon . He makes it all look so effortless , as though he is merely crossing the street or doing his laundry . Actually , Gilmour could probably set his laundry list to music and people would turn out to hear it because it would sound so good ! Pink Floyd fans will want to add this DVD to their collection , but even those interested in good music should give this one a go . Attention : Gilmour goes acoustic for most of the songs on the disc , so stadium fans should take note of this and act accordingly .	1
If you like Pink Floyd , you ca n't keep but liking this DVD . Whether he is live or in the studio , he 's fantastic ;	1
Different , but outstanding nonetheless . This is simply great music performed by a legend and a group of excellent musicians . The versions of old ( and not so old ) classics are performed in an `` Unplugged '' fashion that enhances the essence of each composition . I could not have enjoyed this concert more . However , my only complain is that it was to short ( that is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 ) ... ..it seems to be a compilation of songs from a much larger set . Do n't be put by this though , this is a fantastic concert DVD . The sound is fantastic and the widescreen anamorphic image is detailed and full of color . I wholeheartedly congratulate the person , or persons that decided to release this DVD in widescreen anamorphic , nowadays , it is the only way to go . Thank you .	1
Prior to the release of the marvelous `` Live At The Royal Albert Hall '' , this DVD is also something special . Biased as this review may be , since I am a fan from David Gilmour from his first solo release to his last effort `` On An Island '' . The acoustic versions of some well known songs , `` Shine On You Crazy Diamond '' for instance , gives this set a feeling that you are witnessing an artist filled with divine inspiration and good taste . The DVD includes performances by Richard Wright and Michael Kamen , both brilliant musicians that departed too early !	1
I just saw this the first time yesterday . It is a wonderful collection showing off Gilmour 's talents as a musician . There are some home movie pieces that show the organizing of one of the pieces . Gilmour covers 2 of Syd Barretts pieces and a number of songs from across the life of Pink Floyd . The music is taken from several concert given in 2001 and 2002 . Overall , it 's worth watching many times .	1
Looks like David wanted to get away from the Floyd Pomp that began after their success with the Dark Side of the Moon and carried them into a marketing hodge podge of pretense such as floating animals and the like.A good selection of songs played surprisingly on Electric-Acoustic guitar which he seems to favour . He has an excellent back-up band and brings many of the Floyd songs down to earth.Quite a nice set but could have been longer . Wish You Were Here and several other classics have nice rendering with an excellent bassist . A nice guest appearance by Richard Wright . It is a shame as far I know he did not tour his solo album which may be the better of all the PF solo CD 's . David Gilmour 's willingness to give way to Richard Wright for one of his numbers and his excellent Guitar on it is a highlight.All in all a very good Live Performance .	1
David Gilmour just keeps getting better with age . He does pull out a lot of items from his Pink Floyed days , but then that is what the fans want . Very good crisp audio . A damn good addition to any Floyed collection .	1
For a re-Union concert that they agreed to perform just ONE show , you would think they were going to be a bit rusty , forget some words , have the band lose and what have you , but this is a stunning Live performance ! The double album was a top 10 seller then quickly forgotten , the DVD came out years later to know great reaction . I found mine in some discount bin . I guess people of today would rather listen to their electronic techno crap instead of watching true art and poetry set to music.This one time concert went off so well that Paul Simon at first said his next album was going to be with Art , but who knows what happened , maybe had a falling out again and he released that lame album that had the hit `` Allergies '' on it , then followed by the memorable `` Graceland '' .A true must own DVD for any fan of classic rock or folk.ALSO ... ..for more video from S & G ... they ; performed on SNL in 1975 when Paul hosted the show .

Despite occuring over 20 years ago , the legendary Central Park reunion concert between Paul Simon & Art Garfunkel still is one of the greatest events in rock history . To see these two old friends together for the first time in over 10 years holds value , and though they have reunited sporadically since then ( most recently in 2003 for a tour that yielded the excellent live dvd and album `` Old Friends Live On Stage '' ) , nothing can top this event.Kicking off with an exhuberant performance of `` Mrs. Robinson '' , this is Art and Paul at the top of their game . Though you can still see a bit of tension brewing between them ( you can feel Art 's tension when he exits the stage so that Paul can sing one of his many solo hits ) , but they manage to overcome tensions and put on a flawless show ( which includes hits such as `` Homeward Bound '' , `` America '' , `` Bridge Over Troubled Water '' , `` The Boxer '' ( with an added verse ) and `` Old Friends/Bookends '' ) Of course , the dvd is n't exactly flawless . Yes , the sound and picture quality is great . But , there are some problems . First of all , why is it that several songs are grouped together into one chapter ? Granted , there are no performances really worth skipping over , but still , it is a bit annoying . Secondly , Paul 's John Lennon tribute `` The Late Great Johnny Ace '' is not listed in the track list , yet it is included on the dvd . I also would 've liked to have seen some bonus features added.That being said , this does nothing to take away from the show , which is still a great show after all these years .	1
On a spring Sunday in 1982 , a 13-year-old boy in Northern Europe happened to open the tv and see a huge outdoors concert . In the course of approximately one and a half hours , the boy became a fan of those two men : one tall , curly-haired and angel-voiced , the other dark and short , playing the guitar with a unique touch . As the boy did not have a VCR at the time , he did not have a chance to see the concert again . Twenty-one years later the boy , now a man and fast approaching middle age , places a DVD on the tray - and he is reunited with the holy show : Simon & amp ; Garfunkel 's ` Concert in Central Park'.I do not have the habit of writing about myself , but now I am obliged to do so , because ` Concert in Central Park ' possesses an immeasurable amount of personal value to me.It really took an unreasonably long time to convert ` Concert in Central Park ' into a DVD . The product does not have any real extras , but the content speaks for itself . The additions ( in respect of LP and CD ) of ` Late in the Evening ( reprise ) ' and the first-ever performance of Simon 's solo ` The Late Great Johnny Ace ' alone make this DVD a piece of popular music history . Paul 's wild shriek just before the band cuts into the crowd-inciting rumba sequence of ` Late in the Evening ( reprise ) ' is pure rock & amp ; roll power . And yes , the angry spectator 's stage invasion is there in the middle of ` Johnny Ace'.Interestingly enough , there are some differences to be heard in the music . Intros to some songs are longer than on LP/CD and a few harmonies sound more authentic on this DVD . Some short between-songs announcements are cut out and , unfortunately , Paul 's opening speech after ` Homeward Bound ' is shortened somewhat . I do not know if it is only me , but I think that mixing is more sophisticated here . In addition to singing of the headliners , you can also fully enjoy ( not to underestimate anybody 's input ) the fine guitars of David Brown and Pete Carr , the groovy drums of Paul 's trusted man Steve Gadd as well as the dominant keyboard-playing of another cohort Richard Tee . Essentially , the introduction of the superb band is included in the film just before the very last song.The friction between Paul and Art is no secret , and it is at places visible in this concert as well . They have little direct contact during the set , and the occasional back-patting seems a bit constrained . During Paul 's solo numbers , Art sits at the back and looks uneasy . Paul also seems to make a little fun of Art a couple of times : for example , Art 's less-than-deep one-liner ` I 'm so in the mood ' prior to the glorious ` American Tune ' causes Paul to make faces that imply something else than infinite respect to his long-time partner.The performers , luckily , concentrate on the music and do few tricks to woo the audience . In the end of a touching neighbourhood tune ` A Heart in New York ' , Art does a Statue of Liberty routine . It is no artistic triumph as such but inspires the crowd into a mighty roar.Simon & amp ; Garfunkel 's ` Concert in Central Park ' is definitely one of the most important individual concerts in the history of popular music . Although it now turns out the music had gone through some tidying-up when released on LP , the songs are in the starring role . Skilful camera work and successful sound reproduction make the concert a comprehensive and a most enjoyable experience on the screen , too .	1
This concert record on 19th September 1981 reunited Simon & Garfunkel in front of a crowd of 400,000 , and its one of the best concerts ever recorded . You 'll know this if you 've only ever heard the audio CD , which is worth getting in its own right . However to see , as well as hear , the great music made that night makes this something special.There are a number of things that make this concert great . Firstly of course theres Paul Simons great songs . Mrs Robinson , Homeward Bound , Still Crazy , Fifty Ways , Bridge Over Troubled Water , the list of fabulous songs goes on and on . At the time of this recording Paul Simon had n't really recorded a bad album and if anything the material he wrote in the 1970 's was as good if not better than the 1960 's material . Secondly there was the magical combination of their voices . They were just meant to sing together . I have no idea whether they understood what they were singing in terms of harmony but somehow it just worked.The last thing that makes this concert great is the band playing . This was essentially Paul Simons touring band of the time , so you get Steve Gadd and Grady Tate on drums , Anthony Jackson on Bass , Richard Tee on Keyboards plus a great brass section . These guys are great players in their own right so on tracks like 'Me & Julio ' and 'Late in the Evening ' the whole park is rocking.If never seen or heard this concert you 're missing an absolute treat . Buy now !	1
The more I listen to Zeppelin , the more I see the brilliance of each performer . However , if one has to shine the brightest , unfortunately he also fell the soonest . There have been many great drummers - Pert from Rush , Grohl from Nirvana , Foo Fighters , Them Crooked Vultures ( with John Paul Jones ) to name just two- but in the history of rock and roll and even other genres , there has been few that can play the drums not only as a rhythm instrument , but as an instrument in its own right . Bonham added so much to this group that it is completely appropriate to that they broke up after his death . Nothing against Page , Jones or Plant - they are all incredible musicians in their own right - but Bonham is the clear star of this group . Not just in shear talent but in musicality . He was able to add to any piece not just with technical brilliance . He knew exactly what each piece needed to make it perfect .	1
I loved the band/album when it came out on vinyl years ago ... the DVD is great and a must have addition , to any classic rock concert video collection ! The video and audio are from that era , so be aware of this detail , so as to not be disappointed .	1
I had seen this a long time ago on TV , but as others was not impressed ... ..This version is much better . I am glad I purchased it for another run ... .it was worth it .	1
There are a lot of people who say it did n't need to happen or the improvments are modest , but I would say do n't listen to them.The sound on the original blew , this is 10 times better and as a result , what sounded like -30 years ago previous- a tired , overworked band now sounds like hammer of the gods.It really is amazing ... .rock n roll and black dog , the first few numbers , Plant sounded a little tired but Dazed and Confused really rocks and the sound improvements state just how thunderous this band is , end of or beginning of tour . I remember watching the film long long ago on VHS and DVD and thinking how it kinda sucked because of the sound and even then I thought the soundtrack was more definitive for the band . The film is funner and the band is more fantastic to watch now because the true sound has been unlocked up and unmuffled ... hats off to Page and the engineers for making this all over again . It 's like watching it for the first time ... .and sonically because it tromps the original .	1
Led Zeppelin performs beyond expectations . True to their format , they play on and on , seemingly forever . Excellent cuts of Jimmy Page 's virtuoso guitar work . The pre-concert background was very interesting , especially Jimmy 's playing the hurdy-gurdy . Good insights into the family life of the band members .	1
What can I say ? The greatest band ever at there best : live on stage . The remastered sound and added tracks are unbelievable . Play it loud !	1
I do n't know why I do this , just because I 'm a Zepplein freak I guess . I just ca n't let another `` Zeppelin were n't very good this night '' comment slide . People who write that just do n't know what they are talking about , period . Yes , we thankfully have the new DVD , and the West Was Won CD , but to say that they could n't cut it on Song Remains Same is just a flat out LIE . To be fair , YES , there is some cutting of performances using video footage from different nights and things like that , and there is the `` fantasy '' footage that may or may not bug you . BUT , there is plenty of live music and live video to show you Zeppelin flying high in all of its glory ! The bow sequence alone during Dazed is EPIC , Jimmy is channeling the music from somewhere , who knows where ! Anyway you cut it , the band is in AMAZING form , pure and simple , and if you are unable to be moved by this performance , that is ok I guess , but you should stick to your Sinead O'Connor records and other `` brilliant '' `` artists '' of the like .	1
Outstanding . The `` Rockumentary '' shows the footage from Led Zeppelin 's concert in New York city as well as a bit from their personal lives.The viewer gets an idea of what it 's like from their end of the tour as well as some of the most outstanding music ever in concert.Most noteworthy is the drum solo from `` Moby Dick '' from the late John Bonham.It is long , but anything but boring.Overall , this is evidence of why their will never again be quite a decade like the 1970s for music .	1
You buy , a lot of old pics , tickets , memorabilia , a offer for a poster , mini -- posters , a wonderful t-shirt , and the box.. So big and duty . Please buy this if you can ... if you are a real.. REAL FAN , buy it.. if you dont , dont buy anything and go to your home to wait to see Led Zeppelin on tv hahaha . THE BESTTTT ! ! !	1
This movie & soundtrack amazes me anew each time : like a companion to the 4th album . But it 's not for critics or rock fans who LIKE LedZep : it 's for people who either LOVE Zeppelin , or at least LOVE some thing for its precious charm & mystique . Like many reviewers , I too dismiss all negative reviews by bozos , wiseasses , & middleminds . If one is n't trying to be cute picking it apart , one is open to a very rewarding piece of Zep art : only a fool critcizes Zeppelin for underachieving at what ONLY Zeppelin could imagine . Zep was always about rock magically elevating life to higher state , so complaints about `` authenticity '' are puny nitpicks for puny minds . Symbolically , the fantasy sequences make alot people uncomfortable so they resort to labeling them as cheesy : again , this is ignorant , like trying to win a poker game with a Tarot deck . It 's not cinema or tv , it 's a rock fantasy home movie , not edited for an Oscar ; just personal dream sequences about Inner Courage , staged for 70 's celluloid.No matter how many people get used to Zeppelin , the Wonder of Zeppelin is also their Message . Zeppelin is the opposite of habitually measuring with known parameters . Losers posing as historians often take points off from the Heartbreaker solo for execution : as if there were other electric guitar solo breaks to compare then ! Likewise , if someone can show me a more coherent movie that punctuates an arena show with euphoric medieval fans & fantasies , and the urgency of hot rods , motorcycle cops , & rowdy fans made BEFORE this movie- then I 'll be willing to admit shortcomings . While you 're at it ; WHO PLAYED KASHMIR BETTER BEFORE LZ ? As great as Zep sounds in studio , most of these performances EXCEL or in different ways MATCH what made the studio versions interesting . Many hard rock fans do n't appreciate how Jimmy Page 's sound is cleaner : outgrowing his early vision of sustaining fuzz , here Page is reacting to his guitars ' precious woody tone with wonder & subtlety rather than executing wellrehearsed pyrotechnics for show . Why he outstrips peers like JGarcia & JHendrix is his scope for pushing the blues envelope along with Asian & Middle Eastern & Celtic pastoral vistas- not as a master , but as a cartographer sketching undiscovered territory with only pencil & paper . This film is pure Led Zeppelin because it accidentally appeals to more people than it should , so there 's big riffs for the little guy , threaded among unpolished details that contain passageways to the Hidden . Before you see the Light , joy & terror look the same in the Dark .	1
First off , I love Zeppelin and The Song Remains the Same is an excellent live album and film . But let me just pose a question : Why is Amazon advertising this HDDVD if according to them it 's not being released for 2 more years ? Huh ? ? ! ! By that time we could be downloading movies directly into our heads - a little `` Led for your head , '' so to speak . Seriously Amazon , either figure out what 's going on or take down this item .	1
( Side note ... you can do video reviews now ? Strange ... ) Led Zeppelin : The Song Remains the Same ( Collector 's Edition ) What I 'm about to say has already been said , but I 'd like a chance to say it , too.For starters , this is a major upgrade . My first impression in watching this would have to be : '' Jonesy can be heard ! `` I think the most criminal aspect of the original release was that Jonesy was non-existent . Even when he played the keyboards , you could only hear him if he was the only one playing . As soon as Page came in , Jonesy was gone . Hence , No Quarter just did n't sound that great . But now , Jonesy is there in all his glory . The bass can be heard quite well . The keyboards can be heard . Same is true also for the drums . In the old footage , you got a lot of cymbal and snare and even a little high-tom , but you could n't hear any of Bonzo 's bass or low-toms . Basically , in the old footage , it was all treble and no bass . Now the mix is perfect , and the balance between treble and bass is perfect.I also love the footage itself . I am probably one of the rare Led Zeppelin fans who loves the fantasy/movie sequences . The only sequence I think is rather stupid is Robert 's . It 's cliche , sappy , and really just un-creative . I would have hoped Robert could have come up with something more thought-provoking and imaginative . I love Jimmy 's different sequences , especially his main one , climbing up the mountain to the wizard , and Jonesy 's sequence is really cool . Bonzo 's is the only other cliche one , but at least it is n't sappy.The special features , to me , are really neat . Though I admittedly ca n't understand this whole idea of legal issues that prevented them from tampering with THEIR MOVIE ( caps for emphasis , not yelling : D ) . I would have liked to see the songs put in their original running order . Also , the exclusion of Thank You from the last night ( I have the bootlegs , and it 's a very good rendition ) makes me kinda sad.Now , onto the extra stuff : The t-shirt is fine . It 's size is mis-labeled , but it is n't that small . Trust me . I 'm 6 feet tall and 200 pounds , and I 'm ashamed to admit that muscle comprises only a small percentage of that ( something I am working on ) . But the shirt fits me perfectly . When you get this set , do NOT expect an extra large . This shirt is no bigger than a large . Keep that in mind and you 'll be fine.I am definitely looking forward to the poster , which I 've already sent in for . I love the pictures and the tickets , and even the paper article . My only problems with these extras is that the only reviews they include are negative reviews . Come on ! You ca n't tell me there was n't one positive review of this movie when it came out . You can't.Now , I have listed some things that bother me , but I give this five stars because I love it , and because , in the end , I 'm quite satisfied with what I got . Ignore the nay-sayers , because they are not Led Zeppelin fans . I have the majority of Led Zeppelin live recordings in existence , including studio sessions and all of their official releases ( except for Mothership , which I 'm still debating over ) . I can tell you this is definitely a good performance from Zep . It 's no where near one of their best , but it 's so far from their worst it 's ridiculous . This set is worth it . Thank you , Led Zeppelin .	1
This is a & # 34 ; cleaned up and expanded & # 34 ; version of the 1976 release . The sound , arrangement , and bonus material are fantastic . I have fond memories associated with the original version and this new version only adds to those wonderful memories . Some fans and critics have stated that these concert clips do not represent Zep at their best . But , for me , I think they still stand head and shoulders above anyone else -- - both in terms of musicianship and entertainment . Unfortunately , I never had the chance to see the band live , but through this DVD set , at least I can imagine .	1
This is the review of the Blu-Ray version of the movie that i saw for the first time in theater a long time ago . There is a improvement of the picture quality compare to the DVD version , but nothing as good as a Blu-Ray of today . What is so interesting about this movie is that it 's not only a music concert , it 's a lot more . There is some fiction images throughout the movie along with behind the scenes and real day life action footage with each members of the band . The musicians played a role by illustrating the story of the songs like characters in a movie.The movie starts with the arrival of the crew and the band in Manhattan by car . The city where the show has taken place has a important meaning to the movie . There is some entertaining behind the scenes footage , that had took place during the show . It 's a real treat to see the manager takes on his crew members who had let circulate some pirates posters of the band . There goes down the drain the merchandising profits ! And not only that , but we learned that the show 's profits have disappear in what looks like a robbery ! Now for the actual live footage ! To have footage of the legendary band is a rare historical moment and i have never been disappointed by the quality of the footage , a little dark with no visuals , because the music was so appealing to me . The idea of illustrating the show with a story is not a bad idea , but at times , i was missing the joy of seeing the band play their instrument , it 's the case , especially during the song `` The Song Remains the Same '' , who is one of the best Led Zeppelin songs , along with `` No Quarter '' , simply because for me that 's the songs that are the closest to Progressive rock with their nice atmosphere . Another highlight of the show is the 15 minutes drum solo of John Bonham , who is captured nicely by cameras.The extras contains more songs , and more footage of the conference press talking about the robbery that i was talking earlier in my review . After 38 years , it 's easy for me to give this a 5 stars , because it 's still a great music to hear today despite some flaws on the quality of the footage , but put in the context of the 70 's and restore on Blu-Ray , it 's nice to watch . The 5.1 mix also add a new dimension to the whole experience .	1
UPDATE : This flaw was corrected in a silent replacement of the title . It took over a year for Warner to fix it , but they did fix it . I have changed my rating of the disc as a result . I realize some were not happy I was critical of this because the gap is only 7 seconds , but a 7 second dropout during a drum solo is pretty bad IMO . Some also may not have experienced the glitch due to getting a fixed copy ( again , a year after release ) or were not streaming TrueHD.Anyway , good that the glitch is fixed , however it would have been better if Warner had an official replacement program instead of just silently fixing the problem in an unlabelled 2nd pressing.BELOW IS ORIGINAL REVIEW TEXT : Unfortunately the Blu-ray version of this concert has a 7-second long sound dropout in the TrueHD soundtrack at timecode 1:40:45 - all copies of the Blu-ray currently available are affected . The TrueHD soundtrack of the previously released HD DVD does not suffer from this dropout ( nor does the Blu-ray 's lower quality DD soundtrack ) , so it is clear this was an encoding goof-up on Warner 's part.This type of QC problem is unacceptable for a product that costs $ 20 , yet Warner has not mentioned any intention of fixing the issue . Hopefully they get on the ball and set up a replacement program for those who buy this defective disc.Note that the recent re-release of this disc still suffers from the dropout problem . Maybe the third time will be the charm ... : \	1
This collection is incredible . Comes with a TShirt and is boxed so nicely . My fiance LOVED IT ! !	1
I 'm not one of these hard core fans who have 12 previous versions of TSRTS . I do n't have a High Def Large Screen TV , nor do I have a theater system on my tv . I really enjoyed it though ! Looks and sounds great !	1
This is a fine film of the best ever rock band . The video clips gives the viewer insight into each member of Led Zep . I have watched it many times , especially Black Dog and Whole Lotta Love . The visual effects with the mirrors during Whole Lotta Love was amazing ! I also did not know Jimmy Page played a Theramin . Filmed in 1973 , the video and audio was fantastic !	1
Filmed in Paris in early December 1979 on the Highway To Hell tour , this is a perfect portrait of one of the greatest rock n roll bands of all time approaching the peak of their popularity . Most AC/DC fans are well aware of this concert film and hold it high as one of the coveted items in the bands catalogue . Of course the VHS version is the one everyone 's had for so many years and fans have been dying for a restored DVD version . In the late 90 's we had the Bonfire boxset , which contained the concert in it 's entirety on CD . Not only that but the CD contained the full version of Walk All Over You which is cut short in the movie , and instead of actually seeing it , there is a strange music video type sequence of Phil Rudd in his car racing Cliff Williams in a plane in some kind of air field ; as well as one of the bands encores TNT . However TNT was never included in the movie and no one seems to find it strange . Perhaps it was just never filmed , or maybe it was lost . But after all the griping the thing is finally out and it 's pretty good . Awesome video and audio in all the right departments . But the extras are what 's sorely lacking.It 's basically a few famous musicians like Scott Ian of Anthrax ( when isnt he in something like this ? ! ) , Lemmy of Motorhead , Rick Allen of Def Leppard , The Donnas , Billy Corgan , the girl from NCIS ( ? ! ) a one off spot with a member of fellow Aussie hard rockers Rhino Bucket , metal/hard rock expert VH1 guy Eddie Trunk , and a few AC/DC afficienados . Of course they stammer on and on about how great the band is without really explaining anything and using the obvious tools of reference to describe the band ( Chuck Berry riffs etc ) . The only ones who really say anything worth hearing is Billy Corgan and Trunk , they are real music fans here who understand the band 's technique and explain it to you in a way thats interesting . Lemmy has a few cool comments but otherwise the rest are there to just rant on about how amazing rock n roll is and how great Bon was in a very uneducated way . Like they were asked to watch 5 min of the movie and then come up with something . They discuss everything from Angus ' technique , Malcolm 's importance to the rhythm section , Bon 's death and what kinda guy he was etc . It gets slightly more interesting when they select a few songs and talk a little more indepth about them.As a whole package its 4 stars , but the movie itself is definiatly 5 . But overall , if you want the movie , if you love the concert its the package you 'll wan na have . This show provides people who were n't there a glimpse of what it was like to see a band in the late 70 's , before rock became corporate and acceptable , when it was still dangerous and kids who went to see them knew very little about the bands . They were just these strange magical guys who came up on stage and blew you away . That was the rebellious but slightly naive nature of going to shows in the 70 's . Something that 's very lost in todays times . Whether you 're an AC/DC fan or just a fan of rock music , this is an essential concert movie and the short interview sections with the band provide a strange inlook without being corny . A great document of Bon Scott as one of rock 's best front men . He died 2 months after it was filmed . It 's a chestnut .	1
Great fun . Absolutely awesome to watch if you love old-school AC/DC . The interviews with the band are hilarious and awesome . The live footage is incredible . Wish I could 've been there for one of those small shows . The film itself is probably enough - no need to order the deluxe edition . It 's an old , low-budget film , so do n't expect anything glossy . Kind of suits the band , really . ( compliment , not a dis )	1
Why anyone would want to watch a roadcrew assembling a stage is beyond me but once you fastforward that , and get to the part where Bon grabs his beer before heading on stage , it is absolutley powerful stuff . He is a combination of Brian Johnson and Robert Plant in his heyday ... a wild rock and roll throwback that lived for women and booze . He lived fast and died hard , and I truly believe he had no interest in growing old , so he was called home after a hard night of drinking . All AC-DC needed that night was a stage , and the music is raw and hard driving ... the Angus & quot ; show & quot ; is highly amusing and he plays his tail off , while Bon sings his off ... .highly recommended .	1
Great live video of AC/DC at their peak with Bon ! Packed with live tracks and interviews , and keeps your interest all the way through ! Also includes bonus material , with famous peoples take on AC/DC . Highly Recommended ! ! ! !	1
First of all , the movie is great . I consider Bon Scott to be the best rock frontman that ever lived . So if you are getting this for the movie , you will not be disappointed . The extras , on the other hand , are very weak . All the extra `` footage '' is other peoplt talking about AC/DC . I expected more real video of Bon and the band . I would have gladly paid $ 20 for just the movie instead of having to buy this `` collectors '' edition .	1
This is one true headbangin ' good time captured on tape . Angus rips through solo after @ ss-kickin ' solo as Malcolm , Phil , and Cliff lay down the ballbustin ' rhythm . Aside from an incredible concert full of calssic tunes played to perfection , this video , for me anyway , is FUNNY . One ca n't help but to laugh manically at Angus 's slow , rhythmic stripdown before he moons the audience , ( the funny aspect being the fact that he 's really , really ugly ) . The first time I saw it , I just rolled on the floor.The second funniest part in the film would have to be the attempted & quot ; interviews & quot ; with each band member . With the exception of Bon , the interviewer asks his questions , and subsequently gets the same response from each member : a five second blank stare , followed by & quot ; Ummm ... & quot ; , & quot ; Yeah & quot ; , or & quot ; I-uh ... I do n't know. & quot ; Harsh as it may seem , it 's just flat out funny.Every fan of AC/DC should own this video .	1
Not much to say , ive seen bits and pieces of this concert , and its great ! I just wish they put it on DVD , i notice im kind of late in the request , considering the last person asked for it about 2 years ago . But , I 'm just here to refresh the idea , please put this concert on DVD !	1
This is an important video in the AC/DC fan 's library being one of the last thing Bon Scott had a chance to do with the band before his unfortunate early end . Let there be rock is recorded while the band was on a tour stop in Paris on their Highway to hell tour . 13 song total on the video including Highway to hell , shot down in flames , live wire , and let there be rock . This also includes great behind the scenes footage of the band in the hotel and on the road . Bon Scott at his pinnicle on vocals , and Angus , that little man has more energy than an H-bomb . Must have for AC/DC fans , likely someday to come out on DVD . Check it out if you can . Also noted by another reviewer , Check out Bon Scott 's Big Drink in the interviews , you can see they pieced the footage together because the tumbler 's level of liquid is goes up and down throughout the movie but in no order ... .unless they kept refilling it and he 'd drink it quickly..which is also plausable . That 's living like a Rock Star . Entertainment at its best .	1
Natalya Bessmertnova , Bolshoi Company prima ballerina over three decades , performs splendidly in the title role for this worthy and largely successful attempt at recovering , within a studio setting , many past glories from a truly classical ( as well as romantic ) ballet . Filmed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow , an appropriate site for one of the Bolshoi 's most admired pieces , the performance benefits quite strongly from the lack of applause that is normally tendered by live audiences revelling in infatuation for individual favourite dancers , bringing productions to a halt . A great leaper , Bessmertnova is alike successful with acting , specially to be noted here in the Act I mad scene , while the emotional forcefulness of her partner , Mikhail Lavrovsky , as Count Albrecht decidedly contributes toward the stirring presentation of the work 's sundry musical climaxes . Juri Grigorovitsch , husband of Bessmertnova , creates here continually challenging choreography , a manifest blend of past Bolshoi triumphs along with his own innovations , and although the popular Peasant Pas de Deux from the end of Act I was completed during this production , one will forgive its subsequent removal as not being concordant with an elegiac mood that the choreographer establishes immediately upon progression into the second act . This mood becomes the most dynamic element of the film , enhanced through smoothly achieved artistic montage and lighting effects from cinematographer Konstantin Apriatin . During the more than a century and a half of Giselle 's history , a good many sterling dancers have performed as Albrecht , but few who could maintain the role 's cardinal accent upon emotional strength with the force that does Lavrovsky in this film . And it is Lavrovsky , in company with Grigorovitsch , who provides the artistic casing that enables Bessmertnova , justly celebrated for her interpretation of the tragic innocent , to reveal only the merest hint of that romantic sense of mystery that comprises Giselle . Bessmertnova 's emotive skills , and her technique throughout , up until her final seconds with Albrecht by her grave ( while she displays a perfect arabesque pench & eacute ; e ) never seem well-trod during the course of this excellent Kultur VHS release . Adolphe Adam 's score , ungratifying for the concert hall but note perfect for the ballet , with each number apt to the gifts of well-schooled dancers , is performed without a clinker by the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra ably conducted by Alygis Zhyuraitis . Regal Galina Kozlova , as Myrtha , Queen of the Wilis , dances with her customary efficiency , and the corps is correctly trained for a balletic event wherein cultural homage is paid not only to the choreography of Petipa but to the costumes of Bakst as well . A DVD version has been released for a label other than Kultur but , while narrative development and the impeccable lifts of Lavrovsky are , of course , identical , the VHS taping is far superior to the DVD relative to visuals , sound , and in general quality . Although out of print , The Kultur release can yet be found , and will be preferable to balletomanes .	1
The only reason I bought NEW FACES ( 1954 ) was for Eartha Kitt . I read that she was one of the young singers/actors showcased in NEW FACES and so I had to have it.The picture quality is n't too bad . The movie is in color and though there are a few tiny jump cuts here and there , and the picture is n't as sharp as sayI Love Lucy - The Complete Third Season , which is from the same year or thereabouts , but for the most part it 's watchable.Most of the unknown actors making their appearance are pretty good in this feature like Alice Ghostley and Paul Lynde , who would go on to television fame as character actors , but Eartha Kitt and Robert Clary really steal the show ! Both sing and dance their heart out . Even though Kitt only has dance and song numbers , she really shines here . It 's too bad they did n't have her do more acting in NEW FACES , but that probably had to do with racism more than anything else . Clary is funny as a diminutive French man and he sings really well.Anyway , Eartha performs her standards like `` C'est Si Bon , '' `` Uska Dara , '' `` Monotonous , '' `` Bal Petit Bal , '' and the absolutely magnificent `` Santa Baby , '' which is worth the price of this DVD alone . She sings and dances up a storm and it 's really something to see the `` Sex Kitten '' in her prime . No wonder Orson Welles referred to her as the `` most exciting woman in the world . `` The movie itself is built around musical and comedy sketches of the actors , so it 's not a really strong storyline but it 's fun to watch . I 'd recommend NEW FACES to Eartha Kitt fans like myself or fans of Mel Brooks , who wrote the sketches .	1
BOUGHT THIS DVD TO GET EARTHA KITT 'S PERFORMANCES AND OF COURSE SHEWAS GREAT ! THE FILMING AND EDITING ARE A LITTLE DATED , BUT AS PART OFENTERTAINMENT HISTORY IT IS ABSOLUTELY VIEWABLE .	1
Three videos from the 1987 Album CRAZY NIGHTS ... hence the title . ( Imagine that . ) The videos are good , I just wish there were more of them .	1
This is a very funny movie.The tunes are GREAT , as one may remember from the album , '' MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR '' .	1
This film is by all means an art film.There is less emphasis on things like plot and theme and more emphasis on production , camera shots , humor and of course the music videos.Some of the visual effects are awesome as well.The best videos are Fool On The Hill , Flying , I Am The Walrus and Blue Jay Way.This film looks like a bunch of great scenes pilled on to each other and thats the down fall of MMT.The scenes pop up suddenly without an explanation.This makes the film to short ( 55 min ) . I think if they had more footage of John and George it would be better too.But its still a great film in the art sense.There are also 2 extra songs= They are orchestral performances of She Loves You and All My Loving .	1
Thoroughly mindblowingly brilliant , as in almost all things the Fab Four did . Five stars if only for the performance of & quot ; I Am the Walrus & quot ; ( & quot ; No You 're Not ! & quot ; Said Little Nicola ) and the off-kilter eccentricities of the Men of the Century ( Liverpool edition ) . Play LOUD and take with lots and lots of tea . And biscuits.It 'll all make perfect sense , if you are ready and willing . Otherwise , better not to worry about it.God bless the Beatles and all those who sail with them .	1
In 1967 or '68 , Paul McCartney said that someday we will watch music as well as listen to it . What vision . The Beatles ' videos in their prime .	1
I watched this last night for the seventh time and it seems more charming with each viewing . The Beatles are very relaxed and there are many young children having fun along the way . It has its share of strange British humor but some of the filming is inspired and the song video of `` Walrus '' is top notch . Give it a try .	1
In the Anthology series , Paul McCartney used this phrase to describe what the Beatles ( Paul , mostly ) were trying to create with Magical Mystery Tour . The resulting product , shown in black and white on TV in Britain , was widely panned . Some critics went so far as to say that the film was proof that the Fab Four had lost their shine.Magical Mystery Tour was certainly no great cinematic work . In fact , it 's of virtually no consequence to anyone other than hard-core Beatles fans or stoners that like its psychadelic bent.Whatever it lacks , it has a surreal , quirky charm that makes it worthwhile . Some scenes are just plain bizaare , like the dream sequence in which John Lennon , a mustachioed waiter in a posh restaurant , shovels a table full of spaghetti onto a fat lady 's plate . Not surprisingly , Neil Innes of Rutles fame ( or infamy , if you prefer ) is in the The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band , who performs the song `` Death Cab for Cutie '' -- recognize the name , kids ? -- while a dancer does a striptease . Only in trippy movies like Magical Mystery Tour , or its cousin , the Monkees ' Head , can you see stuff like that.Most of the movie is nonsense but some scenes are quite funny . It 's the kind of thing you 'd expect if you asked a pot smoking pop group to put together a Monty Python episode.If nothing else , the movie is , more or less , like an hour show of Beatles videos . Nowhere else can you see videos of `` Fool on the Hill , '' `` Your Mother Should Know , '' and `` I am the Walrus . '' You know that ca n't be bad !	1
I can understand why Magical Mystery Tour has been the victim of so much harsh criticism . One thing that film purists may complain about is the amateurish style of the camera and editing . However , Paul himself pinpointed the biggest trouble with the film back in the day : people were looking for a plot , but there was n't one . But Magical Mystery Tour is n't a `` regular '' movie . The beauty of this film is that it 's a complete fantasy and therefore a real , developing plot is n't necessarily needed . One legitimate shortcoming of the film is that it is a Beatles movie , yet it 's actually not self-indulgent enough . The Beatles admitted that they were like bit players in their own movie , which is mostly true . The Beatles , along with Mal Evans , each play a character on the bus ( only Ringo 's character has more than a few lines , though ) as well as the `` 4 or 5 magicians '' who cause the magic to happen . ( John also serves as narrator , among a couple other one-scene characters . ) The other characters get about equal exposure as the Beatles ( not including the songs themselves ) . It 's been put around that , because Magical Mystery Tour was largely Paul 's idea , the movie revolves around him , which is completely untrue -- I do n't believe that his `` bus '' character even says one word on-screen thoughout the whole movie.Magical Mystery Tour is less than an hour long . There are a few scenes which are a bit too silly , but there 's also plenty which are enjoyably funny : pretty much anything Ringo says to his auntie , Victor Spinetti 's two-minute mumbo-jumbo speech , and , of course , the spaghetti dream . Naturally , however , the highlights of the film are the songs ! The Beatles had been making promotional films ( AKA `` music videos '' ) for their singles for over a year , and the visuals for these songs were the best-looking yet ( the sequences for `` Fool On The Hill '' and `` Blue Jay Way '' are particularly stunning ) . If you need any proof that the Beatles spearheaded the style of music videos we know today , then watch Magical Mystery Tour !	1
By late 1967 , the Beatles had conquered the music landscape like nobody had ever done before . For Christmas in the U.K. , they offered a special television film called & # 34 ; Magical Mystery Tour & # 34 ; , which aired on Boxing day . This VHS reissue of the film is superior in every way . In addition to having the movie itself on the videotape , it has now been completely resequenced and reimagined in a slightly different running order . All of the songs are now in their very best presentations . Even better is the inclusion of every 1967 promo song film for the remaining selections that were released on the American album . These clips are now brilliantly incorporated within the framework of the film , thus making this version the most definitive presentation ever made available for public viewing . The additional songs are & # 34 ; Penny Lane & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Strawberry Fields Forever & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; All You Need Is Love & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Baby , You 're A Rich Man & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Hello , Goodbye & # 34 ; . Even the song & # 34 ; A Day In The Life & # 34 ; , which was not featured in & # 34 ; Magical Mystery Tour & # 34 ; is also part of this program . By adding these extra tracks into the film , what you have here is the most essential version of the & # 34 ; Magical Mystery Tour & # 34 ; film from 1967 ever released . It is almost like having a video companion of the album , ready to watch on your home screen . The extra song clips actually make this film a much better presentation . satisfaction guaranteed !	1
That Nureyev ( according to one of his major biographers ) was `` disappointed '' in the film , that MacMillan left the Royal Ballet shortly after his intense unhappiness with Management 's forced changes in casting for the production of the Ballet ( and , therefore , in his design for it ) , should have no relevance to the potential viewer 's decision to see this film . It is among the best films comprised of dance ever made.Whatever changes may have been wrought , MacMillans choreography is intrinsically modern to the core , Nureyev and Fonteyn are , well , Nureyev and Fonteyn , Prokoviev 's music has never been more suitably complemented . It is pure joy to watch.I would not have thought to comment on it , that it is listed as a 1966 film should say it all ; however , the point has been made by some reviewers , and I know it to be a matter of concern to some viewers , particularly , I suppose , those who have accustomed themselves to watch and listen only to the most high tech films on the most high tech equipment . This DVD does not seem to have been processed to suit their taste . If that is a concern with you , if you are going to be annoyed by technical deficiencies or sometimes erratic cutting of the final print , then perhaps you should buy a filmed performance that is contemporary . Why buy one that will irritate you . For those who are adaptable , I would certainly recommend relaxing and enjoying it .	1
The music of this ballet is brilliant , delicate , extremely expressive and dramatic . Every moment in the show finds its strength and its emotion in the music itself . All the scenes where a crowd occupies the stage are enriched with popular dances , be it on the market place or during the ball at the Capulets . But we are waiting for the more intimate scenes with Romeo and Juliet and those scenes become dainty , light , but never joyful , because we feel under the surface the drama that is coming and will find its full expression in the vault at the end . The fight scenes on the other hand are first of all and above all sombre and dark , bleak and full of shadows , the shadows of our memory and of our inherited culture : we know that playing with such a fire is deadly , fatal and lethal , and the music is there to make that hellish fire of hatred burn anew and burn ablaze . But it is a ballet and The Royal Ballet of London makes a miracle with a gorgeous setting , with superb costumes , with delicate and light dancing , all the time . Naturally Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev are the stars , but stars in a sky very well staffed and packed with smaller stars , but stars all the same . And the gleaming light of the main stars is enhanced by the twinkling lights of the others . They do not dominate . They are carried to the top by the magic carpet of all the dancers that fly high and swift in the sky of the music . And this classical dancing is also enriched with the expressivity of every movement , of every bearing of the heads , of every look in the eyes , so much so that we do not even know where to start looking , watching , admiring and satiating our desire of beauty . Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , Paris Universities II and IX .	1
Having seen most of the available DVD versions of Romeo and Juliet , I still greatly prefer the more traditional MacMillan choreography , which sticks closely to Prokofiev 's original conception in his scoring , to either Nureyev 's idiosyncratic 1995 Paris National Opera , with Loudieres and Legris , or Grigorovich 's radically revisionist 1988 Bolshoi , with Bessmertnova and Mukhamedov.I 'm not a dancer , and will leave appraisals of technique and skill to other reviewers . I always appreciate Ivy Lin 's very perceptive and engaging discussions of many ballet performances , and several other reviewers have added helpful commentary here.For those who are interested in the music of Prokofiev , conductor John Lanchbery 's reading of this score is one of the best and most satisfying ever recorded on either film or CD ; for reasons that I 've never quite fathomed , Prokofiev often tends to be badly misunderstood by many Russian conductors . ( And by all means avoid any Russian attempts at Stravinsky , which in my experience tend to be uniformly uncomprehending . ) Conducting for ballet is always a little tricky - do you adjust the meter and dynamics to suit the choreographer and ballet master , or do you make them adjust to your reading of the score ? Here Lanchbery , choreographer Kenneth MacMillan and ballet director Frederick Ashton have worked together with each other and with film director Paul Czinner in perfect harmony to produce the best possible integrated performance of music , dance , acting , and film , of any ballet that I 'm aware of.Yes , acting . As Ms. Lin suggests , Nureyev 's sensitivity as an actor is at least as accomplished as his skill as a dancer . Fonteyn magically sheds her years to become 14 years old again , entirely inhabiting rather than 'playing ' the role of Juliet.Pay particular attention to both David Blair as Mercutio and Desmond Doyle as Tybalt . Blair 's teasing and mocking demeanor is wonderful throughout , the best on film . Doyle 's cold haughty rage , in his every stance and expression , is a wonder to behold . His Tybalt has never been equaled or even approached in any other performance of this ballet . The choreography and the dancers ' gestures , large and small , in the entire fight scene are a major highlight of this production and put all other versions to shame.As many reviewers have suggested , Kultur Video has here ( as with all of their releases ) simply made a direct transfer to DVD not from Czinner 's original film stock but instead from their unfortunately rather grainy VHS print , with no attempt having been made to remaster the video copy . I have no idea who owns the rights to this Embassy Pictures film , but a remastered edition of this irreplaceable performance taken from film stock is desperately needed.For those viewers who care more about audiovisual clarity - you know who you are - than the quality of the performance itself , I recommend the 2000 Ferri/Corella/La Scala release over the 1984 Ferri/Eagling Royal Ballet , both of which use the traditional MacMillan choreography . The 1984 Royal Ballet is very nicely done ; the 2000 La Scala is superb in all respects - dancing , acting , 'chemistry ' , sets and costumes , orchestral conducting and playing , and filming . But neither can hold a candle to this 1966 Fonteyn/Nureyev performance .	1
If I were to take a trip back to my childhood , the aptly-named `` Moonwalker '' , the brainchild of Michael Jackson , would be one of the prominent stops . Even back when I was n't necessarily an MJ fan ( I am now ) , this movie captured my imagination . Rather than a whole , cohesive movie , it 's a collection of mini-films , for the most part well-woven together . The first part is a performance of `` Man in the Mirror '' . The second is a retrospective on Michael Jackson 's career , with clips from his music videos and performances from his early career to his `` Bad '' days ( which is the era when the movie was made , and it shows ) . The third is a re-enactment of the `` Bad '' video by a younger counterpart of the cast . The fourth part is a mini-movie which features Michael Jackson escaping from maniacal fans and press by racing a motorcycle as a rabbit-man and eventually doing a dance duel with him ( you really need to see it to believe it ) . The fifth is a video for `` Leave Me Alone '' , and the sixth and final part is a noir/sci-fi film where Michael and three young kids on the streets who have befriended him try to escape a drug lord ( Joe Pesci ) who wants Michael 's head after the latter discovers his plans to get all kids addicted to drugs . `` Moonwalker '' never made it to theatres in the US ( it did , however , in Europe and South America ) , but that did n't stop the VHS release to be sold in over 800,000 copies within a year of the movie 's release . It is a truly engrossing trip through the imagination of the legendary musician/entertainer . While many musicians have tried their hands at filmmaking and only succeeded at showing that they have no talent at it , Michael Jackson surprises . Not only does he show that he has as much feel for staging and visual storytelling as he has for music , he manages to make this movie his own , weaving into both the collage and story some truly imaginative moments.Take the midway point , where we sort of hit the `` present '' . The `` Bad '' video is reenacted by younger actors , in a truly hilarious but nonetheless competent spectacle . After that , Michael Jackson emerges onto the 'streets ' of Hollywood and is hounded by an assortment of stark-raving-mad , claymated fans and press . An attempt by a humoured Michael to escape his chasers ensues , but as he finds out , trying to hide out in Hollywood studios ( especially when you 're Michael Jackson ) is about as easy as hiding the punch at a banquet.But his way out of this situation is possibly my favourite part of the movie . Disguising himself as a leather-clad rabbit man , he manages to escape the studios on a bicycle , which transforms into a motorcycle . At this point `` Speed Demon '' kicks in as the rabbit-man drives at breakneck speed down the highway , ocean and sky . And still the relentless fans and media are hot on Michael 's tail , his disguise not fooling them . This all makes up a truly stunning piece of claymation , both excellently-paced and delicious to behold . Driving out into the desert , Michael takes off his disguise only to have the rabbit disguise reanimate itself , and the two do the best dance duel I 've ever seen . It 's especially stunning to see the claymated rabbit dance like MJ , and Will Vinton and co ( who were responsible for the claymation segment , while Michael himself is live-action ) truly deserve an applause for this as well as Michael.Following is the video for `` Leave Me Alone '' , a truly imaginative , satirical portrait of the mass hysteria the media attribute to Michael . Michael humorously visualises this as an amusement park constructed on top of him , while a miniature version of him goes through a has-to-be-seen-to-be-believed tour , frequented by lots of dogs in suits . This video may feel like a filler but its imagination and vision more than make up for it.This is when the 'movie ' itself begins . My favourite part is when Michael steps into a 30s-style club and `` Smooth Criminal '' kicks in , resulting in a truly artistic music-video sequence , climaxing in the middle , when the music dies and the club-goers chant , for almost a minute , before the music kicks back in . I wo n't spoil the rest of the movie for you , but these are my favourite parts.If you are a Michael Jackson fan then this belongs in your collection for sure . Whether or not you are a fan , if you want to see a really imaginative , creative journey through Michael Jackons 's imagination , I can also recommend this . One thing is for sure ; the tagline could n't be more correct . This truly IS a movie like no other .	1
I was about 3 when this came out and Michael 's music and dancing is one of the main reasons I became a performer . This mix of clips and then short film is somehting that will always be magical , and it shows Michael at his best.This movie should have come out on DVD a long time ago . I hope that it will be released soon .	1
$ 200 IT IS REALLY SAD 2 SEE PEOPLE TRYING 2 BANK IN ON THE DEATH OF MR.MICHAEL JACKSON ... THIS IS A GOOD DVD BUT COME ON NOW $ 200 ? GET IT 2GETHER OR LEAVE IT ALONE	1
You ca n't beat the King of pop . So sad he is gone , but he can still live on through his music and videos . The video was great andnow I can watch it again and again . Thanks Amazon and Michael .	1
This is my second time buying this one . I have a terrible habit of thinking people will return things they borrow . I like watching this with the younger grandkids . They like to get up and dance , I like to cringe when they show the spiders . Fair trade . They do show a lot of his dance steps and the creativity behind it . One of the best yet , besides The Wiz .	1
It is done very well , shipped fast and works great ! I had been looking for this for a long time and it is just how I remembered it as a kid ! I am so glad I got it !	1
This DVD was very entertaining . I really liked the wild adventure film written by Michael Jackson . It truly showed what a creative mind he had and his musical genius .	1
when moonwalker first came out ... and just like millions of teens like me , i had to go and buy the vhs tape which i treasured . but i have a feeling that moonwalker wo n't be on dvd for the u.s. anytime in the near future . and who can blame michael ? ? i 'm sure in other countries , his public image is a lot better than america when we have people like nancy grace trashing him on a daily basis . but for 1988 , this tape kicked [ ... ] ! ! and you def . got your $ $ worth ... but i would love to see it on dvd for the rest of us .	1
This movie is not on region 1 DVD yet and STILL it has over a hundred reviews with a 4.5 star average . The explanation is because this is simply an awesome film and treasure chest from when Michael was at his peak . Well , Thriller was his peak but this is close . You do n't necessarily have to be a Michael Jackson fan to like it , but being an 80s fan is obligatory . Especially given the amount of Claymation in this film.This movie is a collection of segments . The first involves some live Michael footage . I usually do n't watch this . I do n't like the song , do n't know what it is , but it 's this wimpy feel-good `` heal-the-world '' nonsense.After this the movie really kicks in . It 's this montage that basically is out to show you how awesome Michael is . It 's a career retrospective that , given Michael 's recent actions , is kind of sad . This segment is really eerie for some reason . It 's filled with strange visuals . For example , at one point the screen showing Michael footage turns into a starship and flies away . There 's also some Claymation , natch.Next there 's some more weirdness involving a superfluous remake of the Bad video only with the adults replaced with children . At one point the little `` Michael '' holds his hand over his mouth like he forgot his line and ... well this is just kinda weird . Nothing can prepare you for the absolute weirdness of the next segment . Heck , who am I trying to kid , this whole thing is weird.Things really take a turn for the terrifying when we are introduced to claymation psychos stalking Michael ! The really strange thing is they are claymation when they are shown up close , but in the long shots they are real people wearing huge heads ! This segment is filled with cartoon hijinx . People getting squished like pancakes for example . Michael , being chased by the aforementioned claymation stalkers , transforms into a claymation rabbit in order to escape . This is just the first of many transformations Michael will transmogrify into during the course of this film . Michael takes to the streets and is pursued by the terrifying stalkers that take to the street as well . Michael transforms into many people at different points in the chase including Pee Wee Herman . This part of the film is used to showcase the `` Speed Demon '' song . His retreat vouchsafed , he takes off the rabbit mask . Much to his chagrin , the Rabbit mask becomes the rabbit . After a dance off , Michael obviously wins by using a super-duper-presto-chango-spinning-dance-tornado . Sadly , this takes place in a no-dancing-zone and Michael is given a ticket.This next segment is basically a music video for the song `` Leave me alone . '' This video focuses on the many rumors ( and truths ) that the tabloids printed about Michael . Great 80s visuals including dogs in suits , Bubbles the chimp , and Michael dancing with the elephant man 's bones.Finally we have the Smooth Criminal segment which is the centerpiece of the film . This part is a very strange tale , penned by Michael if I 'm not mistaken . In this little fable , Michael and three children romp in a field when they stumble upon an eerie cave . Two of the children go in to retrieve their ball and Michael and the girl are forced to enter in order to find them . Filled with spiders and webs , the cave offers quite a perilous challenge . They stumble upon the hideout of a mob boss , played by Joe Pesche . This drug lord reveals his plan to get children hooked on drugs . I suppose this plan is yclept `` Bugs and drugs '' because the mobster repeats this phrase for seemingly no reason . I could make the statement that spiders are not bugs , but I 'll let this go . The mob boss spots them and with what turns out to be my favorite part of the whole movie , proceeds to scream at them `` DEEEEEAAAAAD ! DEEEEEAAAAAD ! DEEEEEAAAAAAD ! I assume Michael and the kids escape because we next see Michael exiting his house where he is shot at by the mobster 's army . Due to his supernatural powers , Michael is saved and , once again , takes to the streets . When he is cornered by the thug army he does what any iconic superstar does , he transforms into a car . Car-Michael escapes and the mobsters pursue him on motorcycle-back . Meanwhile , the little girl from earlier bivouacs in a decrepit on dive yclept `` Club 30s . '' She is soon joined by the two boys from earlier . Car-Michael arrives at the seen and transforms back . Michael enters Club 30s and he must have time travel abilities as well because with a flash of light the dive is now filled with patrons in appropriate period costumes . Michael now sings Smooth Criminal . '' Do n't prematurely assume that things are over for this segment because after the song Michael meets up with the boys that divulge the horror to Michael that the girl has been kidnapped . All that remains is a spider covered teddy bear . Michael , undoubtedly pissed , goes off in search of her only to be surrounded by the mobster 's army . Do you think things are over for Michael ? I hope not because you 've obviously forgotten that in this film Michael has supernatural powers . As the drug lord begins to inject smack into the little girl Michael uses a scream-attack that shatters all the glass within a 50 mile radius . Awestruck , the mob-army can only stand stoically as Michael undergoes yet another transformation . He turns into a robot like being that continues to utilize the scream-attack and uses missiles and a secondary weapon . Cumulonimbus clouds form in the backdrop and Michael now unleashes his tertiary weapons system : a double cannon that protrudes from his stomach . After all his goons are history , the mob boss takes flight . He was n't trying to escape however , instead he wishes to unleash his most powerful weapon at Michael : a huge particle beam cannon ! All this time Michael has been transforming into his final and ultimate form : Starship Michael ! ! ! He unleashes his coup de grace beam attack and the mob boss is blown to smithereens ! With this amazing segment finished there 's really no reason to continue watching . Nothing in this review is made up , it 's all in the movie . If you have not seen this movie , do n't wait for the DVD , get the VHS post-haste ! ! !	1
This excellent concert video was filmed during Rush 's highly successful & quot ; Hold Your Fire & quot ; tour . At the time this video was filmed in 1989 , Rush was at the peak of their popularity , although they did release some good cds afterward , such as & quot ; Presto & quot ; and & quot ; Roll the Bones & quot ; . The songs on this video are first-rate and feature Neil , Alex , and Geddy in all of their glory . Other than Carl Palmer , I have n't heard a drummer that can match Neil Peart 's intensity , while Alex 's guitar playing is top notch and Geddy 's bass and harmonic keyboard playing are unparalleled.All of Rush 's classic hits are performed on this video , as well as several from the & quot ; Hold Your Fire & quot ; cd , which happens to be my personal favorite . From the melodic & quot ; Closer to the Heart & quot ; to the fast-paced & quot ; Marathon & quot ; , Rush does n't miss a beat whith their high-energy progressive rock and roll . I highly recommend this fine concert video . Watch it and experience the & quot ; Rush & quot ; .	1
This video is pretty cool , but the only reason I gave this video & quot ; 4 & quot ; stars , instead of & quot ; 5 & quot ; is due to the fact that one of Rush 's BEST songs is missing from the video ... 'Subdivisions ' . I 'm a little suprised that this song was not included in the video , especailly the fact that it 'is ' on the & quot ; A Show Of Hands & quot ; live album . But , other than that , this video is not too bad . My favorite songs that I would like to point out from the video are ... ... & quot ; The Big Money & quot ; , & quot ; Marathon & quot ; , & quot ; Force Ten & quot ; , & quot ; Mission & quot ; , & quot ; Closer To The Heart & quot ; , & quot ; Red Sector A & quot ; , & quot ; YYZ & quot ; , & quot ; The Spirit Of Radio & quot ; , & quot ; Tom Sawyer , & quot ; 2112 & quot ; , and & quot ; La Villa Strangiato & quot ; . And also Neil 's awesome drum solo , which is really cool ! COOL video , but could of used & quot ; Subdivisions & quot ; .	1
From the biggest Police nut in the world , I had this back when it first came out on VIDEO ! And watched it about 1000 times.If you own one live DVD , this is the one to get . Great mix , great songs , old stuff , new stuff , some killer , killer arrangements of songs old and new . Stewart is just on fire on this stage . Plus , the DVD has songs that were n't on that original video.The only drawbacks are the backup singers ( unnecessary but hey at least it 's not a HORN section like on Ghost tour ) and a really limp version of `` Every Breath You Take , '' which Sting was probably sick of singing already at this point since it was literally everywhere in 1983.If you 're looking for older police concert material to see them before Synchronicity , wait for `` Police Around the World '' to come out on DVD . Own that and this and you 've got old Police/new Police covered.This absolutely rocks , though . Yes , Sting 's wearing his `` rag '' outfit from the `` Synchronicity 2 '' video ...	1
this is a great dvd.sure there are alot of crowd shots , there are some amusing effects put on in the editing stage , and i have watched this numerous times and i do not recall any shots of sting flexing his muscles or running his fingers through his hair.what is on this dvd is hands down one of the greatest frickin'bands ever to grace the planet.if you have any interest in the police at all this is a must have.the audio is fantastic , the images are crisp and clean , and sting , andy , and stewart play just a fantastic show.i never had the good fortune of seeing the police in their prime , so if you did n't either it would serve you well to buy this post haste.if you want the audio of this show buy the police live double disc.disc 2 is this show in its entirety.also be aware police fans on sept.12 stewart copelands `` police home movie '' titled everyone stares will be released.enjoy .	1
What do you get when you cross the pretentious son of a milkman ( an incorrigible jazzer nicknamed `` Sting '' ) with a great drummer adept at Carribean rhythms ( a self-described `` population statistic '' named Stewart Copeland ) and a journeyman 1960 's guitarist who ( for better or worse ) never quite fit the mold of a Jimmy Page , Jeff Beck or Eric Clapton ( a.k.a . Andy Summers ) ? ? Well , you get a group of veteran musicians with a well-developed songcraft , a high-level of musicianship , an eclectic repertoire that fuses jazz/funk/reggae/punk rock and a very strong desire to succeed ( they even went blonde-the ultimate sacrifice ! ) .This film is perhaps the lone historical document that captures this great 80 's band in their prime and in front of an audience for a full length concert . As such it is essential viewing for any fan . It does , however , suffer from the fact that , unlike the classic `` power trio '' format ( i.e . `` The Jimi Hendrix Experience '' or `` Cream ) which attempts to fill the sonic void using a high level of virtuosity , this trio takes a minimalistic approach to their music . In the studio , this creates a subtle , simple elegance . On stage , it results in some dead air . This group would have been better served if they had been filmed in a smaller , more intimate venue . But , we 'll just have to make do with what 's available here ! Sidenote : Sting 's multi-colored post-apocalyptic outfit , probably inspired by the Mad Max movie series , is vaguely reminiscent of a pinata the day after a particularly raucous birthday party . It 's good for a chuckle.Clarification : Yes , my commentary on Sting 's outfit was pointing to the fact that he appears to have been wrapped in paper mache ' and then flogged . But much to his credit , Sting still managed to carry on and play a great show .	1
Fellow Carpenters Fans : This is the DVD release of the & quot ; Yesterday Once More & quot ; video , just redesigned . The quality is excellant and if you 're a Carpenters fan you 'll LOVE IT ! It 's sad for us US Carpenters fans that they are no longer releasing newer material . & quot ; As Time Goes By & quot ; was the last release and it was only released in JAPAN , excuse me , but ... I thought the Carpenters were born and started in the USA ? ? ? The last US release was the compilation CD & quot ; Singles 1969-1981 & quot ; , another compilation ! Richard is currently working on a Christmas album . Let 's hope the US will see this ! AlwaysCarpenterstoyou . tipod . com	1
I 've aleady reviewed & quot ; Gold & quot ; earlier , so I am writing to all those people who asked for a & quot ; Carpenters , Live in Concert & quot ; DVD . According to the Grant Guerrero website ; there is a & quot ; Carpenters , Live at Budokan , 1974 & quot ; DVD concert . It was released in Japan in 2002 . It has the same content as the previously released VHS tape , which many Carpenter fans already own . I am positive the sound and video have been upgraded to the DVD level . If you want to see this DVD , you either have to have an all-region DVD player , or a DVD player that will play Japan-coded DVDs . I sometimes wonder if A & amp ; M/Universal has any regard for the USA Carpenter fans . This is not fair .	1
This dvd was first released in 1985 titled & quot ; Yesterday Once More. & quot ; I had always held hope that this video would make it to the dvd format . I own both vhs and laser disc versions of this release and I must say , dvd makes a world of difference . Dvd audio is getting more popular , A & amp ; M is releasing a dvd audio of the Carpenters greatest hits titled & quot ; Gold & quot ; on October 22nd . As with all dvd converted video and film , the sound is excellent , the picture crisp . Not one change has been made to this dvd , the video was perfect the first time around and is now preserved for all time .	1
This DVD is excellent ! I love to see Karen & amp ; Richard singing together on the big screen . It is also nice to see some of the original & quot ; promotional films & quot ; that K & amp ; R did for their songs before the MTV era was born back in August of '81 . This is a must for all Carpenteer 's fans	1
I have loved the Carpenters music ever since I was about 7 years old ( which used to get me some strange looks in the playground ) and I am now 19 and while I listen less as my tastes have expanded I still think of Karen as one of the greatest vocalists of all time and Richard one of the best arrangers.It is inspiring that to people of all ages that 2 normal kids from Downey can achieve the success and reach the heights that they did.However some videos can be harrowing and even heartbreaking to watch as Karen and Richard 's personal demons take hold.Richard was able to overcome his , but unfortunately fame for Karen came less easily and the price too high.She is gone physically her spirit and soul live on through her brother and her voice.Karen 's star may have only shone briefly , but few have shone brighter and with more beauty .	1
I think this is a Nice Collection of Clips & whatnot of a Duo that really had a Impact on Pop Music.it reflects a time period vibe & Mood.it 's cool to see Artists not effected by the whole MTV Concept.do n't get me Wrong I Liked MTV back in the Mid 80 's & what have you but it 's cool to see a Act Uncut & just doing there thing.these songs are still Mellow & Cool to this day .	1
Anything that has Karen 's voice , and drumming , and Richard 's piano work and arrangements can only be fantastic . It 's very enjoyable .	1
Since no-one else is dancing this ballet , one wonders where else one would find a copy of it on any medium ? Folks disregard the low marks from the 1 star reviewer , and do n't be afraid to invest in this ballet , with music by Maya Plisetskaya 's husband , Rodion Shchedrin , who wrote and dedicated the music for this ballet to her . Read the review by Expressive Dance Mom , on this listing of Humpbacked Horse , and her comment to the 1 star reviewer . Her remarks are right on . I think you can believe her.I too , think the Little Humpbacked Horse is a very good ballet with some remarkable dancing from the principles . Yes , it 's a bit childish , and the animation is a bit crude , but you probably wo n't find many children complaining about those aspects about it . And , as reviewer , Expressive Dance Mom seems quite enthusiastic about the ballet , most adults wo n't complain either . Very little of the music is damaged by the voice-overs , and you get to hear some very good music by Shchredrin . If you do n't know him , ( I did n't when I first started looking for Maya Plisetskaya on DVD ) , for goodness sake get a copy of their Carmen Suite too . His re-arraingement of Bizet 's Carmen is fabulous . You wo n't believe what he did with only strings and five percussionists ... ... Shchedrin - Carmen Suite / Maya Plistetskaya ... ..Another thing folks , If you really want to know about this great ballerina , get her autobiography ... .I , Maya Plisetskaya ... .And do n't be afraid of buying used copies , especially the hardback copies . I found one for less than $ 10.00 in excellent condition , with many photos . The photo of her on the White House steps w/JFK is one of the saddest faces ( hers ) I have ever seen . You will understand that sadness after you read about her life in the Soviet Russia . To have been a Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the Bolshoi , she was badly mistreated . Some of that mistreatment was still going on when this ballet was being born . She really caught hell over Carmen Suite . Read about it.I know many of you want good ballets for your children . The reason I know , is because of the number of yes votes I have recieved on my review of Snow White ... .Arag & oacute ; n : Snow White ( ballet ) ... . Lots of those votes are coming from people looking for ballets for their children . Buy this ballet for your children . They will love it , and you will too , and HEY , get Snow White too ... ..Richard .	1
This was a gift for my brother and according to him , it is awesome . He likes Pink Floyd so loved the video .	1
This one is hard to find , and I wish they would release it in NTSC format on DVD , but this video tape is one of my favorites ! David Gilmour and crew put on a great show , even without Roger Waters . I was only disappointed that it did n't last longer ! Great performance ! Wish I were there !	1
I saw this concert in Nassau Coliseum in New York in 1988 . It was a great show . This would be a 5 star video but there are two problems with it . One is the slow motion during their playing , very bothersome . Two , what happened to the opening song `` Shine On You Crazy Diamonds '' , there is only the last three or four minutes of it as the show starts . The song live was about 12 or 13 minutes long as heard on the CD . Please when you guys bring this to DVD give us the show as it was seen from the audience , I 'm sure the film is in the archives waiting to show us the concert , the whole show . Please get rid of the special effects . Take a note from Roger Waters ' DVD of `` In the Flesh '' which is a great DVD . Also saw that show in The Garden in 2000 . If it does n't come to DVD , a crime , then to Pink Floyd fans this will do .	1
Because of hours spent watching this video , I walked out on the Synchronicity concert . After listening to disc one of The Police Live , then disc two , I feel justified in doing so.If you can find this film , buy it !	1
The Floyd playing ECHOES part I in the sun-splashed arena by day as the camera tracks in slowly ( awesome ) .Waters pounding the heck out of the gong on Saucerful of Secrets , slow motion sequences during One of These Days , strangely lit scene during Set the Controls & amp ; Wright 's keyboarding , and the making of Dark Side with interviews.Need I say more , this is the definitive Floyd VHS.Non-Floyd fans do n't even knock this one because if you do n't appreciate the Floyd then you wo n't like this anymore than you would The Wall .	1
This is an excellent , but somewhat overlooked , document of a classic Pink Floyd performance . Most people associate Floyd concerts with light shows and football stadiums , but this performance is set in the ruins of Pompeii ( actually , in a old stadium , but I digress ) , without the special effects or even an audience . This IS Pink Floyd music , as raw and real as you 've never imaginedThe songs are truly the focus of this film , but the performances are intertwined with images of volcanic eruptions , ancient mosaics murals , and the plaster casts of the victims who were buried alive beneath tons of lava . The Pompeii setting gives a totally differnet feeling to these classic Floyd songs . For example , & quot ; Echoes & quot ; is filled with underwater imagery , but in the film , the performance is paired with footage of bubbling volcanic mud springs , and of the band members traipsing through the desert in a sand storm , giving a whole new dimension to the song.The performances themselves are outstanding . Highlights include the aformentioned & quot ; Echoes , & quot ; divided up into to Parts I and II , and a frenetic take of & quot ; A Saucerful of Secrets. & quot ; I read somewhere that this was the last time the Floyd ever performed this particular song . A shot of Roger Waters risking a possible burst blood vessel during & quot ; Careful with that Axe , Eugene & quot ; is another highlight.As an added bonus , this film includes interviews of the band , and footage of the recording of & quot ; Dark Side of the Moon. & quot ; These revealing sequences of the band fiddling in the studio , arguing over recording teqniques , and having supper , show the human side of Pink Floyd , contradicting the notion that their machines and electronics do all the work , something that David Gilmour dicussses in his interview . The behind-the-scenes footage does not show Roger Waters in a particularly flattering light , as he is shown as very irritable and pompous , but his intimidating intelligence shines through in his interviews . The Nick Mason & quot ; pie with no crust & quot ; scene is a hilarious bit of rock and roll pretentiousness.Kudos must also be given to the director and the film crew . Their slow crossover shots , almost reminicent of Kubrick , fit the dreamy atmosphere that the music provides . The ultra-slow zoom-in shot at the beginning of & quot ; Echoes & quot ; , followed by the same shot done as a zoom-out at the end of the film , is clever and effective.I take away one star for some minor faults . One , the cameras focus too much on the drumming on & quot ; One of these Days. & quot ; I would have much rather preferred scenes of Roger playing his delayed echo bass part , or footage of Gilmour 's scorching slide guitar solo ( This is also a problem during & quot ; Set the Controls ... & quot ; but Nick Mason 's tribal beats in this song are much more interesting to watch . ) Two , the parts where they cut away to the band in front of a green-screen , mimicing their previously recorded performances , are just plain cheesy , and take away from the atmosphere . Lastly , there are no interview segements of Richard Wright . A minor complaint , but he is an important member of the band , and his exclusion , for whatever reason , just does n't seem right.Those flaws do not take away from the outsanding portrait of the Pre-DSOTM-era Pink Floyd that is & quot ; Live at Pompeii. & quot ; Any Floyd fan should click on the & quot ; Add to Shopping Cart & quot ; button right way , and let the Floyd take you to places you 've never been before .	1
I begin with an important warning to anyone contemplating purchasing the DVD , especially if you think you 're going to get rid of the VHS version , or you plan to get only the DVD for the very first time -- THIS is still the definitive version , and you will regret not having the VHS around . The reason is that the DVD was done by producer Adrian Maben with no input from the band , and therefore will be a grave disappointment . Aside from some additional interview material , including the keyboardist Richard Wright ( sorely neglected on the VHS ) , there is very little to recommend the DVD above the VHS -- in fact , some will strongly argue that the DVD is worth nothing and this is really the ONLY good version . Although I have not seen the DVD yet , I have certainly seen very mixed reviews of it . My advice is , if you ARE going to get the DVD , get the VHS with it , or make sure to hang on to your original copy . Yes , VHS is an inferior format in the 21st century , and Pink Floyd does deserve better ... but as Adrian Maben did not see fit to provide anything truly better , this is the best you can do for yourself . Make sure to order one of these now , in case they go out of print ! Yes , there are some noticeable flaws , but we need to remember , Pink Floyd was not yet the financial powerhouse that it is now ... nor were technology or filming technique up to today 's standards , by a long shot . This means you will have to put up with some oddities , including a filming technique that makes it look very much like a period piece . But perhaps the most notable flaw is the fact that the film runs at a slightly high speed . Those observing closely may notice that the band 's movements seem unnaturally fast . But more noticeable is the fact that everything is pitched significantly sharp , so you will not be able to jam along with this without retuning . And finally , as I mentioned before , Richard Wright fans will be very disappointed to note that he is only included once in the interviews , and is not even seen as he speaks . HOWEVER -- even as an ardent Richard Wright fan I ca n't take more than half a point away , as this video will still blow your mind.His keyboard playing , for instance , goes a long way towards making up for the lack of interview material from him , particularly at the end of & quot ; A Saucerful of Secrets & quot ; and during & quot ; Echoes , Part II & quot ; ( the latter of which reduced me to tears ! ) . And who can forget the delightfully funny performance of & quot ; Mademoiselle Nobs & quot ; , a remake of & quot ; Seamus & quot ; where his instrument is ... the dog ? Truly a great piece of Floydian humor to watch ( Although is it me , or does Roger Waters not get the joke ? Watch and find out ... ) . Another set of fans will be greatly appreciative of the VHS -- here , Nick Mason 's more exotic , pre-Dark Side drumming style is showcased fantastically . Notice that he continues without a pause even when a drumstick flies out of his hand . David Gilmour is also in fine form , although to me his most notable moments are in the creation of Dark Side , and Roger Waters delivers almost mad-seeming vocal and percussion performances , in addition to his bass work.The peek into the production process for Dark Side is truly fascinating , and most notable is a wicked version of the On the Run synth loop that will make your hair stand on end . There are also some interesting practice takes by David Gilmour and Richard Wright , including parts from & quot ; Brain Damage & quot ; and & quot ; Us and Them & quot ; . Finally , you 'll at last discover the source of some of the great Floyd-fan inside jokes ( pie without the crust , and so on ) . Overall , I think this video is a solid 4.5 and a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan . Do n't settle for less -- make sure to have a copy of the VHS around , even with the new DVD version !	1
I got to rate this a ( 5 ) five because I love watching it over & over again . It 's one of my favorites & I do n't have many of them . Nothing better than early Pink Foyld . One of the best music videos ever for spinning off , if you get into that sort of thing from time-to-time . A little less dialogue would be nice , that 's the ONLY complaint I have . If your into getting psychedelisized ( example Hendrix ) this tape is for you .	1
Oh yeah ! ! Now this is Pink Floyd the hippy looking rock group of the early seventies ! ! With one major difference ; the sound is Raw , Loud , and it jams ! ! The Bass saturation is very heavy , as was the case with rock music at the time . The drumming is very intense and energetic , as it should be ! Gilmour 's guitar work is the backbone of this awesome music ! The sounds he makes are so deep and moving it 's unbelievable . The second half of Saucerful of Secrets is indescribable , I do n't know whether to cry or jam out with them ? ! . It 's absolutely beautiful , the slide guitar work , the bass rhythm , the flowing organs , the kick butt drum breaks , the wordless vocals.. I do n't know but it rocks ! Or how about Gilmour 's Dark Side of the Moon take where he get 's feedback and they tell him , & quot ; hey , feedback & quot ; . And Gilmour says , & quot ; Well , what would rock and roll be without feedback ? & quot ; Cool stuff you have to see this ! !	1
The Jeff Healey band : Jeff was alsways a wizard , at this performance playing his rock/blues tunes . Would have liked to see him live . RIP and thanks for your music .	1
This was filmed & recorded April 14 , 1989 in London . This was just after their big break-through debut album of 1988 `` See the Light '' . This concert consists of 10 great songs , plus video clips of `` Angel Eyes '' , `` When The Night Comes Falling From the Sky '' , and `` Confidence Man '' . The band consists of the late Jeff Healey on Lead Guitar & Lead Vocals . ( Jeff passed away last year , after battling cancer , most of his live , that 's why he became blind ) . Also , you get Joe Rockman on Bass & Backing Vocals , and Tom Stephen on Drums . This is what they call a `` Power Trio '' .Jeff is an excellent guitar master , and he demonstrates his skills in this concert DVD . Jeff plays all kinds of tricks with his guitar . He plays it behind his head ( Like the late Stevie Ray Vaughan used to do ) .He also plays it with his mouth . He gets up out of his chair , and really gets it on with his guitar , moving his body with the rhythym , while he plays it . It 's amazing , especially for a blind guitar player . This guy was very talented . He was an excellent guitarist & an excellent lead vocalist . He will be missed.The songs are as follows:1 . The Better It Gets2 . I 'm Tore Down3 . My Little Girl4 . Blue Jean Blues5 . I Need To BE Loved6 . Roadhouse Blues7 . See the Light8 . That 's What They Say9 . All Along the Watchtower10.HideawayPlus , the bonus video clips of:11.Angel Eyes12.When The Night Comes Falling From the Sky13.Confidence ManOverall , this is an outstanding concert DVD , and I highly recommend it . Thanks ! ! ! !	1
THIS CONCERT IS GREAT . YOU GET TO SEE FIRST HAND WHAT THE BUZZ WAS ALL ABOUT . JEFF 'S PLAYING WAS OFF THE CHARTS.SITTING OR STANDING MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THIS GUY . FULL THROTTLE . THE LATER SHOW IN MONTREUX IN 1999 IS A LITTLE MORE REFINED BUT BUY BOTH FOR YOUR COLLECTION . GOD BLESS JEFF HEALEY . HIS LIFE IS A TRIBUTE TO WHAT THE HUMAN SPIRIT CAN DO REGARDLESS OF THE HUMAN CONDITION .	1
This great tape/laserdisc contains just about every Devo film from 1979 to 1983 and a couple ( Jocko Homo , Satisfaction ) from before then . In between every few videos are comic interludes with characters Rod and Donut Rooter ( Michael Schwartz and Laraine Newman ) and even Timothy Leary as Dr. Byrthfood . Overall , this is great fun from the Akron spudboys , and the only place to find Dr. Detroit , probably the last great Devo video .	1
More than any other band of the video era , DEVO knew how to capitalize on the form . Their `` The Men Who Make The Music '' was shown on arthouse type cable shows before most peole even knew what music video was ! I consider this to be an essentail part of any music vid library ( AND PLEASE SOMEONE GET IT ON DVD ! ! ! ) . Granted , the production values are way primitive compared to what followed in the decade , but the level of enthusiasm DEVO brought to the form has rarely been matched . And let us not forget the noteworthy perfomances of Larraine Newman and Spazz Attack.You get `` Whip It '' for the plastic energy domes , `` The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize '' for the potatoes playing the hippo 's teeth , Barbi and Ken in their great big fight during `` Love Without Anger '' ... are you a Spud ? Even if you are n't , you must have `` We 're All Devo . ''	1
So there I was , sitting in my apartment in Chapel Hill ( Carrboro , actually ) , flipping channels on the TV , when I came across this breaking news report about a group of crazy liberals threatening to detonate a nuclear device in Charleston harbor . It 's sort of embarrassing , but I have to admit that it scared the bejesus out of me for a few minutes - until I flipped over to CNN and the networks and saw that they were n't covering any such story , asked myself what the heck the RBS network was , and realized that I was tuned in to the Lifetime Channel . ( The movie originally aired on NBC in 1983 , but I have no memory of that original broadcast . ) Fifteen minutes into the film , I should note , a disclaimer does appear on the screen assuring viewers that the events being dramatized are not in fact happening . It certainly made for interesting conversation the next day , and I have been dying to see this film again ever since then ( it still has n't been released on DVD ) .The beauty of Special Bulletin was the fact that the movie was designed to play exactly as if it were an actual live news event - complete with technical problems , reports from correspondents in Charleston and Washington , D.C. , announcements from political leaders , etc . Watching it again now , I have to laugh about it because it 's obviously low budget and some of the acting really was n't all that good . Still , it boasts a brilliant concept for a film , and , now that I 've finally rediscovered this movie , I know I 'll be watching it on and off for many years to come . Even when you know it 's fiction , it still makes for compelling viewing.As for the story , you have this group of five terrorists ( led by two former defense scientists ) who take over a tugboat in Charleston harbor , engage in a firefight with the Coast Guard , take two Guardsmen as well as a journalist and his cameraman hostage , and demand a live network feed . In an effort to get the hostages released , the RBS network gives them what they want , at which time they demand that all trigger devices on nuclear weapons housed in the Charleston area be brought to them for destruction . This act of unilateral disarmament , they argue , will surely inspire the Soviets to follow their lead . If their demands are not met , they then announce , they will detonate their own nuclear device right there in Charleston . Government spokesmen cast doubts upon the truth of the threat early on , but the tension soon ratchets up as more and more evidence comes to light indicating that this terrorist threat could very well be frighteningly real.The film raises a number of fairly obvious and important questions . Should a network be permitted to hand over a live feed to terrorists , for any reason ? What would the government do in such a case of nuclear blackmail ? Would we stick to our policy of never dealing with terrorists , even if it meant the destruction of a major American city ? Would the government undertake the logistical nightmare of evacuating such a large city ? At one point , the network hosts even get in to a debate with the terrorists themselves about the influence of the media on something like this.Obviously , Special Bulletin now looks and feels its age , but the issues it addresses are more pertinent than ever before - and it still delivers quite a thrilling conclusion . This made-for-TV movie will always be a cult favorite in this reviewer 's heart .	1
Special Bulletin is a TV movie about nuclear bomb threat in Charleston S.C. and how on television network responses to crisis , when one of their newcrews becomes in invovled . I really liked this movie , because of the way that the network reacts to the crisis . In the beginning there is concern for the hostages , but as the continues you see graphics and music being developed . And it becomes less about the hostages and more about get the story . Overall its a good movie .	1
I remember seeing this when it was originally broadcast and it was one of the first TV movies ( or any movie , for that matter ) that addressed the modern ( at the time ) media coverage of disasters . Although the graphics are dated , this is still a timely story . A group of nuclear scientists build a bomb and hold the city of New Orleans hostage . They demand the dismantling of warheads and have them delivered to them for destruction in an attempt to start a worldwide movement to eliminate nuclear weapons . This is a very well written ( by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz ) script that deals with this situation in a very realistic manner . The network insisted on inserting graphics stating that this was a TV drama - they remembered the WAR OF THE WORLDS panic from the 1930 's - although anyone familiar with TV actors of the time would have recognized most of the excellent cast . This is one of Warner Brothers archive collection , a great idea that of that studio 's whereby they release little in demand films on DVD by request . It 's a bare bones disc , which in a way is unfortunate - a commentary and/or interviews with the cast would have been fascinating . It 's still well worth a purchase .	1
My 2-year old son absolutely LOVES this video ! My wife & I bought a used VHS copy of it , and from the moment we first put it on for him , he was enthralled and his eyes rarely move away from the screen whenever it 's playing . We were surprised to find that it was available on DVD , so we bought it for our son 's birthday recently , because the 17-year old tape was quickly wearing out ! `` Disneyland Fun '' was originally part of a 14 volume VHS video series released in the late 1980 's ; this particular video was filmed on location at Disneyland in 1990 , and follows a singular group of children around the park as they participate in the various song sequences alongside many of the classic Disney characters . Even if you did n't know when it was shot , the time period is quite easy to detect with the brightly colored clothes and big hair on display everywhere , as well as the appearance of the then-new character Roger Rabbit , hot on the heels of his popularity from the 1988 film.But as dated as the proceedings may be , there is a great deal of fun to be had , and the songs are timeless & downright infectious ; they 'll stick in your head like glue and you 'll find yourself singing along them , even when you 're not watching it ! My son 's favorites are `` I 'm Walking Right Down The Middle Of Main Street U.S.A. '' , and the all-time classics `` It 's A Small World '' and `` When You Wish Upon A Star '' , complete with an awesome , show-stopping fireworks display.I 'd recommend this video highly to anyone with children , but also as a way of appealing to the child in all of us ; great fun !	1
This video/DVD is an ad for Disneyland . I used it to introduce our 2 1/2 year old daughter to the characters and the look of Disneyland . She loved it . I loved it . Daddy hated it -- 'cuz yes , it 's an ad . Lots of sweet food , the Disneyland parades and rides and characters ; like many reviewers he did n't like the concept of paying to watch an ad . But I honestly believe this helped our daughter enjoy the family trip to one of my favorite places ; -D Especially the teacups ride and Small World ! But now , several months after our trip , I appreciate a few additional things . This video is the only place I 've heard a rare Sherman Brothers song , Makin ' Memories , written for a Kodak-sponsored pre-show to a Disneyland attraction . It 's simple , but the smooth bridge melody acts as a counterpoint to the rest of the song , it 's really interesting . It 's also the only full Rumbly in my Tumbly we 've found , and Pooh Bear is now her favorite.She 's now three , and she still likes to watch the Disneyland video . She mixes up her own experiences with the movie 's , for example she says she did n't like riding Thunder Mountain ( which of course she did n't ride . ) She does say There 's the boats , on the Jungle Cruise.This show taught her that the characters she loves are big . As big as Daddy . ( Which translated later into `` Goofy 's like Daddy ! '' my favorite quote of the whole trip . ) It taught her that they like hugging kids . She still did n't want a hug , but she was happy to stand right next to them as opposed to running in the other direction screaming.It prepared her for sitting still to watch shows and parades . It prepared her for the Jungle Cruise , Pirates of the Caribbean , and Haunted Mansion . ( Yes , we took her on those ; I was n't scarred by my early visits either . She held tight to our hands and knew she was going in a dark place but she 'd seen it before . ) My main advice to Disney is to make a new version . This was made before Toontown , before the Disney Princesses made it big , before the complete revamping of Tomorrowland , before Bear Country became the Hundred Acre Wood , before Toy Story and the Pixar collaboration . Yes , parents will bring their kids to Disneyland anyway , but an updated video showing kids enjoying the favorite Disneyland spots will make it easier to introduce the tiny ones , which in turn is easier on the parents , which makes them want to return sooner ; - )	1
My children enjoyed the songs & visuals , which are centered around Disney Land . The captions are good to help you sing along .	1
At first I was n't sure what to think about this documentary with its sparse narration and pasting together of various production sequences , but after about 40 minutes I became hooked . Straight No Chaser captures Thelonious Monk as a human being which is something one could never do based on his music . The songs alone would make one mistake him for an angel . Here , the stammering , lost , frail genius is fully evident and contextualized in his own voice and through the opinions of those who knew him . I found his son 's remarks to be of great value as viewers can tell that he had a very complex and conflictual relationship with his father . This is to be expected given that Monk had schizophrenia . Luckily , the documentary does not shy away from his condition and the realities of how debilitated he must have been for so much of his life . That he was able to put together the brilliant musical arrangements he did is quite extraordinary . The family story is compelling as well . Clearly , without his wife there is no way in which Monk could have been anywhere near as successful as he was . Best of all is the music -- reproduced here with seemingly endless life performances . Seeing the artist at work is what made the movie for me .	1
So exclaims a frustrated Monk during a late 1960s Columbia recording session , after finishing a haunting run-through of & quot ; Ugly Beauty & quot ; and learning that producer Teo Macero neglected to record it . The movie is filled with wonderful private moments like these , though I ca n't say how much interest it will hold for those not familiar with Monk . For me , however , and for many others who are infatuated with him and his music , the footage in this documentary is gold . The character of Monk is rounded out for us , and we find that he was just as unique and strange in his life as he was in his music . He was truly in his own world , and though for 90 minutes we see him up close , with his musicians , with his wife Nellie , with the Baroness Nica , see his bizarre behavior backstage , at the airport , in the hotel , we are no closer to getting inside his head . For that , one simply needs to hear the music.And the music collected in the movie is astonishing -- An early television appearance where Monk is miffed by Count Basie staring at him across the piano during a performance ... several shows with a quartet including Charlie Rouse ... great footage of the big band sessions of the mid 60s , with Rouse , Johnny Griffin , and Phil Woods scrambling to learn the arrangements ... and the great Columbia session , where Monk becomes visibly annoyed , but still has time for a wonderfully tender moment with pal Teo . There are interviews with Monk 's managers , his son , Charlie Rouse , and a fine piano duet of & quot ; Well You Need n't & quot ; by Tommy Flanagan and Barry Harris , reminding one and all that not only was Monk one of the most distinctive piano players in jazz , but that , along with Ellington and Charles Mingus , he was one of the most brilliant composers as well .	1
It 's hard to imagine a more fitting tribute to the late , great Monk , an innovative stylist who penned `` Round Midnight '' and exerted a tremendous influence on Charlie Parker , Dizzy Gillespie , John Coltrane , and others . That 's largely due to the copious rare footage of Monk , whose bizarre antics we witness on the road and in recording studios . His mumbling musings and anxious tics leave the impression of a mentally unstable man , and it is likely that his tempestuous nature was due to manic depression . But mostly , we hear and see this master keyboardist at work , most notably in a famous 1968 concert filmed by Christian Blackwood . Produced by Clint Eastwood , `` Straight , No Chaser '' is a respectful genuflection to an unusually gifted musician .	1
Explosive ballet with no wasted motion . Petit packs the action into the minimum of time with two first rate performers to provide intensity . The Lovemaking is unmistakably orgiastic ; the fury of rejection and emotional response vividly portrayed . There are moments which fail to register properly but , with an excellent cast , these hardly mar the 44 minutes of superior dance creation and performance .	1
If I were lucky to have been at this concert , it would be one of the few times where I could walk out and say ... ..Now THAT was a great concert ! Next best thing to being at the live concert is this videotape of country greats/legends . What a grand event with legendary heroes - the immortal Johnny Cash , quivering voice of Waylon Jennings , the talented songwriting of Kris Kristofferson and of course the versatility of Willie Nelson.In between the songs are short snippets of separate anecdotes the four share about each other . They have respect , love and admiration for one another . The music is superb , the audience receptive and the band a core of excellent musicians.The concert offers a diverse array of music from Willie 's jazzy and sultry `` Nightlife '' to the comedic `` Boy Named Sue '' and the spiritual `` Why Me Lord '' .Johnny Cash sings the patriotic `` Ragged Old Flag '' and Waylon does his classics- `` Mamas Do n't Let Your Babies Grow up to Be Cowboys '' , `` Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way '' , `` Ai n't No Good Chain Gang '' and `` Luckenbach , Texas '' .Also included are the traveling tunes like `` City of New Orleans '' and `` Highwayman '' . Johnny Cash sings his classics , `` Ring of Fire '' and `` Folsom Prison Blues '' . The other three join him for a fantastic performance of `` Big River '' . A perennial favorite is Kristofferson 's `` Me and Bobby McGee '' .On the softer side - Waylon 's `` Amanda '' and the beautiful song `` Always On My Mind '' . Willie does this one in his original classic way.And there are the cowboys tunes , `` Silver Stallion '' `` Last Cowboy Song '' . The four lend a voice to each other 's songs . They are always on stage together.Some songs I was n't very familiar with like `` Trouble Man '' , `` Best of All Possible Worlds '' , `` They Killed Him '' and `` Living Legend '' . But to hear them is an introduction to wonderful songwriting , something that country music lacks today . `` On the Road Again '' - what better way to end a show than with that catchy , fun road song.The tape was shot at Long Island 's Nassau Coliseum in 1990 and runs 98 minutes . There are 25 songs ! So enjoy a great show that will never be duplicated again . ... ..Rizzo	1
I watched this whole video on the internet . I just loved it and wanted to have it in my library . I 'm going to go watch it right now . We only have 2 of these great performers left to us .	1
A lot of fun to watch One of those concerts that you enjoy enormously watching on a nice system but likely wouldnt enjoy as much if you were there since you wouldnt be able to see what was going on as much.Personally , I dont think Lauper and Sinead were good choices for the two masterpieces that they were given the blessed opportunity to sing but that is nitpicking . Roger sings the majority of the important parts and he does so very well.Roger Waters ' other concert video , In The Flesh , is better overall but then again , In The Flesh is the greatest concert DVD of all time so it wouldnt be fair to compare them .	1
I read a newspaper article where it said that while they were tearing down the stage setup due to the companies that were supposed to be doing so could not show up until later actually found some real unexploded ordinance from the original bombings by the Nazis underneath the planking and stage areas of the Potsdamer Platz Plaza , whether this real stuff was preserved was of unknown origin but I also heard that it surprised the hell out of Roger Waters but I do n't know if this is true or not but I think that I remember seeing him say so in a documentary that I saw him in later . This is a fantastic/amazing concert . I own a copy of it .	1
Its historic , epic , and fantastic . Buy this and you 'll love it , much better than grabbing it off PBS or continuing to watch it on your old vhs .	1
Roger Waters and & # 34 ; The Wall are a great way to & # 34 ; Tear the Wall ! ! That is also apparent as the Germans rightly show their happiness and the oblivious references to life under the East German repression . The guest stars are also well worth seeing . In short , this is a must for anyone who loves Rock music and 1980 's .	1
There could have been no better way to celebrate a great piece of History . The music and the stars were fantastic .	1
Not as good as David Gilmore , but still very good in it 's own right ! Try it you will like if if you like Pink Floyd ! !	1
This is more of a spectacle than a concert . It 's overblown . It 's damn near ridiculous with the helicopters , the limousines on stage , the hundreds of extras , and the A-list guest singers/performers . But , it 's absoluely wonderful.I 'm a Pink Floyd fan ; there 's no doubt about that . And , I love this concert.It pains me to say this , but Cyndi Lauper is annoying . Fortunately , she only sings one song . The rest of the guest singers complement the show - Van Morrison , Sinead O'Connor , and Joni Mitchel to name just a few.The theatrics are just over the top . I ca n't help but believe that this DVD provides the best seat in the house . For anyone having actually attended the concert , I 'm sure a lot was lost visually . So much of the concert takes place behind the Wall . And , there are tens of thousands of concert goers - dare I say hundreds of thousands . I doubt the audio could have been that good for them . For the DVD viewer , the audio is excellent . Furthermore , the DVD blows the viewer away with the vastness of it all.It 's a lot of pomp , but Waters pulls it off with style .	1
all have been said about this historic event.This dvd is a must have.A special rating should be given for the amazing quality of the sound and the 5.1 mixing.This is a true 5.1 mixing very difficult to find on other dvd .	1
True there are some faults with this show , but come on folks , this was one great concert . Read the reviews and you will see how many people contradict one another . The only problem I had was Sinead was barely audible when singing & quot ; Mother & quot ; . Members of & quot ; The Band & quot ; singing the mother 's part was good . Roger in concert 7-13-00 at the Garden sings his part and has the female vocalists sing the mother 's part . I like to hear good artists doing other people 's music . The fact that so many major acts of that time showed up , shows the respect that Roger Waters gets in the music industry . I feel that they stayed as true to the music as possible . His band , The Bleeding Heart Band can play this piece as well as Pink Floyd did . Rick Difonzo plays his guitar almost exactly like Mr. Gilmour . Mr . Waters still has some of these great musicians in his band today like Graham Broad , Andy Fairweather Low and Snowy White . Rent the video and if you do n't like it then you do n't know a classic show even if it bites you on your behind . The Scorpions did an excellent job with & quot ; In the Flesh & quot ; both parts and I 'm not a Scorpions fan . Van Morrison did a very soulful version of & quot ; Comfortably Numb & quot ; . The Orchestra was superb , they probably never preformed in front of such a large audience . Any one who claims to be a Waters fan or a Pink Floyd fan should enjoy this CD and the video . I wish this would be released on DVD , then you have the best of both worlds . Any chance to see Roger Waters in concert no matter what band he has or music he chooses to perform should jump at the chance . This concert was an historical event and is a must for any collector of live shows .	1
i must concur with my friend above . this is a supurb evening with john and friends . the sound and picture are really excellent . i recall seeing john and his working quartet ( joe lovano , dennis irwin and bill stewart ) circa `` what we do '' visit new smyrna beach . john 's parents lived nearby and he and the fellas had just come down from new york city . the quartet songs performed here can be heard on several sco projects including `` flat out '' , `` meant to be '' and his first blue note record `` time on my hands '' . the duets remind me of john 's work with mccoy tyner on the project `` things ai n't what they used to be '' ( blue note ) intimate , bluesy and lovely . to have also performed a couple songs with the remarkable marvin smith and don pullen make for a truly mind bending evening of creative collaberation . an absolute must have for jazz guitar fans and sco fans and deep musician lovers . what a discovery .	1
Here are eight videos from songs Stevie Ray Vaughan and his group did earlier in the 1980s . It 's always a pleasure to hear SRV play his guitar so every song has something to offer . Most of them in this small collection are fast numbers and fun to hear . They are also short numbers so the whole video is only a little over a half-hour in length.In addition , some of the videos are very humorous , particularly the first couple . There are some scenes you laugh out loud . So ... .if you want 36 minutes of up-tempo rock-blues with some fun videos , this a great tape.I see now that this is available now on DVD with bonus songs . Wow , I 'll have to order it ! ( Better late than never . )	1
This video compilation is great . It was a long time coming . SRV has been gone for , what , almost 12 years now ? All the videos are here , Cold Shot , Superstition , Tightrope , Crossfire , and even a live one in New Orleans on a riverboat at the jazz festival . I only wish they would wake up and put this on DVD format . Does n't it deserve to be ?	1
Moody Blues fans this a must have for your collection especially since Ray Thomas is no longer with the band because he was one of the original founding members . The guys get a chance to talk about how the band originally all came about , what the music means to them and how they feel about each other . There is a hilarious scene in the beginning with Graeme getting his beard dyed brown and a wonderful accoustic solo of Tuesday Afternoon.Also nowhere else will you be able to find the videos that were actually shown on MTV. & quot ; I know your out there somewhere & quot ; , & quot ; In your wildest dreams & quot ; , & quot ; No more lies & quot ; , & quot ; The other side of life & quot ; , ( my all time favorite ) and more . I 'll not give away all the surprises you must buy this for yourself to see and hear all the interviews , film clips , videos and rare concert footage . I first saw this on public television many many years ago and it inspired me to send them money.This would make a great gift for yourself or a friend . I have both the VHS and DVD and the quality is possibly better on the VHS but either way you ca n't lose with this little gem . Truely wonderful ! !	1
What a great collection of the best of one of the greatest bands ever the Moody Blues . The collection takes you back to a great place and time !	1
This CD is one of the greatest performances by the Judd 's . They have been a favorite of mine for years But this CD tops anything they have done so far ... .I hope to hear more wonderful music from them soon ... .	1
Prime Cuts : Are the Roses Not Blooming , Love Can Build a Bridge , Talk About LoveCountry music has never been conducive to duos . Save for Brooks and Dunn , JJ White , Thrasher Shriver , the Kinleys , the Larkins , Corbin/Hanner , Darryl and Don Ellis , the Lynns , Brother Phelps , Turner Nichols have come and gone without causing much of a dent on the genre 's charts . Not so with the Judds . Right through the 80s , this mother and daughter duo was a mainstay in country music : winning every conceivable awards for vocal duos , frequented the lofty heights of the country charts and their concerts were of blockbuster success . Part of their indelible success can be attributed to the fact that you could never pigeonhole Naomi and Wynonna Judd . The Judds could very well be the poster child of how to balance between bluesy romp , rocking youthful pop and bucolic down home balladry . `` Love Can Build a Bridge , '' their final studio album , is evidence.As the delectable jazzy piano , introduced a haunting Wynonna Judd on this ferocious leadoff single , `` Born to Be Blue '' opens the album at a promising start . The delightful bluesy riffs are again used to its advantage in `` Rompin ' Stompin ' Blue . '' Naomi Judd 's sassy harmony certainly augments Wynonna 's full bodied Bonnie Riatt-type delivery very nicely on this track . Speaking of Riatt , the diva makes an appearance on this track with her excellent slide guitar playing . `` This Country 's Rockin ' '' as the title suggests , continues to find Wynonna howling and grunting in funky jubilation . Though not one that addresses the deep issues of the human condition , lyrically `` This Country 's Rockin ' , '' a blithe partying anthem , may be a little contrived.Lyrically much superior is the sparse ballad `` Are the Roses Not Blooming ? '' `` Roses ' '' delicately sings home the homily that there is always hope in the midst life 's tribulation . This is a great attestation that Nashville 's songwriters can utilize the matter of three minutes or so to speak to one 's heart . Wynonna 's sensitive vocals and John Jarvis ' excellent playing on the keyboard are sublime . `` Love Can Build A Bridge , '' another top 10 hit for the Judds , continues the inspirational thread . Though lyrically a little clich & eacute ; , this Paul Overstreet , John Jarvis and Naomi Judd co-write with its theme of reconciliation has a universal rhetoric.Two of the most country offerings are `` John Deere Tractor '' and `` Calling in the Wind . '' For the sake of nostalgia , `` John Deere Tractor , '' their debut single was revived , albeit a new recording . `` John Deere Tractor '' and `` Calling in the Wind , '' are both backed by nice fiddling and potent imagery . You do n't get more country than tractors , open fields and a paternal tribute.However , without trying to be too rustic , `` Talk About Love '' is one of the best pop offerings the Judds has had ever recorded . Wynonna 's urgent delivery is backed by a punchy beat and some exceptional guitar playing , `` Talk About Love '' is an understated gem . Equally poppish , though less poignant is Naomi Judd and Don Schlitz 's `` One Hundred And Two . `` There are many pleasurable on this final Judds CD . But the essential quality that sets this CD apart from other country releases is the inter-weaving vocals from mama Judd and daughter . This is further accentuated by Brent Maher 's deft production . Together with their previous release `` River of Time , '' these two CDs are the Judds at their finest .	1
Simply Outstanding ! ! ! This is the best Todd Rundgren concert dvd , I 've seen so far . I have watched lots & lots of other concert dvd 's by other musicians , and I 'd have to say this is one of the best ! ! ! Todd performs at his very best , he is really into this concert . The Tokyo crowd are really into the concert . Plus , there are lots , & lots of backup musicians , and 3 beautiful women dancers in tight , short , pink dresses . Everything is 1st Class ! ! ! It has a approximate running time of 94 minutes.The song set:1.Real Man2.Unloved Children3.Parallel lines4.Ca n't Stop Running5.Compassion6.Secret Society7.Something to Fall Back on8.Love of the Common man9.Can We still be friends10.Mated11.The Waiting Game12.Love in Action13.Rock Love14.Hawking15.The Want of a Nail16.Hello It 's Me ( One of my favorite songs by Todd Rundgren , it does n't sound exactly like the studio version here , but it is close . It is very well performed ! ! ! 17.I Love My LifeOverall , this is a great one , and I highly recommend it . Thanks ! ! ! !	1
Back in the eighties the critics loved them , fellow musicians raved about them , they were called the Rush of thrash and they blew away bands like Slayer and Metallica . It never helped them achieve the following they deserved . If they do have any form of a cult following it would be based around Tommy T Baron 's sensational guitar work which by the way reaches it 's apex on this album . It 's progressive it 's technical but it 's catchy it has songs that generally clock in around 4 minutes . Coroner is exemplified by the song D.O.A absolutely stunning stuff . Music lovers know a metal band has never been as underated as Coroner .	1
i think its important to mention that this is not a live album.here on amazon they have it labeled no more color ( live ) .i almost did'nt order it because of this.anyway i must say this is my favorite coroner album.it has the dark sound of their earlier stuff & is more technical than a lot of what came after it.the best of a great band ! !	1
No More Color is a awesome release from the 3 member band Coroner . With some awesome guitar work and drumming , No More Color retains the true thrash spirit , all the riffs are downright thrasy , yet un-repetitive unlike some lesser SF thrash bands . & quot ; Die By My Hand & quot ; , & quot ; D.O.A. & quot ; and & quot ; Read My Scars & quot ; are probably the best songs on here , most of the songs are tru thrashy goodness , only a couple are repetitive . Bottom Line , If you like german ( and swiss ) speed metal bands like Kreator , Destruction , and Celtic Frost , or you want to escape some of the mediocare SF thrash *cough*Forbidden*cough* , you MUST buy this album .	1
What 's so great about seeing one of Ms. Turner 's concerts on video or DVD is that you do n't really have to be a fan of hers to enjoy it . If you 're not really a fan , you 'll still enjoy her magnetism and energy , her rapport with the audience . That special rapport is clearly in evidence here , as she has this very large ( 70,000 strong ) audience in the palm of her hand . If you are a big Tina fan ( as I am ) , then you will absolutely adore this video . This stands as one of her best shows , and is a personal favorite of mine . She seems full of life and fire , from the opening number , Steamy Windows , when she descends a flight of stairs to the stage , to the finale , Better Be Good To Me , which is so much more up-tempo than the radio version . This special and unique lady has so much soul and energy you ca n't help but fall under her spell . Please , if you are or are n't a Tina fan , get this video and enjoy a Rock-and-Roll Hall-of-Famer put on one whale of a show while she 's at the top of her game .	1
It was my dear departed Ma who introduced me to the magical children 's book , THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS by Kenneth Grahame . This was shortly after I graduated from high school , when I would periodically read chapters from the Winnie-The-Pooh series to her . Well , I fell in love with Grahame 's book ( Mr. Toad is one of the greatest characters in English literature ! ) , and about 1983 or '84 , I upgraded my little paperback copy to a really beautiful hardcover copy published by Grosset & Dunlap , which includes wonderful colorful illustrations . ( That copy still sits proudly in a bookcase right next to THE WORLD OF POOH by A . A . Milne . ) In 1989 , my Ma purchased a VHS copy of this Mark Hall and Brian Cosgrove `` stop-motion '' animated production of THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS for my niece and nephew . Weeeeell ... When I saw it , I instantly fell in love with it and obtained my own copy . ( I would have stolen the copy from my Ma 's grandchildren , but that sort of thing usually earns one some nasty karma , and I seem to have all I can stand as it is , thank you very much ! ) This movie is probably even better than the book , and I 've already told you how the book is esteemed by me . From the first viewing , this became my all-time favorite stop-motion movie , and that has never changed . Oh sure , I love Nick Park 's Wallace & Gromit - particularly THE WRONG TROUSERS , with its punky penguin , Feathers McGraw . ( I seriously considered using Feathers McGraw as my Ammyland pen name when I wrote my first review for this website . ) But you know , nothing 's ever gon na catch MR. TOAD in my book ... I mean , he drives awfully fast in that little motorcar ! In 1990 , I took my tape over to my then-girlfriend 's apartment , thinking that she might like to see it . ( `` The Countess '' was a good ol ' gal , with an appreciation for the finer things in life , like the classic Tex Avery and Tom n Jerry cartoons . ) Well , I played it for her once and unwittingly created a monster . She asked me to bring it a second time , which I did . And thereafter , every time I showed up at her apartment , the first words out of her mouth were , `` Did you bring Mr . Toad ? '' And when I answered , `` No '' , she 'd immediately begin to pout . It was as if she was n't happy to see me unless I was accompanied by that impertinent , little green amphibian . The first forty times , I thought she was just joking ( I 'm a bit dense ) , but after that it finally occurred to me that she had given her heart to Toad , and I truly was in the doghouse without him . So , I finally wised up and bought The Countess her own copy of THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS , so she could watch it anytime she desired , and I thereby erased her perpetual pout . But I 'll tell ya the truth ... that d*mned frog , I love the bloke , even if he did steal my gal.This 78 minute stop-motion movie is filled with marvelous characters and memorable lines : Of course , there 's first and foremost `` the famous Mr. Toad '' ( do n't think he 's famous ? Just ask him ! ) with his beloved horse-drawn caravan , which he disdains as a `` common canary-colored cart '' when he encounters his first motorcar . And then his motorcar mania which ultimately wreaks so much havoc , causing him to lose the family 's venerable Toad Hall . There 's sensible Ratty , Sensitive Mole , the wascally Weasels , and old , stoic n stout Mr. Badger . ( Man ! You just do n't mess with Badger ! The Weasels found that out the HARD way . He was `` Thumpin ' an ' thumpin ' an ' thumpin ' '' ` em ! ) And are there ever some funny lines that The Countess and I used for many years afterwards ! ( `` Out of my way ! `` ; `` Chap 's a d*mn frog ! '' ) I love the scene where the young field mouse is trying to inform Mole about something and Mole admonishes him about his pronunciation , telling him not to drop his `` H '' s. And the little mouse obeys in saying , `` It 's Toad , sir - he 's got hisself harrested ! '' And there 's that moment when Ratty and Mole wander nearby Mole 's long-forgotten hole in the ground ( Mole End ) and he becomes unexpectedly homesick . Sniffling , he says in a low voice , `` I smelt it and I wanted it . '' The Countess and I got lots and lots of mileage out of that line . We used it for Italian restaurants , saloons , compact discs , movies , trips to Disneyland , and on and on . But the day she pointed to an engagement ring and said , `` I smelt it and I wanted it '' , I was forced to break her smeller.But seriously , while there is lots of action in THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS , portions of it are a tad slow for the movie 's intended target age . There are a number of idyllic scenes ( e.g. , the `` Up Tails All '' duck sequence ) that are likely to lose the interest of your youngsters ( you know how they 're captivated only by the `` Whizbang-Clangdang '' stuff ) , and the thick English accents ( that delight us ) are sometimes going to be a bit tough for the kiddies to follow . But you know , to heck with them , get this children 's movie for yourself and wait for your kids to `` grow up '' enough to fully appreciate it . But men , do n't let your wives see it or yer gon na lose ` em to that suave ladies ' ... uhm ... Toad . Well , unless that 's your intention.Listen , I got ta run now . I just got a phone call from the police department and I got ta go bail out my Brother , Napoleon . It seems he 's got hisself harrested ... .. hagain !	1
After the DuckTales series came to an end , Disney had hoped to bring the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and crew to the big screen . The Ducktales The Movie : Treasures of the Last Lamp was a complete fop in 1990 . I remember seeing the movie at my local theater when I was a kid . The movie is only available on DVD through the Disney Movie Club ( which I 'm a part of ) and the Disney Movie Rewards.The DuckTales movie has Scrooge , his nephews ( Huey , Dewey , and Louie ) , his adopted niece , Webbigail , and Launchpad on an adventure to find a golden lamp.The movie is still great to watch after all these years .	1
The first of Disney 's attempts to make some quick bucks from a feature based on one of their daily TV series , `` Treasure of the Lost Lamp '' sprawned from the enjoyable 80 's cartoon series DuckTales and is likewise animated by the TV department . In this big-screen goround , Scrogue McDuck ( Alan Young ) travels with his nephews and niece Huey , Dewey , Louie , and Webby ( all Russi Taylor ) in search of Collie Baba 's legendary treasure . They are persued in this quest by powerhungry sorcerer Merlock ( Christopher Lloyd ) with the reluctant assistance of his henchmen Dijon ( Richard Libertini ) and escape with their lives - but without most of the treasure . The kids release a geenie in the lamp when Webby is cleaning her `` teacup '' and have fun making crazy wishes ( such as turning Webby 's stuffed toys into real live animals . ) But Merlock , the geenie 's former master , is hot on their trail and hell-bent on reclaiming the lamp and the power of the geenie at any cost.All this plays out like a workprint version of Disney 's classic `` Aladdin , '' which debuted two years after the DuckTales release , but that 's not nessesarily a bad thing . There 's a lot to like about `` Treasure of the Lost Lamp , '' and a lot of fun to be had here , including many comic moments . Also , the breezy 74-minute runtime is just right for young viewers ' attention spans . While the visiuals and somewhat choppy editing are nothing compared to the Feature Animation-created Disney efforts of the time , the movie recaptures the look , feel , and spirit of the TV show , making it good fun for fans and a very worthile watch for others . In fact , it 's best to think of this as an episode of the TV show with an extended runtime . When you use that point of view with this film , you 'll have a lot of fun following the epiosodic adventures of the characters . The opening sequences while searching for ( and finding ) the treasure feel a lot like an animated Indiana Jones and it 's a shame there was n't more time put into this part of the story.All in all `` DuckTales '' provides a solid , simple and entertaining story , great vocal delivery from all the cast ( most noteable in this department is Christopher Lloyd as the villian ) , and a lot of laughs with genuine humor behind them . Highly reccomended viewing for a lazy afternoon , but this might not stand up to repeated showings unless you 're a big fan of the show . If you are a fan , do n't hesitate to buy this - you 'll be pleased . Others who just want a taste of what the show was like , this will fit the bill nicely and is suited to a rental .	1
What a great movie this is . Actioned packed right from the start , quick-moving plot , and of course the ever-lovable Scrooge McDuck , just as you remember him.Scrooge searches for a lost Arabian treasure , but is ignorant that the most valuable part of the treasure is an old oil lamp . ( Of course you know where this is going . ) Scrooge 's niece and nephews discover a genie inside the lamp with the power to grant wishes . The genie advises the kids to wish for small things , because big wishes lead to big trouble . The niece Webby ignores this advice , and wishes for her stuffed animals to come to life . Scrooge sees all this magic happening and finally discovers he has a magic lamp.The Genie tells Scrooge he better be careful not to attract too much attention , because an evil immortal villain with a magic talisman is also seeking the lamp . The crafty villian finds Scrooge after only one wish , and gets ahold of the lamp after Scrooge gets it confused with a gravy boat . All heck breaks loose and Scrooge loses all his money , but he gets the lamp back later and becomes rich again . Then he fixes it so no more genie wishes will ever be granted by making the genie into a real live boy . The lamp falls apart and the genie plays cops and robbers with Scrooge 's nephews , while the evil villan is ... well ... we see him falling from the sky somewhere , but he ca n't die , so I guess he ended up okay too.The sad thing about this movie is it 's so overshadowed by Disney 's Aladdin . There really is n't much difference between the two movies , except for a giant money bin . The only advantage Aladdin has over the Ducktales movie is its outstanding songs . I highly recommend this DVD for Ducktales fans , but if you 've seen Aladdin already , the Ducktales movie will seem awful similar.I find it kind of sad that the Ducktales movie ultimately ended up being nothing more than a practice sketch for the later Aladdin film . It really is underrated .	1
This VHS another original documentary . its a live concert and a good one . if your a big Bob Marley fan you know this .	1
I mean again its Bob he has something real to say in all of his songs you know.If you dont like real dont get Bob .	1
Was received the item very quickly and in good condition . My son is a huge Bob Marley fan , this was a must have for his collection .	1
As usual , it has all the excitement as if you were there.You just ca n't get enough of BOB . He 's the Greatest	1
200 Motels fits neatly in Zappa 's concept that everything is related . Using members of the Mothers from different time periods and following a storyline that places characters in amd out of space ( one character is talking to one group of mothers , then suddenly we are shifted to another location where the conversation is being continued in a completely different context with other band members ) . This is Zappa at his most audacious . Music is not easily digestible 3:30 songs with memorable hooks , this is Zappa playing with the Orchestra . Frank himself rarely appears on screen , allowing Ringo Starr to fill in his part . With Beatle Ringo , Turtles Flo & Eddie , and Who Drummer Keith Moon making appearances on and off throughout the film , what we have is Zappa 's dream/nightmare of what it is like to spend a year on the road , where every town looks the same . Sets are relegated to cardboard cut-outs to increase the uniformity , and Zappa also pays tribute to Kubrick , with appearances of 2001 's monolith and Clockwork Orange 's pig-masks . This is the first film shot on video , then transfered to film stock , which allows for quicker editing and electronic image manipulation . Rated R for nudity , language and beer drinking ( Remember , Zappa was anti-drug )	1
You have to really want to understand this movie if you are to appreciate it . You should be familiar with Zappa 's work and be prepared to watch it many times and maybe even do a little research to help figure out some of the inside jokes and other craziness . Actually makes sense if you understand it . A testament to Zappa 's greatness . The editing job on this one must have taken ages ! MAGIC FINGERS is one of Zappa 's best melodies , and the performances are unforgettable . If you love Zappa , try this one if you got the time .	1
great great video on girl groups . Wish it was available on DVD ...	1
Phantom Tollbooth is one of my all-time favorite books , and this movie was a perfect companion and a great representation of all the magic that made the Phantom Tollbooth so wonderful . Highly recommend ... I think even in these & # 34 ; modern days , & # 34 ; kids will appreciate this one .	1
What to say ? Chuck Jones has created a real bona fide classic which ought to be shared by ALL age groups as well as cartoon fanatics like myself . ( That is , whether or not you have kids in both the former and latter . ) Having first seen this at the age of 13 , I must admit , I could n't help feeling perplexed when I saw the first few minutes of the movie : bored , pessimistic little Milo making his way home from school , then finds a magical tollbooth popping up in his bedroom . Once he enters it , he finds out he 's become a cartoon character , then wondering into an alternate cartoon universe with a crazy patrol officer constantly repeating the word `` guilty '' and little lethargic amoeba-like creatures called `` doldrums '' . Since I was watching this on TV , so much of it freaked me out so bad I flipped to another channel . Now let 's fast forward to the age of 26 ... ... and now I 'm actually ENJOYING IT ! Having been a lifelong Looney Toons fan myself , this movie IS a refreshing break from the usual fare of Bugs , Daffy , and Marvin the Martian . The unique style of animation as well as the psychedelic colors/Picasso-like backgrounds were BOTH timeless and way ahead of its time ( especially since it was made in 1968 ) . Besides , now that I 've seen it in its entirety , it is pretty fun and enjoyable to watch as Milo embarks on a journey with Tock the Watchdog and the Humbug to rescue the princesses of rhyme and reason . Their disappearance has created nothing but confusion and despair over a magical land full of words , letters , and numbers coming to life.The bottom line on the Phantom Tollbooth : if you want to see non-Looney Toons works of Chuck Jones and still enjoy classic children 's TV/movies , like Captain Kangaroo , Electric Company , Schoolhouse Rock , and Charlotte 's Web , then THIS IS IT ! : - )	1
Amazing performances ! ! ! This must be released on DVD ( with more songs ? ) ! Steve plays acoustic guitar on `` 40,000 Headmen , '' `` Rainmaker , '' and `` John Barlycorn . '' They also do `` Dear Mr. Fantasy , '' `` Low Spark , '' and `` Glad/Fredom Rider . '' Get it if/when you can !	1
I have to pinch myself to prove I 'm not dreaming - I still can hardly believe such a recording exists . I 've rated Traffic as one of my top bands since the mid Seventies - but living in a backwater in the middle of Africa I knew of nobody else who liked this band , so it continued as my little secret until the Internet age and I found out there were other people out there who had the same taste as me.I own everything by Traffic ( which unfortunately is n't much ) but I 've never read up anything on the band or done any research whatsoever ( well , thinking nobody else liked the band ) and had never even heard of this recording until I accidentally came across it listed on Amazon just a few weeks ago . How to get it became a bit of an issue as Amazon no longer mails packages to South Africa ( where I now live ) because the thieving bastards in this country 's post office steal foreign packages.I finally twigged to get it from UK and got to listen to one of my top bands in their prime . I have the Traffic Jam DVD , which is itself outstanding but in a completely different way to this no-frills performance . I like to see bands both in their prime , and preferably young looking , and this recording fits the bill on all counts . What I do n't like is backup singers , a brass section and alternative guitarists and drummers , or MTV-style editing.I tend to suffer from incurable over-expectation - I 've been disappointed by so many live recordings , not necessarily because they 're bad , but just hyped up in these reviews . Not so with this one . One could n't ask for anything different.I usually also have had enough of one band after an hour or so - and this was one of the few that I REALLY wished there was more to watch at the end.A few observations : * I was amazed at the role of Jim Capaldi , which was negligible , and do n't know what to make of it . In this case , there WAS a replacement drummer . * I expected Steve Winwood to look all geeky and gawpy ( based on photos on album covers ) , but he looked quite the virile rock star . * For all his lack of stage activity , I believe Steve has an amazing presence . I bought Eric Clapton 's Crossroads just for the Steve Winwood section - whenever he 's on stage the performance is just amazing , which makes it all the harder to explain why his solo music is so average ( on a par with Phil Collins in my estimation ) . * The only below-average song I thought was John Barleycorn . It 's one of my favourite songs and for the first half I though his voice was weak . But he changed gear and ended on a real high note . Mr Fantasy was a highlight for me , as it always is . Makes my hair stand on end.No Traffic fan should be permitted to be without this recording .	1
Great dvd of vintage Traffic.All original members except for Dave Mason.If your into Traffic this is surely the one to buy.6 stars out of 5 .	1
This is one of the best jam bands ever at their peak . Sadly they broke up after the DVD was done and never played with the original lineup again-which is a pity . Steve Winwood and Jim Capaldi made great music together-not that Capaldi has passed on , this DVD is an opportunity to see them perform . The obly drawback to this DVD is that the cinematographer did a `` psychedlic '' shoot for part of the DVD , with swirls and other such remnants of the era . If you are willing to overlook this stupidity , then this DVD is worth it to you .	1
While I am an old guy ( 62 ) and have been a huge fan of Traffic since their inception , I have only recently been exploring the realm of concert videos . Staring with my purchase of the Cream 2005 reunion dvd - which really set the standard in my mind - I have purchased a number of others since by a variety of groups . I kinda got spoiled by the modern conveniences like DTS surround sound , and the superb modern video quality . ( Mind you , even these modern tools can result in crap in the hands of the wrong people , i.e. , producer/directors/engineers who try to compensate for their lack of vision through the use of modern technology . ) So , while this performance and its recording took place before the existence of the new stuff , this show comes off nicely ! Great shots , decent sound , and , hey - it 's TRAFFIC ! They all seemed so young and naive ... ..it 's a hoot to watch the young Steve Winwood on this dvd and then watch him on the Clapton/Winwood Madison Square Garden one in his well-earned & # 34 ; elder musings , & # 34 ; or to see him perform on the Soundstage DVD ( another great one if you can find it ) . This was a group of extremely talented , creative individuals in a time of innocence ... ..certainly they were unprecedented in any major commercial sense.I 'll be watching this one over and over , and wishing I had seen them back in the day ... .	1
These 21 music videos in this dvd , are classic 1980 's music videos at their best . Annie Lennox is not only beautiful , but she is an excellent lead vocalist . The portrayal of these music videos are awesome . Annie is fantastic . I love all of them , but some of my favorites include : `` Sweet Dreams '' , `` Here Comes the Rain Again '' , `` There Must Be an Angel '' , `` Sisters are doing it for Themselves '' ( with Aretha Franklin ) , and `` Missionary Man '' . These videos are just as good now , as they were back in the 1980 's . Thanks ! ! ! !	1
In this chapter the history of the Eurythmics , Sophie Muller begins the creative process and collaboration in a successful , where she makes music with images , Annie Lennox putting a woman on a pedestal / Diva , the images are a bit obscure , but so insightful report , our frustrations Emotional everyday , like you Have Place a Chill in My Heart , sorry that this video as well as the We Two are One Too on DVD have not left yet , that was so comprehensive that we live in , luckily an injustice that still exists in its raw form wild and why not !	1
Annie Lennix : On word -- -HOT ! Her velvet voice sears in this DVD with The Eurythmics videos . Includes `` Sweet Dreams '' , `` Who 's That Girl ? `` , `` Love is a Stranger '' , `` Here Comes the Rain Again '' , `` Right By Your Side '' , `` It 's Alright , Baby 's Coming Back '' , `` Sexcrime 1984 '' , `` Missionary Man '' , `` Would I Lie To You ? `` , `` There Must Be an Angel '' & many other great , great hits.VERY recommended !	1
When I think of U2 , I think of Under A Blood Red Sky-Live At Red Rocks . This is U2 at their finest . This is the epitome of U2 . I just wish they would release it on DVD ... .	1
As another reviewer mentioned , this was their transition time . They were still a great punk/new wave band ; MTV actually played music videos back then , and `` New Years Day '' was one they played 5 or 6 times a day . Even though it was kind of hoky , I loved that video and still do.I saw them in Norfolk on this tour , and they were about what you 'd expect : fantastic , silly ( Bono had and still has that self-conscious , self-righteous air that I still find completely forgivable ) .And , now that I live in Colorado and go to Red Rocks several times a year ( most years ) , I wanted to go rent this and watch it . After all , it 's NEW YEARS DAY today ( 2007 ) . Blockbuster did n't have it , could n't get it . Netflix does n't have it . Surely Amazon has it , I thought . WRONG . Come on guys , somebody . Release this on DVD . It 's one of your best concerts.Oh , and by the way , I 've seen it on VHS before.If you 've always liked U2 , you 'll probably love this . If you think Achtung Baby or Pop were their best albums , you might not . But try to check it out anyway . War : the best album they ever did . This came from the `` War Tour '' .	1
It would be awesome if they would release this on DVD ! True Donna Summer fans would purchase this if it were ! I definately would ! ! !	1
Originally released in 1983 , this is a 90-minute video of a show that was recorded live at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Los Angeles . The full track listing is Macarthur Park , Love Is In Control , Unconditional Love ( with Musical Youth ) , Romeo , Do n't Cry For Me Argentina , On The Radio , Woman , One Night Only , Stop In The Name Of Love , a medley of ( a ) Dim All The Lights ( b ) Sunset People ( c ) Bad Girls ( d ) Hot Stuff , followed by Last Dance , She Works Hard For The Money , State Of Independence . This is very much the post-disco Donna , the pop singer and chanteuse , as attested by the absence of her earlier disco hits like I Feel Love . Donna maintains the interest throughout and it must have been a memorable concert .	1
In regard to this concert , it was hands down one of her BEST performances ever . Her voice is pitch perfect as if she just came out of the studio . Everything about this concert was perfect especially being introduced to Tina Arena ... ..what a set of lungs ! ! ! ! not to mention just how they harmonize pitch perfect . The whole concert is just a must have , recorded in California.Ive been waiting for the remaster onto Blu-ray , this is just the best , you cant help but feel good and be overwhelmed by the musicians and singers . I keep buying copies of this VHS looking for one that is in pristine shape until they get their collective ( you know what together ) and produce a perfect transfer into Hi-Def sound and video . Cant wait ... .its way over due fellas ... get to it ! ! In regard to the tape sent me buy the seller , I havent had an opportunity to watch it yet , but the seller has earned respect with their ratings so I took a chance on the strength of the sellers reviews . Thanks for a clean product , in very good cosmetic shape so hopefully that will come through when playing it . Thanks ... J.Casper	1
Anyone who is a fan of what I call & # 34 ; Jam Bands & # 34 ; , or anyone who is a fan of music in general would do well to buy this concert . Dire Straits was one of the best bands in the 70s and 80s , and received what I consider too little acclaim for their music . It 's an older concert , so the film is n't the best , but the sound is top notch and sounded great in DTS 5.1.Buy this concert .	1
Yes , the video is not up to snuff for a Blu-ray , or even just a plain ol ' DVD release , but the sound quality is truly stunning . Like the mix of the refurbished Brothers in Arms CD/DVD Audio , it presents the music in such a fashion wherein details come out that could n't possibly have on earlier versions.The video is rather sub-standard , to say the least . The initial shots of the band playing pool are , really , quite shocking in terms of their graininess . With technology that could make films from fifty years ago look pristine , I 'm not sure why something could n't have been done to improve the quality of something filmed in '84.That being said , however , as other reviewers have pointed out , the music is nearly flawless . `` Tunnel of Love '' is breathtaking in its scope and depth , and the version of `` Sultans of Swing '' is arguably the finest yet committed to tape . The arrangements of all the songs are precise and executed brilliantly by not only Mark Knopfler , but by all the excellent folks he assembled to dress up his magnificent songs.It 's worth the money , whether on Blu-ray or otherwise . Where the video may disappoint , the audio will infinitely satisfy .	1
I ca n't believe the crap I 'm reading here . How many of you trashing the blu-ray were fans back in 1983 ? I had this on CASSETTE ... ..AUDIO cassette ... ... .two of them back in the day . I loved it then and I love it now ... to finally SEE it ... sorry if you 're disappointed the blu-ray does n't look like blu-rays recorded today.I just wish you 'd shut up or someone else might not pull something so awesome from the vault like this ... and the bonus material is fabulous.if you 're reading this wondering whether or not to get it , stop wondering . it 's great . the opening version of once upon a time in the west is alone enough to make it worth the money . just stellar arranging . mark was and is a fabulous MUSICIAN .	1
I 'm one of those people that believes a concert is more about the sound than it is about the video . Sure , I like seeing my favorite artists , but I much rather hear them . There are a whole bunch of concert videos with questionable picture quality that can still benefit greatly from the blu-ray format . Alchemy live is a perfect example of what I 've been saying for a while now . And finally , a record company gets it . This is the release that audiophiles have been wanting for years . Yes , some of these older concerts have low resolution video , a by-product of the times there were recorded . So while the video does n't make a case for being put on blu-ray , the audio does . And that 's what delights me as an audiophile . Blu-ray takes up where DVD-Audio and SACD failed . Now we can have high resolution multi-channel audio.And let me just say , this is one of the best sounding concert videos I own , and I own a lot of them . The mix is just superb for a show that is nearly 30 years old . There is the perfect level of crowd noise blended in to give you that `` there '' feeling without it ever becoming overbearing and overriding the band . And for the musicians themselves , well everything is perfect clear and concise while still having that warm , analog sound . Even the bass is properly recorded . With most concerts you either get thin bass or overblown bass , Alchemy is the rare instance were it 's almost perfect . This concert sounds so good I perfer it over the CD version , though I wish the missing tracks were included on the blu-ray , even if that meant adding a slide show where the video was missing ( worked great for Jethro Tull 's 1978 MSG dvd ) .I only hope that people buy this and show the record companies that there is a market for us crazy audiophiles . We do n't mind that the video is n't much better than VHS or Laser Disc quality , just give us that glorious high resolution audio . Oh , and let Chuck Ainlay handle the surround mix . Here 's a sound engineer than understands how to employ surround sound correctly !	1
been a big fan of dire straits from their first song on the radio , but never got to see them until bothers in arms tour at radio city in new york .this is the next best thing of being there	1
Probably the best live respresentation of this terrific band ! I know Brothers in Arms was a huge commercial success , but this is a better , great songs and terrific musicianship ... a must have !	1
It 's time for all living generations to admit that the baby-boomers were witness to the biggest and best thing in the history of show biz : the Beatles . After a few weeks on the charts , the kids ' faves still fall below The Beatles positions , to this very day . Why , because it 's -still- fresh .	1
This black-and-white documentary chronicling the Beatles ' first US visit in 1964 is very interesting for the historical perspective it gives . Hate 'em or love 'em , there is no doubt the Beatles completely shook up the music world . Some of the crowd reactions are scary/funny with their frenzied screaming fanaticism.Much of it is comprised of the Beatles in hotel rooms as they watch TV , smoke cigarettes incessantly , and chat among themselves , or going out and about town , or riding in trains . This is intercut with various DJ 's discussing the upcoming Ed Sullivan show event , crowds and crowd comments , and the actual appearance of the Beatles on that show.The sound and image of the straight documentary portion is pretty good . However , the appearance from the Washington Coliseum concert comes across very poorly , mostly due to the limitations of the original recording and skimpy stage equipment . At one point , when Ringo gets to sing & quot ; I Wan na Be Your Man & quot ; , he is barely heard.There is a 50-minute & quot ; making of & quot ; the 80-minute documentary , as well as a commentary by the film-makers , and a booklet with some quotes and photographs . If you like the early Beatles , this is the DVD for you .	1
With the 50th Anniversary of the Beatles First US visit this year , I thought it was a good idea to re-watch this fun documentary , filmed by the renowned documentary filmmaking team , Albert and David Maysles in February , 1964 . Apparently , they were called by Granada television to ask if they would consider making a film shortly before the Beatles landed . Albert Maysles had never heard of The Beatles , luckily , his brother had , so they agreed to make the film.This really captures the excitement of Beatlemania , when it was a joy to be having success in America ( a task no other British act had ever really succeeded in ) and before the crowds , noise and general mayhem had not become something to be avoided . You feel that the screaming crowds were a huge surprise to the band & # 8211 ; John Lennon comments with amazement that he wasn & # 8217 ; t aware , & # 8220 ; anyone knew we were coming ! & # 8221 ; as the kids run alongside the car . Their tolerance , and willingness to act up in front of the cameras , leads to some enjoyable and intimate scenes . As Albert Maysles says , when interviewed in & # 8220 ; The Making Of the First US Visit & # 8221 ; , an extra documentary & # 8211 ; included in this disc & # 8211 ; their access was virtually unlimited . The Maysles brothers accompanied the band in New York , to Washington DC and Miami Beach.This documentary includes clips of the bands concert in Washington , of the Ed Sullivan Show performances , of the band at the Peppermint Lounge ( poor George would clearly have preferred to have gone to bed , but is out voted by the others , keen to see something of New York now they are there ) , on the train travelling to Washington , messing about in hotel rooms , having photo ops in Central Park and , always , both on show and on the run from the crowds . There is no voice over in the documentary & # 8211 ; allowing the footage to speak for itself . However , in The Making of ... . , Albert Maysles offers many comments on his favourite parts of the film , there is extra footage & # 8211 ; including the scrum of the British Ambassadors Ball , which so upset John Lennon & # 8211 ; and it is nice to hear his thoughts about that time , when the Americans welcomed the Beatles with open arms .	1
All i can say is buy this and enjoy the humor of the group and the live tv performances on all of the Ed Sullivan shows and the sound is pretty damn good .	1
Of all the 'Aida ' productions I 've witnessed , this version is my favorite . If you are searching for your first 'Aida ' it should be this Metropolitan Opera production with its balance of great and good singers , and its grandiose Egyptian backdrops of sandstone , bronze , linen and gold . It has one of the better triumphal marches , too . No elephants ( except for a few tusks ) , but scads of soldiers , dancers , Ethiopian prisoners , leopard skins , and gaily caparisoned horses.Aprile Millo 's Aida sings well , especially her celestial pianissimos , but she is a cold princess-slave . She seems to be perpetually annoyed -- perhaps because Amneris got the best costumes -- -but her tomb scene with Placido Domingo is to die for . It is only when she has to crank up the volume that she sounds a bit pinched.Dolora Zajick 's Amneris is why you need to hear this production . She is a luscious , spoiled , intensely feminine , young Pharaoh 's daughter . She is also a true Verdian mezzo with a voice as rich and seductive as her appearance . This is one of those 'Aidas ' where the Pharaoh 's daughter almost steals the show.Paata Burchuladze sings a Slavic , wa-wa trombone of a Ramfis , lisping , loud , and satisfactorily menacing at the fore of his priestly chorus . I really enjoyed the stentorian booming of the priests , thundering away at the lower levels of 'Ritorna Vincitor , ' demanding the deaths of the Ethiopian prisoners , and snarling out their 'tradditores ' beneath Amneris 's frenzied pleading in the judgement scene.Placidio Domingo is a soldierly Radam & egrave ; s and his 'Celeste Aida ' is sung with a silken vigor that does n't require the interpolated , often-bleated high B flat at its climax . His nobility does make it difficult to believe his sudden decision to desert his soldiers and run away with Aida in the Nile scene , but make no mistake , this is a great tenor in his prime . If you do n't shed a tear during 'O Terra Addio ' maybe you should be listening to something other than opera.Greek bass , Dimitri Kavrakos is a suitably dignified pharaoh with slightly less wa-wa than his priestly colleague , but with enough volume to be heard in the crowd scenes.Sherrill Milnes is a ferocious , glowering Amonasro , although his baritone has definitely begun to show signs of dryness . His scene with Aida is dramatic rather than beautifully sung.There is one fairly serious problem with this production -- I 've played it on two different machines , so it is n't my equipment : I can barely hear the male chorus at the beginning of the Temple of Vulcan scene . The priestess and the women 's chorus come through fine , but no matter how much I crank the volume , the men 's unaccompanied chorus is nothing but a distant muttering.Even so , I think you 'll love this 'Aida ' , right down to the last 'pace ' of Amneris , quietly grieving above the tomb .	1
The 1980 videotaping date on this opera is incorrect . I believe it was taped 1989 or 1990 . Since moving I have no idea where it is , but do know that it was not 1980 for sure.Enjoy !	1
The first thing that impresses the viewer are the stupendous sets . It is as though the designer , Giani Quaranta , has thrown down a gauntlet to the performers - `` Match this ! '' . He clearly conveys the impression of a great civilization that seems to be on the wane . The giant friezes ( if that is the correct term ) are hugely impressive , but they are beginning to crumble . The frescoes in Amneris ' room are lovely , but the paint is coming off . I was also impressed by the King 's costumes . I checked up and the headresses , including the double crown as well as the regalia - the crook and the flail - are absolutely correct . I only wonder why Pharoah did not have his false beard ? Would it have made singing harder ? I confess to a certain fascination with Amneris , and Dolora Zajick gets better and better in this role as the opera goes on . In the end you have the feeling that old Ramfis is going to have a rough ride when she becomes queen.I have seen too many Aidas where you wonder WHY Radames prefers her to Amneris . Here , thanks to Ms. Millo 's exquisite looks ( it is a pity she is not black in real life , it suits her ) and marvellous singing ( particularly the pianissimos ) the plot seems half way reasonable.The only negative , and I say this with sadness because I admire him , is the performance of Sherrill Milnes . He is no longer in good voice and his acting is not upto par . He comes across as far too old for a warrior king and he is very stiff in certain parts.Domingo is Domingo - looks , voice and acting are all perfect.I have one quibble with the video and that is the superimposition of Amneris on Aida and Radames in the finale . It would have been better to present the double stage from a distance . Also , Amneris ' final `` pace '' is swallowed up by applause , which is a pity . I would have expected better of the Met 's audience .	1
Dolora Zajick 's & quot ; Amneris & quot ; , and Aprille Millo 's & quot ; Aida & quot ; are a stunning combination . I teach music to elementary students , and my 5th graders upon watching Act IV of & quot ; Aida & quot ; asked if we could watch the entire opera . Anything that could have 5th grade boys asking to watch opera has got to have something going for it ! ! ! Domingo is too old ( facially ) for the role of Radames , but vocally still strong . Watching Sherrill Milnes ( Amanasro ) is always a treat . He is the consummate professional . Staging , sets and acting are carried out to a & quot ; T & quot ; . It is unlikely that a better video recording of & quot ; Aida & quot ; is out there ! ! ! 5 operatic stars ! ! ! !	1
This production is surely the most lavish AIDA ever recorded , should be the cornerstone of any DVD opera collection . From my high horse , I can only fault the soft video image in 4:3 ( only 'cause the newer , particularly the European productions are in 16:9 HD & 5.1 audio ) and an above average PCM stereo audio mix - that 's just quibbling . DO NOT HESITATE _ BUY ! ! !	1
There is nothing like seeing great blues in a small club . Stevie has done a lot of great live work ( except while in the depths of his drug abuse ) , but this video is the pinnacle of what he was capable of . This small club in Toronto , with rowdy fans has more energy and fire than any arena , stadium or theatre could match.This was also a musical high point of Stevie 's career . He was older than the & quot ; In the Beginning & quot ; disc ( also taken from a small club ) , and his playing reflects it . He was more fluid and confident , and you can see that he was REALLY feeling & quot ; it & quot ; the night of the El Mocambo show . I have never heard or seen a better rendition of Texas Flood . I have never even seen a beter blues guitar performance by anyone on any song compared to it . The versions of Tell Me , Wham ! , So Excited , Testify , Voodoo Chile , Mary Had a Little Lamb , and Lenny also are the best I have heard from any recording ( official or bootleg ) of Stevie's.As for the DVD , it could use some work . I noticed , in comparison with the VHS version , the mixers have brought the volume down a bit on Stevie 's guitar , while making the low end sounds more prominent . This takes away from the power of Stevie 's performance a bit . They also still have not included the version of Little Wing that was performed right before Third Stone From the Sun ! Please ! Include it , I will buy the DVD again ! On a bright note for the DVD , the interview included is quite interesting , with Tommy and Chris ' thoughts and relflections on Stevie and the night of the El Mocambo show.All in all , I would still get the DVD over the VHS copy . But regardless , every fan of the blues , Stevie , and/or guitar should buy this video . Ever hear Eric Clapton describe Stevie as an open channel , in which musical ideas just flowed through him ? This video is proof , and it is amazing .	1
Stevie Ray had a special intensity I loved in his style that I feel he lost in his latter years ( you can compare `` Live in Austin '' first and last performances ) . On this video it is all one performance from his early days . The show is no frills , clean and simple SRV and Double Trouble on a small stage . The video and sound are both clean and well done . Stevie Ray Vaughan does a great job on the songs he re-does in his show ( Hendrix etc . ) doing them in his own intense style .	1
At the beginning of their career in 1983 , Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble played a show at the tiny El Mocambo club in Toronto . It was a normal gig , and it was only by chance that there were cameras recording it . But thank god that there were cameras rolling , because if there were n't , music fans everywhere would be deprived of this piece of history . The band plays with basically no pause whatsoever between songs . There is just no weak point at all , and every song is filled with adrenaline and emotional playing from Stevie . The two songs that stand the tallest surely are `` Texas Flood , '' a blues EPIC- and do I mean epic-one of the greatest recordings of the electric guitar ever put to tape , and `` Lenny , '' a slow instrumental where Stevie just goes all out ; you can really see that his heart is completely in it . Also definitely worth noting are `` So Excited '' and Stevie 's awesome cover of `` Voodoo Child ( Slight Return . ) '' Just the concert alone would be fine , but also included on the DVD is a great interview with Double Trouble about Stevie- his playing and his personality . Do n't miss out . This is a must-have .	1
Dvd arrived in `` record '' time ( bad pun ) and was in A-1 condition . Very high quality audio and video . Fantastic guitar virtuoso . Jack Duegaw	1
YOU BETTER STRAP YOUR SEAT BELT ON WHEN YOU WATCH THIS ONE SRV GOES ALL OUT GIVING 100 % IN THIS LIVE COVERAGE HE WAS A GUITAR GENIUS ! ! !	1
My boyfriend had this DVD , but he loss it . So I decided to get it for him . He was so happy to listen to it again .	1
This video captures Stevie Ray Vaughn and Double Trouble as well as anyone could ever hope to . Bands generally divide into two categories . The vast majority do their best work in the studio and try with varied success to capture some of what they did in the studio in their live performances . Then there are those rare bands whose natural element is live performance . These bands try in the studio to capture some of what they do live . Double Trouble was definitely the second type . The performances on this video are every bit as technically proficient as anything Double Trouble ever did in the studio , but they are fluid and alive in a way that is rarely if ever captured in the studio . Incredibly , Stevie Ray Vaughn and Double Trouble were actually better live than they were in the studio , a rarity . I had the good fortune to see them live a few months before Stevie Ray Vaughn died.I only wish there were some more SRV videos of this quality available , particularly some later ones with Reese Wynans , who I personally think made an incredibly good band even better.If you buy only one SRV video , this is the one . Buy this one first in any case .	1
The energy of this performance is incredible . It really shows SRV at his best ... playing in a small , smoky , room , with sweat rolling off of him as he squeezes note after note out of his guitar . The musics is so awesome , I made a cassette of the audio to listen to in my car . This performance includes some of his best versions of Mary Had a Little Lamb , Testify , and several that were previously not available anywhere else .	1
Well , what else can I say ? This is the most intriguing and engaging guitar performance I have ever seen recorded . This performance is tight and well focused on what SRV is doing with his hands . There are tremendous strengths of raw power , perfection , discipline , precision , fun , brilliance , originality and a genuine flowing musicality of this astoundingly flawless performance -- and yes , even Jimi fell flat on occasion ; check out Jimi 's Live at The Fillmore East.I also would like to note another side of Stevie 's brilliance ( which often goes unnoticed ) : since Electric Ladyland , Stevie is the first artist to offer up new blues standards ( Love Struck Baby , Pride & Joy , Could n't Stand The Weather ) . Considering the mountain of recorded blues music , and the general recycling of other people 's ideas -- Stevie comes up with new material . Absolutely brilliant.And do n't forget the fantastic players Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon who entwined themselves with Stevie 's playing to help move it forward.And when it all comes together , you have `` Live at the El Mocambo '' . It is magic .	1
Lest you should ever forget what rock 'n ' roll was originally all about , and what it still IS meant to be all about , check out this eye-popping performance from a young and unknown Stevie Ray Vaughan . The guitar playing world in 1983 was heading in two directions : electronic buffoonery of the worst order from the likes of those dullards Satriani and Vai , and directionless & quot ; energy and raw power & quot ; school of thought , populated by idiots who could n't play their instruments and did n't understand any better what this wonderful medium is all about . Oh , it makes me so ANGRY to even think about it.So exactly what Stevie Ray Vaughan and his merry men thought they were up to in that sort of context is anyone 's guess . But who cares - all I can say is THANK THE LORD . From the first second of the show , shimmying in from stage-right , Stevie pulverises the stage , his instrument , his face and the crowd with the most gut-wrenching sonic assault I have ever seen or heard . Outstanding though most of his studio albums may be , you have no idea - really , none - of the energy - the man 's sheer brute strength - the power of Stevie Ray Vaughan 's playing until you see it unfold before you , even on a slightly tinny video . And WHAT he plays is inconceivably brilliant . You will shake your head in wonder.Hendrix , the great deconstructor himself , is pulled apart limb from limb and ghoulishly re-arranged like the victim of some crazed serial killer . Lonny Mack is gunned down the straight like an over-powered dragster . SRV 's wife Lenny is eulogised , sweat cascading down face , as the man gets through a whole smoke in one go without taking it out of his mouth . Even if you do n't like his music the video is worth getting simply for Mr Vaughan 's legendary facial expressions , and the marathon take on Texas Flood will do you till Tuesday week . Truly , TRULY outstanding.You should just SEE the looks on the faces of those lucky Canadians in the audience .	1
This live performance at a small venue in Toronto really shows Stevie Ray in all his glory ! His playing on Texas Flood is a guitar classic ... playing behind the back ... super intense blues riffs ... a man using a guitar as an extension of his creative forces . I 've never seen anybody so connected to his instrument ! If you play guitar or are just learning the instrument ... this DVD shows what the capabilities are !	1
mind blowing show from beginning to end , chris layton and tommy shannon are essential to the live sound they dont miss a beat , hendrix would be very proud of stevies renditions of third stone from the sun and voodoo chile	1
There is n't much else to say . Voodoo chile is better here than on his records . Hug You Squeeze you is n't on his records as far as I know . Seeing him do it is a million times better than listening . If you have n't seen him do a show , and you 're a fan . You ca n't be dissappointed by this so buy it . Texas Flood is literally amazing . Lenny is perfect . I did n't get third stone from the sun till I saw it . The perfect way to understand his music and his showmanship even in this small setting . Tommy Shannon and Chris Layton are great but they 're obviously way behind SRV no matter how competent they are . This album is awesome and it 's perfect . Not a single flaw . Stevie Ray was bigger than life , especially here . He 's tapped in , and you have to see him and feel it to believe it . 63 minutes.P.s . I am extremely angry if he really did do Little Wing on this concert and some fool cut it out . I 'd buy it again if they released it with that song on it . We Love you Stevie !	1
I mean , it 's SRV , what else do you need to know ? Stevie 's sound and playing on this recording is phenomanal !	1
If you 're a longtime Clash fan , this video will make you salivate . It has all of the ringing tones of the Clash 's lyrical content in the plot , as well as numerous live performances and casual footage . For instance , it shows the late , great , Joe Strummer curled up into an inhuman ball on the stage , moaning to the audience , yelling at and dispersing bouncers during `` Janie Jones , '' and playing the piano while chatting with the main character , Ray . It shows Paul Simonon relaxing and enjoying some reggae music , and being collected after his arrest for shooting pigeons . It shows Topper Headon hitting and kicking a punching bag while dressed in a yellow excersize suit . And it shows Mick Jones singing into the microphone , snapping at our slightly bigoted main charcater , and showing up late to rehearsals . All this comes on top of the life and times of Clash fan/roadie/sex shop employee Ray Gange , and the plight of two young black men in the chaotic year of 1978 in Britain . I 'd say that for all of this , this film is definitely worth watching , if not owning .	1
If you 've never been to a Patti LaBelle concert this is as close as you 'll come to getting the full experience . Patti throws down in this concert like you would n't believe . Singing songs from her standards & quot ; On My Own , & quot ; & quot ; If You Asked Me To , & quot ; and & quot ; Lady Marmalade & quot ; to cover songs of Aretha Franklin 's & quot ; Ai n't No Way & quot ; and Whitney Houston 's & quot ; All the Man That I Need. & quot ; Do n't forget the magical moment when Patti 's former group , Labelle , takes to the stage for the first time in over 15 years . And you will not believe what this grand diva does with Somewhere Over the Rainbow . If you can watch this tape and not hail Ms. Patti as one of the greatest stage performers ever , honey , you must be dead !	1

I love this video ! It is a very important collection in the history of music video , despite the fact that the Pet Shop Boys never show up on the MTV top 100 lists any more . One thing to notice about those lists -- they always give too much weight to who is popular now . But the history of music video should not be forgotten ! This is an important piece of that history.From the Album `` Please '' West End GirlsLove Comes QuicklyOpportunitiesSuburbiaThese songs are the early , and perhaps the defining Pet Shop Boys . This is when they got the most play on MTV , and West End Girls was a worldwide hit . The video for Opportunities shown here is actually the second film shot for the song ; the first one was also shown on MTV , but did n't make as much sense for some reason - this one is much snazzier and in keeping with the 80s pop idea that the Pet Shop Boys really developed to a high art form.From the Album `` Actually '' It 's A SinWhat Have I Done to Deserve ThisRentHeartAlways On My Mind*These songs are from their follow-up album , and the Pet Shop Boys began the tradition of putting in remakes between major albums , which is where Always on My Mind comes into it . These have the same dead-pan humor and , but these videos each tell more of a story - they are little films , rather than just backing pieces . The duet with Dusty Springfield on What Have I Done to Deserve This probably marks the transition away from `` stand in front of the camera and sing '' videos and more elaborate productions.From the Album `` Introspective '' Domino DancingLet to My Own DevicesIt 's AlrightIntrospective was one of the `` minor '' albums of the Pet Shop Boys , but still produced good hits . Domino Dancing was another story-line video ; the other two became more `` artistic '' and conceptual.From the Album `` Behavior '' So HardBeing BoringHow Can You Expect To Be Taken SeriouslyJealousyWhere the Streets Have No Name/Ca n't Take My Eyes Off of You*The real artistry of video and music came together for this album , which is sad that for the most part American audiences did n't get to see too much of these videos . The video for Being Boring incorporated the cast of the Pet Shop Boys touring company when they went out `` live '' , and won awards in Europe , even from MTV . But MTV America had lost enchantment with the Pet Shop Boys . They were garage , they were n't grunge , and ultimately they were n't straight , and that 's what MTV in the 1990s was really driving at.Unique to DiscographyDJ CultureThis was another high concept video , perhaps more than ever the Pet Shop Boys coming out to their audience at long last . Neil Tennant dressed up as Oscar Wilde and standing in the dock - wonder what that means ? Director Eric Watson was involved in a good many of these videos ; film director Derek Jarman was also responsible for several ( It 's a sin , Rent ) and the difference shows . Bruce Weber directed the Being Boring video , and it really has the same kind of appeal and feel as other productions Weber is noted for.In many ways , the Pet Shop Boys helped to define what a musical group in the video age was all about , and the kinds of production qualities and innovative ideas that had to be part of the overall package.There have been several albums released after this time , including `` Very '' , `` Bilingual '' , `` Nightlife '' and the recent ones `` Release '' and `` Pop Art '' , but no comparable video collection . I want that too ! It would be a wonderful companion to Videography , which is about the last way to see these really great pieces .	1
This collection of eighteen music videos is wonderful for any fan of either the Pet Shop Boys or British pop music in general . In an age of Fred Durst and Pearl Jam slaughtering older songs ( `` Faith '' and `` Last Kiss '' , respectively ) , Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe actually improve on the songs they remake with a clean sound and great lyrics . This features the videos until 1991 , and does not include any from the albums `` Very , '' `` Alternatives , '' `` Bilingual , '' `` Nightlife , '' and `` Release. '' 1 . West End Girls ( Directed by Eric Watson and Andy Morahan ) The Boys ' biggest hit and a good video . They shot in London , which makes me homesick for England . I spent three months there in the early nineties , and always want to get back.2 . Love Comes Quickly ( Directed by Eric Watson and Andy Morahan ) Great , shadowy visuals highlight an underrated dark ballad ; this could still pass as a video just shot last week.3 . Opportunities ( Let 's Make Lots of Money ) ( Directed by Eric Watson and Andy Morahan ) A whimsical song given a bizarre video treatment as Tennant , looking Amish in glasses and hat , is sunk into the floor of a parking garage , and sings while decomposing in some shots . Weird.4 . Suburbia ( Directed by Eric Watson ) Suburbs , dogs , and an abandoned city bus . Nice video , watch for the TV screen that is playing the alternate version video to `` Opportunities ( Let 's Make Lots of Money ) .5 . It 's a Sin ( Directed by Derek Jarman ) It is a sin to have to watch the Boys uncomfortably go through the paces of hoods , trials , and goofy makeup . One of the weakest videos on the compilation.6 . What Have I Done to Deserve This ? ( Directed by Eric Watson ) Mix Dusty Springfield and some backstage Vegas-like chorus girls , and this video will have you interested . Tennant and Lowe look like they are having fun performing with the sorely missed Springfield , who is fantastic.7 . Rent ( Directed by Derek Jarman ) Another failure from Jarman has a dark song given a bunch of video cliches ( slow motion , silly resolution , etc. ) . Liza Minnelli remade this song as a ballad much better on her `` Results '' album , produced by Tennant and Lowe.8 . Always on My Mind ( Directed by Jack Bond ) Surreal video from the Boys ' surreal motion picture debut . Better song than Willie Nelson made , but Joss Ackland crooning along kind of brings everything down.9 . Heart ( Directed by Jack Bond ) The worst video here has a Nosferatu story as Tennant and newlywed are haunted by a lovestruck vampire . Weak bat effect spoils already average effort.10 . Domino Dancing ( Directed by Eric Watson ) Two Latino men fight over one gorgeous girl while a tanned Tennant croons . Sunny locations , and when our little female side of our love triangle appears in a vinyl dress , I was ready to break out the Armor-All and a chamois . Wow ! 11 . Left to My Own Devices ( Directed by Eric Watson ) Good song is shot looking above through a glass ceiling at performers . Weird angle loses interest after awhile , but Lowe and Tennant move more here than in almost any other video.12 . It 's Alright ( Directed by Eric Watson ) This is the song you sometimes hear on car ads . It is really about how the world might end at any time , but Tennant and Lowe sing to a collection of some cute babies , all shot in crisp black and white . A fun video.13 . So Hard ( Directed by Eric Watson ) Another mild hit has more black and white in a depressing little video about infidelity . Nothing really stands out.14 . Being Boring ( Directed by Bruce Weber ) The Pet Shop Boys ' best song and best video , as done by a leading photographer . Black and white , as assorted teens get ready for a party . This will make you nostalgic for youth , when the most important thing you had were your friends . Some nudity , but it only serves to heighten your emotions . Excellent.15 . How Can You Expect To Be Taken Seriously ? ( Directed by Liam Kan ) The version of this song on their album was a little peppier , but the video is funny . The song concerns all those megalomaniacal performers with their pet causes and yes men.16 . Where the Streets Have No Name ( I Ca n't Take My Eyes Off You ) ( Directed by Liam Kan ) Who else would have thought to mix the two title songs into a giant , coloring book-bright remake ? Strong video , with cheering crowds over Tennant 's vocals.17 . Jealousy ( Directed by Eric Watson ) Lush video also deals with infidelity , leading to violence in a restaurant as Tennant croons away . Gorgeous to look at.18 . DJ Culture ( Directed by Eric Watson ) Really weird video as Tennant dresses like Oscar Wilde , and cross dressing Queen Victorias mix with a soccer match . Wild to watch.I have been a long time fan of the Pet Shop Boys , and I have always enjoyed their videos , even though MTV does not play them anymore . Come to think of it , MTV hardly plays ANY videos anymore . I highly recommend this collection.This is unrated but contains some physical violence , some male nudity , and some sexual content .	1
Wow ! Excellent footage from one of the best live DVD concerts that I have seen.Excellent sound and over-all quality.Just enough to make me want to go out and get tickets for their new upcoming tour - 2005 / 2006	1
I have bought this one in VHS and a special CD edition back in the 90s as it was released , then I grabbed my DVD copy a few years ago and now I have this very specific DVD version , full of extras and even a `` bonus '' track which , by the way , could have been edited better ... and now I guess I will be buying it again if a 'deluxe ' edition hits the stores in 2011 celebrating the 20 years since the legendary Wembley Summer XS show - or hope so.It 's simply a must for any INXS fan , and even the best way for newcomers to find out why this was named to be the best performing live band ever back in the days when this was shot , and why it should remain always as one of the Michael Hutchence 's personal legacy.It 's just great to see the full show again , along with the band commentary ( or kind of ) , and the backstage and interviews extras recalling those good old days when INXS was at it 's peak ... only shame would be there 's not the video for Shining Star , and the extras are a bit too short anyway.Sound , quality and extra features deserve a full five stars and make it a worth-every-penny pack.Great .	1
This has to be one of the top 10 live performances on DVD anywhere.Captured at their peak in Wembley , INXS showed why they were one of the hottest bands in the world . Before boy bands would take over en masse , INXS held the world in thrall with frontman Michael Hutchence and the band 's unique blend of pop , rock and funk.You can feel the stadium rock when INXS goes into Disappear - and you can feel the lighters sway in Never Tear Us Apart . In other words , this DVD experience is as good as being there . Truly one of those magical nights where the cameras managed to catch it all . Hutchence is in top form.I saw the band a few years before on the rise as a lean hungry band in college , and a few years after this performance - this is absolutely the band at its peak . 2 albums later Hutchence had hit rock bottom.Worth getting , and with the companion live CD - which has tracks that are n't on the DVD and vice-versa .	1
I would like to say was good I have this on vhs and the tape is getting pretty bad so I ordered on dvd and I love it .	1
This concert recorded live during the summer of 1991 at London 's Wembley stadium showcases Australian rockers INXS as they end their world tour in support of their X album . The fans are more than motivated as they jump and move with each song , and the band includes every hit within the set list . Michael Hutchence sings passionately with the dynamic stage energy he made famous . Though Hutchence is sadly no longer alive and while INXS never matched the level of success they once had after this time had passed , their memory as a band with a keen pop sensibility fashioned by a rock style will never be erased .	1
A Sinatra session with Ella Fitzgerald ; a Sinatra Bossa Nova session with Antonio Carlos Jobim ; Nelson Riddle in action ... wow ! As Ira Gershwin would say : - Who could ask for anything more ? Beyond category !	1
This is probably the best of the 5 or 6 Sinatra television specials that have been released on video over the past 10 years or so . And that is true for one reason ; those 15 or so minutes that Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald , both still in their prime , show the world what could have been if only they 'd followed through on those plans to make an album together.The duets they sing togther , starting with & quot ; Goin ' Out of My Head & quot ; and ending with & quot ; Lady Is a Tramp & quot ; are , quite simply , perfect . These are obviously two singers who love working together , one only wishes they did so more often . The closing rendition of & quot ; Lady Is A Tramp & quot ; ranks as one of the best moments in the history of American popular song ever captured on film ; I 'm just glad the camera 's were there to capture it.The duets with Jobim are great as well , but honestly , if you want to hear the Frank and Tom Jobim at their best , you need to go listen to the albums they made . The real treat on this video is Frank and Ella , and if you 're a fan of either singer ( or just a fan of good music in general ) , you need to do yourself a favor and pick this one up .	1
I love the sound of Frank Sinatra 's voice during the decade of the 60 's , and the first half of the 70 's . This DVD is one of a series of television concerts that he did in the 1960 's . It is not surprising that his voice is wonderful during this show . I particularly like his rendition of `` Ol ' Man River '' on this DVD . I listen to this track quite bit . He puts so much feeling into his performance.Lady Ella is terrific on this DVD . Her solo performances really add to the show . In addition , her singing with Frank is quite beautiful . They really work well together . It seems obvious that he had a great deal of respect for her . Their version of `` Lady is a Tramp '' is worth listening to again and again.The segment with Antonio Carlos Jobim is a gem too . Frank sings Irving Berlin 's `` Change Partners , '' which is soft and caressing . His rendition of `` The Girl From Ipanema '' is a joy . This was when Frank could sing so clearly . There is not a scratch in his voice . His voice just flows during this segment with Jobim.Lastly , the orchestration is terrific . Three cheers for the Nelson Riddle Orchestra . This show has it all . I watch it quite a bit . I love it .	1
First aired in November of 1967 , & quot ; Sinatra + Ella + Jobim & quot ; remains not only Sinatra 's & quot ; finest hour & quot ; on television , but one of the great music specials of all time.Frank and Ella have two segments together -- the first , in which they explore some of the 'contemporary'songs of the day is capped with a duet of & quot ; Going Out My Head , & quot ; which simply wraps up the song forever ; the second , includes standards ranging from & quot ; Do n't Be That Way & quot ; to & quot ; Stompin ' At The Savoy , & quot ; and concludes with a rousing duet on & quot ; Lady Is a Tramp. & quot ; The middle secion of the show has Frank and the late Antonio Carlos Jobim in a medley of both Jobim originals ( & quot ; Quiet Nights & quot ; & quot ; Girl From Ipanema & quot ; ) combined with American standards in the bossa nova vein : ( & quot ; Change Partners , & quot ; & quot ; I Concentrate On You & quot ; ) . & quot ; Sinatra+Ella+Jobim & quot ; gives the MTV generation a lesson in what great musical television is all about ... there are no flashy costumes or special effects , no dancers , strobe lights or dry ice.Just a trio of great musical talents on simple sets doing what they do best.All it takes is talent !	1
I have owned the original Jimi Plays Berkeley for years now , from VHS to the first DVD release , when I heard this was being re-worked with 15 mins of new footage , to be honest , I was all that over joyed , but after seeing this new edition , I came away really liking this film much more than I ever have ! The BIGGEST improvement in the film is now `` Hear My Train A-Comin ' '' is now in it 's full length ! This was one of Jimi 's best live blues songs ( along with Red House ) and in the original Jimi Plays Berkeley , the song was butchered up . They used as much new footage as they could find and inserted 1970 riot footage as filler , came out really nice . They also added in a few minutes from the first show of `` Voodoo Chile '' which was not at all featured in the previous version . Great killer version too of what they show , Jimi playing a fired up solo . The film includes more street footage and it 's not too bad , shows alot more young black men who were digging Jimi at the time.The second show of the night is pretty much the same as the previous version , except `` Machine Gun '' is extended , they found new concert footage and inserted it and also added in more riot footage , what you get is what I consider to be the BEST Machine Gun Jimi ever performed ! Better than a Band of Gypsys version , as this one feels more complete and organized and has more of a bluesy feel to it.So i you own the old Jimi Plays Berkeley verion , it is well worth it to get this new version ! The sound mix is brand new as well and I think it 's more clear sounding than the previous DVD release . The producers took what I always considered a pretty badly edited film and made it very watchable and enjoyable !	1
I personally liked this DVD . Let 's face it , the guy is gone , and you have to grab what exists .	1
I got this DVD mostly to remember the night I got to see Jimi Hendrix , live . I went to the second show that night in Berkeley with a buddy , we were seniors in high school . After all these years , it 's interesting to compare the film to my memories of the event . My memory bank seems to have embellished that evening with more color , more electricity , and verve than the DVD seems to show . ( and , no , I was n't on any sort of potion that night , ... I was as straight as can be ) , ... I suppose for those who were not there , this would be pretty interesting , but for me , it 's a bit of a comedown . I guess they cut some of the concert out of the film , ... ... I understand that , ... .. but , I just had higher expectations for the film based upon my memory of that evening , ... ... .Still , nice to have that bit of history documented .	1
NOTE : Update after several watchings : There are a number of new black voices in the movie ( from the Berkeley concert , not talking heads from NY ) There is a lot more footage from outside the concert ( where many of these additional black voices were recorded ) Jimi has always suffered from the seen as a performer for mostly whites . That is quite true , but this film makes it clear that he was gaining more black listeners as his career matured.Honestly , I do n't think the cover photo is from Berkeley - there are numerous comments here that it is n't . But , how could a mistake of this size be made ? ? ? Otherwise it remains an excellent update . I wish they put the sound to the 1st show in , but I am sure down the road it will be out too . Is this from Atlanta ? ? ? ( another concert they should release ) I am 61 and a long time Jimi fan from the old Hey Joe list days of the early Internet . I 've owned every version of his Berkeley concerts and this is the best by far . It 's likely to be the best we ever have as this seems to be all of the footage . I did not expect to like the new release this much - I read all of the reviews below and have the earlier release . I am surprised how much more I like this new one ! I 'm a pretty jaded old fan , and I like this update to a classic concert.Let 's face it . The original Jimi Plays Berkeley was a disaster of a film THIS new release makes it 2 clear concerts . They re-edited the existing footage with some found footage and riot footage . You get a good feel for BOTH early and late shows . The original film did not come close to this.Oh , the audio ? It 's an improvement on an already excellent mix from 2003 . I think the DVD audio for this release is much better than the 2003 release.PS : I am uncertain about Jimi 's dress on the cover photo . is that from the 1st show ? His more familiar blue outfit from the second show ? an earlier reviewer pointed it out and I have to admit to being uncertain . I must be getting old .	1
Best part of the movie is to watch him play Voodoo Chile s.r.and the pool hall crowd , how awsome are they .	1
This is the third version of this one I have bought in the hopethat it will be a lot clearer but no . They are all very soft focusB & W ; but as a documentary it has everything . If you are a Dylanfan this is a must see . If not do n't bother.Listen UP	1
I 'm a fan of reality television even though the contestants on Survivor and Big Brother are in a completely artificial situation , as far from reality as can be . Yet nobody is writing their script ; they are writing that themselves . These comments are also relevant to this excellent documentary of young Bob Dylan on tour in England in 1965.I do n't like the Spotlight Reviews on this site . They are too `` expert '' and do n't get everything right . They are too full of themselves.One of the main impressions I get from this documentary concerns the clash between beautiful and brilliant Dylan , who is actually doing something good in the world , and the reporters/critics . True , Dylan is very confrontational with them , but they are lucky to have his attention at all.It seems like these nothings , these cogs in the wheels that employ them , do n't get the point at all . The point is Hattie Carroll , being murdered by a rich and apathetic white s.o.b . and getting away with it . The point is that Bob Dylan is coming out and saying something that needs to be said . The point is that Bob Dylan believes in right and wrong , and therefore is a mouthpiece of God , cutting through all our crap.And very few others were doing this at the time . Not too many are doing it now either . Put on the radio . What do you hear ? You hear personal lyrics , I love you , I find you attractive , I 'm mad at you , whatever . In one genre you hear that you are worthless except to the degree that you turn me on , and that the singer is worth more than you because he has a fancier car and more expensive jewelry , and will blow you away with a shotgun.What a bunch of baloney . What kind of values are we offering to the young people who listen to this idiocy and think it is cool ? Then you have Dylan . Justice . Poetry . Intelligence . How often do you hear a lyric on the radio that is intelligent ? Contrast the Dylan of this documentary to some of the more recent Dylans . Do you know the song Union Sundown ? That 's the one ripping globalization to shreds , a decade before everyone else realized it needed to be stopped , a way to maximize profits by paying pennies for labor , firing American workers and replacing them with slave labor overseas.Contrast that Dylan to this younger one . The more modern one , the older one , is n't physically beautiful anymore , is n't a pixyish darling anymore , but he 's just as on target , just as sharp and penetrating.One of the highlights of this video is the live performance of the beginning of It 's All Over Now Baby Blue at the special request of Donovan . First , Donovan sings a perfectly nice song , then Dylan sings a freaking masterpiece . I like the way Dylan smiles as he sings `` yonder stands your orphan '' . Think about that line . Your orphan ? That means you are dead , does n't it . I like Dylan 's smile as he sings that line , a smile saying hey , listen to that lyric , get it ? It 's one of the really interesting lines to It 's All Over Now , Baby Blue.At the Albert Hall , Dylan is alone with his guitar and harmonica , no band behind him , and he is mesmerizing the world 's most elite audience , the Beatles among them . He 's doing it just being himself , his brilliant self.I like most of the commentary . This is one of the few videos where I played the film a second time to listen to the whole commentary . It 's funny the way one of the commentators gives all his reasons for being pleased that Hattie Carroll was cut off before its climactic ending and thunderous applause , and then the other commentator , who is obviously right , completely disagrees with what we 've been listening to , in a perfectly non-confrontational way , and says that was the one song that should have been shown in its entirety . Far from detracting from the effectiveness of the film , this song would have made the entire point of the film , that Dylan was a powerhouse.Real people , worth watching	1
The standard by which all & quot ; rockumentaries & quot ; are forever after judged . Not only is the subject the most important artist of this century , the presentation is perfect . No serious student of film or music can ignore this work . It defines brillance .	1
If you 're already a fan of this film , you 'll know what I 'm talking about , and will really appreciate the DVD for the bonus features . The commentary added a lot of information that was new to me.This movie remains fun to watch , even after repeated viewings.The audio track suppliments are another great extra on this disc .	1
PODES ESTAR DE ACUERDO O NO CON EL VALOR HISTORICO DE ESTA PELICULA ...

If you dig Bob Dylans music , or are into good rock documentaries , than you will most surely like DONT LOOK BACK . Although not very in depth in the sense that NO DIRECTION HOME , the most recent offering is ... this one instead just follows a young Bob Dylan through his 1964 European tour . You get to watch the man at fun and at work , galavanting around Europe with the likes of Joan Baez and Donovan . Its all in a very stylish black and white , and is very fun to watch.The way Bob Dylan gives the subtle F*** YOU to every single reporter that crosses his path , is entertainment enough . But you get him arguing with unruly fans , acoustic battling with Donovan , and just amazing the crowd onstage.D.A PENNEMAKER gets down and deep into the crazy touring life of Bob Dylan in the sixties . Also , we get a sense of the rock and roll business , through up close dealings with John Hammond , Dylans manger at the time . The movie is a good time , if you are into rock docs , you got ta see this one !	1
Hard to figure how this has n't made it 's way to DVD or better yet Blu-ray . A huge band of fantastic players easily handle the entire Paul Simon catalogue . The live version of `` Diamonds '' is worth the purchase price alone .	1
This video only has 5 songs on it but she choose 5 of her best.Each person has to to decide if its worth your money.About [ $ ] .I have it and have watched it several times.With Enya 's videos you can let your imagination go wild ! Caribbean Blue does it for me ! A story of fantasy and enchantment complete with fairies ! If you ever watched any of the ... that comes off MTV , this will seem like a breath of fresh air.And by watching ... without being vulgar.Something the MTV crowd needs to learn.Bottom line-beautiful , magical , and entertaining ! Not only do you hear beautiful music but you get to see a beautiful princess as well ! ! !	1
This is a WONDERFUL movie . I love watching it over and over and over again , despite the & quot ; bad quality & quot ; of the video . I personally think it 's great . A must for any HARDCORE Metallica fan or Cliff Burton fanatic .	1
I bought this and Cunning stunts not too long ago . I was disappointed with Cunning stunts , but this one was awesome . The songs here are much better played , and this was when Metallica was in it for the music not money ! ( Like they seem to be today , although I like some of their new stuff too ) . All the songs are great played especially & quot ; Seek and Destroy & quot ; & quot ; Sanatarium & quot ; & quot ; Fade to Black & quot ; & quot ; Creeping Death & quot ; and & quot ; From whom the bell tolls & quot ; .The quality was much better then I expected due to how horrible people said it was . Of course the quality isnt the best audio and video vise but the songs are AWESOME and thats whats matters ! ( James said a similar thing too ) . Also there is a funny interview with Cliff and James where they talk about people thinking they were sell out . Cliff said & quot ; We are doing what we want to and if they consider that selling out then whatever & quot ; Cliff seemed like a pretty cool guy and he was very talented , much better then the bassist that Metallica have today ! I think this DVD shows how talented Metallica were in the 80s . In my opinion they were at their best then .	1
Oh how I miss Master Burton . Its so unfortunate that he died when his tour bus flipped over and it was all the more sad that I found this out when I just became a huge fan of his . He is God of bass and can really be matched by no bass player , not even John Deacon ( Queen ) or John Paul Jones ( Led Zeppelin ) , hell they dont even come within a hundred lightyears of Cliffs godliness . Cliff deserved so much more than what he got and its videos like these that remind me of the good old days of Metallica , not when they and they 're music went to hell with 'Load'.When Cliff died it only led me to believe `` What if ? '' and that question has been plaguing my thoughts ever since . If Cliff had n't been killed than it seems to me that Metallica WOULD release the follow up to Master of Puppets called ... And Justice for All but would n't release crap like the Loads or St. Anger . Maybe they would have made thrash popular and destroy hairmetal before horrible grunge ( besides Nirvana ) and nu-metal surfaced . Cliff you were the heart of Metallica and without you the band will never relive what they started , may God rest your soul and lead you to ... ETERNAL THRASH ! ! ! ! YEAH WE KNOW YOU WANT THAT ! Right , about this DVD . This really brings out the Godliness of Burton with 'Sanitarium ' and 'For Whom the Bell Tolls ' being the best live songs . James , Kirk and Lars arent half bad themselves in fact they really are quite amazing here as well but its Master Burton that really shines on this DVD . I could n't really say anything that has n't already been said about this masterpiece . So this is for ANY Metallica fan that is willing to spend $ 20 , which should n't be too difficult . Just buy it dammit and see the Jimi Hendrix of bass !	1
... but you 've still got the records when your heroes are gone . All of Metallica 's 80s output is 5 star stuff ; Metallica 's cover versions alone wipe the floor with most bands ' music ( including Limp Bizkit , buddy ) and this collection of ( mostly ) rough bootleg footage is no exception . I remember many teenage basement and rec room viewing parties when this came out , but I have one complaint : these guys have ( deservedly ) attained a private jet and personal chef level of success in the ensuing years , and they could n't throw any bonus stuff on here ? RIP Cliff	1
This is a great & quot ; for what it 's worth & quot ; metallica vid ... sure LIve S*** is the ultimate live vid/cd but this was a look at Metallica back when they were n't so popular , back when they were still headlining for others ! Great song choices !	1
I 'm glad I could find this CD on Amazon , since my original copy had been stolen . It really is the best of the Crue - the real Crue - Vince , Tommy , Mick and Nikki .	1
I have a lot of Eric Clapton DVDs , VHS concert tapes and , of course , CDs and this `` 24 Nights '' holds a special place among all of them . It might be the pinnacle of Clapton 's fantastic career . This is so good I have the DVD and the two-disc CD.There are four segments to this concert , filmed over several days and I am partial to the second and third parts : the blues songs and then the nine-piece band numbers . Together , they are 51.5 minutes of some of the best music I have ever heard.The bluesy `` Running On Faith , '' the opening song of the disc in segment one , is a great start , a song that gets better and better over the years . On part two : the blues numbers , I particularly liked Clapton 's guitar work on `` Have You Ever Loved A Woman ? '' It 's not bad having Buddy Guy and Robert Cray as your backup guitarists , either ! I found the 9-piece segment to be my favorite with one song alone - `` Pretending '' - having two of the greatest solos ever by Clapton . If that song does n't get your blood moving , nothing will . `` Old Love '' has some nice solo work , too , by pianist Johnny Johnston , bassist Nathan East.. I 've always enjoyed Eric 's two female backup singers Katie Kisson and Tessa Niles and Kisson is really great with her solo at the end of `` Wonderful Tonight . `` The final segment , featuring a complete orchestra , has two great opening numbers and finishes with the only number I did n't care but , by then , I have more than my fill of great blues and rock 'n roll . However , it 's still fun to see everyone dressed in black tie and evening gowns , anyway.This concert never fails to amaze every time I watch it and hear it .	1
Super quality of the sound and video a real nice mix of Clapton Favorites unbelievable when playing with the orchestra a real must have	1
Eric Clapton 24 Nights takes you through a journey with his differnt bands including The 4 Piece Band , The Blues Band , The 9 Piece Band , and The Orchestra . This DVD runs 90 minutes with many special guests including Phil Collins , Buddy Guy , Robert Cray , Nathan East , and more . If your looking for a great Eric Clapton performence this one is for you ! Their are many great songs including the bluesy Watch Yourself , The Orchestrated Bell Bottom Blues , Bad Love , Old Love , and White Room . If your looking for early songs try watching Sunshine Of Your Love with the the 4 Piece Band . These performences are just great recorded at the Royal Albert Hall , London in 1990 & 1991 . This is truely a must have for all guitarist across the world ! ! !	1
The only dissapointment I had with the CD was the mediocre version of & quot ; Badge & quot ; ... . & quot ; Badge & quot ; is my gavorite song , but in the CD , the song is terrible so it 's good they left it off ! Everyother song is good .	1
This is a fine recording of Claptons fabled London Albert Hall concerts from the early 90's.Starting with the 4 piece band you get : Running on FaithWhite RoomSunshine of your LoveThen the Blues Band : Watch YourselfHave you ever loved a womanWorried life bluesThen the nine piece band : PretendingBad loveOld LoveWonderful TonightThe Orchestra and band : Bell Bottom BluesHard TimesEdge of DarknessThis all done very professionally and there are some great moments interspersed with just a few I could have done without . The live version of the 'Edge of Darkness ' theme is tremendously powerful , and the Blues set is my favourite overall . This has Jonnie Johnson on Piano and Robert Cray and Buddy Guy on Guitar.Well worth buying overall .	1
This video is very nice to watch . It has Madonnas first videos made for her early biggest hits . This video is enjoyable because you get to see Madonna during the early eighties when she was still fresh , young , and innocent . This video takes you back in time when Madonna was more feminine and prettier than what she is now . This is a video for any hardcore Madonna fan of her early eighties look . Seeing this video in a way makes you miss the old Madonna from the Like A Virgin days .	1
With her rising popularity and heavy radio play during the mid 1980s , Madonna was bound to have her earliest videos compiled on videocassette . The first in a series of many compilations & quot ; Madonna : Madonna & quot ; contains four videos that were released on her self titled debut album and sophomore album , & quot ; Like A Virgin. & quot ; Starting with the classic & quot ; Borderline & quot ; ( which features a yet unknown actor by the name of John Leguizamo in a non-speaking extra role ; keep an eye out for him in the breakdancing scenes ) the tape continues with three other Madonna video gems , & quot ; Lucky Star , & quot ; & quot ; Like a Virgin & quot ; and the hard to find video & quot ; Burning Up , & quot ; which only can be found on this videocassette ( it was not included in Madonna 's & quot ; Immaculate Collection & quot ; compilation ) . & quot ; Burning Up , & quot ; which is still one of my favorite Madonna songs , is a creative video , incorporating clever set designs and lightning . The & quot ; Lucky Star & quot ; video which features a version of the song that was previously unavailable ( now available on Madonna 's remastered & quot ; Madonna & quot ; album that was released during the summer of 2001 ) also differs from the version found on her & quot ; Immaculate Collection & quot ; DVD.Now , I only wish both videos were available on DVD with many of her other videos not found on other compilations ( e.g. , & quot ; I Want You , & quot ; & quot ; Into the Groove , & quot ; etc . ) However , if you are a true Madonna fan and need to have every one of her videos , than this tape is necessary . If not , let 's wait and see if the & quot ; Burning Up & quot ; video will be re-released on DVD as a single or on a compilation in the future.Overall , a great tape full of memories and the makings of one of the Twentieth Century 's greatest stars .	1
This tour video always takes me back to those fun , colourful eighties years , when Madonna looked like a human being ( no way was she 'chubby ' , she was healthy and gorgeous compared to the skeletal anorexic she is now ) and made perfect pop music and brilliant music videos . If this concert video is ever published on DVD , I will most definitely buy it .	1
THIS HAS THE CRAZIEST VAN HALEN SOLOS EVER ! ! ! ! BUY THIS DVD AND YOU 'LL NEVER REGRET IT ! ! !	1
Eddie Van Halen was one of the guitarists who first inspired me to pick up a guitar and amaze me with his two handed tapping technique . So this DVD has its place in my DVD collection.This DVD really highlights the band in their hey day , enjoying themselves and showing the energy playing in front of a crowd can bring induce . Despite the absence of Roth , they were still able to find success with 5150 and ride that wave of success and churn out plenty of 5150 tunes . Sammy still manages to sing a couple of pre-5150 tunes and shows he is not unfamiliar with a fret board.The footage is good enough for me . The sound though is not the best , but considering this was recorded almost 20 years ago , you cant expect the same recording quality as today due to technological advances.Anyone who likes Van Halen will appreciate them not just for their ability to compose good music , but also becuase Eddie is a legend amongst guitar circles for his innovative playing.I think this shows Van Halen at best , having a good time , working the crowd and playing good music . Throw in some 80 's fashion and glam and you 've got an entertaining DVD .	1
Eddie Van Halen is so talented . I totally likes this recording of him live . His brother to on the drums is amazing .	1
Yes , I 'd agree this live show is better then the `` Redwoods '' that 's also still available . The band is tighter musically then the Redwoods concert and did a great job . That 's not to say the other is bad ... but I 'd much prefer this show . Now , I ca n't say it 's 'better ' than the `` Kenny Loggins - Alive ' DVD simply because I LOVED Kenny 's rockers on 'Alive ' , which was just 'smokin ' hot ! ' BUT of course we are getting a bit older too and we 're talking about a '20 year ' spread of time . haha ! The Grand Canyon concert is a good buy , tight band , and great percussion .	1
I saw Kenny on the television recently , and he still sound good , but he looks a lot older . This is the younger version of Kenny and his voice could n't be any better . Nice backdrop in the Grand Canyon .	1
If you have n't seen THE ROLLING STONES : GIM ME SHELTER ( CRITERION COLLECTION BLU-RAY ) it 's an iconic documentary filmed by famed movie-maker brothers David and Albert Maysles ( The Beatles - The First U.S. Visit , Grey Gardens / The Beales of Grey Gardens - Criterion Collection ( 2-disc set ) ) that was supposed to feature `` The Rolling Stones '' in concert at Altamount Speedway in Northern California.What was going to be the West Coast 's answer toWoodstock : 3 Days of Peace & Music Director 's Cut ( 40th Anniversary Ultimate Collector 's Edition with Amazon Exclusive Bonus Disc ) ended up being something far more sinister as people experienced bad acid trips and the Hell 's Angels roughed up audience members and performers . It eventually ends with a stabbing death that 's caught on film in this documentary. GIM ME SHELTER not only shows the Rolling Stones in concert at various venues before heading into Altamont , but it also shows the wheeling and dealing that went on behind-the-scenes to get the concert off the ground . And it films the reaction of the Stones , particularly Mick Jagger , to the stabbing death as the footage is presented to the group after the incident.The documentary is riveting and the event itself has since been touted as the `` defining '' moment that brought an end to the Hippie 's `` Peace & Love '' idealism and what could happen without rules and order.Picture resolution is excellent , but do n't expect it to be razor sharp like something that was filmed recently.==== BONUS FEATURES ====*** KSAN 'S RADIO ALTAMONT -- ( 01-hour and 29-minutes ) -- Indexed & `` Play All '' * This is audio only , over a static image , of excerpts from the KSAN radio broadcast that followed the next day after Altamont .

I have written elsewhere in this space that when it comes to musical influences in my youth that the Stones played a key role in developing my tastes . I have also mentioned elsewhere that my youthful alienation was reflected in the language and sound of the group . I mentioned Street Fighting Man and Tumbling Dice , as well as an earlier cover of Little Red Rooster as important . All this is by way of saying that I looked forward recently to re-watching the old Stones documentary Gim me Shelter reviewed here , despite my knowledge of the tragic incidents that occurred at Altamont and marred the whole experience.If one is to recount the high points of the too short counter cultural explosion of the 1960 's one could arbitrarily assign the Summer of Love in 1967 as the height and Altamont as the start of the decline . We can argue that point endlessly but clearly something or some things happened at Altamont that exposed the ugly side of the dope/ counter cultural scene . Moreover , on reflection no one can deny the unreasonableness of having the notorious Hell 's Angels , despite favorable press from Tom Wolfe in Electric Kool Aid Acid Test and Hunter Thompson in his classic study Hell 's Angels , as security for a 300 , 000 person event.Now , we finally get to the music and the film . And I think that this is about the right place for such comments in the scheme of things . There have been many , many Stones concerts during the past forty years but none have had the cultural significance of Altamont . Most of the film is about how they , good-naturedly if ultimately naively , tried to put the event together . A fair portion of the film is footage of the reaction by the Stones to the events that they witnessed and interspersed in between are parts of the performance.This film has not aged well , although Mick has . His voice comes off tinny here reflecting an earlier , more primitive sound technology that does not do justice to how Mick and the boys could whip up an audience . A nice surprise though is a very sensual Tina ( and Ike ) Turner performance . Unfortunately , the Jefferson Airplane afternoon performance is marred by the violence that doomed the event . But here is the skinny . If you need to look at rock and roll history watch this one and one half hour documentary . If you want to hear the Stones at their best then purchase any one of about ten greatest hits albums available . That 's the ticket .	1
`` Gim me Shelter '' is rightly considered one of the most riveting rock documentaries ever made . A mere 4 months after the `` 3 Days of Peace , Love and Music '' at Woodstock , the peaceful hippie vibe degenerated at Altamont . The Maysles Brothers- who chronicled the seamy side of Jackie O 's reclusive , eccentric relatives in `` Grey Gardens '' -- now chronicle the seamy side of the hippie movement . `` Gim me Shelter '' is a cinematic masterpiece of a terrifying , violent episode in American history . `` Gim me Shelter '' breaks the fourth wall . It 's framed with the Rolling Stones watching this very documentary , and their shocked , agonized reactions to it . Mick Jagger , in his younger days , comes across as a cute charmer . In his presence , women swoon , weep -- and at one point , a topless woman tries to get onto the stage . There 's the impish , immortal Keith Richards . The Rolling Stones are , above all , musicians . They are seen listening to their music , watching their Madison Square Garden concert . The music gives them peace . A sexy duet between Ike and Tina Turner provides an interlude.Even if you are n't a fan of the Rolling Stones , you might come to like their music . The Stones seem naive about the effect of their music on people . `` Under my thumb '' , '' Brown Sugar '' , '' Street Fighting Man '' , '' Sympathy for the Devil '' and `` Gim me Shelter '' are songs with unpleasant subjects -- the Stones do n't seem to understand their lyrics might inflame people . It foreshadows Woodstock '99 when Limp Bizkit sang `` Burn Things '' , then front man Fred Durst wondered why people were burning things . `` Gim me Shelter '' also shows the polar opposite of Woodstock at the hastily prepared Altamont . It 's a squalid place . There 's public nudity ( of those who should 've kept their clothes on , really ) , public urination , drunkenness , and fights . The violence rises to a fever pitch when Mick Jagger gets beat up by a `` fan '' as soon as he gets out of the helicopter , and Grace Slick tries to pacify the crowd when Jefferson Airplane guitarist Marty Balin gets punched out . The concert spins out of control . When the Grateful Dead land , they are shocked when they learn about the violence . Had they performed , would the situation have improved ? We 'll never know . `` Gim me Shelter '' shows the nightmarish end of the '60s . As the Summer of Love in San Francisco ended with squalor and drug addicts in the Haight , so did the peace & love ; end with violence & disorder . ; `` Gim me Shelter '' shows the dirt beneath the flower power .	1
`` Gim me Shelter '' , the Rolling Stones documentary , follows the Greatest ROck and Roll Band in the World on their 1969 US Tour , and at the tours finale , a free concert festival at Altamont Speedway . It also shows them at Muscle Shoals studio in Alabama laying down tracks for their next album Sticky Fingers.It captures great performances of Jumpin Jack Flash , Satisfaction , Street Fighting Man , Honky Tonk Women and others , while you also get to hear early versions of Brown Sugar , You Got ta Move , and Wild Horses . The documentary also focuses on the efforts that were being made to create the free concert which was supposed to take place at a different park in San Fran , I think it was the Golden Gate Park or something . Things take a bad turn when the free concert gets started . The Flying Burrito Brothers play a tune and the Hells Angels , who were hired as security decided to enforce the crowd by smashing pool sticks on their heads and just basically stomping the fans on the ground . The Jefferson Airplane takes the stage next and are greeted with the same chaos from the crowd of over 300,000 , and Marty Balin of the Airplane actually jumps in the crowd and gets punched in the face . I think Santana actually performed there too , but his concert footage is not included here . The day turns to night and then the Stones come out in all their stoned and wasted glory . They get things started with Sympathy For the Devil here , and a motorcycle engine starts to catch fire and explodes causing the band to stop for several minutes , then they get back in the groove and perform an excellent version of the song . Under My Thumb comes next and its definetly got an erie sound to it . As they perform it , a fan named Meredith Hunter aims a gun , and as he does so he is stabbed twice in the back by one of the Hells Angels . They go on to stab him once more in the ear and proceed to kick and stomp him to death while the Stones play on . At the end of the concert the Stones jump in a chopper and get the hell out of Altamont . The film shows a couple of replays of the murder with Mick Jagger watching and commenting . The film ends with shots of the fans leaving the show early the next morning with a rocking rendition of Gim me Shelter played live at one point during the Stones tour i guess . This is definitely a great documentary to watch and its packed full of extras like some footage of two or three songs performed on the tour . The album `` Get Yer Ya-Ya 's Out '' is the perfect companion peice to `` Gim me Shelter '' . Its a live album record on November 26th and 27th at Madison Square Garden while on that 1969 tour . Get both the cd and the dvd for a classic Stones experience .	1
Okay , so the film has to be valued as a piece of cinema verite capturing a nightmarish moment in countercultural history , but going on 35 years later , I 'm still waiting for the Stones tour documentary that was , after all , the original intent of having the Maysleses & Co. around the Stones at all.This `` anniversary edition '' of the film offers a ray of hope in the form of a few snippets of outtake material - the scenes from the Muscle Shoals studio in particular are a real joy ( and bravo , guys , for showing you *were* capable of noticing somebody besides Mick Jagger for at least a few seconds ! ) .So where 's the rest ? By all accounts the Stones ' performance at Altamont was brilliant - they did n't just stop playing and flee , as this film misleadingly suggests . Granted , the events at Altamont turned the film into something other than originally anticipated - but that story 's been told already , and the movie 's gathered its due laurels . Now can we *please* finally see the rest of the Stones ' concert ? ? I 'm sure I 'm not the only one who would value that miles more than the interminable self-congratulatory `` commentaries '' the filmmakers tacked onto this edition ( really , who *cares* that you adore Mick 's scarf ? ! ) . The remastering job is very fine , though , so ... all right , four stars . I 'll save the fifth one for when you let us have the Stones . ( And for the record , re another reviewer 's remarks : That 's not Andrew Oldham , who had long since parted ways with the Stones , it 's Sam Cutler , their road manager ; and there were no Stones hanging around in any `` local civic offices '' - what an idea ! )	1
The curse upon the Rolling Stones appears to be that the pinnacle of their musical creativity , from 1968-1974 , is overshadowed by Altamont.The irony , of course , is that while the Stones and some others are to blame for shoddy planning , based more on naivite ' than anything else , it was the Hell 's Angels who took it upon themselves to beat , intimidate and , finally , murder concert-goers . As GIM ME SHELTER documents , the Angels were asked to sit on the stage , to form a human wall between the crowd and the performers , in exchange for all the beer they could drink . They took this to mean they were to keep the crowd at bay , using fists , hobnail boots , pool cues , and knives.In the end it was the Hell 's Angels , a group of thugs who had never bought into flower-power and the entire hippy trip , who brought the 60 's tumbling to a frightening and embarassing finale'.Jagger , like the Dead and Jefferson Airplane before him , seems meak and confused at Altamont , while good ol ' Keith Richards attempts to take control of the situation.JAGGER : & quot ; People ! People ! People , people , people , people , people . People . People ! Awright . Awright ... people ! & quot ; RICHARDS : & quot ; If those cats , right there , do n't stop beating everybody , we 're not playing anymore . Those cats , right THERE. & quot ; Almost forgotten in all the pop-sociological writings about this film is the great , great music . The Mick Taylor version of the Stones was as powerful as it gets , and they flex some muscle here.My only question is , why were n't Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor allowed to speak on camera ? Jagger and Watts speak frequently , Richards speaks occasionally ( mostly on stage at Altamont ) , Taylor is shown only occasionally , and Wyman is seen on screen , I think , one time , in the background on stage .	1
John Burks of Rolling Stone Magazine called the free concert at Altamont Speedway on December 6 , 1969 as `` Rock & Roll 's Worst Day '' . Many performers called it the end of the peace movement.With the success of the Woodstock Music & Art Fair in Woodstock , New York in August 1969 , many people have wanted to see a concert in the West . So , what better to have it in California with a free concert to be held on a Saturday , December 6 , 1969 at the Altamont Speedway in Northern California . With an amazing lineup which would include the Grateful Dead , Santana , Jefferson Airplane , The Flying Burrito Brothers , Crosby , Stills & Nash and rock n ' roll 's most electrifying band , the Rolling Stones.And the footage would be recorded as part of a documentary on the Rolling Stones 1969 US Tour directed by Albert and David Maysles ( known for their work in 1968 for `` Salesman '' and later in 1975 for `` Grey Gardens '' ) and Charlotte Zwerin . Of course , the documentary known as `` Gim me Shelter '' would become more than just a documentary about the Rolling Stones , it would be a documentary that would capture the Rolling Stones performing at the Altamont Speedway concert . A concert unlike Woodstock which was peace , love and rock n ' roll , the free concert at Altamont was stained with violence including a homicide . `` Gim me Shelter '' received restoration for it 's 30th year anniversary in 2000 and in 2009 , the film was given its High Definition treatment by the Criterion Collection as it was released on Blu-ray.VIDEO : '' Gim me Shelter '' is presented in 1080p High Definition with its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:33:1 . According to Criterion , the new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from the 16mm camera original and the 35mm duplicate negative under the supervision of co-director Albert Maysles . Thousands of instances of dirt , debris , scratches , splices , warps , jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI 's DRS system and Pixel Farm 's PFClean system , while Digital Vision 's DVNR system was used for small dirt , grain and noise reduction.Although I have never owned the standard DVD version of `` Gim me Shelter '' , I would assume that this high definition release is the definitive release yet . There is a good amount of grain on the film but personally , this is literally a time capsule of a significant event in American music history . It 's not a pristine video transfer but again , considering the original source , I felt that `` Gim me Shelter '' looked very good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES : As for the audio for `` Gim me Shelter '' , according to the Criterion Collection , the soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original 35mm magnetic multitracks . Clicks , thumps , hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD . You get two lossless audio tracks . The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and the DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.I compared the two soundtrack and I felt the 5.1 track , the audience is more prominent and I just felt the electric guitars , percussion and bass were more punchy and clear . Especially Mick Jagger 's vocals during the performance scenes but the 2.0 track is no slouch either for those who prefer to have that stereo option . The soundtrack sounds great coming from the front channels as well . So , it really comes down to audio preference . I 'm more the immersive soundscape audiophile who prefers hearing sounds all around than just the front channel.Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES : '' Gim me Shelter - THE CRITERION COLLECTION # 99 ' comes with the following special features : * Audio Commentary - Audio commentary featuring directors Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin and collaborator Stanley Goldstein . This is the same commentary from the 2000 DVD release . * 1969 KSAN Radio Broadcast - ( 30 minutes ) Audio excerpts from KSAN Radio 's Altamont wrap-up , recorded December 7 , 1969 , with introductions by then DJ Stefan Ponek for the 2000 edition . Expect to hear comments from Emmet Grogan , leader of San Francisco 's counterculture movement , Sonny Barger , head of the Oakland Chapter of the Hells Angels at that time . * Outtakes - ( 19 minutes ) Performances by the Rolling Stones at Madison Square Garden in 1969 , including `` Oh Carol '' and `` Prodigal Son , '' plus backstage outtakes and footage of the band mixing `` Little Queenie '' . Backstage includes Mick Jagger jamming with Ike and Tina Turner at Madison Square Garden . * Images from Altamont - Altamont stills gallery , featuring the work of renowned photographers Bill Owens and Beth Sunflower . Awesome still images from the event . * Trailers - Two theatrical trailers plus the re-release trailers.EXTRAS : * 40-Page Booklet - Featuring the following essays : `` Rock-and-Roll Zapruder '' by Amy Taubin , `` The True Adventures of Altamont '' by Stanley Booth ( who traveled with the Rolling Stones and gives his insight and experience at the Altamont event ) , `` Snapshots from the Road '' by Georgia Bergman ( who was the personal assistant of Mick Jagger from 1967-1972 ) , `` The Decade that Spawned Altamont '' by Michael Lydon , `` The ` Demonic Charisma ' of Gim me Shelter '' by Godfrey Cheshire ( film critic/filmmaker ) and a big fan of the film , who challenges Pauline Kael 's 1970 review.JUDGMENT CALL : This is probably the first Criterion Blu-ray which I watched once , watched it again and days later , watched it once again . I suppose that like some people who have re-watched the Zapruder JFK assassination footage or the video footage from momentous times that were significant , you just ca n't stop watching it . `` Gim me Shelter '' was a documentary that captured my attention from beginning to end.We get literally two documentaries in one . We get to see the rock legends , the Rolling Stone at their best in Madison Square Garden performing with such flair . This is the Rolling Stones that I would have loved to see perform back in the late '60s and early '70s . I was just in awe by their performance in this documentary because my exposure to the Rolling Stones was what I have seen from the '80s and now . I can see why my parents and millions of people loved the band back then . Mick Jagger was just all out and cool and to see him and the band on stage was just fantastic.And then we get what was supposed to be an awesome day of music , becomes the worst thing you can imagine happening at a music festival . Chaos.For one thing , watching it and thinking how this event was pulled off with lack of organization , lack of security ... it leaves me in awe . Granted , the film was created before I was born and with the way things went at the Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock , I am guessing that organizers were not expecting any chaos . After all , it was a time of peace and love . But also , people were on some major drug trips at the time and for the Hell 's Angels , they came for the beer and to do their job of protecting the stage and they came in the cue sticks and if people were going to get in the way , they were going to get beat down.In hindsight , one can wonder how in the hell this could of happened but watching the film , was there any doubt that any decorum would take place ? This was organized chaos and David and Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin were in the right place at the right time . No one expected four people to die at this event , then again , no one expected people to give birth at this event . I 've read that no one expected 300,000 people to be at this event but when you have these major bands headlining , especially the Rolling Stones , this was significant and somehow , it 's hard to comprehend some of the decisions that were made prior to this event happening.Keith Richards told the London `` Evening Standard '' in regards to the Altamont event , `` Really , the difference between the open air show we held here in Hyde Park and the one there is amazing . I think it illustrates the difference between the two countries . In Hyde Park everybody had a good time , and there was no trouble . You can put half a million young English people together and they wo n't start killing each other . That 's the difference . `` May it be the naiveness of the Stones and their manager but regardless , `` Gim me Shelter '' shows us the end of the hippie era . Where `` Monterey Pop '' and `` Woodstock '' which both have respected documentaries showed the good of music during the late '60s , `` Gim me Shelter '' showed us the bad . Where hundreds of thousands of people were expecting awesome music for the day , those who were in the front row got to see the worst . And the Maysles and Zwerin were there to capture it on camera . The filmmakers were at the right place at the right time and for decades , many people can watch this film over and over and listen to the wonderful music of the Rolling Stones but also get a dose of chaos all in one documentary.The Blu-ray release of `` Gim me Shelter '' is once again , another magnificent release from the Criterion Collection . The restoration and how its presented on HD is great , considering this is a 40-year-old film . And also special features and a booklet that are equally fantastic . This is a release that is simply worth owning . `` Gim me Shelter '' is a fascinating documentary that has endured for decades and for us who were not around during that time , we watch this film like we see other tragedies that happened in American history , we see this and ask `` why ? '' . Like those who stood and cheered in Arlington , Texas with smiles on their face and then see chaos of John F. Kennedy being murdered . Here we are six years later after Kennedy 's death but this time , at an even that was supposed to be peaceful and somehow ended up becoming deadly and the cameras catching the events leading to Meredith Hunter 's death.The documentary leaves us and possibly the viewers of other generations after me asking how can this happen ? Why were the Hells Angels brought in ? Why was this even so badly organized ? Why did Hunter bring a gun ? Too many questions but not many answers ? `` Gim me Shelter '' is a fascinating and important film covering that one day where rock n ' roll went wrong . This Blu-ray release is highly recommended !	1

THIS IS A GREAT DVD FROM ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK BANDS EVER.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .	1
There are two distinct parts to this great film , the first a standard rockumentary ( and a good one at that ) that focuses on the Rolling Stones and their recording and performing in the U.S in late 1969.Fans of the Stones will love to see this band at the peak of their youth , influence and talent . Mick Taylor had just replaced the deceased Brian Jones bringing a far more professional guitar sound to the band . Taylor was a true musician , arguably the best axeman the Stones ever had . Mick Taylor 's lead guitar runs brought so much to the band as their most acclaimed albums `` Let it Bleed '' , `` Sticky Fingers '' and `` Exile on Main Street '' followed.The Stones are featured here live at Madison Square Garden with opening act Ike and ( a very young and sexy ) Tina Turner.The second ( and much more important ) part of this film focuses on the Stones disasterous free concert at the Altamont Motor Speedway in Northern California . The real life crowd footage of this show is a fascinating look into the naivetee , the mind pollution of hard drugs and the loss of innocence and direction of the 60 's Generation . The hippies at this show make `` Heavy Metal Parking Lot '' look like a Mensa festival- stoned on acid , irrational- these are the folks who think war machines can be stopped with peaceful vibes and flowers . And when minor situations erupt that could be handled more tactfully , the Hell 's Angels security detail began to get rough with the overintoxicated and clueless concert goers.Very interesting is the interaction within the crowd as the mood starts to go bad.Opening act the Flying Burrito Brothers attempt the old classic `` 6 Days on the Road '' and have to deal with crowd violence . The Jefferson Airplane , also in their musical prime suffer the same fate.But headliners the Rolling Stones insist on going on with the show.It 's very interesting to see human weakness from all sides , the Hell 's Angels clearly overreacting with fists and clubs to annoying stoned out fans is a lack of judgement with brutal consequence . More interesting is the impotence of the performers- a scared Keith Richard patting the back of the biggest nearby bodyguard , Paul Kantner shivering behind a microphone and attempting to use the crowd to shame the outlaw bikers , Mick Jagger trying to dance and ignore the mayhem around him while fans look on disgustedly . These are the ROCK STARS who thought they could preach peace and all would accept their gospel . To see these revered musicians appear so human and vulernable is worth the price of admission.The images that are captured are incredible , thousands of words can not describe what cameras were lucky enough to catch.There is debate on what happened to Meredith Hunter , an 18 year old who is seen with a handgun at the concert and then stabbed to death by the Hell 's Angels . After watching fat naked hippies battered with pool cues , it is hard to defend anything the Angels did that day , but a jury acquitted several of the bikers of murder and YES unfortunately this young man did brandish a pistol at a rock concert , hardly a `` peace and love '' thing to do . The only thing undebatable is that this was a tragedy and a waste of life . Watch the movie and decide for yourself.Great music , tense and chilling , It is sad that this was a real event but very fascinating viewing for most anyone , rock fans or those with historical interest for the era .	1
I am the Stones Authority . This is an interesting film . Well shot and produced from a production values point of view . The documentary `` story '' itself is a little disjointed , but holds together well enough , but ends rather abruptly with not much explanation . Just Mick muttering something to the effect of `` bummer '' while in the edit suite watching Meredith Hunter getting beaten and stabbed and then a montage lead out showing the sorriest bunch of hippies you 've ever seen from the Bay Area marching out to the concert site to a soundtrack of the song `` Gim me Shelter '' . It is an odd way to end the film . It did n't occur to the Maysles to maybe capture some additional commentary from the band or the entourage regarding this mess out at Altamont ? I would have liked to have heard a fresh recap of their impressions . I have my own impression based on watching the film though , and that is this : What a mess the Sixties were . What started out wonderfully enough degenerated into what you see at Altamont by the decade 's end . Proof positive that children do a lousy job of raising themselves . God help us all that these knuckleheads are now running the country for the most part . Jeez . The other impression that is reinforced for me by this movie - and I had to learn it the hard way still - is that large outdoor concerts suck . I watched Woodstock . I would n't have wanted to be there . I do n't need dirt , rain , mud , bugs up my butt , losers puking on or near me , my girlfriend p**ing in the grass , heat , cold , Hells Angels , Guardian Angels , angels from heaven or sympathetic devils dancing on my feet . And the fact that many outdoor concerts are free does n't help . As a friend of mine from the former Soviet Union points out , `` Everything we had was free . We did n't have to pay for anything . And it all sucked . '' But you can watch this movie from the comfort of your own home . And it is a pretty good movie . The Stones concert footage from Madison Square Garden is good stuff . Seeing that mess at Altamont is interesting . Having it all preserved on film all these years later is historically wonderful and should answer a lot of questions people have about the Sixties in general . Get the movie .	1
Watching this after a screening of WOODSTOCK is a real study in contrast . ALTAMOUNT was always on my radar , growing up , and I had seen this in the theater back in the 70s , but revisiting it now ... what a revelation . There was a perception that WOODSTOCK had been an incredibly significant event in the counter-culture galaxy ; a peace+love tribal congress . This concert came four months later , and because it was the west coast rebuttal to the upstate NY megafest , would be even better - better bands , better drugs , hipper hippies , freakier clothes , groovier vibes . The crowd shots are both revealing , and inevitably , terrifying as the claustraphobic crush tightens around the stage ( crowd control plans , anyone ? ) and the HELLS ANGELS react like bears in cages being poked with sticks ... they erupt in an orgy of beatdowns and over-the-top violence . After all , that 's what they do . Was anyone truly surprised ? The various bands ( Airplane , Santana , Dead , Stones ) are merely ineffectual witnesses ( with a good view ) to what goes on , tho Marty Balin does get coldcocked during the Airplane set . I 'm sure the musicians to this day feel fortunate that they did not get stomped on stage by the ever-growing legion of wild-eyed , wooly strangers standing nearby . ( keep an eye out for the 300 lb . naked man careening through the crowd ) If Woodstock gave us a pleasant marijuana buzz , Altamount grinds our collective molars with a bad blend of street meth and bootleg LSD . Man , am I glad I was n't there.All this being said , a good portion of this excellent documentary features the Stones backstage , in the recording studio , on the road , and performing with aplomb at a Madison Square Garden show . In '69 , after all , they were in midseason form .	1
While not a piece of cinematic brilliance , if you like the Stones and rockumentaries you 'll be pleased . It has some nice footage and really shows what happened at Altamont , which is what the film mainly focuses on . If your looking for a film full of performances , this is not it , though there is footage of some songs from the '69 tour before Altamont , as well as a great clip of Tina Turner , who opened for the Stones during the tour . Check out the book True Adventures of the Rolling Stones for more from '69 Stones !	1
Simply a surreal film . Really a maddening film ... if it were n't for Altamont , this would be nothing more than a low budget fan-based Stones cult classic , but the events of December 6th , 1969 make it an historical icon . Presented under the guise of following the Stones late in their Gim me Shelter tour of 1969 , this disjointed account follows the band as they complete a show at Madison Square Garden in New York and begin negotiations for a ` Woodstock ' like free concert in the San Francisco area late in 1969 . Interspersed with recording studio drug induced sound checks for , among other things , an early recording of ` Wild Horses ' , the film meanders towards the inevitable outcome at Altamont and the absolutely phenomenal occurrences of that day and concert.Really following no rhyme nor reason , this movie moves at a somewhat languid pace with snippets of concert footage and backstage coverage of the band ... this Criterion Collection has performed an amazing service by digitally remastering these recordings to sound absolutely rich and astounding . The New York shows and Altamont shows all have a drive and depth with the bass and lead/rhythm guitars brought out and integrated with Jagger 's vocals that really stand out . My only complaint about this ` tour ' film is that after the tragedy at Altamont , the Stones play some of their best live concert music and this film , unbelievably , does not present it.The highlight of this movie , obviously , is the Altamont concert and these events cover almost the entire last half of the film . Showing the rushed attempts at staging this show and the behind the scenes negotiating in the rush up to it , we 're then propelled out to the raceway where we 're suddenly a part of the concert scene . A ` Woodstock ' like affect then takes place as we see hippie after hippie take his place in the crowd and the ever present drug-like aura pervades . Suddenly , motorcycle-like rumbles override the crowd noise and the Hell 's Angels make a ceremonial like entrance and the inextricable shift to violence begins as does the concert . Among the classic footage is a confrontational trash talk exchange between Jefferson Airplane 's Grace Slick and the Hell 's Angels frontmen over the clubbing into unconsciousness of one of its band members . Also , the Grateful Dead arrive and then soon depart , without playing , as they learn of the unrelenting violence associated with this concert.The Stones , meanwhile , purposely wait for nightfall , angering , according to Angels frontman Sonny Barger , the crowd even further and take the stage under an immense and violent aura . This is where the film gets hypnotic as the band breaks into their set while the Angels continue beating the crowd into submission . Pause after violent pause in the music is offset by Mick 's pensive outlook as the environment is clearly out of control . It is amazing to see the concert aesthetics of the sixties as the Angels walk about onstage and even talk with Jagger between vocal sets . A large dog even walks across the stage and the motorcyclists wrestle with a large naked drugged out woman before we see Meredith Hunter in his lime green suit rush the stage before he 's beaten back . It 's not until it 's presented to the Mick and the viewer in the ever present backdrop of editing this film that we see in slow motion the real horror of Hunter 's and the Angel 's actions . Carrying a gun in an apparent drug induced haze while rushing the stage , Hunter is beaten back , stabbed and killed while Jagger tries to control the crowd . Helicoptored out amidst loud sobbing from his girlfriend and under a blood soaked gurney , the band continues , but the viewer only gets to see Mick reviewing the ` awful ' footage on a small film screen in a studio and then walking out . This is where the film ends.While important from an historical perspective , this film was very revealing as a ` you are there ' anchor . The close proximity to the band as the violence was occurring and the abundance of concert footage earlier that day gives the viewer a solid view of Altamont and the absurdity of that day . Weak in its point of coverage of the Stones on Tour , it more than makes up for it with the melancholy and surrealism associated with the death and violence that equates to the epithet Altamont .	1
this is a terrific movie , even not taking its subject matter into account . centered around a 1980 reunion of the legendary folk music group the weavers , it is a splendid tale of friendships revived and recalled . it is also a chance to see a filmed record of these brilliant musicians who fueled the folk craze of the late 50s and early 60s , while they themselves were still being blacklisted . a beautiful tribute to ronnie gilbert , freddy hellerman , pete seeger , and above all the wonderful lee hays . get it !	1
The Weavers , Was n't That a Time , is a must for anybody who loves folk music . It tells the story of the Blacklisting of the folk quartet the Weavers . PETE SEEGER , LEE HAYS , RONNIE GILBERT , and FRED HELLERMAN . It also tells about how successful their first concert after the blacklist was at Carnegie Hall , on Christmas Eve 1955 . For years into the 60s , the Weavers disbanded and the artists went into their separate ways . Seeger went to expand his solo career , Hays went into retirement on his farm , Gilbert started spending her time in the theatre , and Hellerman spent his time writing and producing . Then on the Thanksgiving weekend of 1980 , the events that this film was filmed for came to pass . After 25 years , the four original Weavers returned to Carnegie Hall and gave two concerts.I am so sorry to hear that this film has gone out of print . My copy is kind of worn out and I really want to be able to own it on DVD . I hope Warner Bros. will consider reissuing it . You have my order if they ever do .	1
This video covers every music video Iron Maiden released from 1980 ( Women In Uniform ) to 1992 ( From Here to Eternity ) . 1992 also marks the last year with singer and frontman , Bruce Dickinson , who left the band . Iron Maiden then went on to make two lackluster albums with singer Blaze Blayley . Anyways , the video gives you great classics such as & quot ; Run To The Hills & quot ; , & quot ; The Number of the Beast & quot ; , & quot ; The Trooper & quot ; , & quot ; Aces High & quot ; , & quot ; Wasted Years & quot ; , and & quot ; The Evil That Men Do & quot ; , along with some more underrated songs that are just as good as the classics like & quot ; Stranger In A Strange Land & quot ; , & quot ; The Clairvoyant & quot ; , and & quot ; Be Quick or Be Dead & quot ; . It also includes more videos than the ones I already listed , and two live videos , in & quot ; Running Free & quot ; , and & quot ; Infinite Dreams & quot ; . I would highly reccomend this to any Iron Maiden fan .	1
Bought for a friend who is a big fan of the director of this film . He also likes Bowie , but walking into his place you would n't here him play him at all !	1
This full package is just what you 'd think it 'd be - no surprises . It 's done well . The picture is probably as good as it can get - being digitally mastered from 16MM film ( which is not at all a favorite of mine ) . Sixteen Millimeter film tends to look grainy and blurry and it 's shame now that this legendary musical performance did n't have a higher budget.The sound of the DVD is clear and strong . The best part for me was the commentary soundtrack by Tony Visconti and the director which is insightful ; I learned a lot.The DVD also comes with a fold-up poster and mini booklet . It 's a nice package for fans . I still claim that David Bowie 's best LP is & quot ; The Rise & amp ; Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars & quot ; of 1972 . He hit his peak early on , but the surprising thing is how he managed to maintain a vibrant , and always fascinating creative impulse for many years afterwards . Whereas most artists would have disappeared after Ziggy 's pinnacle , Bowie quickly kept us thinking , and rethinking the whole while.In my opinion , this is David at his peak . See a truly historic Rock & amp ; Roll moment , captured on film forever , and now remastered on DVD for your home collection .	1
Awesome footage of an historic event ! Opting to retire a character many others might have worn out over the long run , David Bowie shocked the world with his closing address : & # 34 ; Not only is it the last show of the tour ... its the last show we 'll ever do ! & # 34 ; A wondrous spectacle of Glam Rock at its finest . David Bowie proved he can rock with the best of them , while treating his audience to an awesome display of lighting , costumes , make-up and Ziggy !	1
This is a wonderful documentary capturing Bowie at his absolute prime musically and creatively . The sound is excellent throughout all the performances . My only complaint is that the limitations of the 16MM film and the lenses they used severely hampered the quality of the images that were captured on stage . Quite often the lenses had issues processing the extreme colors and intensity of the lighting , so what you end up seeing is totally blown out and diffused or even out of focus . Too bad . It would be nice to see them take a better pass at restoration and release this on Bluray . Overall I would recommend for any serious Bowie fan as the music is just too good to pass up . The surround mix is fantastic , clear with a good amount of punch . Worth it just to hear the soundtrack ( which I already owned on CD ) in 5.1 .	1
& quot ; Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars & quot ; takes us back to the height of the Glam Rock movement with David Bowie at his most outrageous in his Ziggy persona . This 1973 concert was filmed in London in what proved to be Bowie 's last performance as the king of androgynous rock and roll . All of the songs you want to hear are on this one -- & quot ; Space Oddity , & quot ; & quot ; Changes , & quot ; & quot ; All the Young Dudes , & quot ; & quot ; Suffragette City & quot ; -- and whatever the limitations of the film and its transfer to DVD , there is something to be said for seeing Bowie do these songs instead of just hearing them on CD . Of course , when he was dolled up as Ziggy Stardust , that was exactly the point . If you have ever enjoyed Bowie , then you want to at least give this film the once over .	1
The film it self is interesting and not very well done to normal standards , but who said David Bowie was normal anyways . He is quite odd and his music is a breakthrough in rock and roll music , because he has his own unique style that inspired many , including Roxy Music , Talking Heads , Alice Cooper , Elton John , Nine Inch Nails and even Marylin Manson and much more . This live concert is pure rock and roll and it rocks the house all night long , I was more in it for the music after I knew what I was in for . Its also great for background music while doing other things , like any other live concert video is for , because even I ca n't sit there watching the crowd flicker for over an hour like watching a good movie , so I just sit back and enjoy the music , because thats what its all about , the music ! David Bowie rocks live and the Spiders were spectacular . This was their last performance together and it is very moving to watch the end and the crowds reaction when he says this is their last show . Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars might have left , but Bowie still remains till this day . Great concert dvd from a even more great artist ! ! Also check out Song Remains the Same ( Zeppelin ) , Live at Pompeii ( Floyd ) , Pulse ( Floyd ) and Gimmee Shelter ( Rolling Stones ) , and basically any other live concert by bands you love , because its awesome seeing them perform live , seeing them in action in front of thousands . In the words of Neil Young , Hey hey my my , rock and roll will never die !	1
This is one cool but dated video . It contains some of the only video of Mick Ronson , deceased , available . It also chronicles the Ziggy Stardust tour which was huge for Bowie in his cross dressing era . It 's really good if you excuse the fact it was shot with less than top of the line gear . It still gives the vibe and I do recommend it to anyone who loves Bowie during this time . This is really some of his best work in a time when many people did n't know what to make of him.Get it , set back , and wonder .	1
Classic film that any 70s Bowie fan would love ! Outstanding jams and solos by Mick Ronson , fantastic , classics songs from Ziggy Stardust , Space Oddity , The Man Who Sold the World , Hunky Dory and Aladdin Sane . Some backstage clips of Bowie changing his incredible outfits . Great sound . Such a gift for Bowie fans ! To be part of the final concert with The Spiders from Mars is such gift ! Thank you ! ! !	1
You remember Ace & Peter , the other two members that were vital in making KISS what it is ! Well , they 're not being interviewed on this video or any other so far . This video receives four stars because of one thing : the classic KISS footage . It is the best in terms of quantity of the 70 's footage available ! The downfall ? You have to wade through lots of interview footage of Gene & Paul blaming Ace & Peter and pretty much everyone else besides themselves for problems with the band . I liked watching this the first couple of times , back when I was naive enough to believe most of it , but now I fast forward through the interviews to get to the make-up footage , which is very cool . Things I got tired of hearing while watching Extreme Close-up are:1 . Hearing Paul say how Ace 's guitar playing stopped `` blossoming '' ( a . Ace 's 1978 Kiss solo LP sold the most copies , b . Like Paul 's playing `` blossomed '' ? , and c. How do you `` blossum '' when your guitar solos are being edited and your allowed 1 to 2 songs an album ? ) 2 . Hearing Gene talk about how Ace created the original KISS logo and then Paul `` refined it '' and how they 're still using `` Paul 's logo '' today - Give me a break , just say Ace created it ! 3 . Hearing how Eric Carr `` buried '' Peter Criss as a drummer . For one , their styles were different , Peter had a funky sound that made songs like `` Parasite '' , `` Hotter than Hell '' , and `` Strange Ways '' groove as hard as they did and Eric Carr had a hard rock style that gave the `` Creatures of the Night '' album and subsequent albums a kick in the butt.4 . In general , hearing how Ace & Peter were basically self destructive losers who wanted to bring down the band and Gene & Paul are drug-free , consumate professionals.The thing I did like : The classic footage , which is worth owning it for.The classic line up ( Ace , Peter , Gene , & Paul ) and the make-up and costumes , etc . are why the group has had any success at all . There success did not start with `` Lick it up '' , `` Asylum '' , or `` Revenge '' , it started with `` Alive ! '' . Their influential period began and for the most part ended when Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were officially out of the band . When people think of KISS , they 're going to think of Ace , Peter , Gene , and Paul . These four are the reason KISS is what it is . There should be a video for Ace & Peter to tell their sides of the KISS story for once . I almost do n't care what is true anymore , just show a different point of view for crying out loud . Buy Extreme Close-up for the footage of KISS in their most influential , exciting , prime : the 1970 's , not for the `` truth '' from Gene & Paul .	1
KISS ' '' Extreme Closeup '' documentary is pretty entertaining . I liked it a lot.As I already mentioned in the headline for this review , it does a good job picking up on where the `` Exposed '' video/DVD left off . You get behind the scenes interviews from mostly Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley talking about the history of the band , the fans and other bands they encountered ( as well as some of the musicians they had hired when Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were no longer with the band ) , and some pretty good and interesting stories . Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer have small parts in this video , but they are to be found in here , and you get to learn interesting stories from when they joined the band and also from when they were kids ( you also get to hear stories like that from Gene and Paul ) so that makes this video another good reason for why you should buy it.I also enjoyed the video footage of KISS in concert from the 70 's and briefly into the 80 's as well as some of the music videos from the 70's,80 's , and two videos off of the `` Revenge '' album ( the videos for `` Unholy '' and `` I Just Wan na '' ) ... however , my biggest complaint with this video is that while it is still very good , some of the footage of KISS live and in concert and some of their music videos are only excerpts ... I know that sometimes bands/video producers have to chop off half of a song , music video , etc . for a video/CD to have more space on either the video or the CD , but WHY did they have to chop off the last few seconds of the music video for `` Let 's Put The X In The Sex '' ? ? ? ! ! ! Overall , a very good documentary , it is a good place to turn if you want to learn more about KISS and see some of their classic music videos and live footage of the band from the 70 's and 80 's , you get to see some pretty cool behind the scenes pictures in this video , and I have one more thing to say : Someone contact Yahoo ! Launch ( if you can , I could n't find an address for them to send in my request ) and tell them to put more KISS videos on there ! ( the ONLY KISS video on that site is the video for `` Psycho Circus '' , a very good video , but KISS fans who use Launch want more than just one KISS video !	1
His rhythms are impeccable . His voice is a smooth & gentle survivor . Get this cd & let it take you away.Also , the deeply heartfelt music on this cd is n't as sappy new age as some other Oryema music . I do n't think `` rock '' applies either -- it sort of does for one song but not for the album as a whole . This is the Geoffrey Oryema cd that feels most essentially meaningful to me . I mean other CD 's by him are great works of art , but THIS ! THIS ! This is amazing ! The true experience of true exile .	1
Great memories of one of the most talented artists of the 1980s . Very creative videos , which brought great memories back . The quality of the VHS is as good as one can get on tape , but from what I 've read , . the DVD version is no cleaner , and was likely not burned from original Masters.well worth it ...	1
GOOD TO KNOW HANK MADE IT TO THIS CONCERT , IN SPIRIT HE WAS THERE , ONLY TEAR IN MY BEER MISSIN ! OTHERWISE GOOD EXCEPT FOR IDIOTIC BREAK IN THE MIDDLE , COMES DRUNK , THEN IN ONE MINUTE HE 'S OK ! THAT 'S NOT PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTION ! THAT PART WHEN HE 'S TAKIN BREAK SHOULD BE DELETED ! ALSO WHEN HE DIED IT 'S FEW MINUTES PASSED MIDNIGHT , ACTUALLY HANK WILLIAMS APPROXIMATE TIME OF DEATH IS AROUND 3AM , NOT 7AM , DEATH CERTIFICATE IS WRONG AS USUAL ! A little after 3:00 AM , Hank dies . Rigamortis set in before 5 AM , some say he was dead for no longer than 3 hours , when he arrived in thehospital at 6:00 AM . The doctor said he could not have been dead up to6 hours . And even if that 's the case , he did not die before 1 AM , January 1 FOR SURE.By calculating the distance traveled from town to town , taking intoaccount his driver 's testimony , it is safe to assume Hank died around or at 3 AMon a lost highway between Bristol and Bluefield.IRONICALLY IT WAS ON HIGHWAY AS HIS SONG SAID ! HE WAS WORKIN ON `` AND DEAR '' SONG ! Hank was buried on January 4th , he was reburied in the early morning on 1.17.1953 , so there is more space for people to visit his grave , also to accomodate future burialsof his family members . It was done in dark to avoid confrontations with always present fans.In 1983 a tribute movie was made : Concert Hank never gave , an impersonator sang23 songs Hank might have performed but in his condition , if he did survive24 more hours , he would no be able to give more than 30 minutes of performance , it was his time to go ! We can be happy he made it to 1953 ! And Dear ... By : ( Hank Williams 12/31/1952-1/1/1953 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- We met , we lived , And dear , we loved.Then came that fatal day ... By : HankThe love that felt so dear , Fades far , far away ! And Dear ... We met , we lived , And dear , we loved.The love that we felt so dear , Fades far , far away . By : L.J.And here dear , have no fear , I want you to listen dear ... .Dear , I want you to hear ... The love that felt so dear , By : L.J.Fades far , far away ! Never again will be so dear , Never again will be so near ! By : L.J . LARY 4/5/2003 , All Rights Reserved ! IT 'S GOOD MOVIE BUT DONT WASTE YO DOUGH ! ALSO THERE ARE 10 SONGS WITH THIS ACTOR SINGING HANK WILLIAMS , HOW HARD WAS IT TO ADD TEAR IN MY BEER ? U CANT HAVE HANK WITHOUT THAT SONG !	1
Bought this because of Kurt Moll . Enjoy listening to his singing . I do n't care for contemporary scenery but this was well done . Manfred Hemm played a great Papageno and Heinz Zednik a good Monostatos . As always Levine was great at conducting and the Met Chorus did a great job . Always enjoy listening to them in other operas . A must for anyone 's collection .	1
It is so obvious from the very start that the designers of this DVD had no idea what the hell they were doing . Using a 'kids ' font for the opening credits ? Rather insulting , and sad that this opera of Mozart 's was n't treated as it deserves.James Levine 's conducting kind of took me by surprise , right from the start . That 's one fast overture , too fast for my taste , overlooking the overture 's melodic power . The counterpoint seems to be undermined as well , and the counterpoint is precisely what makes this overture such a peak in all of history . Levine could have been more sensitive . Of course he seems to think that his way is right , but I just wish no future conductors take his cue . 'Dies bildnis ' comes across as trying-hard , partly because of the stage direction and also because this production 's Tamino does n't blend in with the orchestra all that well.Luciana Serra , who did n't quite nail the Queen of the Night in Colin Davis ' CD , gives a much better performance here . Her voice is more powerful and more accurate . The sets used around the Queen of the Night are the coolest in the production as well.A standout in this DVD is Pamina . Her voice is wonderful , but her poor-me look during Sarastro 's 'In diesen heil'gen hallen ' is kind of ridiculous.I prefer Kurt Moll 's rendition of Sarastro in Colin Davis ' CD ; him being slightly younger then as well may have something to do with that . And if you 're questioning why I insist on comparing this DVD to Colin Davis ' CD , it 's for the simple fact that plenty of the performers in the CD are also featured here.Papageno is supposedly a scene stealer in this DVD . He may be so , but the theatrics of this great work of music are so secondary , I do n't care that he elicits laughs from the audience . Made me smile though .	1
This is by far one of the best operas of all time . And thats to I do n't know who , this is one of the best Zauberflotes around . Araiza is a great Tamino , his voice is batifull and he dos n't shout . Battle is a good Pamina also . The most interesting singers are of course Kurt Moll and Luciana Serra . Kurt 's sarastro is deep and moving , and Luciana 's Queen of the Night is fabulous . Manfred Papageno is well acted and with good voice , something that is not very importanr in that role , but i apreciate it .	1
Everything about this performance is simply brilliant . In general , nothing beats live music performances . Having seen the opera live a few weeks ago , I can safely say this is at least as good as the live performance.Perhaps the greatest performers were the Queen of the Night , Tamino and the orchestra itself . This DVD is truely a gem , and a joy to watch . Highly recomended .	1
A generally enjoyable DVD ! Die Zauberflote , Mozart 's last opera , performed on this disc by the Metropolitan Opera under the direction of James Levine.The cast features such stars as Kathleen Battle ( Pamina ) , Fancisco Araiza ( Tamino ) , Manfred Hemm ( Papageno ) , Kurt Moll ( Sarasto ) , and Luciana Serra as the Queen of the Night . Brian Large , who has vast experience with opera , directs this major work.This opera showcases the voice and acting skills of Kathleen Battle : she is brilliant , beautiful and with a voice that could only be described as a gift . Also noteworthy are the exquisite vocals by Luciana Serra as the Queen of the Night . However , it is Manfred Hemm as Papageno who steals the spotlight : from beginning to end , his funny interpretation of his character ( accompanied by his great voice ) carries this work to its fitting conclusion.The only negative comment ( thus the loss of one star ) was the surreal quality of the sets . Frankly , I thought they were ugly and if anything , detracted from an otherwise stellar performance . Also the overture featured , I felt , a little too much of James Levine : surely , some more shots of the orchestra could have been inserted here somewhere.While The Magic Flute is not my favorite opera by Mozart , this is , all things being considered , an enjoyable performance . Musically , I could honestly recommend this DVD .	1
Thank goodness this one is saved on video . This is Liza at her very best in 1992 singing and dancing . I have been discovering that the live concerts are so much more enjoyable to listen to than the similar audio CDs . The combination of the video and the hi-fi stereo can not be replaced with an audio CD . I especially liked the dancing on this one . A solid 5 stars with no hesitation . Also , there is very little of Liza 's work available on VHS or DVD making this video priceless .	1
For any of you people that consider Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey to be divas , but if it were n't for people like Liza Minnelli there would n't be such a term as diva . She is a perfect definition of what a diva is . She has successfully conquered both the acting and music world . She can sing , dance and is so beautiful . This video recorded live from her Radio City Music Hall performance is absolutely breathtaking it captures everything from that memorable performance : every dance move , every laugh , every note . I was blown away with how wonderful a live show Liza puts on . The songs she sang were creative , inspiring and touching , the girls dancing with her were such talented dancers , and the costumes they wore were so gorgeous . Liza gives such a great live performance , she has never lip synched onstage like some of today 's female pop artists . Girls like that could learn from women like Liza and Liza is the best !	1
Like I said about part I . If your a collector like me . You 'll buy it and enjoy it . If your a few fan . You 'll enjoy it . If your picky . I would n't buy it . Your not going to enjoy it and feel that you should 've gotten more . It 's a documentary , not a concert DVD . So , it 's going to be someone vision of the band . Not yours . I enjoyed it . Could it have been better ? Sure . They always can . Iron Maiden `` Early Years '' is great . This is not as good as that because it 's not done by the band themselves . It 's the Label 's documentary .	1
If you are an Ozzy freak , then I am very sure that you will probably not like much of this DVD.Here are my gripes with Volume 2:1 ) The story is a little inaccurate . I forgot to note in my other review that in Volume 1 , there is absolutely no discussion about Dave Walker filling in for Ozzy before he returned for Never Say Die . That period is virtually non-existent in everyone 's mind.Same thing here for Volume 2 - there is no mention of Geezer Butler temporarily quitting during the work for Heaven and Hell , leaving Geoff Nicholls and Craig Gruber open as candidates for the bass slot.Although they are important , I do n't think that Dave Donato or Ray Gillen are really worth spending elaborate amounts of time on since they only recorded demos with the group ( with Ray touring ) , but the fact that Glenn Hughes is not shown in the opening credits and is barely mentioned is downright criminal . I personally love Seventh Star , so watching the video for No Stranger To Love is fine with me . I think it 's a great song and a great video.Plus there were all of the other numerous line-up changes - do n't forget about Eric Singer , Dave Spitz , Bob Daisley ; etc.2 ) There needs to be full , uninterrupted videos - only on YouTube do they have uncut versions of Neon Knights , Die Young , the uncensored version of Trashed , Zero The Hero and the video for TV Crimes.3 ) Just as the Volume 4 album was not mentioned in the first DVD , why is there no mention of Mob Rules ? I really have mixed feelings about Tony Martin - he has a great voice and he really did an awesome job of singing all of the classics live . Everyone wrote him off as a Dio wanna-be , but there is hardly any similarity between the two . He also wrote a lot of great songs with the band - the only thing is that they are generally stuck between lesser quality songs on each album that he was on . Plus , Geoff 's keyboards are given far too much attention which makes Sabbath sound a little bit lighter and dare I say , fluffier ? I really think that this should 've been the start of Tony Iommi 's solo career because those records ( except for Headless Cross ) are really Sabbath in name only . But I like the video for Feels Good To Me - watching it now , it has a nice retro 90 's feel to it.More interviews with Cozy Powell would 've been nice as well.There really should be a Volume 3 ( maybe even 4 ? ) done next to cover the post-Dio reunion , Cross Purposes , the short lived return of Bill Ward in South America and the nail in the coffin - Forbidden .	1
This is a Story of SABBATH , not a Concert video . Great Interviews with DIO , GILLAN ( very funny segment that explains where SPINAL TAP and Stonehenge originated ) . Fundamentally different to Volume 1 of the set THE BLACK SABBATH STORY ; and yes you DO get 85 Minutes worth of material , just in several slabs . Dio seems to be at his most conciliatory , probably because of the then upcoming De-Humanizer tour . This is a real Gem , and I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD . SABBATH will Hopefully release a Third DVD to cover the period post 1993 . And i hope they do this soon . I would especially Love to see a long interview with Bill Ward , since he has been the most honest , forthright , and consistently appreciable of the band members in talks and other interviews . You will see this in Bill 's spots on this DVD , and it is worth the wait to see Bill on screen , although it is conceivable that Fans who like Volume one will not like the fundamentally different content in Volume 2 .	1
This movie is probably more enjoyable for Pistols fans than for others ; plus Pistols fans will be able to tell when Malcolm McLaren is , er , stretching the truth a bit : & quot ; But my greatest invention was what they called 'the Punk Rock ' & quot ; he hisses from behind a leather S & amp ; M mask in the opening sequence . There 's some sharp , funny stuff here , as many of McLaren 's & quot ; commandments & quot ; for rock'n'roll stardom can be seen today in pop : the cynicisms of executives and marketers who have no real interest in music ; the & quot ; pre-fabricated & quot ; band ; the commodification of rebellion.Thing is , the Sex Pistols were greater than even McLaren could have ever imagined . Compare the cheesy , corny sequences , many with McLaren , to those in which Johnny Rotten is on-screen : Rotten 's intent is so gleefully mad , so mesmerizing and ferocious , that it completely undercuts Malcolm 's prancing about , his art-school theories , and his impresario pretensions . Watching Johnny , Sid , Steve and Paul in rehearsal ( singing & quot ; No Feelings & quot ; ) or in a & quot ; video & quot ; ( & quot ; God Save the Queen & quot ; and & quot ; Pretty Vacant & quot ; ) or live on-stage in Dallas and San Francisco ( their last ever gig ) is a real thrill -- equal parts subversion ( Johnny ) and stupidity ( Sid ) . Really , these are the best parts of the film ... .Except for the classic scenes of Sid Vicious , all filmed less than a year before he died . Here Sid stalks Paris , clad in spiked leathers , engineer boots , and a bright-red swastika T-shirt , mocking the populace and stealing sweets . He kisses a poster of Clint Eastwood . He attacks a prostitute . And later that night he appears to a sell-out crowd , clad in tuxes and ball gowns , and astonishes them with his immortal trashing of & quot ; My Way. & quot ; Wisely , the film ends after that . I mean really , what could have topped it !	1
The production is tawdry compared to the Royal Opera La Traviata . Except for Beverly Sills , the singers are not great stars . But , Sills is as glamorous , as sympathetic , and as heartbreaking as any Violetta . Everyone sings with their heart on their sleeve . Sills is a great Violetta .	1
This production was recorded in 1976 , outdoors at Wolf Trap . Considering the source the images and sound are amazing . In act three , I felt that there was some color distortion and some sound distortion , but in general the filming was incredible , particularly for its time and place . There is little of Beverly Sills 's work available on DVD . This DVD shows clearly her command of the role of Violetta . The production is `` classical '' and nicely done . This might not be the best DVD available of La Traviata , but if you want to see Beverly Sills in one of her iconic roles this is the opportunity to do so .	1
As a fan of GnR I was n't at all disappointed with this DVD . It 's the closest I 'll ever get to seeing the original boys in action and they do rock . This concert was filmed during the Use Your Illusion tour in 1992 and for some strange reason they chose Tokyo as the concert to film . I say this is strange because the crowd is rather subdued and consequently the band seems to be missing that extra energy or spark that they usually seemed to posses at other live performances . Still it 's a great show and the boys give it there all , starting out slow ( ish ) and building to a chaotic climax . It 's great to witness Axl 's strutting and racing up and down the stage all the while screaming with his amazing voice , and Slash hitting the astonishing guitar solos especially the one at the end of Double talkin Jive . They have even tossed in a few short interviews with band members between songs which is good for a laugh.The quality of the video is fine and for a price of 15 dollars this is well worth picking up . It also contains an excellent selection of 15 songs including ; Nightrain , Mr. Brownstone , Live and let die , It 's so easy , Bad obsession , Attitude , Pretty tied up , Welcome to the jungle , Do n't cry , Double talkin jive , Civil war , Wild horses , Patience and November rain.After watching this I found myself thinking with amazement and regret that there will never be another band like Guns N ' Roses ... Sigh .	1
Stuffy is a stuffed bunny given to a little girl one Christmas in the Victorian era . When the little girl comes down with Scarlet Fever , her doctor must insist all her toys and clothes be burned . Luckily , because she loved him so much , Stuffy is saved from the fire by a fairy who looks after well-loved toys and turns them real . Stuffy is given an extra mission , however . It has been decided that he is to be the first Easter Rabbit . Soon , Stuffy is on a trek to Easter Valley , joined by three rabbit misfits , to set up shop in this magical , green location hidden away at the North Pole . But , as the fairy warned him , Stuffy must be cautious . The snow creature known as Zero intends to make Easter Valley like the rest of the North Pole before his first Easter visit can ever take place ! `` The First Easter Rabbit '' is a sweet if unremarkable little animated special from Rankin/Bass , the masters of holiday specials only outdone by the Peanuts gang over the years . The team produced three Easter specials that come to mind , this one being the second , from 1976 . While this story is done in traditional , hand-drawn cel animation , the other two , `` Here Comes Peter Cottontail '' ( 1971 ) and `` The Easter Bunny is Coming to Town '' ( 1977 ) are stop-motion `` Animagic '' ( ala R/B 's famous Rudolph TV special ) and generally seem to be better-known . Personally , I have always been most familiar with `` Here Comes Peter Cottontail '' , probably the best-known of the three , and it is a true favorite of mine . The other two I had never seen until today , Easter 2013 , and in fact , I wo n't have seen Easter Bunny is Coming to Town until after I finish writing this . I 'll probably review that one too.Being that it is traditional animation like Frosty and a few of R/B 's others rather than their highly popular stop-motion animation , it is also shorter , with a runtime of 25 minutes . Unfortunately , that means you do n't get a lot on the DVD . Mine only included a puzzle game as a bonus feature . However , I do not own the `` Deluxe Edition '' , but rather the 3-pack Fun Easter 3-disc set that also includes `` The Easter Bunny is Coming to Town '' and `` Yogi the Easter Bear '' . Unless the deluxe edition includes some extras I do n't know about ( it could be the very same disc in my set though , since I hear it does not have any extras ) , I recommend going for the triple disc set I picked up ( it 's hardly more expensive at all , and it looks and sounds great ) . But , getting back to the program itself ... '' First Easter Rabbit '' has its charm . It 's hosted by Burl Ives in the form of a cartoon rabbit , so right there , you know it 's going to be an enchanting little holiday tale . However , plot-wise , though starting out with a similar plot to `` The Velveteen Rabbit '' , it soon goes into a standard R/B formula of an icy villain trying to stop the festivities and the good guys calling on Santa Claus to save the day . Yes , though I admittedly am a big Rankin/Bass fan , they are always trying to stick Santa in everything ! Even Rudolph gets in on the action for a sec . Those were R/B 's biggest stars , so they seemed timid to do much without them . Or maybe it was just demanded of them to include the pair in everything . Anyway , while the general plot about Easter , the villain ( a combination of Jack Frost , Prof. Hinkle and Winter Warlock ) , and Santa are formulaic R/B , it also has the sub-plot about Stuffy 's relationship with the little girl , which continues to have importance throughout the program . This is what makes this special ... special . It 's sweet and touching , and it also allows for the singing of `` Easter Parade '' , a sequence that does a lot to make this feel like an Easter Special and not Frosty 2 ( er 3 , or ... whatever ) . So , basically , this is a nice Easter offering from Rankin Bass , but I still prefer Peter Cottontail by far ( the original ; I just remembered there was a CGI sequel a few years back ) , and we 'll see how `` Easter Bunny is Coming to Town '' fairs this afternoon . I recommend picking this one up if you 're a big Easter , R/B , or even Santa fan , but I do recommend getting it in the 3 pack I just bought last week .	1
Simply said , Beverly Sills revived this opera which , until she made it into her signature role , had not been sung in NYC for 125 years . This DVD documents not only her amazing voice , but her peerless skills as a true singing actress . I am so glad , and saddened at the same time , that it also stands as a testament to the glory of what was New York City Opera , and that it preserves performances by in-house stars such as John Alexander , Susanne Marsee and Richard Fredricks , along with Julius Rudel 's masterful conducting . I was privileged to see the entire `` Queens trilogy '' several times , and I am sorry there is no filmed record of Sills ' `` Maria Stuarda '' ( which I own with Dame Janet Baker ) or `` Anna Bolena '' ( Nebretko is fine in the role ) . I am proud to own this DVD , and I know you will too .	1
Being a great fan of Beverly Sills , I have listened to all of her recordings . She was a brilliant Violetta ( Traviata ) and a powerful Lucia , but the role of Queen Elizabeth I in Donizetti 's ROBERTO DEVEREUX was , in my opinion , her greatest achievement . This live video performance is gripping . Her singing is superb and her acting is inspired . She IS Elizabeth , in all of her glory and her despair . Many have compared her performance to that of the great Bette Davis as Queen Elizabeth and I would agree with that judgement . This is the paramount performance of Sills ' illustrious career .	1
This DVD , also available on VHS , was filmed in 1975 at the Wolf Trap Festival . Stars the incredible soprano Beverly Sills in the role of Queen Elizabeth I of England , tenor John Alexander as the title hero Roberto Devereux and bass baritone Richard Fredericks as the villainous Duke of Nottingham . The opera is a collector 's treasure of opera and a must have for fans of the diva Beverly Sills . It is undoubtedly her greatest performance . She began to sing the role in 1969 and took the world by storm through the early 70 's , impressive not only for her ability to sing so demanding a vocal role , but also singing all three Tudor Queen operas of Donizetti- Anna Bolena and Maria Stuarda were the other two that preceed Roberto Devereux . In the mid 70 's , the medium of television and film was beginning to reach the opera crowds . Joan Sutherland did it in the 80 's and opera films such as the 1979 Don Giovanni starring Kiri Te Kenawa and Raigero Raimondi was becoming popular . Beverly 's other opera films , taped performances for the Wolf Trap and for the New York City Opera include Jules Massenet 's Manon , which is possibly her second best performance next to this . Also available is Donizetti 's Daughter Of The Regiment sung in English , Rossini 's Barber Of Seville and Verdi 's La Traviata . All worth the purchase.The part of Queen Elizabeth in this opera is as vocally difficult to sing as Norma of Bellini 's opera . Although the part calls for a dramatic , big voice , Sills proved to the world that a light instrument can be trained to dramatic heights . She is on fire as the Queen , all passion , from love in the aria & quot ; L'amor suo & quot ; to coloratura spectacular in & quot ; A Ritorno Qual Ti Spera & quot ; . In Act 2 , her soft romantic side fades as she discovers that Roberto Devereux , the object of her affection , loves another woman , Duchess Sara ( sung by the mezzo soprano Susan Marsee in a superb performance ) . The Duke of Nottingham , previously a friend and loyal supporter of Robert Devereux , become jealous also when he learns of his romantic link with Sara , his arranged wife . He , together with the Queen and the entire court , conclude Act 2 with a fiery ensemble & quot ; Va La Morte & quot ; that totally brings the house down . Beverly Sills is at her strongest in this dramatic act , as she rages in majestic fury and orders his death sentence . In the last part , she regrets her rash decision and attempts to save him , but it 's too late . Devereux is executed and Queen Elizabeth begins to die that very day , as she mourns and laments with bitterness the final arias.This is Beverly Sills at the height of her career . She earned a cover in Time magazine for this performance . She looks back and remembers the Golden Age that this was for singers like her . Currently , recordings of Beverly Sills which have long been LP albums are finally making it into the compact disc market . Available now are & quot ; Beverly Sills The Great Recordings & quot ; , & quot ; The Art Of Beverly Sills & quot ; & quot ; Plaisir D'Amour & quot ; & quot ; Sillsiana & quot ; & quot ; Lucia Di Lammermoor & quot ; & quot ; La Traviata & quot ; & quot ; Manon & quot ; & quot ; Tales Of Hoffman & quot ; & quot ; Barber Of Seville & quot ; & quot ; Rigoletto & quot ; & quot ; L'Assedio Di Corinto & quot ; & quot ; Ballad Of Baby Doe & quot ; & quot ; La Fille Du Regiment & quot ; and the opera in which she sang Cleopatra which launched her career in '64-65 Handel 's Julius Caesar . Check them out . You will fall for the voice of Beverly Sills .	1
While nothing , absolutely nothing , can compete with the original `` This is Spinal Tap '' for comedic genius , this DVD is a brilliant work in it 's own right . While it is true that the majority ( maybe 75 percent or so ) of the film is a live show shot in the Royal Albert Hall in 1992 , there are numerous interludes and links to keep the satire quotient pegged.All in all the music is performed well , but some of the newer materiel falls a bit flat compared to the `` Smell the Glove '' set . Songs like `` Cash on Delivery '' and `` Clam Caravan '' , while vaguely amusing are not up to the normal Tap standards ( although Nigel playing the clarinet is quite a sight ) , and the Rap version of `` Sex Farm '' was just plain annoying . Having said that , there are moments of inspired brilliance here . During `` Stonehenge '' they have the opposite problem they had in the original ... the monument is too huge to get in the theatre . During `` Big Bottom '' all three play basses , which is not only funny to think about , but very funny to actually hear . The guitar pyrotechnics and way over the top soloing of Nigel Tufnel continue in `` Diva Fever '' , a forgettable song without the solo . During this particular solo ( during which Derek takes a cab and gets a huge meal at a restaurant , while David has a cucumber facial and pedicure ) Nigel plays his guitars by throwing horseshoes at them , juggling while playing with his feet , etc.Interspersed with the concert footage are numerous links , most of which are utterly brilliant . We learn that Nigel has invented a folding wine glass ( he still needs the rubber hinges ) , and has founded 'Travel for Animals ' , an organization that allows animals ( in this case his ferret , Trevor ) to travel with their own passport . We learn that Derek goes on his father 's telephone sanitizing service ( 'Sani Phone ' ) business calls with him to help make ends meet , and has invested in not one , but two unbuilt London apartments , the net result of which is that he has to stay in a hotel while in London . David and his wife now work part time at a summer soccer camp in California and she runs 'Potato Republic ' , a store specializing in itchy Irish clothing . Additionally , David and Nigel visit their boyhood home of Squatney , and reminisce . All of these bits are inspired as are the guest spots featuring things like Mel Torme singing `` Big Bottom '' and a member of Primus with a picture of Derek tattooed on his bicep.My only irritant with this DVD is that some of the songs are incorrectly named in the liner notes for some reason ; for instance , `` Big Bottom '' is called `` Bum Cakes '' in the credits . All in all , I think this is a wonderful DVD , and is well worth the money . If you are a true Tap fan , you must own this !	1
This is a fine collection of songs that is very well performed and engineered . The only disappointment is that the DVD ONLY has 17 songs on it . The band had , by this time , released over a dozen albums and there is no way to cover such an expansive body of work without leaving out an immense amount of material . This is also a video that you can play with the grand kids running around .	1
If you love the moody blues this is for you . They 're older but the music is the same . We enjoyed the cd .	1
Moody Blues fans have long enjoyed and admired the group 's unique ability to capture visual imagery in music . In this respect , Live at Red Rocks is a crowning achievement.The beautiful Red Rocks Amphitheater provides a uniquely appropriate setting for the Moodies ' haunting blend of rock melodies and classical accompaniments . The video does an excellent job of incorporating the scenery into the musical flow of the presentation.Several facets of this production are noteworthy . The film masterfully captures the interplay between the band and the audience , long one of the group 's touring trademarks . It also does a wonderful job of documenting the three generation span of Moody Blues enthusiasts , scanning the attendees to reveal middle aged grandparents in casual clothing , twenty-something hippee wannabees , and some fully involved pre-teens , all lost in the rapture of a major Moodies event.Viewers with a good ear will notice that many of the vocals have a slightly strained quality , not sounding quite as good as one might expect from the likes of Hayward , Lodge and Thomas . This is because Justin was fighting a nasty case of laryngitis the night the video was filmed . Even with that disadvantage , the music still manages to be far beyond ordinary.So far as the music , the normal repertoire is here . Standard stage versions of classics like Nights in White Satin , Lovely to See You , Story in Your Eyes and their traditional closer , Ride My SeeSaw are included . A true highlight is a magnificent version of New Horizons , powerfully enhanced by a dynamic orchestral background score.When all is considered , A Night at Red Rocks is a true five-star experience . Do n't miss it !	1
Clocking in with nearly 20 full length songs , this DVD contains the best live recording the Moody Blues have done to date - including the Royal Albert Hall concert . The vocals are much tighter ( it was 10 years ago ) and the orchestra is fantastic . Given that this is recorded in a natural amphitheater adds much more to the Moody Blues emphasis on spiritual/ethereal music.Unfortunately , this is only dolby sound , as surround sound came much later , but it sure beats anything of that time period . Highlights are & quot ; Knights In White Satin & quot ; and & quot ; Question & quot ; . Lighting is perfect and the orchestral introduction and Graeme Edge 's vocal readings are superb ! No typical DVD extras .	1
I recall nearly ten years ago when PBS showed this concert during its financial pledge drives ; using a mono VCR with the incoming signal being plain broadcast , I recorded what I could of the concert on VHS tape and , up until now , that 's the way I 'd always seen/heard it . Well , that old tape is an utter joke compared to the DVD ! ! The concert on DVD was a whole new experience for me and I was blown away with it.Video wise , I was pleasantly surprised at how clear the concert looked overall , given its age and the video technology used back in 1992.Audio wise , I was assuming it would sound comparable to the audio CD and for the most part I was n't let down.Editing wise , I was a little disappointed that some of the song introductions ( by Justin ) were edited out . Of course I understand that the DVD producers did this to save disc time , but I feel that the concert would have flowed a little more smoothly had the intros been left in.But overall , not bad -- not bad at all ! ( I 've seen , on television , the newer concert at the Royal Albert Hall -- and , in my opinion , that concert is n't near what the Red Rocks concert is . ) For those interested , here 's a partial list of my A/V equipment : RCA 20 & quot ; ColorTrax Plus Stereo Monitor/Television ( six years old ) Pioneer VSX-456 Audio/Video Stereo/Dolby Pro Logic Receiver ( five years old ) [ For music DVDs I usually run the receiver -- rated at approximately 100 watts of 5-channel equal power output -- in 2-channel mode with its bass/treble controls turned off = up ] GE ( Digital ) 1105P DVD Player ( two years old ) [ I use the red , white , yellow RCA jacks , which provide analog audio/composite video output , to feed the receiver ; standard three-foot patch cables for audio ; two three-foot gold cables for video -- DVD player to receiver , then receiver to television 's direct video input ] Yamaha NS-A636 & quot ; Natural Sound Home Theater & quot ; speakers ( six years old ) [ The speakers have 8-in woofers , 4-in midranges , 3/4-in ferro-fluid semi-dome tweeters ] 24-foot pair of 18-gauge speaker cables [ of the Radio Shack budget variety ] having pre-installed pin connectors	1
I really enjoy this movie . It brings back so many wonderful memories as a kid . I think it & # 65533 ; s good for children of the eighty & # 65533 ; s and new kids , who can & # 65533 ; t find any thing else great on TV . The Care Bear series really does teach about caring . As corny as that sounds .	1
I 'm having trouble getting the story straight on where the care bear cousins come from . The first movie says they got their tummy symbols after the care bears but the second one says they got it with the care bears . Classic story of good and evil as the warm lovable care bears battle the evil dark heart in hope that they can rescue the other care bears and restore peace to the world . I thought it relied to much on the classic care bear line-up of Tenderheart , Braveheart Lion , Grumpy Bear , Friend Bear , Secret Bear , etc but your little ones wo n't really care and if they like the care bears this is the right movie to get them countless hours of enjoyment .	1
Because my grand daughter , age 2 , saw from the commercial and want to see that so bad . So that 's why I ordered that for her . She is so much interesting and watching the Care Bears . Thank you .	1
At 80 minutes , this version of the oft-maligned Farewell Concert is certainly a better buy than the awful 48-minute original TV version . The extended length is still a mixed blessing , however . While every song presented is now complete except for `` Toad '' and `` Stepping Out , '' there IS more pointless narration by that horrible , self-important English narrator ( with an accent that annoys even deaf people ) insulting rock and roll by calling the electric guitar as a `` noise machine . '' WTF ? I 'm not going to elaborate on the film and sound quality as that has been described to death in earlier reviews , although the quality of the Extended Cut DVD is *somewhat* better than the original DVD , but still rather mediocre.Which brings me to the music . The final 2 Royal Albert Hall shows did n't display Cream at their finest ( that honor would go to the March '68 Fillmore/Winterland shows ) , with mistakes and occaisonal vocal flubs , but the music is certainly damn fine by any standard . To actually see the complete performance of `` Spoonful '' -- regardless of awkward camera angles or excessive close-ups -- is a blessing.The 10-minute-plus performance of this tune is a fascinating glimpse into the minds of Eric , Jack , and Ginger . This is not the best version of `` Spoonful '' they ever played , but this type stream-of-consciousness improvisation stands unequalled in rock ; not even the Grateful Dead could come close to the flights of fancy Cream was capable of . Rather than seem chaotic , meandering , or awkward , the jams Cream whipped up ( pun intended ) were melodic , tight , and VERY energetic . Despite the audible individual characteristics of the three players , the music sounds tightly locked together , as if Eric , Jack and Ginger shared a special musical link . This link was evident even in the group 's first recording sessions in August 1966 ( documented on `` Coffee Song , '' `` Wrapping Paper , '' and `` You Make Me Feel , '' all from the Those Were the Days box set ) , which showed that Cream could play much better after only two months ' rehearsal than most bands that had been together for five years.This link is the reason that Cream is so special in rock music . Forget about those carping critics who complain that Cream 's jams are `` overlong , '' or `` self-indulgent . '' They just either have nothing better to do or just slavishly agree with everything that comes out of the mouths of Dave Marsh and Lester Bangs or any other of the myriad stuck-up morons at Rolling Stone . Cream is where it is truly at , even if this movie is less-than-stellar .	1
Cream - in the brief period of just two years - earned and gained the respect , admiration and countless praises of thousand and thousand people by then . Leonard Bernstein , believe o not , was one of his most fervent hard fans . In my personal case , Cream was one of my top bands between 1968 and 1970 , the others were Steppenwolf , Vanilla Fudge , Doors , Ten years after and Band of Gypsies.Their sound was utterly original , innovative and vibrating . Additionally every one of them was among the top list of virtuosos in every discipline . 100 % creativeness and full inspiration arouse a mesmerizing atmosphere wherever they appeared . `` Farewell Concert '' is a nostalgic documental that revises the most exciting performances of these three young ( by then ) virtuosos . Nine songs were more than enough , Sunshine of your love , White room , Politician , Crossroads , Steppin ' out , Sitting on the top of the world , Spoonful , Toad and I 'm so glad to demonstrate us why they were the most remarkable Rock Trio ever existed.The footage was extremely elemental . There are excessive and obstinate close ups , but despite of this minor flaws , between tracks there are thoughtful reflections of every integrant of this `` Dream Team '' . Jack Bruce ( 27 ) reflections , the brilliantly brief but effective interview with Eric Clapton and finally the monster of drum , Ginger Baker , with an unforgettable solo drums in Toad , make of this document an invaluable document for the posterity that you should not miss it.Curiously Royal Albert Hall was the alpha and omega that unconsciously would prepare them for their monumental reappearance in 2005 .	1
I was a little bit worried that this video quality might be horrible because it 's older , but it 's flawless ! I was able to watch my FAVORITE TV show as a kid with my kids , and in perfect , flawless , streaming and audio format . Thank you , Amazon , for bringing this to me and my girls ! !	1
I especially loved that I could see some footage from the 70 's that I had n't seen in forever . LeonRussell was great in this and Jesse Ed Davis and of course , a very young Clapton , and all the rest .	1
THIS WAS A GREAT LIVE PERFORMANCE BY SO MANY GREAT ARTISTS , ONE PERFORMANCE THAT NEEDS TO BE SEEN IS THAT OF LEON RUSSELL JUST TERIFFIC ! ! !	1
I remember when the original `` Concert For Bangladesh came out on 3 LP discs ( Vynal record albums for the young uns ) . I played them over & over again ... except side 1 . I just could n't appreciate the music of Ravi Shankar ( It just sounded like a lot of noise to me back then ) . I do n't know if it had to do with the aging process , or watching the performance , but the Shankar part is one of the most fascinating parts of the concert . At one point , it almost looks like a duel between Shankar ( on sitar ) , and the sarod player . And the Tabla player is excellent . Had I not SEEN it , I never would have appreciated it . ( I think I 'll take a second look at my Monterey Pop film ) .The sound & picture are clean . The performance ( a real piece of history ) should be in anyones collection .	1
Fascinating . I bought the `` Legacy '' DVD package of all the great Karloff Frankenstein movies last night , and on a whim , rented the Dick Cavett DVD `` Rock Icons # 3 , '' which is a collection of his shows from the '70s that featured great rock artists of the day . Lo and behold on the first show was Elsa Lanchester , the Bride of Frankenstein herself . And the second show -- George Harrison ! Right when he was battling with Capital Records to get Bangladesh out on album ( there was no VHS or DVD , kids , but the film -- the film being reviewed here -- was in the theaters ) . The Cavett DVD is essential Harrison viewing and shows the whole world at a different time , when people were very much trying to figure themselves out , deal with drugs , women 's lib , post-hippie life , etc . The consciousness of every single person in the three shows included on the disc appears a lot more enlightened than we all are now , that 's for sure . And while cavett is a bit of constipated host , he is not too too full of himself and sometimes amusing . He does n't treat women too kindly , so at least we 've come a long way in that department . Anyway , talk shows were far far more civilized then ; none of the glib crap chat that passes for conversation today . These people talked , intelligently and wittily for hours . So , there was George , and he was his usual self and funny and candid , and there was Ravi Shankar , too , playing , of course and joining the conversation , and much of it is about the concert for bangladesh . And they showed an entire clip from the film of George doing the song `` Bangladesh , '' and it just reminded me that this was a long time ago and concert films just were n't up to snuff . Now , mind you , it 's not the deeply distressing herky-jerky MTV type of stuff . The camera stays in one place for the most part , but it is all shot very darkly and there are too many closeups and not enough shots of the band . The music , won the Grammy back then as album of the year , and it is all very , very good , from Leon to Dylan to George and Clapton and badfinger and billy preston , it is all just a joy -- a community of likeminded artists extending the musical vision of all things must pass and bringing their own tangible contributions . When we see the big benefit concerts these days , they trot out one act after another to do their thing , but back in the day , they all actually teamed up and played together -- just like superheroes do in the comics , and in many ways , for a teenager back then , these were the superheroes . Clapton is God , and all that . And , of course , the Beatles . It 's a wonder to revisit Bangladesh any old time and if you saw my review on the old album , I 've been pleading for this remaster and rerelease for years -- and hoping for it since before George died . So , the concert is certainly worth a revisit , but do n't expect a lot from the film . I almost think the album is the better way to go , but it 's worth having both if you can afford it . This is Dylan at a live peak , singing the best he ever had and will in his life ( Harrison did n't even know he would be performing until very late in the game ) and Leon reminds us why he was so big back then -- there is absolute electricity to the duet of `` beware of darkness . '' George , meanwhile , is the best he will ever be live , as his wife Olivia has attested , and Clapton , so low in the hole at the time , is bracing throughout . So much has changed in the world since `` Bangladesh '' and now there is worry everywhere you look . It is nostalgic , to be sure , to look back on this , but the music , so sterling , remains very vital to this day .	1
The 6 stars go to the Dylan set . I recall seeing this in the theatre on a large screen and thought `` finally , some magic . '' 4 stars for what came before that set ... average 5 .	1
The Concert for Bangladesh was shot on 16mm film with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 ( 4:3 ) . When it came time to release it theatrically , it was matted ( which is kind of the opposite of pan-and-scan ) and blown up to 70mm . Reportedly , the theatrical experience was very poor . Pixels were said to be the size of ping pong balls on the screen . That being said , this DVD lavishly presents the concert in the aspect ratio in which it was filmed , nothing is compromised . It was not an uncommon practice in the 60 's and 70 's for film-makers to film in 1.33:1 and then crop out the edges of the composition to make it `` widescreen-shaped . '' The benefit in doing this is that it allowed the director to construct 2 shots , 1 for the theatre ( widescreen ) and 1 for the TV ( full-screen ) , without losing vital information in either version . Stanley Kubrick filmed many of his later films using this technique . In the case of Bangladesh , as most of the shots are perfectly framed for 1.33:1 , it 's doubtful that the widescreen release was something that was planned from the beginning .	1
I was 12 years old when this was originally released on vinyl ( which i still have in excellent condition ) , and loved the record as much today as i did then . when it was first issued on cd quite a few years ago i was waiting for the store to open to get a copy ! now , years later the film is finally released on dvd ! what joy it is to see what i 've listened to for so many years . ( i never saw the film in the theater ) . a great set from a cast of spectacular legends from the music industry . George Harrison , Ringo Starr , Billy Preston , Leon Russell , Eric Clapton , Bob Dylan and a host of others in a spectacular performance for charity , an event that actually started concerts for charity . DVD quality is decent considering this show was shot in 1971 , sound is very good . there are 2 low points for me in this set , but neither to drop my 5 star rating . the first being nearly 17 minutes of Ravi 's performance . ( did they really have to play that long ? ) while the music was intresting , its hard to listen to for that long for me personally , and two , the ommision of Bob Dylan 's Mr.Tamborine Man ! this track was included on the cd and original vinyl versions . On the upside , a couple performances from the afternoon show and rehersals have been added , `` If Not For You , '' `` Come On In My Kitchen , '' and `` Love Minus Zero/No Limit '' on disc 2 of the set . Overall it is wonderful to finally be able to own a piece of history !	1
I was waiting long time to have this DVD edition . I first watched the concert on a VHS tape and the difference , especially the sound , is huge.George is at his best musical shape and the emotional mood is evident.I like the whole program , but is undenyable that 'Awaiting on You All ' , 'Wah-wah ' , 'Beware of Darkness ' 'Bangladesh ' , the number from Billy Preston and the Dylan 's section are highlights.The extra DVD is interesting for giving an extra perspective of what that concert meant in terms of opening people 's eyes , minds and hearts about things happening in our world.P.D . I 'm giving it 5 stars , but the image quality ... I just think they could have done a better job restoring it .	1
If you only ever purchased the original release on VHS `` all those years ago '' , do yourself a favor and purchase this deluxe set . Disc one is amazing and disc two is icing on the cake.I wish all reissues were done this well .	1
The `` Quiet '' Beatle breaks his silence in this magnificent DVD . There are NO complaints here , especially with the deluxe edition of the Concert For Bangladesh . Picture and sound quality are both excellent , considering the 34 years that have past since the concert took place . Head and shoulders above everything else is the stellar performance turned in by George Harrison . Never wanting the spotlight when he was a member of The Beatles , Harrison takes center stage as he leads a cast of gold-star musicians ( some legendary ) in a first of its kind ALL-Star benefit concert . The Concert For Bangladesh is the granddaddy of all the benefit concerts that have come after it . If you do n't own any concert DVDs and are looking to purchase one , this is it . It 's a piece of history that 's been preserved in all of its glory on DVD . Although George passed away in 2001 , his legacy as a great musician and humanitarian is very much alive . The Concert For Bangladesh DVD : A+	1
The Adventures of Superman is a treasured memory from days gone by ! I well remember watching this after running home from school on Channel 4 WTTV owned by Sarkes-Tarzian in Bloomington IN ( also the home to Sammy Terry - Many Pleasant Nightmares Sammy ! ! ) . But since we did n't have color TV until I bought one when I was working at Sears in the mid 1970 's I never knew that about 50 % of the episodes were in color . It 's just a shame that the whole series was n't filmed that way . George Reeves was one of my heroes growing up along with Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.When I feel nostalgic I will play 1 or 2 episodes to pick my spirits up ! I would rate this a very high 8.75 to 9.25 - IF there was a way to watch the whole movie with some/most of the music used in the 2-part TV episodes this would be a perfect 10 out of 10 . This is highly recommended for anyone in their mid 50 's or older as it 's very likely it had been a part of their life ! Who does n't love Superman ?	1
Before `` Superman '' of TV became more and more a `` kid 's show '' , and before it even became a series , there was this movie with Reeves and Coates.This story , of a drilling site discovery just outside the small town of Silby , is so solid that it warrants a movie remake with all the technology and big names available.Interestingly enough , with Phyllis Coates as Lois , there would be very little period adjustment for her character . Before `` Women 's Lib '' and `` Feminism '' in all fields including entertainment , Coates delivered a very strong portrayal , of a no-nonsense , actually somewhat embittered reporter not willing to let her associate Clark do all the heavy lifting : she refuses to hang back at the hotel while Clark investigates the suspicious site in the middle of the night . Of course , this character got `` sweetened '' for the series later shown in color . The early , black-and-white Lois fit the `` smart and sexy '' image of today . She could not be `` in love '' with Superman in the way Noel Neill ( though `` smart and sexy '' in her own apprpoach ) was later in the '50s ; the idea is just hinted at in the '51 enterprise.Amazon reviewers have pointed out the lesser soundtrack used on the original film , but I found it effective . I 'm sure we all agree that the cinematography and special effects are excellent.Interesting to watch George Reeves in this early take . Fans of the TV series will note a drop in energy level by the mid-'50s . Perhaps Reeves though this Super-hero thing would n't affect his progress . ( About two years later he was edited out of `` From Here To Eternity '' , apparently because of the kid-show identification , and one must surmise this took plenty of wind from his artistic sails ) .Footnote : It 's been said that Elvis Presley enjoyed the TV show and I can contemplate Elvis mentally referencing Reeves ' acting when he hit the soundstage .	1
These videos bring back memories of the first time I saw and heard Sade way back when ... This DVD takes you from beginning to sweet end of the sultry smooth lyricist and beautiful backing instrumentals . After watching this , I felt like replay the very next day . I especially enjoyed having the subtitles on to see the words being spoken/sung , not only to sing along , but to appreciate the brilliance of the writing .	1
The CD gives you the sweet sounds of SADE from four CD 's . Great music from a great singer . Ca n't wait until the next CD .	1
This is an old anolog recording redone for DVD so it has some limitations but is still a solid performer . Sade 's music was ahead of its time making listening to these music videos a real treat . Oh how I miss the old days of the MTV when talented music videos were assembled with interest sounds on a daily basis .	1
Aside from absolutely loving this music , I am always enthralled when I watch Sade sing : her look , her voice , her moves ... all so enchanting . I 'd be inclined to give this DVD a 5-star rating , but I ca n't since I 've already seen the `` Sade Live '' disc , which I consider to be virtual perfection in a musical performance DVD . Overall , `` Life Promise Pride Love '' rates a `` 5 '' for music and sound quality , and a `` 3 '' for the videos.THE MUSIC . Timeless and still moving . I dig the songs more now than when they first hit the airwaves back in the 80 's and 90 's . There 's a good balance of hits representing the first four albums : three each from `` Diamond Life '' and `` Promise , '' and four each from `` Stronger Than Pride '' and `` Love Deluxe . '' There 's also a bonus hit , `` By Your Side , '' from the most recent album `` Lovers Rock . '' As Sade fans can well understand , it 's hard to tire of this alluring music , especially in 5.1 ( fantastic ! ) .THE VIDEOS . While this compilation makes a great addition to anyone 's musical DVD library , I have to admit that I was a bit underwhelmed by the outdated storylines and mediocre production quality in several of the videos . No surprise really : the first ten tracks are vintage 80 's productions , with the most common settings being bars , nightclubs and casinos , occasionally frequented by a cast of underworld characters or other mystery men ( whatever ) . As far as I can tell , the videos are ordered chronologically , and both the production value and creativity improve as you keep watching . Most are in color , but the four b/w videos are especially noteworthy for their artistry : `` Never as Good as the First Time , '' `` Nothing Can Come Between Us , '' `` Cherish the Day , '' and `` Feel No Pain . '' Directors Sophie Muller and Brian Ward chalk up the most video credits with five and four , respectively.DVD FEATURES . Nothing extravagant , consisting simply of a discography , biography , and a couple options involving the displaying of lyrics.All things considered , this would be a worthwhile purchase for just about anyone .	1
If this version of MFT was only available on CD , it would certainly be the best version ever ... There 's only some problems with that : although the doco does contain the entirety of Coltrane 's solo after Tyner 's , it does not include the beginning of the performance ... and also , the sound quality is so extremely bad that it almost makes you weep.Still , this is incredible music . Coltrane here breaks so free from the studio version of the piece that one wonders why none of the recorded ( or bootlegged ) versions seem to have this much power ... this is truly an outstanding performance , which we are lucky to have.The visuals are also astoundingly powerful - you can see the strain in Coltrane 's face , and in Elvin Jones ' - drool begins dripping out of the end of the soprano sax , and at one point Coltrane ( deeply into the performance ) accidentally clubs the microphone with it ! The visual details make this performance almost frightening to watch - one wonders what a real live performance of coltrane was like.The other performances on this disc are very fine too - look at the ONLY complete recording of Alabama ( not a single CD version has the whole piece ) and it 's on video too ! There 's a couple of fierce performances of Impressions - one with Eric Dolphy - and a superb Naima.There is finally colour footage of Coltrane at the Newport '65 concert ( New thing at Newport ) which shows the frightening energy of his music making as well as the fact that James Garrison had appalling dress sense ...	1
The picture is excellent . And even though the sound is PCM , it is surprisingly good . Great performances from great artists , and of course all the songs are flawless .	1
Bob Dylan/Various Artists '' 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration '' ( CD & DVD ) ( Sony Legacy , 2014 ) . . . .This four-disc CD/DVD set documents a massive 1992 celeb-fest concert honoring Bob Dylan 's career , with live performances by rock , pop , country and folk stars of the era , as well as numerous old-guard artists who were Dylan 's contemporaries in the '60s . The stage is set by an excellent introductory sequence in which we see Dylan in a career-spanning montage , as well warm testimonials from many of the artists who played at the Madison Square Garden show , and then the concert is presented from start to finish with guitarist G.E . Smith leading the on-stage backing band and splitting emcee duties with Kris Kristofferson and others.How you see these performances will depend largely on how you viewed the music scene of the time , the early '90s representing an era when post-punk `` grunge '' had revitalized rock'n'roll , but the '80s vibe was still strong , as seen by performers such as Tom Petty , John Mellencamp , et . al . One way to view this is as a triumphal last gasp for the hippie-era rock elite : there 's Dylan of course , but he wound up being timeless and immortal , but also Eric Clapton , who was riding high on his own `` Unplugged '' triumphs and Neil Young , who bangs through a couple of classics much to the delight of the crowd and one of the concert 's biggest surprises is how Ron Wood brings the house down with his tight , dynamic version of `` Seven Days , '' crisply summoning the intensity of his youth and showing the young folk how it 's done.Another striking moment comes when Irish singer Sinead O'Connor comes out and is basically booed off the stage , appearing in concert shortly after she publicly criticized the Pope and the Catholic hierarchy for covering up rampant sexual abuse within the Church -- an issue on which she was resoundingly vindicated , two decades later . The instant O'Connor steps on stage , the crowd erupts into an epic battle of fierce cheers and persistent boos . Instead of singing a Dylan song , she defiantly and tearfully barks out a rough version of the adapted Bob Marley song she had sung on Saturday Night Live two weeks earlier that had caused all the controversy in the first place ... One of the few differences between the CD and DVD versions of the `` Bobfest '' concert is her performance : on the CD we hear her in rehearsal , singing `` I Believe In You , '' and the inclusion of concert video is certainly appreciated , though it is a bit jarring to see how quickly the show went on as if nothing had ever happened when one of their fellow performers had been so dramatically confronted by the audience.Dylan fans will dig this one , and students of pop culture will appreciate the snapshot of the rock'n'pop landscape in the early 1990s , whether your opinions run pro or con ... Definitely a document of its time ! ( DJ Joe Sixpack , Slipcue Guide To Country Music )	1
Fun to see the concert as it unfolded . I was dissapointed that the audio is not in 5.1 , for some reason I assumed it would be . Sinead O'Connor loses her cool for some reason and buzz kills the whole Madison Square Gardens , so very unprofessional , she made it about her , and then Kris Kristofferson trys to kiss her ass . I would have deleted the entire section prior to release of this DVD . Johnny Winter is star of show.Buy CD , music is fantastic , DVD ? buy another CD instead .	1
I have this on VHS and enjoy the new release with Great Sound and picture quality . Some of the actual concert is missing for whatever reason ( probably contractual stuff ) but it is almost complete and that is fine with me .	1
ARE WE EVER GON NA GET A DVD OF THIS CONCERT , HOPE IT 'S BEFORE I DIE.I 'VE STILL GOT SOME MORE MILES LEFT BUT ... I WAS SO MUCH YOUNGER THEN - I 'M OLDER THAN THAT NOW.Next buys ; `` Chimes of Freedom '' and `` Old Ideas '' ( New Leonard Cohen ) RIP . Etta James and Johhny Otis .	1
This was packaged very well . It is an excellent remake especially in blue ray technology . It looks like this event just happened yesterday . I would recommend it to anyone . This is the most awesome group of about 24 musicians singing all of Bob Dylan 's most popular songs . I have watched it about 10 times now . I never tire of it . Very well done . I do n't know why I did not know of this event back in 1992 .	1
I had this concert on LaserDisc and I have always felt that Neil Young 's performance of All Along the Watchtower was the standout . However there are many other fine performances including Tom Petty , Willie Nelson , and George Harrison . The songs are all so good , that it would be hard not to enjoy each performance . Some years ago , I obtained a DVD of the concert , but it was not complete . In particular , it did not have the Neil Young performance , so I was very disappointed with it . I am really pleased to have this very complete version in great looking video and great sounding audio . I bought the CD version of this as well . As Neil Young said , & # 34 ; Thanks for having Bobfest ! & # 34 ; .	1
WHat are you guys at SONY waiting to release this title on DVD ? For such `` Powerful '' people , one must think that clearing the path for this should not be such a hard thing.I would pay , any reasonable amount to own this concert on DVD . DO IT !	1
I have both the VHS version of this show , as well as the lazer disc edition , and watched it live on HBO . I rank this mega-super-star event right up there with Woodstock and Live Aid as one of the best concerts of all time . The line-up was all A-list including Stevie Wonder , Johnny Cash and June , Lou Reed , Neil Young , Johnny Winter , Tom Petty , Roger McGuinn , just to name a few , and a mega rare appearance by George Harrison performing two songs and participating in others . It will be interesting to see if they restore George 's & # 34 ; lost & # 34 ; song in the show . His version of & # 34 ; if Not For You & # 34 ; was not included in the commercial VHS or Lazer Disc release of the show . This concert also includes some lesser-known acts ( at the time ) including Tracy Chapman , Roseanne Cash , and a truly haunting version of & # 34 ; Masters of War & # 34 ; by Eddie Vedder . All indications are that this is a first-class release in terms of the video and audio sourcing . G.E . Smith who provided the Music Director and guitar duties for the show will hopefully sound better than ever .	1
This footage was out of print for some time . I owned it on VHS and now am privileged to own it on Bluray . I am one happy man . Such a collection of artists coming out to help celebrate the Poet Laureate of our generation . I wish it were longer but you take what you can get and in this case I am very happy..	1
I have waited to write my review of Star ! but I now have the wherewithal to do so . This movie was a flop-twice . Then why is it so interesting ? I know 'bad ' movies such as `` Wild Women of Wongo '' but that was n't a big studio production . This is different . This was the time of the death knell for movie musicals . I love movie musicals , but the times were changing in the late 60 's . When The Sound of Music was made , this erosion was just starting . Also , when Blake Edwards became involved with Julie , he wanted her to play less `` innocent '' roles . This certainly could pose as one . Andrews plays Gerturde Lawrence , a `` star '' who was much more well-known in England as she was in the U.S . I 'm a little up in arms as to why this movie was called `` Star '' . So this movie gives one an interesting look at the British Music Hall as well as the Algonquin theater in New York . I really like the cockney lingo here , although I wonder if it is accurate because of the criticism given the screenplay . The best part of the film are the musical numbers , which my favorite is `` Limehouse Blues '' which is almost done in pantomime , as the music of Limehouse Blues gets adapted in many different guises until it is tragic at the end . This sequence should be in movie history . The next best part is the relationship between Gertie and Noel Coward ( maybe it should be called that , but Noel Coward was still alive ) . Having collected a sizable amount of Noel Coward recordings on CD it is interesting to see parts of his stage plays recreated . After all of the relationships with men that she has in the film , the most memorable is with Noel Coward , and that is on a friendship and professional level . Dramatics are provided more from Gertie herself , who tends to want to steal scenes from her stars so her own career can increase . She also has a propensity to not deal with her monetary affairs very well . She finally has a roadblock in the guise of Kurt Weill , whose play `` Lady in the Dark '' she stars in . Her almost husband brings her to a club where it seems that the act that is being presented gives her the inspiration . But we do n't see the act ! What is it ? Soon afterwards , we see the infamous `` Jenny '' sequence which makes one wonder if they have overstuffed their coffers . Still , a very intersting sequence considering that you hardly see `` Lady In The Dark '' in the theater . Everything is big , big , big ! Perhaps its this excessiveness that hurts the film . Still , for me this film has many magical moments that makes one love the remote control , so we can make our own version . The DVD is stuffed with extras-on side two we have some documentaries and also a written history of the film . The commentary is very thorough-with comments by Wise , Daniel Massey , and other colloborators . I wish this could be done with other 'flops ' too . Time has a way to bring movies into a different light , and I think that `` Star '' is worth more than it was back then . Too bad that the monetary losses can not be recouped with DVD sales . So help out and buy the DVD already !	1
STAR ! is a remarkable showcase for the very versatile performer , Julie Andrews . She has never in her career looked or sounded better . Her remarkable singing voice is at it 's peak , and for someone who does n't think of herself as a dancer , the Cyd-Charisse-style numbers come off beautiful , as do the many quirky Vaudeville numbers . She 's draped in more than a hundred elegant , haute-coture costumes and dripping with Cartier jewelry . Clearly the intent is to really show this performer off , and it does . And yet , the best bits are scenes of quiet , intimate conversations , and simple rehearsal presentations of songs . `` Someone To Watch Over Me '' and the sublime `` My Ship '' are given minimalist presnetation , and yet Julie Andrews gives riveting performances : It shows us that underneath the glitz and glamour is an talented performer with a very potent stage presence.As for her acting , she brings a very complex , difficult character to life quite vividly . Andrews is a bit genteel ( as one would expect ) , but in a way that 's what makes the whole thing work : A person who is n't utterly charming , would never get away with some of the outrageous things her character does . As the film progresses , she becomes more and more demanding , self-centered and egotistical until she 's spun completely out of control , and Andrews presents this quite well . I take exception Robert Horton 's official Editorial Review for Amazon : `` Its social message -- independent Lawrence just needed a man to boss her around '' completely misses the point . Richard Crenna plays the one man who 's willing to look past her raving primadonna persona . In fact , he assigns himself the task of busting her ego , which by this point is tremendous . If there 's a `` message '' here , it 's that a person could easily wreck herself if she is n't firmly grounded in reality . It 's rediculous to pooh-pooh this , but indulge Doris Day movies which are far more sexist . ( Does Amazon not want to sell this movie ? ) Speaking of indulgence ... As with many films of this period , this movie takes a slow , leasurely pace . It does n't present a tightly woven story ; it 's episodic . Even so , it 's delightful to watch in small doses like a mini-series . It 's nearly three hours long , but four sittings of about 45 minutes each works well.This movie takes full advantage of the 70mm widescreen presentation . The environments are expansive , the locations impressive . There are enormous Broadway theatres , massive Manhattan hotels , British palaces , and an estate on the French Riviera . The colors progress from the sepia tone of the seedy Music Halls , to the vivid candy-box colors of the 1960s big movie musicals when presenting Broadway numbers some of which are downright garish and frankly bizarre . There are long takes and medium-to-long angles shots . It 's a style we 're not used to seeing anymore , but works well to present the backstage life and on-stage presentations.A nice clean print was transcribed to the DVD , but it 's a tiny bit spooty , and slightly yellow : not enough to be annoying , just not quite upt to modern HD standards of quality . As a `` forgotten film '' we ca n't expect to ever see a good digital clean-up . Barring that , this is as good as it gets . It 's a lovely presentation of a visually impressive film .	1
Wow what a film ... . But as a biography is falls short on information about Gertie . However ; as a Julie Andrews-extravaganza it is pure GOLD ! Her timing and talent is beyond Poppins , Maria Von Trapp and Victor/Victoria : - ) ) ) ) 7/10/2005 : When it comes to her PERFORMANCE as an ACTRESS , Miss Andrews is full of the Andrews cliches ... the high pitch voice and talking much too fast ... Examples are the tennis-scene with Pamela in which she does a horrible overacting as she falls to the ground . Yes she leans to the over-familar Andrews-mannerisms much too often ... .She is a comic and over the years has proved time and time again that she is out of her league when attempting dramatic turns ... .A classic it ain ` t , but some sequences do compell , but compared to the Limehouse Blues-number in ZIEGFELD FOLLIES and the 1 in STAR , you will sadly realise - that MGM it is not ... ..But `` Burlington Bertie '' , `` Jenny '' and `` The Physician '' stick to my mind as Andrews at her best as entertainer .	1
For years this film was said to be bomb . It 's an interesting mix of musical numbers and acting scenes . As the film goes on , the dramatic scenes get better . A treasure for any musical buff and for Julie Andrews fans .	1
I did n't know what to expect of the movie , which is kind of old but I must say on first looking at it , I wanted to watch it all the way to the end ( 3 hours later ) because it was such an entertaining movie ! It is great g-rated entertainment , the kind they rarely make these days . Julie Andrews will wow you with her versatility as an actress on full display in this movie and the other actors also put on fine performances . Some people may be slightly put off by the long overture at the beginning but that 's why you have a skip button on the remote ! Other than that this is a really wonderful story , that deserves as many accolades as that famous movie about a governess that Julie did sometime before this one ( The Sound of Music ! ) and I 'm a little confused as to why it is not as well known . Do buy the DVD because it is packed with bonus features , pictures and interesting behind-the-scenes stories and shots . This dvd is a pleaser that can entertain the entire family .	1
George and Ira Gershwin wrote , in my opinion , the finest American opera of the last century . It is supremely melodic , intensely dramatic , provides at least eight first-rate roles for performers and ( having seen the opera at least four other times in other productions ) experiencing it , in this gorgeous Trevor Nunn production , is a treat I did not ever expect to see.First , the cast : Every single person in the huge company can sing and act . But special mention must go to Willard White ( Porgy ) -- a proud , strong , handsome man who projects his love and spirituality and his life as an outsider in his actions and wonderful baritone voice . Cynthia Haymon , is a gorgeous Bess . Her first scenes as Crown 's drunk , addicted , whore/lover are performed beautifully -- then her 'redemption ' as Porgy 's lover is wonderful to see and hear . Her lovely , strong soprano voice , her movements , her acting all change before our eyes . Gregg Baker is the perfect Crown . Not only is he a commanding singer , he is a commanding presence : big , powerfully built and extremely handsome . It is quite obvious how he could be both sexually exciting and absolutely frightening to Bess and all the other characters . Damon Evans is superb as Sporting Life the one character who depends more on acting than classical singing . This is not to say that Evans can not sing . He does wonderfully with his two numbers which are , granted , more musical comedy-inspired than opera-inspired . And his acting could not possibly be bettered.The production by theatre-director Trevor Nunn ( `` Les Miserables , '' among countless others ) is thoughtful and true to the creators ' intentions . With his designers he has built a `` Catfish Row '' that is filled with heat , intensity , comedy , drama and , ultimately , tragedy . His staging of the orchestral prelude is the best , most interesting I 've seen . The camera peeks into the lives of these ordinary people who depend on extremely hard work and few pleasures to exist . Several moments have stayed with me long after my first viewing : a first act fight in which Crown violently kills another character ( Robbins ) with a cotton hook , staged and filmed so realistically that one would think these were stunt people and not opera singers ; performances by all of the few white people in the cast ( Mr. Archdale & the Undertaker , for example ) in which they do not 'talk down ' to the African American characters ( as I 've seen in several other productions ) but talk simply man to man ; the way that the camera is tight on Bess 's unbelieving face when Porgy silently ( through the music ) offers her his room to hide in when everyone else has turned her away ; another close up : this time on Sporting Life watching the crippled Porgy summon the strength to kill Crown with his bare hands . And finally toward the end of the opera , when Sporting Life seduces Bess with drugs and his fantasy tale of what New York City will mean to her.The London Philharmonic brilliantly led by Sir Simon Rattle is perfect in both the operatic and jazz sections . This is an altogether satisfying , majestic production both musically and dramatically.I have read almost all of the other reviews for this DVD and , honestly , do not understand the overwhelming longing to see the Otto Preminger movie . Poitier and Dandridge were not opera singers and the Gershwins wrote an OPERA . This means that the two title characters would have to be dubbed by other singers or , if they did their own singing ( and I , honestly , have no idea if they did or did n't ) they would have to compromise this extraordinary music.It is true that the syncing of lips and music is not always on target . This bothered me terribly at first , but then I found so much to love and admire about this production that it made little difference to me . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .	1
`` Porgy & Bess '' is George Gershwin 's masterpiece and one of the 10 greatest operas ever written ( see my list on Amazon ) . For a long time ( and even now ... Leonard Maltin 's review , e.g . ) condescendingly called a `` folk opera '' ( translation : `` the Met wo n't do it '' ) . Bollocks . True , Gershwin himself used the term , probably an attempt to slip it into acceptance through the back door . It 's not only one of the grandest of grand operas , it 's the ultimate verismo opera , outshining anything from Italy.Porgy was first performed in 1935 . It only slowly gained acceptance , mostly because of racial prejudice . However , if Porgy itself were racist , as claimed by some cretinous looneys , the establishment would have had it performed all over . A version of Porgy , severely chopped by about half , was filmed in 1959 . In 1976 , a complete performance was mounted by the Houston Grand Opera . The Met premiere followed in 1985 . No film recording of either has ever been released . In 1993 Simon Rattle recorded a performance on outside sets ( the actual singing provided - as in many films - by lip-synch . This is the current DVD . In 2002 a revival of the Houston version was recorded at the Lincoln Center , but not yet released . The appearance of the 1959 film is held up by difficulties with the Gershwin family.Added note : a number of low-rating reviews on this site seem to believe that the 1959 hack-job film is the `` original '' or `` real '' Porgy and Bess . Hearty-har-har . Come on , people ; try to get the facts before sticking your feet in your faces . The `` original '' or `` real '' Porgy was on stage in 1935 and is twice as long as the deeply mutilated version filmed in 1959.Of these versions , Houston 's is the best . The 1959 version was savagely hacked but had some first-rate performances . I 've not seen the Lincoln Center offering . Rattle 's disc is very , very good.Rattle had a fundamental and creative understanding of the jazz idiom . If anyone harbors the misconception that Porgy is a light-weight work , Rattle will put quits to it . ( Compare , for instance , Gershwin 's storm with those of earlier opera masters such as Rossini or Wagner : he stands with them as at least an equal . ) Porgy is here well staged . The sets are a masterful recreation of a poor fishing village in 1930s South Carolina . Much of the singing and of the sparse dialogue are lip-synched . This is a common procedure in Hollywood , but these performers , though well-rehearsed , are just not as experienced as American actors . The result is the occasional mismatch . No biggie . The outdoor staging allows some extra perks , such as taking us outside into the storm when Crown goes in search of Clara . The performance , however , is incomplete . Rattle makes the traditional cut ( which Houston restores ) of the poignant Buzzard Song in Act II . As a great bonus , this is n't the usual stand-up-and-sing performance in which , during big arias , everyone else stands there and tries to vanish into the scenery.Rattle 's cast is first-rate . Porgy is Willard White , a classically trained singer with a commanding stage presence and bass-baritone voice . When this man threatens to take Sportin ' Life apart , or to kill Crown , we know he can do it . In the 1959 film , Poitier 's excellent Porgy still has a more limited range and is n't as dominant on-scene . His singing voice is that of Robert McFerrin Sr. , father of the better-known Bobby McFerrin . McFerrin 's voice is fine for the part , and he sings with intelligence and art ; however , he 's not quite as authoritative as White.Bess is Cynthia Haymon , a classically trained soprano who is as much at home with Monteverdi or Puccini as with Gershwin . If anyone is Bess , she is , to the nines . Her face is not only beautiful , it is interesting and enormously expressive . Her singing is poignant and her performance riveting . In the 1959 film , Dorothy Dandridge is equally attractive and expressive . Her singing voice is that of Adele Addison , a classically trained soprano who mastered many styles from Baroque forward , but was particularly associated with 20th-Century composers such as Foss , Poulenc , and Bernstein . Her performance is perhaps a little less ravishing than Haymon 's , but nonetheless first-rate . There is a wide-spread opinion that Dandridge should have been allowed to do her own singing . True : an `` opera '' voice was substituted for an idiomatic voice.The rle of Sportin ' Life is in some ways absolutely central to a successful Porgy . He is a refreshing contrast to the almost oppressive religiosity in Catfish Row . He drives or helps to drive , much of the action ; he is central to the opera 's ending . Rattle 's Sportin ' Life is Damon Evans , a classically trained singer whose range of venues has been enormous - including a stint as Lionel Jefferson in `` The Jeffersons '' . In the 1959 film , Sportin ' Life was Sammy Davis Jr. , the biggest talent in the show . Davis ' Sportin ' Life wheedles and cajoles , a siren at the gates of Hel* . Evans ' Sportin ' Life croons and beguiles , oiling the downhill slide . It 's hard to decide which of them is the greatest Tempter . Both give fabulous performances . ( * `` Hel '' is the correct Nordic spelling . The double `` ll '' is merely a Christian affectation . ) In Rattle 's version . Crown is portrayed by Gregg Baker , a classically trained baritone who has appeared only twice on film . His voice is clear and honest , and his acting is appropriately vigorous . He makes an imposing and convincing Crown . The 1959 Crown was Brock Peters , an actor with over a hundred film appearances to his name - in 1959 his only previous appearance had been in `` Carmen Jones '' . Baker is a more effective and menacing Crown , although Peters ' performance is excellent.I ca n't recommend this DVD too highly . It 's a tribute to Gershwin 's genius and a genuinely involving performance . As an added bonus , the English subtitles are the actual libretto ! And the good tunes never end.An added bit of trivia : in 1959 2 uncredited bit parts were performed by Nichelle Nichols and Maya Angelou .	1
I was told @ the Woodruff Arts Center that if I like the production they were putting on in 2006 I should see Porgy & Bess . Yes , it did take me this long to see it . I loved it as I was told I would . I ca n't wait to share it now w/my Family & Friends . My only regret is that I did not see it sooner !	1
I give this DVD 5 Stars because ... Its Prince ! It has a great selection of music videos and shows the timeline of Prince 's talent and performance ! MUST BUY !	1
Prince is one of my all time favorite artist . These videos take you back to a time when music was starting to evolve . Great assortment of some of his best videos .	1
I first saw this film in 1981 on a late night cable show called Night Flight on the USA cable network.Ever since that moment i have been mesmerized by this concert.The acoustic set was awesome and when they went electric it was mind blowing.I never knew Neil Young could rock this hard.This dvd should be purchased the company that released it did an incredible job.The picture and the sound is perfect.I wish all dvd companies would put this much care in 70s concerts on dvd.This one is a 100 % masterpiece !	1
Thanks to Neil Young and this great concert ! Growing up I was never a big Neil Young fan . I was more into the `` heavier '' side of rock . BUT ! ... after viewing this concert and seeing Neil and Crazy Horse kickin ' out the jams ... I became a instant fan.This show has diversity ! ... It starts out `` un-plugged '' ... then the giant Fender amps come out , along with Crazy Horse , and play some great music . It 's billed as a `` Concert Fantasy '' and that is true . I also like the roadeyes ( roadies ) who run about durning the show . I 've read that NY was the first to use wireless microphones ... remember this was in 1978.I only wish the film quality was a little better . Sometimes it 's a little grainy in spots like a old movie , but despite that it 's a great rock and roll show.You ca n't go wrong with Rust Never Sleeps.Buy it ! ... .buy it now !	1
This is the best Neil I 've ever seen on film , ( or video ) . Songs range from the innocent , reflective , acoustic & quot ; Sugar Mountain & quot ; to the semi punk / seminal grunge of & quot ; Sedan Delivery & quot ; . Why is n't it on DVD ? !	1
We are in the process of collecting a lot of concerts and this concert sounds great and gets one into the music and proformance . Very great buy and a very low price , as well . You will not be sorry that you bought this dvd concert .	1
Yes , it might very well be . If not the best , it 's among the top 5 . I love this album and the DVD makes it that much better . It is not without small flaws with the all the Road-Eye monkeying around in between songs , and some of it is noisy but it is a literal take on a concert film - you see the entire concert as if you were there , delays and all . I just fast forward through those parts . This is Neil Young as his absolute best and that I pure genius .	1
I recently saw Dianne Reeves in concert . During her show she talked about how Sarah 's voice inspired her to sing . She told the story of how she met Sarah before a show and did n't realize it was her because everyone kept calling her & quot ; Sassy & quot ; . After leaving that incredible performance I became even more curious about & quot ; Sass & quot ; and her legacy.I enjoyed this video tremendously . Like the previous reviews stated , it is filled with performances from her early years to later . Other greats of jazz and close friends ( Joe Williams , Billy Eckstein , fellow musicians , etc ) speak candidly about her as a friend and artist . Her mother and daughter also give insight to her life ( her self-image woes ) as well as refreshing antecdotes ( the apollo experience and her & quot ; sailor 's tongue & quot ; ) The performances are breathtaking . Sarah Vaughan did n't just sing . She SANG . Her voice was an instrument and it is truly amazing to listen to her on songs like & quot ; Summertime & quot ; , & quot ; Misty & quot ; and & quot ; Send In the Clowns & quot ; She had style , grace and a presence all her own . Sarah Vaughan commanded attention and mesmorized audiences in every performance.I recommend this video for anyone who wants to learn about one of the greats of music . Sarah Vaughan : The Divine One is a wonderous glimpse into the life of a jazz jewel , whose music still sparkles.Peace . CLB .	1
Really good stuff on this Santana video !	1
I like this disk better than Supernatural . When I got the Supernatural disk , I wished for a DVD that would feature the stuff that made ma a fan for ( HOLY-MOLY ) almost 40 years . You do n't have to be a hard-core fan to like this disk . It is well done , sound is wonderful , the up close shots made me feel like I had an on-stage pass .	1
Although it 's only 2 channel , the uncompressed track sounds pretty good . This is probably the only good sounding classic Santana disc out there . The picture quality , at 480 , is lousy at best.But then it 's the music that counts anyway .	1
For all Santana fans , This DVD is a must buy one . Here you can hear and see Carlos and his band at their best . The concert is performed at Mexico , the native country of Santana.The audience was extremely great . They love him and enjoy his music , and they deserve a star to their own , for making the DVD incredibly alive . Santana is the best for all those long years , and it 's strange how he 's atracting all those different generations with different tastes . Also his GREAT keyboardist Chester Thompson is unbelievable.The only drawback of this DVD is the audio , which is set at the Dolby 2.0 format ( only 2 channels ) .	1
An excellent video . This includes Carlos on site at the pyramids and throughout Mexico City.In one jam Carlos tunes into the Doors and plays a melody , which must be his spirtual contact with Morrison ( the doors also played Mexico City ) . This video has a transcendance to indio days because of religious prayerful speeches of Carlos concerning Bob Marley . It is better buy than the El Salvador cd and as good as Moonflower , Abraxas , or marathon .	1
After almost ten ( ! ) years , this video from the band 's 1993 World Tour remains the definitive statement of Dream Theater in concert . I have converted countless unbelievers into the DT camp by simply inviting them over and popping this masterpiece on . This illicits the same response EVERY time : & quot ; Who ARE these guys ? Wow. & quot ; LIT is an awesome experience in many ways . First , it was the first chance many of us had to see the band live-something many of us would have killed for in 1992/93 ( some still will ! ) . I have seen Dream Theater twice and can attest that they are awesome live . I have owned all of their videos , DVD 's , tons of imports and traded tapes . But nothing released since this video has captivated my attention in the same way.Secondly , the song selection , comprising songs from the first two releases plus a few as-of-yet unrecorded beauties ( a pre-AWAKE version of & quot ; The Mirror & quot ; will give you chills ) make this supremely enjoyable.Third , the musicians themselves are outstanding , but you already knew that . The band sounds great-really tight-better than on the & quot ; Once in a LiveTime & quot ; video . The mixing by the japanese engineers is very good.Fourth , John Petrucci 's STAGGERING guitar solo . Wow . I must have watched it a couple hundred times ... Fifth , the videos included for & quot ; Take The Time & quot ; , & amp ; & quot ; Another Day & quot ; .Sixth and finally , the way the band stretches out at the end of & quot ; Take The Time & quot ; . Amazing . Of course you do get spandex pants and ridiculous hair to boot ( mostly due to Portnoy and LaBrie ) .An essential video . ( p.s . where 's the dvd ? )	1
The line above is about as true a & quot ; one-word review & quot ; as I could give . The band gave a fantastic live performance . Lovely video ... I never tire of seeing it . These guys are musical virtuosity to the maximum . Definitely worth a loooooong look..heheh .	1
To James LaBrie - stop running across the stage ! It seems that whenever the band takes an instrumental section , which , as any Dream Theater fan knows , happens quite often , the singer finds himself at a loss . Many of the high-angle shots reveal a confused-looking LaBrie jogging from one end of the stage to another , a gesture that winds up just being funny , but not so much ha-ha funny.With that in mind , this tape comes from a time when Dream Theater , not yet sure of its niche but seeing an opening in the mainstream due to the success of Pull Me Under , was in search of rock stardom ( and stage presence ) . Despite the sometimes laughable ways in which their hopes and youthful energies are manifested , the band is clearly fired up and puts on an excellent performance here . LaBrie 's vocals are fantastic , especially taken by comparison to more recent live recordings . As for the rest of the band , what can I say ? They 're Dream Theater - virtuosic as always.Aside from the live concert that it documents , Live in Tokyo also shows a few early music videos . Of these , only Pull Me Under ever made it to the air . The direction is a bit cheesy and the sets are even cheesier , but once again it shows a band that had energy and was aiming high . The scenes in Tokyo also show a side of the band that , while covered often , are well worth seeing again . Here we see 5 long-haired guys walking around joking about condoms . It 's always cool to watch them just be goofy and screw around - reminds me of my own friends and humanizes a band that has such phenomenal talent that they seem godlike at times.All told , this video offers a look at a band that deserves to be phenomenally successful at a time when it looked like they very well could be . Today , while successful amongst their market , Dream Theater no longer sees such opportunity . They came just a hair too late ( pardon the pun ) as 80's-style metal was pushed out by the plaid-shirted grunge crowd.However , if you wish to see the band in a more mature form , with far more intense skill , I recommend the Metropolis 2000 DVD or tape . At least LaBrie found out what to do with himself.Recommended for Dream Theater fans for its look at the early life of the band , with a caveat - if you do n't like seeing LaBrie look a little dumb , steer clear .	1
Nearly anything MJ had a hand in making is worth having ; therefore , for those die hard fans , this is great ! Made and edited my Michael , this is the true spirit in which he wanted his fans to see him . Always the perfectionist , he worked tirelessly to make sure his fans were n't disappointed . The only posthumous ( after death ) Film or story that Michael would bless is & # 34 ; This Is It & # 34 ; ; also sold by the seller . Kenny Ortega produced and directed many things with Michael , as his respected friend.The Dangerous Films are classic and will never get old .	1
This is a great dvd with a few disappointing short films . Remember the Time , Jam , Black and White and Keep it in the Closet are great videos . Keep it in the Closet has to be one of the sexiest videos ever made . The black panther dance at the end of Black and White is one of the greatest interpretative dances ever . I was disappointed that MJ gave into critics and painted racist slogans on the car and store windows to explain his breaking glass . His interpretation of a panther 's sexuality and violence does not need an explanation . I liked Will You Be There and Dangerous . It is too bad MJ never did a short film for Dangerous . It is a great song and deserves better than concert clips.On the other hand , Gone to Soon is a too sweet memorial to Ryan White . Unfortunately most people wo n't know who he was . I was disappointed in Give Into Me . This is another version of Dirty Diana . But I think Give Into Me is a better song and hoped for a better film . Who Is It ? , another great song is turned into a slick , pointless spy story . The video does n't come close to the dark lyrics.Heal the World makes 2 appearances . I never saw the original Super Bowl show but this version seems very short.The behind the scenes clips are interesting and worth the cost of the dvd.I think this is worth the cost and the great short films more than make up for the not so great films .	1
I thorougly enojoyed those DVD.I was pleasantly surprised to see his old Pepsi commercial here where he is singing with a younger version of hisself.I also liked the behind the scenes look at his videos and how they came about.R.I.P to the best that ever did it .	1
Michael Jackson - one of the most musically talented entertainers . I 'm happy to have this DVD in my collection . Full versions of his `` films '' which are otherwise difficult to find . Love this DVD .	1
At first watch , this disk is a little confusing . Packed with more of Jackson 's shameless self-promotion , it made me wonder why that was needed ? Because in this set of songs , Jackson is talking about being a victim , and showing victims of prejudice . Now I think Jackson took so much crap from the public and media during his career , he had to learn how to promote his own work and efforts to overcome that and continue to be the success he was , and is . ( His own campaigning reminds me a little of President Obama 's campaigning efforts , if the truth be known . ) The flip-side of this DVD is that it shows how the videos were made , some behind the scenes fun . Some of this is self-promotion again ; some of it is MJ giving you a glimpse into his world.I was a little thrown-off by the carnivalesque imagery with Dangerous ; however there is some great symbolism here , much of it corresponding to ancient Egypt ... Some of it corresponding to the innate wisdom of being young . One has to keep in mind that even at an early age , Michael Jackson was world-traveled and someone who witnessed a lot of what was going on with our planet and us , as human beings.Black or White opens the set . At the beginning it shows , perhaps , rebellion is a healthy way to get free of some things that keep us down ... Even inviting us to look at the rebellious spirit of children , in order to understand our own pain and hopelessness ( thus the dark dancing sequence of Michael 's at the end ) . Are we a little higher in our intelligence than animals ? That might be a question to ask when watching the morphing sequences of human faces . At the end of the video , MJ states `` prejudice is ignorance '' . What is the difference between stupidity ( like a kooky Simpson 's cartoon ) and ignorance ? Stupidity does not have access to information and tools - like music , languages , the arts . Stupidity is like living in the dark because one does n't know how to use a light-switch . Ignorance refuses to gain access to those tools ; in it 's stubbornness and need to be `` right '' , ignorance becomes a form of prejudice . I think MJ is also asking , how much of our ignorance is projected on us by the media ? Super-Bowl Heal the World - I thought these pieces were very emotional , colorful and powerful , especially with the participation of the children ( many who are in their 30 's by now ) . Love it ! Remember the Time - just a fun song and dance number with Egyptian themes and fantasy , like a magical dream or reminiscing about the possibilities of past lives.Will You Be There - another very powerful performance , with more footage from the Super Bowl gathering . A prayerful song for the spirit of the child , Jackson is saying many go to war and act-out with righteousness because they were wounded as children . He would be one to know ! In The Closet - erotic and frustrating ; MJ comes across a sort of dancing Pinocchio when it comes to actualizing his desires in real life . Better to have a super-model do that for him ? Gone Too Soon - with an intro and montages featuring a young boy talking about discrimination , someone who died from AIDS , this one is dedicated to sick and orphaned children , and children with AIDS.Jam - Jam is basically saying life is very confusing , like a game ; we 've got to learn how to take advantage of every day of our lives , because life is short . Featuring artists of the time - Kris-Kross and Heavy D , I love the beat with the jingling bells , interspersed with more kids dancing , playing and jumping rope ( as if it is the children that keep life going here ) .Heal The World - seeing this performed live brings tears to my eyes . It was important to Jackson to make videos , he said , because these would outlast the actual concert performances , leaving images behind which would stay with people 's minds . Once you see this video , you will want to learn the song and sing it to a few people you care about ( and even some you dislike ) .Give In To Me - interesting rock performance piece . Jackson was multi-talented , and did some scat-singing in this video which reminded me a lot of George Benson 's approach to rockin'.Sets are interspersed in here with a video montage of Jackson sitting at the piano , playing and singing to himself `` I 'll Be There '' , with footage of himself from childhood , harmonizing . Just lovely ! Who Is It - another romantic piece about loss and betrayal ; slick filming ; seems more personal and autobiographical.Dangerous & Why You Wan na Trip On Me ? - The energy of the two pieces as they blend into to one another seem to say , instead of looking for what 's good and what 's right , why do we tend to look for trouble ? Our natural curiosity as children are lost in hopelessness and cynicism . That 's the real danger , is it not ?	1
Exactly as it 's titled - the greatest hits and then some . Great performance , although the up-tempo version of 'Magic ' is like a knife through my heart . Had to skip over that but others may ( probably will ) like it . He sure seems to have fun performing it .	1
Barry Manilow is the BEST of the BEST ! This man puts his heart and soul into everything he does . He continues to amaze ! This concert , recorded in 1993 in England , is fabulous . Can anyone sing a ballard better than Barry ! It 's 2006 and he just had the # 1 CD , '' Songs of the Fifties '' . MANILOW - SIMPLY AWESOME ! !	1
I have a ton of videos , and the biggest critics are my kids who watch them . This is one of the few videos they always go back to . There is n't a dull moment , and at the end you 're left wanting more ! That 's probably why they usually watch it SEVERAL times in a row .	1
I enjoyed seeing It 's Arbor Day , Charlie Brown again as I am a very big fan of Vince Guarldi 's music . In the `` Arbor Day '' program you could tell he was making some definite changes in some of the character and scene interpretations in the newly composed music for this film . A must keepsake for Guarldi fans as this was his last work for Peanuts before he died .	1
What can I say ? It 's Charlie Brown ! Always good , clean fun that almost always leaves you feeling good inside . Another good moral lesson that everyone should listen to .	1
This classic story is as cute as ever on DVD and it comes with a bonus special ... It 's Arbor Day Charlie Brown ... which is also really cute and perfect to watch in the spring . Buy and enjoy !	1
Even cynical Lucy van Pelt ca n't help liking this ... especially since she 's got the starring role ! Just kidding . Oops ! Do n't slug me , Lucy ! The scene in which the mall already has Christmas decorations fits perfectly with the over-commercialization of Christmas addressed in `` A Charlie Brown Christmas . '' And this was 1974 before department stores refused to say Merry Christmas.There is n't much mention of Jesus Christ that I recall considering Linus ' recitation during the Christmas special . Easter is the celebration of the Resurrection . That said , this is still a classic .	1
Does this one still even pop up on TV ? If not it should because after the classic Christmas and Halloween Peanuts specials this one is the next based . Made in 1974 it has every bit of the charm and laughs as those other specials and it 's too bad that it does n't get more notoriety . They really do not make them like this anymore.This special is much like `` It 's the Great Pumpkin , Charlie Brown '' in that we again have the ever hopeful Linus , trying to convince the rest of the gang that the Easter Beagle will arrive on Easter Morning to give eggs the kids . None of the gang are buying it however and they are all off having their own problems . Peppermint Patty is trying to teach Marcie to color eggs , much to Patty 's frustration , Sally has to get some new shoes at the mall , Snoopy wants to get a new bird cage for Woodstock , and Charlie Brown is discouraged to see the stores already advertising for Christmas at Easter time.This DVD comes with a bonus Peanuts special , `` It 's Arbor Day , Charlie Brown '' . I guess they were pretty much scraping the bottom of the barrel when they made this one in 1976 . It 's not bad mind you , but who celebrates Arbor Day ? While researching a report on Arbor Day , Sally enlists the gang to turn Charlie Brown 's ball field into a garden and orchard , complete with a tree on the pitcher 's mound and scarecrow in the outfield.Good Peanuts fun !	1
This is certainly a performance to rank as a great encore , a tribute to the genius of iron maiden . As a true fan of Bruce Dickinson , I was amazed at the way he could sing so many of their anthems in a way that made them seem brand new . Only Adrian was missing . The real downside of this video was the & quot ; magic & quot ; show , it really cheapened what was a great performance by the band . I was particularly intrigued by the performance of Jannick Gers , who I had n't seen live previously . Although not the absolute classic lineup , this is worthy to be called a collector 's item .	1
& quot ; Baby you can drive my car ... & quot ; I wish I could drive your car , Paul ! ! I love Paul and this video brings out some of the greatest songs ever , like & quot ; Hope of Deliverence , & quot ; & quot ; C'Mon People , & quot ; & quot ; Drive My Car , & quot ; and & quot ; Lady Madonna. & quot ; The cleverly edited version of 3-4 different concerts does n't bother me ; I was impressed that they could edit it that well . What did distract me , however , was the frequent transition from black/white to color . Why would a 1993 concert tour even be filmed in black/white in the first place ? Anyway , the music on this tape is wonderful , and remembers well what a great person McCartney really was .	1
'The Last Unicorn ' , that has a big star cast , including Mia Farrow , Jeff Bridges , and more is like 'Secret Of NIMH ' not like any other typical and sweet animated movies from the 80 's like 'My Little Pony ' , it 's a dark , mystical and philosophical tale for the elder kids about The Last Unicorn that is taking out on a dramatic journey with a young wizard , and the beautyful , but tough Molly.If you are grown tired of typical Disney movies with cute animals that sings and dance all the time , then buy the more serious toned 'The Last Unicorn ' , you wo n't be dissapointed !	1
This is an excellent movie for everyone . I first saw it in highschool and was enchanted then and am just as so now . It has beautiful music , great acting , and is funny and serious . When I feel down in this ugly hum drum world of mondainity I pop This wonderful fantasy in the VCR and escape for a while . A good intriguing story . Rankin and Bass are always good . The animation/drawing to some may not seem the best but it is appropriate for this fantasy and is very pretty . A good fantasy anime for the whole family .	1
I saw this movie when I was young , and never forgot it ! Even though I 'm not a big fan of animated movies , the storyline , music and lessons of this visually-enchanted movie makes for one excellent tale ! Unicorn lovers and Fantasy Movie lovers , see this one if you have n't already !	1
Like so many people here ( more than I expected ) , this early 1980s film ( regardless of some animation flaws -- I still find its unique art intriguing ) The Last Unicorn is also my all-time favorite movie ( and I 'm a 20 year-old straight male originally from Idaho ! ! ) . It is poetic , the music composed beautifully , the storyline enthralling and the animation effects more than decent . The Last Unicorn is presented here on DVD but the original VHS version at the time of its initial release and during the 90s is best , as it is the original format the movie was presented in . Beautiful , in every aspect , and recommended for ALL .	1
I love this movie . I loved it when I was little , and I still love it . I remember always having my parents rent it for me when we went to the video store , and then taping it off TV for me . You can imagine how devastated I was when some accidently taped over it.I knew when I started collecting DVDs that I simply had to have this movie on DVD , but alas It had not been released . Until now . I got positively giddy when heard it was going to be released on DVD . Waves of nostalgia hit me . I pictured various scenes from the movie and all those childhood senses hit me : Wonder , amazement , empathy , and even sadness . This movie was very powerful.It is so hard to put into words the emotions I feel when watching this film . It is beyond all animated features that have come along since , and I think it has to do with the mystical nature of it : a lone Unicorn searches the world for others of her kind . On the way she meets a witch , a novice magician , an adventurous thief , a handsome young prince , and his father who is the key to the unicorns disapearence . Then of course there is the Red Bull , a powerful bull surround literally in flames.I highly recomend this for people of all ages . And parents should buy this movie for their children . They will love it the way I did and still do . I also highly recommend the book THE LAST UNICORN by Peter S. Beagle , which this movie is based on .	1
I bought this for my fiance as well as the IDW deluxe graphic novel . We went to a special event , met Peter Beagle , and watched the movie on the big screen . It was pretty cool .	1
ABOUT TIME `` The Last Unicorn '' is released on DVD this is way long overdue.FanS of such movies as the Lord Of The RingS triology will also love this movie.For even though it starts like the children 's movie that it is said to be.But after first 10 minutes or so it gets very much in same line as Lord Of The RingS..In matter of fact the `` bull '' in this movie resembles a lot the demon that is battled in one scene of the 1ST Lord of the Rings Movie..So grownups do n't be weary of this movie.It is for all ages.With a soundtrack by the classic band AMERICA..Long before Elton John did `` Lion King '' or Phil Collins did `` Brother Bear '' or Bryan Adams did `` Spirit '' .There was America doing the music for this movie.This is just one of the best Fantasy filmS of all time..And it takes a soon to be released live action remake to get this out on dvd.Which is what i been hopeful about..This movie is very special to me coz this was one of my beloved Mandy 's favorite movies ( Mandy was KILLED by a drunk driver in 1997.STOP DUI ) .So buy this movie watch it as a family and be captivated by the Magical Mystical Wonder that is the Last Unicorn.And i am sure that you too will add to one of your favorite movies.And FanS of Lord Of The RingS watch this Tolkien-esque tale.If could choose more then 5 stars this would be a lot more not enough stars to exspress the greatness and brillance of this Fantasy Film Classic	1
Totally forgot Jeff & # 34 ; The Dude & # 34 ; Bridges was in this , as well as Mia Farrow ! Great classic film from a time when CGI films just did n't exist . Slightly inappropriate for children ( ironically ) . My 6 year old was not happy to see the Romani witch murdered by the 3-breasted ( yes , you see them ) winged creature .	1
Excellent fantasy-story not only for children but also for adults . We hear the voices of great talents like Angela Lansbury , Mia Farrow and Christopher Lee . The music and the main song is performed by America and the result is so fine . Enjoy it one and once again .	1
One of the best cartoon movies of the 80s . If you have a child or want to go back to your days as a child , then this wonderful cartoon will bring back those golden moments . Also , if your pagan , this is one of the better movies on the list ! ... Highly recommended !	1
I remember watching this film as a child ( whether is was renting it , owning it , or seeing it on the Disney Channel ) and it 's one of those old classics that has managed to reappear in my movie library . I had the beat up VHS copy last and I 've recently given it the upgrade it deserved ( especially after the VHS mysteriously disapeared when I wasn ; t home ... seriously , that did happen and it sucked ! But back to my review ) and I have to hand it to you ... The picture : MUCH clearer ( and wider too ) , the colors : As BRIGHT and RICH as ever , and the sound : Good old America , CA N'T GET ANY BETTER than that ! So there 's my review , but the re-release becuase A . ) It was recent and B . ) You 'll love it ! !	1
The movie is great . A Blu-Ray version is better ! Unfortunately , it 's not glorious-but-not-angel's-singing-earth-shatteringly-glorious . From the opening scenes you can still see grain and what looks like cel damage . I do n't fault the transfer necessarily , but in a perfect world there would 've been work put into repairing some of the damage done throughout the years . We have the technology ; we CAN rebuild it . ; o ) I have n't watched the extras yet . I assume it 's the usual fare , but in case they exceed or fall far short , I may revise this . All in all : five stars for the flick ( kids may get scared at some of this imagery , but it 's a great film and story ! ) and three stars for the BD transfer .	1
Excellent job of getting the book just right ! I love this movie and thinkit has become a cult classic ! It followed the book very well . I thinkPeter S. Beagle wrote this novel ( sp ? ) and I know he was very satisfiedwith the way it was produced !	1
Absolutely great film . I watched this as a small child and loved it . Through the years I was growing up I lost the title of it but still vividly recalled the scenes . Now as an adult I finally got a chance to see it again and can safely say that it is more satsifying to me than it was as a child . A must see !	1
4.5* I love Peter S. Beagle 's works , especially `` The Last Unicorn '' , `` Tamsin '' , and `` A Fine and Private Place '' . I watched this a long time ago , and remember loving the story , and today I was finally able to share it with my 5-year-old daughter . In the screen adaptation ( the screenplay was also written by Peter S. Beagle ) , Mia Farrow plays the Last Unicorn who inadvertently learns that she is the last of her kind . Curious to discover the fate that has befallen the rest of the unicorns , the last unicorn learns from a Butterfly ( Robert Klein ) that an entity known as the Red Bull has herded the unicorns to the ends of the earth . Unfortunately , she finds herself captured by the witch Mommy Fortuna ( Angela Lansbury ) as part of the witch 's Midnight Carnival . The unicorn is able to escape with the help of a novice magician Schmendrick ( Alan Arkin ) and proceeds to the seaside castle of King Haggard ( Christopher Lee ) and meets the dreaded Red Bull , a fire elemental , but is once again saved by Schmendrick when she is transformed by his magic into a mortal woman , Lady Amalthea . Here is where Amalthea's/the last unicorn 's quest gets really interesting and complicated , for it is at the castle of King Haggard that Amalthea meets and eventually falls in love with Haggard 's adopted son , Prince Lir ( Jeff Bridges ) .The rest of this magical story explores what happens to Amalthea and Lir , will their mortal love survive the revelation of Amalthea 's true identity , and will Amalthea fulfill her real quest to find the rest of the unicorns , and defeat the evil Red Bull ? The story itself is magical , but what makes it compelling are the various themes explored , regarding friendship , self-discovery , faith , courage , love , and mortality . The anime ( Japanese animation ) is beautiful , and I will always consider this a classic . The songs are also melodious and meaningful . Highly recommended , though I would advise caution for the under-5s since there are some scary depictions in this movie .	1
No offense to anybody , but the Otis-Melvin-Ron-Richard-Dennis lineup is my favorite one ( yes , even more than the original 5 ! ) ; Ron and Richard are SO great , and this is one of the best DvDs ever ! I watch this DvD at least once a day ; ) a MUST-buy !	1
This DVD has just the basics of Elvis ' excellent 1968 special . If you want an in-depth presentation , you should get the 2 DVD Deluxe edition . This DVD includes nearly all of the footage of the original show . Elvis ' performances are outstanding , especially the `` informal '' jam session , where Elvis actually plays his guitar instead of just using it as a prop ! Elvis ' informal jam session was an early precursor of the MTV Unplugged series that would follow more than 20 years later . The bonus material includes some outtakes and photos , but really does not add much to the set . This DVD should be enough for the average fan and it is available at a reasonable price . Hardcore fans will want the deluxe edition .	1
There 's not much more to say that has n't already been said about the 68 Comeback Special , but it really makes me sad to see how he was in this Special compared to how he was in his last few concerts . He was so sexy , charismatic , funny , and mesmerizing on this dvd.. I could n't take my eyes off him the whole time I was watching it ! His voice is so raw and sexy and I wish I could 've been there in the audience . There wil never be anyone like Elvis and it 's nice to be able to watch him whenver you want on this deluxe dvd edition .	1
Elvis the King Of Rock N Roll and live music . Great DVD , awesome sound quality and picture and an awesome set list . Long Live The KING !	1
Okay , this is a 5 star special . Any Elvis Presley fans will want to own Elvis ' 1968 TV special , and most probably already have it on VHS . The question is ... .is the DVD worth purchasing ? To start , the DVD is not complete . Evidently , there was some issue about the rights to & quot ; Are you lonesome tonight ? & quot ; so this song is NOT to be found on the DVD . Other from that , I did n't find anything missing from the DVD . The picture quality is a little soft , a little grainy , and looks like the show was recorded on videotape . Of course , all of this is how the special looked in the first place , so it 's not a big deal . In fact , given the limitations of TV broadcasts back in the 60s , the picture quality is acceptable . The soundtrack has the original mono soundtrack . There is also a 5.1 dolby digital remix which sounds good but is maybe a little bass-heavy . Young fans weaned on ultra-glossy DVDs of recent films may be disappointed with the picture/sound quality , but those of us who grew up on Elvis will absolutely love the DVD , which is pretty much the best the special has looked and sounded . The main issue is whether or not to purchase this particular edition ... .or wait and hope that a future second edition will contain the deleted song . It 's a toss-up . Personally , I am happy I bought the DVD and I will probably listen to it quite often ! Other than the special itself , there is little else on the DVD . There is a website link-up and a small slide show . That 's it . I would have liked a subtitles option ( who would n't want to sing along with Elvis ? ) . Or how about some outtakes ? So , given the incompleteness of the DVD , I can only rate the DVD 4 stars , although the special itself is 5 stars.One last thing - this is obviously a 1960s product . The production numbers have a surreal , almost psychedelic quality to them . Elvis himself is in superb voice , and he delivers a performance that cements his image as the king of rock and roll . But Elvis fans already know this . To the uninitiated , there is probably no better way to see the King at the height of his powers as in this special ! Recommended !	1
This set is beautiful . Very well done and if you want to see Elvis Presley at his best this is the dvd to buy . Here he shows the world that he could still rock after he returned from the army and leaving the movies . He performs here with his original musicians and plays the guitar . Here he rocks , and for a while he returned to his roots and sang Gospel Music dancing to it with a group of dancers , dress in beautiful suits . At the closing of this dvds he sings the historic song IF Y CAN DREAM , dress in a beautiful white suit , same song that he sang with Celine Deon later on , when the technology put them together . This set is a most for any Elvis fan , but for the ones that really one to see the talent that this man had .	1
Where to begin ? This is the Elvis I fell in love with . He is hot , talented , gorgeous ... he 's Elvis ! Every song in here is a classic , and he rocks every one as only as HE can.No matter what your taste in music , you have to recognize the outrageous raw talent that this man had .	1
Watched this many years ago and it still thrills me to see Elvis at his most intimate live appearance . He has such a rapport with the audience and is having an obviously good time . In my opinion nothing will ever be as great as this performance was . I could watch this three times a day and not tire of it .	1
I was unable to attend any of Elvis '' s concerts . This was almost like being there . Elvis was so relaxed and engaging with His audience.Worth every penny.Everything added with the concert was just a + . Loved it .	1
What a handsome comeback Elvis makes in 68 . He was the best . His songs will forever live for many many years . Order this and enjoy every second of it . There is one part that will have you laughing . One of his background singers removes some lint ( from his many fans who love to wipe off his sweat ) , he then hands it over to one of the fans . She was SUPER EXCITED OVER THEM . Elvis laughs and says `` Wonders never seize to amaze me '' . You will love this .	1
hey im 26 but i dig elvis he had an amazing voice and was a great song writer and piano player he was cool before the word cool in 1968 the king returned to take back his crown from the beatles this sets awesome you see an older wiser elvis on top of his game theres so many cool moment like women going crazy cause elvis tosses his scarf you really see a legend performing like sinatra or marylin monroe elvis was a real star and no singer today has the voice he did	1
This arrived quickly and in perfect condition . Be sure to review the special features . It 's a great gift to youself to have `` If I Can Dream '' - the 1968 powerhouse finale , in your home .	1
This is one of the best , if not THE best , Music Specials everpresented on TV . Everyone knows the story of the King 's 1968Comeback from `` Bland Land '' , and this show brought him backwith a vengeance ! I for one am thrilled to have it at anaffordable price . One of the reviews here ( from a total Elviscompletist , I assume ) is knocking BMG for rehashing so muchof Elvis ' stuff , but not everyone can afford to ( or WANTS to ) spend 40 or 50 bucks every time they make a purchase . I saybravo , Elvis ! Thanks for the `` Memories '' , Big Boss Man ! ! !	1
After years and years of making movies and largely neglecting his musical career , Elvis did this TV comeback special in 1968 . The success of this show rejuvinated Elvis , and within a year he had recorded `` The Memphis Album '' ( also recommended ) which included `` In The Ghetto '' and `` Suspicious Minds '' .The TV special reunited him with his original 50 's band for the intimate small stage set . He is seated and singing some of those classic Sun records `` Thats Alright Mama '' being perhaps the best known . Then , dressed in black leather he is backed ( out of sight ) by a bigger band and here Elvis is in rocking form , tearing up the stage with fabulous performances of Jailhouse Rock , Heartbreak Hotel and many others . During the remainder of the show a full band and Orchestra back him , together with additional dancers and large sets . The show ends with a breathtaking version of `` If I Can Dream '' , which remains my favourite Elvis performance of all time.This 'special edition ' has a few humourous outtakes and some stills , but really its the main film your buying it for . If you want a proper special edition buy the 3 disc edition . If you 've never really understood what made Elvis so great , buy this DVD and you will .	1
This speacial was so much fun to watch that I actually enjoyed all of the extra footage . It shows what it takes to make a show as unforgettable as this . This is an Elvis fan must have and a music or entertainment fan should have .	1
Elvis is at his very best in this concert . You have to see it for yourself and you 'll love it .	1
First , I must say that the video looks fantastic , and the sound is far above what we 've heard from the 68 Singer Special in the past . Cheers to EPE for a very professional , if somewhat bloated , package . Gee , I do n't think I 'll ever really watch Disc three . What I WOULD have enjoyed is hearing the commentary tracks that EPE reportedly recorded in 2003 with Scotty Moore and DJ Fontana for the sit-down segments . What happened to that track ? ? ? Why is it that EPE just ca n't quite complete these projects ? Maybe it 's so they can release yet ANOTHER super special edition in the next format that comes down the pike.At any rate , this is somewhat overpriced ( I blame EPE , not Amazon ) , but the first disc is definitely a treat . Not to be missed .	1
This is absolutely the most incendiary performance of U2 ever captured on tape , with the most imaginative and grandiose staging , and it 's a crime that it 's not yet on DVD . As the years go by it becomes ever more of a historical and social document , one that needs to be in digital soon !	1
This is U2 at their best . If you are a big U2 fan like I am you must own this video . A theatrical performance by Bono and the band in Sydney that features many songs from their Zooropa and Achtung Baby albums , among others.One of the few if not the only times you will see/hear songs like & quot ; The Fly , & quot ; & quot ; Daddy 's Gon na Pay , & quot ; and a full version of & quot ; Lemon , & quot ; and & quot ; Zoo Station. & quot ; Not only do they play these live rareties , they sound great.During & quot ; Mysterious Ways , & quot ; ( the best live version I 've ever heard ) you can get a glimpse of Edge 's wife who belly dances on stage during the song and toys with Bono.This is an energized concert with the band at their best , putting a lot into the show for a large crowd and the many photographers and cameras.Taking place in what is probably my favorite era of U2 music , this concert is one of the great recorded rock musical films in history ... right up there with & quot ; The Wall , & quot ; The Song Remains The Same , & quot ; and even & quot ; Tommy & quot ; among other films.The music covers the entire history of the band up until that point in the early 90 's and is performed with such a flair and passion that it makes for a cinematic experience U2 fans wo n't soon forget.I can only hope they release a DVD version in the future , although it is available on laser disc .	1
What a great concert ! Pity I wasn able to see u2 in concert during zoo tv . This is a must-have for any major fan . Excellent live rendtions of the anthemic & quot ; bullet the blue sky & quot ; ( which features one of the best edge guitar solos ever heard ) , & quot ; pride & quot ; . Bono 's theatrical mode is in full swing as he starts off with Zoo Station and the first songs in character as The Fly with those very cool sunglasses and ends the concert with the surreal Mephisto . Also worth mentioning is the special live fx which went into & quot ; where the streets have no name & quot ; with fire encircling Bono all around . Various fx are added to the video to enchance the quality but it fails . unecessary zooms , strobe effects and slow mos are a big no no . This concer delivers and delivers well .	1
Simply put - this is U2 's best performance available on video or DVD ( and that includes the recent 'Elevation ' DVD ) .The performance is impeccable . Also , having seen U2 twice on the 1992-1993 tour , once in the early 1992 indoors and once 6 months later outdoors , I can say that the mindblowing ZooTV tour got better when it went outdoors - more screens , more Tribants , more content , and more songs . This show is one of the last on the tour , and unlike the U.S. shows , features tracks from 'Zooropa ' ( 1993 ) . By the end of the tour , the set , the lights , and the images had been even better constructed than any U2 show has ever been - the barrage of video sayings accompanying `` The Fly '' , the appropriation of the handicam in `` Even Better Than the Real Thing '' , the live belly-dancer during `` Mysterious Ways '' , the junkie pantomime on `` Running to Stand Still '' , the uniforms on `` Daddy 's Gon na Pay for Your Crashed Car '' , and the final dance during `` Love Is Blindness '' . And nowhere is the line between U2 in the 1980s and U2 in the 1990s so symbolically portrayed as when Bono-as-MacPhisto removes his devil 's horns as the techno-drenched `` Lemon '' fades into a minimalist interpretion of `` With or Without You '' .This is required viewing for even the passing U2 fan . My only question is where is the DVD .	1
Live events are rough to review . With the exception of MTV Unplugged events and the Eagle 's Hell Freezes Over tour , the amount of outstanding reviews are far anf few between . The music will make you sign , but it probably has more to do with the love in your heart from when you first feel in love with the Cranberries . Great band !	1
I wanted to own a DVD of live Cranberries and that is what I got . It is enjoyable , but could have been done better . I hope they come out with something higher quality before they call it quits . If you like the Cranberries this is worth having .	1
This is a must have for any Cranfan ! ! ! Certain songs sound even better live , like & quot ; Wanted & quot ; and & quot ; Dreams & quot ; ! ! For those who are n't familiar with the Cranberries , the band is nothing fancy ... .no backup dancers , pythons , or other gimmicks ... .they do n't need to be . They 've got these great songs and the singer actually SINGS ! ! ! That 's what their live show is all about , MUSIC , SINGING , and it ROCKS ! Seems hard to believe in the days of Britney Spears , but it actually is possible to hold an audience simply by singing/playing an instrument if you 've got TALENT for singing/playing an instrument ! The Cranberries also do the ultra rare & quot ; So Cold In Ireland & quot ; . The camera and sound are excellent , better than the front row ! Get this now ! Dolores even does a cute little jig during & quot ; Liar & quot ; .	1
I have a 2-yr-old who is a big fan of Elmo , and this tape is packed with all Elmo , all the time . This is a good thing because when we 're watching other Sesame Street segments where other characters are featured without Elmo , he just runs around distraught saying , `` Elmo ... Elmo ... Elmoooo ... ... '' Oh boy . Here 's hoping this tape outlasts his obsession .	1
NOthing more to say other than if you or your child loves ELMO , they 're gon na enjoy this DVD . My 3 yr old loves it .	1
My son is a huge Elmo fan , so this DVD can give him his Elmo `` fix '' . He likes the other Sesame Street DVDs , but he always wants more of his favorite character . This one is all Elmo , all the time.It is a cute story of Elmo trying to pick a picture for the monster art show . As he 's sharing his pictures with his Sesame Street friends he recalls the memories . It has some fun songs and teaches about various things . It 's a fun video for Elmo fans .	1
My daughter loved this video ; it even gre on me . This is a great collection of stories with Elmo ( and some stars ) woven into a larger story that kids will enjoy.Our daughter loves to dance to the songs in the video and is oblivious to her surroundings when this is playing .	1
We have a whole collection of DVDs from the Sesame Street collection , and this one is a compilation of some of better Elmo segments . My only complaint is the short running time .	1
I love him ! He 's always so annoyed and fed up with things . A bit like me ! ! nd I smiled . But I laughed more.The `` chemistry '' between Charlie and Peppermint Patty is one to see . And Marcie saying stuff like , `` Stop holding my hand , Charlie Brown . '' and other things to fire Patty up ! And the grandma and teachers speaking in the , `` Wo Wo Wo Wo '' language provides a few laughs also ! I loved it . I laughed so hard when Patty was disappointed with the `` meal '' that Snoopy prepared for everyone . `` Popcorn ? Buttered toast ! ! ? Where are the mashed potatoes ? ? ? ! `` There are fewer cartoons as good as this here.5+ stars.Love ya , Charlie Brown ! ! & lt ; 3	1
This one is right up there with the Christmas and Halloween offerings -- a perfect Peanuts outing . Some of the details ( like the toast , pretzels , and jellybean fare prepared by Chef Snoopy ) were stuck in my memory from when I saw this on TV as a child . And it 's fun to watch Charlie Brown 's fecklessness in the face of Peppermint Patty 's pushy self-invitation . Many of the details of this one are nostalgic for me ( like the kids climbing into the jumper seats in the back of the station wagon ) , so I was glad to share it with my own kids , who love it .	1
For some reason , `` A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving '' has a case of middle-child syndrome -- people always think of the Christmas special or the Halloween special , but not the Thanksgiving one . That 's too bad , because the this little holiday special has a certain low-key charm , as Charlie Brown once again gets in over his head while Snoopy wrestles with deck chairs.Charlie Brown is -- of course -- depressed about the upcoming holiday . He 's also planning to go with his family to his grandmother 's house , as you 'd expect . But then Peppermint Patty calls him , and ends up inviting herself , Marcie , and Franklin to a Thanksgiving dinner ... at HIS house . Poor `` Chuck '' does n't have a prayer of fending her off.So Charlie Brown 's friends agree to help out with an early Thanksgiving feast , along with the culinary skills of Woodstock and Snoopy . But with a ping-pong dinner table and a main course ( buttered toast , jellybeans and popcorn ) cooked by a dog and a bird , is there any chance of this being a satisfying Thanksgiving ? And then there 's a bonus episode : `` The Mayflower Voyages '' in which the Peanuts kids travel on the Mayflower to the Americas , and chronicle the first few years of the Pilgrim colony , their cooperation with the local Indians , and the origins of Thanksgiving itself.Perhaps the reason that `` A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving '' is often overlooked is because it does not have a powerful central message , nor does it have the absurdity of the Great Pumpkin . It 's basically about a bunch of kids ( and two animals ) scrambling to put together a decent Thanksgiving dinner so everybody 's Turkey Day wo n't be ruined.And honestly , that 's more than enough . There 's a gentle warm charm to the story , with some understated humor ( `` What did you expect , a turkey card ? `` ) , the occasional surreal scene ( Snoopy engaging in a deathmatch with a `` grasshopper '' deck chair ) , and Charlie Brown flailing around trying to stay afloat.And the gang is in fine form here -- Charlie Brown is still worried about the holidays and trying to keep everybody happy , while Lucy is bossy ( she spends the Mayflower voyage demanding to see who 's in charge ) , Linus is laid-back and wise , and Peppermint Patty is domineering and totally oblivious . The only downside : Marcie sounds . Like she 's . Channeling . Williams Shatner at . His most . Choppy . And blurry.It may not be quite as well-known as the other two `` main '' holiday specials , but `` A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving '' is a fun , fluffy way to spend your time digesting the turkey .	1
Charlie Brown , Linus , Lucy , and the rest of the peanuts gang are back for another holiday.Thanksgiving is coming and Charlie Brown is getting ready to go to his grandmother 's house for Thanksgiving dinner . But , just as he 's getting ready to leave , Peppermint Patty calls and invites herself over . To make matters worse , she ends up bringing Franklin and Marcy along , too . Charlie Brown now must make dinner for his friends before he can go to his grandmother 's house . He enlists the help of Linus , Snoopy , and Woodstock . Snoopy is in charge of setting up the tables and chairs , while Linus and Charlie Brown get started on the food ( toast , popcorn , jelly beans , and pretzels ) . Needless to say , Peppermint Patty is pretty upset with the food , but Linus takes some time to describe the real meaning of Thanksgiving . Charlie Brown 's grandmother saves the day by inviting everyone to her house for a real Thanksgiving dinner.I 've been a fan of the Charlie Brown holiday specials since I was little . I could n't wait for them to come on TV . It 's nice to be able to share these timeless shows with my own children . They enjoy watching Lucy pull the football away just as Charlie Brown is ready to kick it , and Snoopy planting wet kisses on Lucy . I 've always enjoyed hearing Linus ' message about the `` true '' meaning of the holiday , too.This DVD contains another special about the Mayflower landing at Plymouth Rock that is very good , too.I give this DVD my highest recommendation . Peanuts specials have been and will continue to be timeless classics , and `` A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving '' is no exception . Do n't miss this funny special that contains a useful message .	1
Who the heck does she think she is ? First she invites herself over to Charlie Brown 's house for Thanksgiving , then she invites her girlfriend and Franklin too ! What 's up with that ? Of course Chuck has no backbone and agrees to everything even though all he can make is popcorn and toast . Well thank God Snoopy comes to the rescue . Sure he gets in a fight with a lawn chair , but he gets the place set up.Of course Linus once again puts everyone in their place and tells them about the original Thanksgiving and that it 's more than just the first shopping day of the Christmas Season . Peppermint Patty finally realizes that she 's made an ass of herself and sends her girlfriend to apologize.The gang ends up riding in the back of a station wagon to grandmother 's house where everyone will get their turkey , except for Snoopy and Woodstock , they 've been hoarding food in the doghouse.Best part of the show is the 'Little Birdie ' song .	1
Charlie Brown , with the help of Snoopy and Woodstock , prepare quite an unusual meal for his friends before him and his family leave for his grandmother 's house . `` Over the river and through the woods to Grandmother 's house we go ! '' . Charlie Brown is a real American cartoon icon . What the heck can you expect from the Peanuts gang ? They 're kids . Give it up for Charlie Brown even though he 's missing the turkey , but who cares when you see it ?	1
Remember Marcie ? The bespectacled girl who 's so in awe of the tomboyish Patty that she calls her Sir ? Patty , who 's long worshipped her `` Chuck '' from afar blows it bigtime when she invites herself , Marcie and Franklin to a Thanksgiving dinner -- and then finds fault with Charlie Brown and Snoopy 's culinary talents with toast , pretzels and jellybeans . After her host leaves the table in humiliation , Marcie politely but firmly runs her `` mentress '' through a reality check . Marcie gets 5 stars for gumption and diplomacy here , but the moral of the story is if you 're so overbearing that you invite yourself to dinner , do n't critique the menu .	1
this movie makes it Thanksgiving for me . I have watched it every year for a loooong time . Love Charlie and Snoopy	1
Peanuts once again hits DVD with this collection of three animated specials focusing on love.The disc starts off with `` Be My Valentine , Charlie Brown , '' which first aired in 1975 . Valentine 's Day is coming , and the gang 's getting excited . Charlie Brown is hoping for lots of Valentines this year . Linus has a crush on his teacher and buys her a box of chocolate which Sally thinks is for her . And in the middle of all this , Snoopy puts on a special Pawpet Theater show involving love . Frankly , I found this story to be a little depressing , even for Peanuts and was surprised that The Little Red Haired Girl did n't even get mentioned.Next comes 1967 's `` You 're in Love , Charlie Brown . '' It 's two days before school lets out for the summer , and Charlie Brown is trying to work up the nerve to talk to The Little Red Haired Girl . This is affecting every aspect of his life , leading to some embarrassing moments and potentially the worst last school day ever . This short was filled with the humor and warmth I usually associate with Peanuts.The final selection is `` It 's Your First Kiss , Charlie Brown , '' from 1977 . Charlie Brown is shocked to learn that part of his duties during Homecoming is to dance with the Homecoming Queen after kissing her . And the queen is none other then The Little Red Haired Girl , whose name we learn is Heather . But first , he must do his job as punter in the homecoming football game . This would be easy , except guess who 's holding the football ! This sweet story brought a smile to my face with the ending.As with other Peanuts DVD 's the three programs are the heart and sole of the disc . There is a computer game for another movie , and that 's all . Still , the programs are ultimately what I bought it for . The picture is clear and sharp . The sound seems to have a bit of a problem , but only on the first show and only when Linus and Sally are speaking . Other wise , the sound is fine in all three.This disc will appeal to Peanuts fans of all ages . While the first program may not have as happy an ending as usual , the other two make up for it big time . I 'd never seen these programs before buying the disc , but I intend to watch them for years to come .	1
Charlie Brown is one of the most vulnerable guys I 've ever read/seen/heard about . I thought `` Be My Valentine , Charlie Brown '' was so sad . He makes me want to give him a hug and a valentine . `` You 're in Love , Charlie Brown '' was very cute about his first look at the Little Red-Haired Girl . `` First Kiss '' was an episode I 'd never even heard of ... and that one reminded me of the end of `` 40 Year Old Virgin '' ... lol . The Peanuts ... got ta love 'em !	1
Charles M. Schulz shows us the dark side of the holiday with Charlie Brown 's trauma & Linus 's crush . However , it 's this harsh look at reality that has made the Peanuts specials so endearing because CB never gives up , and humor can be found in almost any situation .	1
I have a good foundation in films that expand the imagination . This happens to be one of them . This was my absolute first animated movie of my lifetime . It sparked something in my mind when I was a child that I will never forget . That was motivation . Anyone who does n't like secret of Nimh , may think so because of its lavishness . But the truth is , Don Bluth found a great story and told it the best he could . It is different from the book , and thats alright . A person should n't set their standards that way . It is a very dramatic and heroic tale of some very small creatures trying to defeat something so large , that only something tremendous and exciting could pull them through . Will plays a large part , next to heart and courage . I recommend this to parents who want their children to have grand imaginations , or to those who already have one . ( Since there are n't any listed above - here are the qualities ) Film 4.5 ( As good as possible ) Story 5.0 Sound 4.5 ( As good as expected , great for Tru-surround )	1
When the art form of Animation ( the HAND DRAWN animation ) was still being done , This film exceeded the magic and wonder of most of the family affair we are littered with today . Every character in this film is endearing ( Jeremy the crow is my personal favorite ) . The film is also filled with eye candy , the colors and background paintings and animation is top notch . NIMH boring ? Not at all , I found this film to be extremly entertaining and the story kept my interest the whole way through , and this statement is coming from a 38 year old man ! Yes I saw NIMH as a child but the charm still captures my heart to this day.Don Bluth is a master animator in my opinion , and thankfully he is carrying the torch for this little used art form in this time of computer animation . Why on earth ca n't both mediums exist ? Handdrawn versus computer ? I 'll take hand drawn everytime ! The heart in this film comes from ALOT of HARD WORK and from alot of talented people that had a love for the art form of hand drawn animation . Deep down inside , I believe Mr. Bluth will have the last laugh as hand drawn animation will make a comeback.To the one reviewer who obviosly was not paying attention during this film , NIMH stands for NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH . Do not hesitate to sit the children down in front of the TV to watch this film , better yet & lt ; sit down with them and watch it ! You 'll find you will enjoy it as much as they will.Enjoy this masterpiece and respect it for what it is .	1
I watched this recently for the first time on Youtube ( they took it off ) and fell in love with it . Its Ironic because I saw the second one first and it was terrible ! This one makes that second movie look like Barney ( thats not a good thing ) . Its also ironic because this is a Don Bluth film and they made one of my favorite cartoon movies The Land Before Time and later American Tale . I did n't know that . This came on CN when I was little and I never really got into it and deeply regret it . One thing I really loved was the suspense . This is really intense for a kids movie and that is a plus ! The action had me on the edge of my seat , more so than any R rated thriller I 've watched this year . The story was also dark . I really felt for Mrs. Brisby and wanted the best for her . I 've never seen an animated movie ( besides Plague Dogs ) where everything bad that could happen to the main character does . The scenery in some parts of the movie was absolutely breathtaking expecially the detail put in the Rats home . This is a wonderful movie for children and parents alike . I wish they still made animated movies like this .	1
A Visually stunning animated tale of A Mouse and her family . While attempting to rescue her son , she stumbles upon a secret of the National Institue of Mental Health and what they 'd been doing to other animals . True to a good/evil movie , good prevails . It also shows us to never ignore the magic in all of us , and to never give up.A Must-see for Chidren and Adults alike .	1
Sometimes you can find the most interesting things without even thinking about it . For instance , just a couple of weeks back I was standing in a crowded shopping location mindlessly looking behind the DVDs to see what was behind them . I had nothing better to do so what could be the harm in that ? As I was flipping through them , an old animated feature that happened to be on DVD cought my eye -- 'The Secret of Nimh ' . I still had the image of the cover in my head as a young child and though I had never actually seen the film , I figured there could be no harm done in buying a DVD for less than ten dollars . When I got home and popped it in my player , just viewing the opening sequence , I knew I was in for a treat . The music matches the animation perfectly , the animation is gorgeous ( some of the best I have ever seen ) , the backdrops and paintings are beautiful , the voice characterizations are fitting and entertaining , and the story is definitely a very original one . The only flaws are with the DVD itself , but I will not let that bog down the film 's deserved five star rating . Having said that , I hope that MGM plans on improving upon 'the Secret of Nimh ' DVD in the future to insure that future generations will view the film and feel the same way I did when I first saw it . I really missed out as a child .	1
Gorgeously animated , smartly written and surprisingly mature for a film that 's clearly geared to young audiences . Don Bluth and company really peered over new horizons with their painstaking efforts on this picture , and ultimately gave their old bosses and coworkers at Disney the kind of direct competition they needed to wake up from their late '70s slump . Bluth 's unmistakable style positively seeps out of every panel of NIMH , with an expressive , gestural quality that manages to be both creatively streamlined and rich with detail . The story , so dark that Disney actually opted out of making the film themselves , remains a breath of fresh air even today , thirty years after its premiere . Its broad landscapes and diverse characters tackle some very challenging themes with succinct honesty , respecting their viewers without scaring them off . Too many kids ' movies resign themselves to the opinion that children need their hands held on a stroll through happy town from start to finish , with a reassuring character always nearby whenever something remotely spooky happens . NIMH rejects that theory , cautiously , and ends up a better picture for all audiences as a result . It 's a revelation .	1
This deeply enchanting animated adventure , takes us back to the wonderful world of 1982 ... those where the days my friend ( sigh ) ... The widow ( Elizabeth Hartman ) of the great mouse hero , Jonathan Brisby , undertakes a quest to find a cure for her desperately ill son , Timothy ( Ian Fried ) .She must find the great rat , Nicodemus ( Derek Jacobi ) , through untold dangers , and is helped by a fun-loving crow Jeremy ( Dom De Luis ) The producers of this movie really create an enchanting world , with just the right touches . Children loved it then and will love it now . This one of those timeless classics .	1
`` The Secret of NIMH '' is by far one of the best movies you could ever watch . The animation is brilliant , the music is flawless , and the actors are superb . I recently purchased a copy of this DVD , and I can honestly tell you that I received my money 's worth.The movie is about Mrs. Brisby , a meek field mouse with four children , who recently lost her beloved husband Johnathan in a tragic accident . Her youngest son , Timothy , is dangerously ill with pneumonia . He can not go outside , but the farmer of the field in which they live is getting his tractor all set , so Mrs. Brisby has to move her family , otherwise they 'll all be killed . Mrs. Brisby , as you can well imagine , is feeling distressed . She pays a visit to the Great Owl , and is told to go to the rats of NIMH , who live in a rosebush just outside the farmer 's house.Mrs . Brisby does as she is told , and meets with Nicodemus , a wise old rat who is the leader , and who was also a very good friend of Johnathan when he was alive . The rats of NIMH are currently planning on journeying to Thorn Valley , but Jenner , a cold-hearted rat with a lust for power , will not hear of it.This movie is full of suspense , heart , and even humor . Mrs. Brisby makes a wonderful heroine , Nicodemus makes a supreme leader , and Jenner makes an outstanding villain . If you have n't seen this movie yet , then I highly recommend that you do so .	1
We had it by VHS before and lost it . This is first time we bought by DVD and kids love it . Thanks !	1
Mrs. Brisby is a newly-widowed young mother with four hungry mouths to feed . She 's also a tiny field mouse who scrapes out a modest living for herself and her family among the other small animals who live in Farmer Fitzgibbons ' field . Harder times have fallen upon the meek and selfless little mouse , however , as her youngest child , Timmy , has become ill with pneumonia just as the family is forced to find a new home before the farmer 's plowing begins . Doing anything and everything in her power to help her son and discover a remedy for her moving woes , Mrs. Brisby visits an ingenious little mouse named Mr. Ages who provides her with medicine for Timmy . Unfortunately , the danger comes sooner than expected , and Mrs. Brisby must find a faster solution . At the suggestion of her friend and neighbor , Auntie Shrew , the desperate mother takes her plea to the Great Owl . This is a dangerous task indeed for a tiny little mouse , but Mrs. Brisby will stop at nothing for the welfare of her children . She survives the frightening experience only to be sent on another quest . The Great Owl informs her that she must seek out the wise , old Nicodemus , leader of the rats in the rosebush , for only they have the power to move her home ; the rats of NIMH.NIMH , the National Institute of Mental Health , is the key to all that Mrs. Brisby never knew about her late husband . Her experiences with the rats of NIMH , escapees from that awful place , will open her eyes to an entire world of secrets , science , and magic that she never could have imagined before . Most importantly , she will come to realize the power within herself . `` Courage of the heart is very rare ; the stone has a power when it 's there . `` When former Disney animator Don Bluth struck out on his own , he was unable to take the Disney `` magic '' with him . Despite the number of animated films to his credit since , most lack a certain special `` quality '' that sets them in league with the great works of the house that Walt built . This is not to say that many of his films are n't enjoyable . In fact , a few came rather close to that Disney excellence , and one such film shines above all the others : `` The Secret of NIMH . '' In a time when fantasy films were all the rage , NIMH was the perfect animated feature , but what made this story so powerful and exceptional was the bold style in which Bluth chose to tell it . `` The Secret of NIMH '' makes no effort to be like a Disney film , nor does it attempt to be aggressively different . It simply uses its own style to create a world that suits the story perfectly . There is magic , but no fairy-godmothers or three wishes . The animals in NIMH live among modern day humans , but their own existence is very much medieval , with swords , wizards , and strange creatures around every corner . The film makes no apologies for depicting blood , death , and at least one use of the `` D '' word ( I was n't exactly counting ) . In fact , I 'm quite surprised to see it listed as rated `` G '' on Amazon . I had thought it came out as a `` PG '' film , though I 'm not certain . Regardless , the film is excellent for family viewing among parents and older kids ; not too low-brow for adults , but full of humor , fun , and adventure for the younger set . The characters are striking and real , from the humble little Mrs. Brisby to her caring friends , to the dangerous creatures that lurk and plot around them . Dom DeLuise is unforgettable as the clumsy and confused Jeremy the crow , and the dramatic presence of greats like John Carradine , Hermione Baddeley , and Derek Jacobi is not unfelt . The animation is glorious , as one should expect from a former Disney animator , and the story 's message about courage and love is conveyed flawlessly , but the real power of this film is invoked by the music . The hauntingly medieval-sounding score by Jerry Goldsmith will stay with you forever , even if Disney music is more your style ( take it from me , a Disney fanatic ) , and Paul Williams ' singing of `` Flying Dreams '' during the credits is equally enchanting.The DVD is much less spectacular . The only real extra feature is the theatrical trailer , and the film is presented in fullscreen without having been remastered . Still , it 's nice to replace the old VHS with a disc , even if the viewing experience is only slightly improved . The DVD I have features the previous cover art , however it is my understanding that the art is the only thing that has changed with this newer release . Hopefully , this animated classic will receive a more comparable DVD release in the future . If you have n't seen `` The Secret of NIMH '' yet and consider yourself a fan of animation , you MUST pick it up . Outside the Disney Studios , American animation does n't get much better than this !	1
The Secret of NIMH is a superior example of what magic can be done with animation . No CGI here , just simply a talented group of artists and animators giving the eyes a beautiful banquet of animated imagery . The story about a mouse named Mrs. Brisby ( in the book it 's Frisby and I do n't know why it was changed ) seeking the help of strangely intelligent rats so she can move her home so it wo n't be destroyed is classic , and anybody who was a small child in the 1980 's should have seen this by now . And know how good this movie is . Don Bluth film 's almost have about them a mythical quality , they seem a step above most Disney films . The Secret of NIMH is no different . A must see for fans of animation or anyone who was ever a kid . Although it might be a bit scary in some parts for the really young ones . Especially the Great Owl .	1
She 's older , wiser , and her voice has mellowed , but oh ... .There 's nothing like Streisand LIVE . This television special is truly incredible . It starts with a mesmerizing editing job during the overture . By the time Marvin Hamlisch conducts & quot ; People & quot ; and Barbra makes her appearance ( backstage video of her approaching the stage entrance ) your spine is tingling ! She steps onstage and the Arrowhead Pond audience goes crazy . Barbra sings & quot ; As If We Never Said Goodbye & quot ; and your eyes well up with tears ! The first act Barbra arranges around a psychiatrist theme -- couches and 60 's songs ! Ahh ! The second act is pure concert : Barbra on a stool singing great songs . When she launches into an incredible version of & quot ; Lazy Afternoon & quot ; you wonder why Barbra does n't drag more great songs like this out of her past and sing them live . Incredible ! The climax ( before 3 encores ) is a medley from YENTL . When Barbra sings WITH HERSELF on & quot ; Piece of Sky & quot ; you 'd think she 'd blow the roof off the Arrowhead Pond ! It 's truly remarkable.Buy it ! Rent it ! Own it ! Barbra , sing live and release everything live ! !	1
it 's a great show hearing Barbra Streisand perform Live.she does a fantastic job all the way during the performance.it 's classic Streisand .	1
I got the VHS of this concert a couple of years ago . The DVD is a vast improvement in almost every way.For me , this tour was one of the best PG concerts I 've ever seen . The `` Growing Up '' tour was incredible , but I think this show had better showmanship and activity -- and also a bit of a better selection of songs.Really , who is a better showman out there than Peter Gabriel ? I do n't think any other act -- with the possible exception of Pink Floyd/Roger Waters or *possibly* Tool -- approaches a concert as theater to the extent that PG does . It is n't just the songs , it is an artistic push for mood , costume , lighting , and *story* . On this tour , Peter and band use two stages ( one male , one female ) connected by a catwalk and moving sidewalks.The extras are also great with a `` making of '' doc that has Peter deconstructing the show and the sets . Rather than pure self-promotion , this segment really gives you a feel for all of the blood , sweat , and tears that went into creating this show . There 's also a really great remix of `` Steam '' , a pretty neat timelapse of setting up and striking the show , as well as previewing `` Growing Up '' .My one complaint about this DVD is that it is pretty clear at least some of Peter 's vocals were re-recorded in studio . There 's no breathing ( PG spends about a third of the concert in motion ) , no mic fades , and the audio does n't always match up with the video . This is pretty typical of PG who apparently did the same for the VHS version , the Secret World CD and Peter Gabriel Plays Live CDs ( he said as much in the `` Plays Live '' liner notes ) . For me it is maddening . I 've seen PG live 6 times now ( soon to be 7 or 8 as the Growing Up 2003 tour shapes up ) and I have never heard a missed note or a crack . Even if such a thing should show up , it 's a LIVE performance , is n't it ? The perfectionist leanings that PG has are admirable , but I believe this goes to far and takes away from his live recordings.Most people do n't seem to mind this , but I wanted to point it out.To those of you complaining about the video compared to the VHS version , I have both and I 've watched them closely : The VHS is full-screen and cuts off the edges . The DVD is not a cropping . The picture in the DVD is a little darker , but a whole lot sharper . I 'm no expert but I believe that when the VHS edit was mastered , it was `` sweetened '' to make it look more like video : a little more colorful and brighter but a little more distorted . This looks more like film.As for the audio , you ca n't compare the two : the VHS comes nowhere near the quality of the DVD . I ca n't compare it to the LD version , but the DVD mix is much more discrete and allows for a better feel for the full range of percussion -- though Tony Levin fans might want to turn the bass up a bit ; I think the low range was de-emphasized a bit to keep it from taking over.Overall , this is an excellent DVD and well worth buying even if you 've already bought the VHS . If only more acts put as much effort into their live performances as Peter does.Enjoy !	1
I was more than impressed when I first saw this on videotape , but the DVD adds sound options which really help to immerse yourself in the music .The staging has been much talked about and it is certainly something to behold , yet it does not detract from the focus of the show .I hesitate to call Peter an entertainer as this DVD shows him to be more than that - after all , his band match him in creating the moods for all the songs .It is almost like a movie .I look forward to showing this to people over the years so they can see the full potential of presenting music to an audience .This DVD together with STOP MAKING SENSE would be a potent double bill .See this and be enriched .	1
Peter Gabrial : Vocals , piano , harmonica , tamborine and paddle Tony Levin : Bass , piano , tamborine and vocals David Rhodes : Guitar and vocals Shankar : Violin , tamborine and vocals Paula Cole : Vocals Levon Minassen : Doudouk Jean Claude Naimo : Synthesizers , piano , organ and vocals Manu Catche : Drums , tamborine and vocalsWhilst I dont have the DVD I have the video which has a fine transfer and no dubbing so this review is based mainly on that . This is very good . The band play well and Peter shows his abilities as a dancer and actor ( the visuals in themselves are amazing ) . Peters vocals are as strong as ever and the compositions ( all as always written or cowritten by Gabriel are all great . Forget Phil Collins Live , for the ultimate live music expieriance watch a Peter Gabriel concert .	1
Secret World LIVE is by far one the best concert videos I have ever seen ( and I have seen many . ) To finally have it on DVD makes me very happy . The performance is incredible . All Peter Gabriel fans should own this , and any casual listeners will become fans after seeing this video . I do n't know what kind of special features this DVD will have , but it really does n't matter . The concert itself is definitely worth the price of the DVD . It is elaborately conceived and staged , from Peter singing `` Come Talk To Me '' from a phone box to packing the entire band in a suitcase during `` Secret World '' to the all out party that is `` In Your Eyes '' . Simply put , it is Awesome . I have almost worn out my VHS copy and the CD of the show is my default CD . I own so many CD 's that it is hard to decide what I will want to listen to while I 'm out of the house so `` Secret World '' always goes with me , and it never fails to work nicely . I guess now I can go out and get a portable DVD player and keep the DVD with me , just in case .	1
While the overall remastering of the sound is good ( could use more bass though ) , it 's the reMIXING i 'm a little ify about . Some of it is good , but a lot of it IS N'T . Long time fans of the film and accompanying CD will notice several things in the performance that were n't there before . Extra vocal ad libs ( one of which during `` Shaking the Tree '' when it can clearly be seen that Gabriel 's lips are n't moving , and another at the tail end of `` Secret World '' where his voice suddenly sounds a whole octave lower - strange . Over-sight ? Laziness ? ) For the most part , these changes do n't intrude too much ( kinda nice actually to hear a different mix since i 'm so used to the regular one ) , but there are times when it just should have been left the way it was . In particular , `` Solsbury Hill '' , which has always been my favourate part of the film . Different/more vocal ad libs , and the end of the song has been totally rearranged . After the last chorus , it goes right to the `` hey hey hey ... '' bit , and THEN the keyboard lick comes in . For me , it 's really quite annoying , but for others it may not be.EXTRA FEATURES : The features i was thouroughly happy with ( i was thrilled to know there were going to any `` extras '' at all ) . The `` timelapse '' feature was neat , showing the equiptment being rolled in and setup , the lighting and sound checks , people filing in , the concert in it 's entirety , people leaving , and then finally packing everything away for the next show ... all in ultra fast motion ( it takes a little over a minute ) . Theres a couple of nice little `` behind the scenes '' documentarys to , one for `` Secret World '' , and one for his more recent `` Growing Up '' tour . Both are informative and show some cool offstage footage . Worth seeing . Also included is a remix of `` Quiet Steam '' ( the song itself is not a remix of `` Steam '' , but a total re-recording ) , over which a montage of photos from the tour are shown . The photos are n't very interesting , but the remix of `` Steam '' is quite cool._______________All in all , it 's WORTH GETTING , even if you already have the VHS , or laserdisc . If your a huge fan , like myself , i 'm sure your gon na get this anyway ( you know you are ) , so whats the point of the review , but i hope this has been informative for those unsure of what they 're getting into.LONG LIVE PETER GABRIEL ! !	1
Even if you don , t like Peter Gabriels music ( I find a lot of his stuff too experimental and weird ) , but this the , very best concert DVD I , have , ever seen ... ... ... .with great , musicians . The most amazing , thing is just the theatrics . It is phenomenal !	1
One of the best live concert videos in the business . Stunning songs , brilliant staging , musicianship , superbly filmed and great sound mix .	1
What a package -- great song selection , performances , and film production . I had it on VHS and finally obtained the DVD . I recall when this tour came through LA around 1995 or so and wished i could have seen it live . A great combination of theater and music . Tony Levin on bass and the gorgeous , sexy Paula Cole on vocals are more reasons to obtain this gem . I have this and Growing Up Live , and Secret world Live is superior .	1
After having read the reviews of this dvd I was at first a little worried whether I would be wasting my money buying this dvd . Some of the complaints are justified , such as the grainenees at times in the picture and the lack of bass which has been taken out of the audio mix in several songs , in particular Solsbury Hill . There are however improvements over the original in the audio , in that both guitar and keyboards are given more prominence than before . Some of the vocal parts have also been re-done and sound alot better , particulary on songs like Kiss That Frog and Sledgehammer . The highlight for me however is the audio mix on San Jacinto which blew me away the first time I heard it , as it was the song I would always fast foward on the video . All in all a great dvd well worth buying despite some minor complaints .	1
The cast , the concert , and , most importantly , the music of this dvd are all absolutely phenomenal . Calling this performance wonderful and calling this disk a must-have are both extreme understatements ! I have no issues -- repeat ... no issues -- with the picture quality , but apparently a number of people do . That being said , unless you 're the type who , if they 're encountered , will fixate on video troubles throughout the show while missing the point ( i.e . the show ) , you will not want to miss this regardless of whether or not you 're a lunatic for Peter Gabriel .	1
As with all of Peter Gabriel 's projects , this one ranges from pedestrian to good to GREAT . If it was n't for the rather grainy ( it was filmed in a European auditorium full of cigarette smoke , I guess ) image quality , I would give it five stars overall . Musically it IS five stars .	1
Peter Gabriel spent many years developing a sound an onstage presence that was far removed from the sound and look of 70 's Genesis . Gone were the costumes and wires making him fly . His shows were powerfull and he let the dramatics come through with little more than his body movements , an occasional painted face and some interesting lighting . His performances were far more intimate than his former bandmates . He was trusting enough to surf the crowd long before Eddie Vedder was old enough to drive.On this tour , Gabriel felt secure enough to revisit some of the more outright theatrics that began his career with Genesis.The result was one of the finest combinations of great music and showmanship to ever grace a stage . I 've read reviews of the CD and there are some who make comments to the effect of & quot ; Well , I guess you had to be there & quot ; . To those I say buy this VHS , see it on a good set with good speakers.His band is exceptional as always , but larger . The sound is incredible and Gabriel 's trademark plaintive rasp has never sounded better . The theatrics and special effects enhance , instead of detract.Even if you 're not a real big fan of his , you ca n't deny what a perfect performance is contained here .	1
This live San Diego concert can not to be missed by any Sade fan . This is the best of her live concert footage , capturing the music and the artist better than other efforts . You can just feel the excitement of being there in this lavishly produced concert film that brings both the music and the unique relationship of Sade to her loyal fans to the forefront.It is a performance bare of costume changes and pyrotechnics , as it is just about the music we love , giving it an intimacy in spite of the large venue . Sade has never been lovelier and her vocals are surrounded by bass , horns , and precussion from fine jazz musicians like horn player Rick Braun . You get seventeen songs here and yet you 're sorry when it ends.It is worth noting that this band has stayed together during years of absence by Sade herself , an integrity and loyalty displayed in a business without any . It is the same kind of relationship she has with her fans . Late in the concert Sade leans down and accepts roses from one of those fans . No one tries to rush the stage and grab her and she gives the fan a gentle kiss as a thank you , in a day and age where your not suppose to . It is a classy moment from a classy woman.There is a particularly intimate moment where Sade sets down and speaks of a personal encounter with a man in a New York bar who told her his story of love and war which became the haunting `` Like a Tattoo . '' Though deeply felt songs such as this one are scattered throughout , the overall feel of the concert is upbeat and fun.Exotic rhythms take you from sandy shores to romantic nightclubs and a happy feeling embraces the viewer like arms of love surrounding them and singing them a lullaby . This San Diego concert is the best one out there , and a wonderful reminder to fans of why we fell in love with this singer and her band , and why we will continue to support Sade no matter how much time elapses between albums .	1
This is Sade 's best concert ever ! She puts forth so much effort and the songs are timeless ! Even though this concert is fifteen years old , I still watch it to enjoy some home entertainment . I never thought a jazz concert could be so entertaining until I saw this one . Her unique rythum and voice will intrigue you ! ! !	1
Sade 's outstanding performance here is terrific -- 18 gems captured with her sounding great , looking beautiful and packed with high energy and style . Sade 's DVDs are a great pick-me-up and her jazz style and professional band do a super job of keeping a high-energy , tight , `` on '' sound that 's both catchy and artful . Sade 's always been , and always will be , one of my favorite female vocalists . This DVD is oustanding , and the classy lady continues to shine bright and clear.I hope she 'll tour again sometime ... . in the meantime , be sure to add this , it 's one of my favorite concert DVDs.Update : December 2011 : years after writing the original review , this is still one of my alltime favorite concert DVDs . As I 'm learning how to play electric guitar recently , I 'm finding too that playing along with the tracks in this concert is a lot of fun . Sade over-delivers in one of the best concert videos ever , with a super voice and band ; this is well worth getting and highly recommended .	1
Just read the reveiws of Sade 's 1994 Live Concert DVD that I bought two weeks ago and all very outdated ... so here is a 2010 review ! It is AWESOME and a must for any Sade fan wanting to see her in Concert . She is great and the band members too ! My only disappointment was her not singing `` Punch Drunk '' which is one of my favorite songs .	1
Sade and her band never fail to put on a good show . I never get tired of watching this video . It 's one of the best performances I 've ever seen . I 've never gotten to a real Sade concert , but watching this video will make you feel like you 're there , like you 're right in the front row . There 's always a lot of action . You can tell that Sade enjoys performing . I ca n't wait until Sade goes on tour again because her performances are off the chain .	1
The great thing about digital technology is that you can butcher , reassemble and reanimate other people 's abominations . If I were to re-cut this pitiful , tedious , self satisfied rant on something political , I 'd fashion it into a short but thrilling peek into the Stone 's laboratory as they meticulously construct one of rock 's all time hugest monsters . The footage of the band and guests in the studio is absolutely riveting . The rest is annoying , adolescent , French philosophizing on the problem with anything not French . Off with its head ! !	1
This film has been unfairly maligned by many ( Rolling Stones fans , Godard fans ) , but it 's actually pretty good and absolutely fascinating at times . Godard 's politics get in the way of his cinematic mastery at times , but overall I found this as good and as compulsively watchable as his classic films . One of the greatest things about this film ( as others have noted here ) is showing The Rolling Stones in their rawest state . This is n't a slick , MTV , reality style TV programme with lame interviews and an obsession with showing only the `` fun times '' while working . Godard shows ( with his camera circling the studio in brilliantly filmed long takes ) how absolutely TEDIOUS it is to make a record/CD/music . We see Jagger , Richards , Wyman , Watts ( and studio musicians ) obsess over the most minute details on how the song Sympathy for the Devil is going to sound . It 's not like `` hey , let 's do the song '' , and one take later , they 're done . There are n't any groupies , flashing lights , nothing . It 's just The Stones making their music , and it shows the dedication that great musicians like The Rolling Stones put into their craft . It 's also especially sad to see Brian Jones , who was pretty much `` gone '' at the time of this film . The Stones put him off in a corner ( he looks like he 's sitting in his own little box ) , and you can hear him strumming inaudibly . There 's a microphone in front of him , but it obviously is n't on , and Jones does n't seem to know . Jagger , Wyman , Richards , and Watts pretty much ignore him , and soldier on without him . Jones 's drug use and alienation were at its zenith here , and he died shortly after these sessions . These sequences might be the most realistic depiction of rock musicians recording an album ever.Godard intercuts a lot of political material in the film ( this film was made during his generally abysmal `` Maoist '' period ) , but his framing ( especially scenes shot at a junkyard ) is classic Godard . Even though these scenes in the junkyard are with the Black Panthers and their rhetoric/dialogue are completely dated , dogmatic , and overly political , the scenes are still well shot and crafted . I never found the film boring , unlike some of Godard 's other Maoist films like La Chinoise , which was REALLY boring . So if you 're a Godard fan , or a Stones fan , you should see this film . It 's really quite good , despite some of its politics .	1
one plus one is phenomenal stuff at least for one reason , which is that one of the 'ones ' mentioned in the title refers to the Rolling Stones ' recording of Sympathy for the Devil.The experience is amazing . The viewer is taken into to the studio where Keith Richards literally composes the song , plays guitar , plays the bass , sings in the chorus and directs fellow backing vocalists ( Charlie Watts , Bill Wyman , Marianne Faithfull ) . It is literally amazing to see how involved Keith was and how much he was leading the band.But Keith 's leadership is only half of the story . One plus one also tracks how Mick Jagger come up with the lyrics that have made this song so famous . The movie also makes it quite clear how alienated ( and marginalized ) was Brian Jones from the rest of the band.The movie develops from the first chords ( that Mick patiently shows to Brian Jones ) , to the session in which percussion where added , to those in which the piano was added , to those in which Keith plays bass , to those in which Keith improvizes few notes that would later become Sympathy-for-the-Devil-vintage-guitar-solo.It 's a great historical document and the music is quite excellent . One plus one is definitely worth watching .	1
My favorite part of this video were the interview clips . I already knew the music , as I 've had album for quite some time , but with the interviews offer a view of the artists themselves . This video also includes two songs that are not on the album ( while the album includes a song that 's not on the video ) . Therefore if you are a DCD collector , this video is imperative .	1
Unlike most concert films , this movie does not open with footage of the band . It opens with a montage of groups of Non-Western people dancing while DCD plays in the background . For most groups , this would come off as the height of pretentiousness , but here it works . The big pay off is the concert footage . Lisa Gerrard 's voice was in great shape on the nights that they filmed this . The entire concert turns on two songs - & quot ; The wind that shakes the barley & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; I am stretched at your grave and will lie here forever. & quot ; The only minus would be the interviews with Lisa & amp ; Brendan Perry that are dropped in between every three or for songs . But , hey , that why the remote has a button with FF on it . By the way , this film looks GREAT on a wide screen TV , so if you 've got a friend with one , drop by with this tape & amp ; a six pack .	1
This DVD is in the 'Unplugged ' format , though the word is n't used in the title because these guys are presumably more important than most other acts and seem to deserve their own category ! Fans of Led Zeppelin will both like this and also wish that there had been an electric set from their reunion tour included as well . I saw the guys in Birmingham in 1994 and it was a great gig .What with the great package of the Led Zeppelin DVD live material being available , I only wish they 'd gone that extra yard and offered a little bit more .I think those people who are interested in a different side to music will enjoy this , as it shows some folky influences , though the rock and blues is always there in the groove .There is even a country feeling to some of the material .These guys are still good at the dynamics of live performance and they took time to present the music in the right setting visually .The sound options have been updated and the extra features are worthwhile .I recommend those interested in acoustic music with a rock influence pick this up .	1
Too bad about Bonham , but when he died , it was too bad that John Baldwin did n't play with them as well . Ah well .	1
JIMMY PAGE AND ROBERT PLANT HAD EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO CALL JPJ AND JASON BONHAM . IT 'S A KNOWN FACT THAT NO BAND WITH THE OBIVIOUS EXCEPTION OF THE SURVIVING BEATLES HAS BEEN OFFERED SO MUCH MONEY TO REFORM . INCLUDING JPJ WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT BUT THE SUBSEQUENT CALL FOR JASON BONHAM AND THEN THE ULTIMATE VERSION OF STAIRWAY STADIUM TOUR WAS SOMETHING ROBERT PLANT NEVER WANTED TO HAPPEN . THIS TOUR WAS N'T ABOUT MONEY . IF THAT WAS THE CASE THEY COULD HAVE DONE THE OBIVIOUS AND MADE THREE TIMES MORE MONEY . FRANKLY , I AM GLAD WE DID N'T GET A REUNION WHICH SIMPLY GAVE THE FAN A BLAST FROM THE PAST FOR OLD TIMES SAKE WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN NICE TO SEE BUT FAR AWAY FROM THE MAGIC OF LED ZEPPELIN 'S GLORY DAYS . LED ZEPELIN WAS A BAND THAT NEVER MADE THE SAME ALBUM TWICE . THEY PUSHED THE BOUNDERIES IN THE STUDIO AND ONSTAGE AND THOUGH THEY COULD BE VERY SLOPPY WHEN THEY WERE ON FEW BANDS THEN OR TODAY COULD MATCH THEM FOR SHEER EXCITEMENT AND CONVICTION.NO QUARTER GIVES US A NEW LOOK AT CLASSIC SONGS WHICH ARE GIVEN A BREATH OF FRESH AIR WITH EGYPTIAN MUSCIANS , SHIMMERING ORCHESTRATION , AND GREAT MUSCIANS WHO GIVE BONHAM AND JONES 'S PARTS THE LOVE THEY DESERVE . THE RESULTS ARE A DVD THAT IS LEAPS AND BOUNDS AHEAD OF THE OTHER REUNION OFFERINGS FROM BANDS SUCH AS FLEETWOOD MAC , THE EAGLES , AND PINK FLOYD . HIGHLIGHTS ARE GREAT VERSIONS OF FRIENDS , NOBODY 'S FAULT BUT MINE , RAIN SONG , AND KASHMIR.SOUND QUALITY IS SUPERB AND THIS OVERALL PRESENTATION IS ONE THAT IS BOTH FRESH AND FOREVER MEMORABLE . ROBERT MAY NOT HAVE THE PITCH HE USE TO HAVE BUT HIS LOWER AND MID RANGE TONES ARE IN MANY WAYS BETTER AND MORE CONTROLED AND JIMMY PAGE 'S ACOUSTIC WORK IS SIMPLY OUTSTANDING AND RIVALED ONLY BY A FEW GUITAR PLAYERS . WHAT SIMPLY BLEW ME AWAY WAS NIGEL EATON 'S HURDY GURDY WHICH LOOKS SO WEIRD BUT PRODUCES SUCH AN ERIE FANTASTIC SOUND . HE ALMOST STOLE THE SHOW AND HIS SOLO DURING THE SUBSEQUENT TOUR WAS REALLY AMAZING . THANKS JIMMY AND EVEN MORE SO TO ROBERT FOR GIVING LED ZEPPELIN 'S MEMORY A REUNION WE MAY NOT ALL HAVE LIKED BUT GOT SO MUCH MORE THAN COULD HAVE BEEEN EXPECTED . THIS IS THE EXAMPLE FOR WHICH ALL REUNIONS OF GREAT BANDS SHOULD BE JUDGED .	1
He is the guy who mixed & mastered this dvd conversion & with extraordinary results . This is rock 'n ' roll , kids ; it 's gon na be loud so forget that other review . The audio on this is so much improved it 's not funny . I always found that the vhs release never had any bass , even through my home theater system with a powered sub . This release corrects that & follows through on the possibilities with a great DTS mix ! The audio is sharp & clear & I found that after watching this for the first time in quite awhile that I enjoyed it even more than before . That 's probably because of the upgrade in quality . Kevin Shirley for those of you who do n't know has been doing excellent work producing for the likes of The Black Crowes , Dream Theater , & Iron Maiden for years as well as the phenomenal job he did restoring last year 's Zeppelin double dvd . Cheers , Caveman !	1
To have so many hits in such a short time is phenomenal but for them all to be absolutely great is quite something . But that 's exactly what Aerosmith have achieved with Big Ones . Taking the hits from the albums Permanent Vacation , Pump and Get A Grip , Big Ones features some of the finest rock music from the late 80 's and early 90 's . With Steve Tyler 's amazing voice and Joe Perry 's great guitar playing this is one great combination that was always set to succeed and it is n't highlighted better than on Big Ones . From the classics like Love In An Elevator and Dude ( Looks Like A Lady ) to just hard rock of Livin ' On The Edge and not forgetting one of Aerosmith 's streghts the power ballads like Crazy , Amazing and Angel . Every song included here is worthy of its place and nothing seems out of place . If you like rock with attitude Aerosmith are for you . Eat The Rich is just plain simple fun and a great song and one of my favourites along with the amazing Amazing and the Grammy winning Janie 's Got A Gun . However my favourite has to be Angel which is by far their best ever ballad and it sounds lovely and beautiful which is quite an achievement for a rock band . Also included is a live verison of Dude ( Looks Like A Lady ) which rounds things off a shows Aerosmith can rock live as well as in the studio . All in all this CD is barely out of my CD player as it is that good and should pretty much be in evrybody 's CD collection let alone a rock fan 's . Brilliant .	1
If you only buy one Aerosmith Cd , then this is the one . It 's got all the best songs from some of the best of Aerosmith 's days-the sober ones .	1
Here are Aerosmith 's best from their Geffen Records era . They signed with the label in 1985 after reforming ( they disbanded in 1980 ) . The original tracks are & quot ; Walk On Water & quot ; and & quot ; Blind Man & quot ; , the latter becoming a hit . The other 13 tracks are from PERMANENT VACATION , PUMP , GET A GRIP and THE BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD EXPERIENCE . There are no tracks from the band 's first Geffen album DONE WITH MIRRORS . Most of the tracks on this album would be recycled for OH YEAH ! ULTIMATE AEROSMITH HITS in 2002 .	1
This album is full of Aerosmith 's greatest hits of the late 80 's and 90 's but it is missing a lot of the best songs from albums as well . I would of gotten rid of Cryin ' , Crazy , What it Takes for starters . The album already has Amazing and Angel what other power ballads do you need ? You certainly do n't need 5 slow songs in a row . The album could of usedMagic touchYoung LustF.I.N.E*to give it a boost Just to name a few . The album is worth the money , and if you are a fan you probably already own it along with 5 or 10 of their albums . The first Greatest Hits album is better , if you are just getting into Aerosmith I recommend buying the first Greatest hits album and Gems , to give you a feel of how great this band is . Then buy this album and explore the back catalog for yourself .	1
I had this CD before but someone borrowed it and never returned it . I am glad to add it back to my Aerosmith collection .	1
by the time the mid-1980 's rolled around , many felt that Aerosmith were a once-great relic of the mid 1970 's . They released four great albums between 1973-1976 , but started with Draw The Line , it started turning on them . By the mid-1980 's , Aerosmith had been long past their peak and they had n't had a hit single in years . This all changed when they met Run DMC.Being smart and knowing when to strike when the iron is hot , Aerosmith came back with Permanent Vacation in 1987 on Geffen ( their first Geffen album , Done With Mirrors , was extremely underrated , check it out ) . Dude ( Looks Like A Lady ) was the first single and went to # 14 , becoming their biggest hit in a decade . However , this comeback single was not a fluke , it became the first of 11 straight singles ( every single one collected on here ) to make the top 30 ( Eat The Rich and Deuces Are Wild were both smash hits on rock radio , and Blind Man and Walk On Water were the new tracks , Blind Man peaked in the 40 's and Walk On Water barely got noticed when released in early 1995 ) . Aerosmith were not only hot during 1987-1994 , but they were actually hotter than they were in the 1970 's ! Only 2 tracks ( Rag Doll and Walk On Water ) of the 15 recreate the gritty bluesy classic rock sound that Aerosmith perfected in the 1970 's , so many fans of classic 70 's Aerosmith are n't so fond of this & quot ; poppier & quot ; sound . However , for many of us who grew up in the 80 's and early 90 's , this is the Aerosmith we knew first.I hope one day that there will be a comprehensive 1973-1982 collection ( instead of a ten track ) of the Columbia years , but when it comes to the Geffen years of Aerosmith , this is as good as it gets . The 2-disc & quot ; Young Lust & quot ; collection includes way too much from just 4 albums that it 'd be cheaper to just go and buy the 4 albums seperately . BIG ONES is a Greatest Hits collection that delivers , every track on the album was a hit in some form or another , and there 's nothing from 87-93 that 's missing .	1
Like the title suggests some of Aerosmith 's biggest known revival hits are on this release . I think what should be on any compilation is subjective , but I think the point of this release was to gather a lot of hits in one place . And that they did.Big Ones is still a good release , and Big Fun to listen to .	1
This is one of the better greatest-hits compilations that I have listened to , and I 've listened to many . In my opinion , Steven Tyler and Joe Perry are rock 's best one-two punch since Page and Plant , and I would use this album as Exhibit A in my case to support that statement . Unless you are a rabid Aerosmith fan ( like me ) , just pick up this album and save yourself the money of buying Permanent Vacation , Pump , and Get a Grip . Big Ones showcases Aerosmith at their blues-rock-boogie finest , with classics like & quot ; Love in an Elevator & quot ; , & quot ; Janie 's Got a Gun & quot ; , & quot ; Dude Looks Like a Lady & quot ; , and & quot ; Eat the Rich & quot ; leading the way . The previously unreleased & quot ; Walk on Water & quot ; is a great cut , and should fall into your normal listening rotation . This album is strong from start to finish , packed full of 100 % genuine American rock-n-roll , and should defintely endear Aerosmith to any music novices who are unititated to the band 's music . Big Ones , packaged with Aerosmith 's Greatest Hits , provides a great overview of the band 's work and does a great deal to prove the fact that Aerosmith may be American 's greatest rock band of all time .	1
This is kind of an odd collection . It 's not career-spanning , and only takes the hits from & quot ; Permanent Vacation & quot ; , & quot ; Pump & quot ; , and & quot ; Get A Grip & quot ; . But if you 're a fan of their early 90 's work , this is for you . Included is & quot ; Angel & quot ; , & quot ; Love In An Elevator & quot ; , and & quot ; Cryin ' & quot ; , as well as & quot ; Dude ( looks like a lady ) & quot ; , & quot ; Janie 's Got A Gun & quot ; , and & quot ; Livin ' On The Edge & quot ; . Plus many more , including a few new songs . & quot ; Dueces Are Wild & quot ; is really good . Pretty much all these songs are on the 2-disc collections , but if this is the era you like , then you 'll love & quot ; Big Ones & quot ; . It would go perfect with the earlier & quot ; Greatest Hits & quot ; album .	1
Not a bad song on here if you are an Aerosmith fan ... These are all tunes from the later more recent years of their career like Pump and Permanent Vacation not the classic Toys in the Attic and Rocks era ... Rock on !	1
Really love this CD . Love to listen to this group as they rock my whole place and I find myself singing along and dancing to the beat . If you are seeking to do that with some of the best rythym around you then this is definitely a CD you would love too .	1
I bought this CD last year and I have listened to it a few times . I have to admit that I have skipped past the songs that I am not familiar with yet , hence the four stars . The songs on here that were released in the 80s are the best ones , thought I like the ones from the & quot ; Get a Grip & quot ; CD . Only for casual fans , like me , who are n't interested in getting every single album they have released . Rabid fans have no use for this because they already have all the songs .	1
Big Ones does a great job of collecting the best of Aerosmith from the mid 80s to early 90s getting some of their best songs like what it takes , cryin , and janie 's got a gun . THe song selection is great for the most part , they even included deuces are wild from the beavis and butthead album . However , the version of walk this way with RUN-DMC which is a great song and basically revived their career absent from the album though it obviously should be on there .	1
This album is great as far as greatest hits albums go . I only gave it 4 stars because they could have done a better job of selcting tracks . There are songs more worthy of being on this album than ones that were chosen . One of my favorite songs on this CD is Eat The Rich . I love the guitar/bass intro . If you get this album along with the Aerosmith Greatest Hits album released on Columbia then you will have a good start on Aerosmith .	1
Aerosmith 's Big Ones like & quot ; The Immaculate Collection & quot ; ( Madonna ) is one of those hits albums that is a must have , every 80 's and early 90 's songs is on here , from & quot ; Angel & quot ; and & quot ; Rag Doll & quot ; to & quot ; What It Takes & quot ; ( this is my favorite ) to & quot ; The Other Side & quot ; ( another favorite ) from & quot ; Permenant Vacation & quot ; and & quot ; Pump & quot ; , then & quot ; Cryin ' & quot ; and & quot ; Amazing & quot ; ( both of these songs are gems ) on & quot ; Get A Grip & quot ; ( a very good Aerosmith album ) , the songs good from 1986-1994 straight though and that is how a hits album should be with new or unreleased songs mixed in . & quot ; Walk On Water & quot ; new on this CD , is a good song very ignored at radio , the two songs that this CD could do without is & quot ; Deuces Are Wild & quot ; and & quot ; Blind Man & quot ; ( probably my least favorite of Aerosmith ) , it just goes to show you that as long as you bring out great music like Aerosmith , Madonna , and Bon Jovi , you can go on creating more and more hits after you have releases execellent hits ' albums .	1
& quot ; Big Ones & quot ; is surprisingly comprehensive for a set of hits from a group that could n't stop cranking them out in that time period.Aerosmith is the best American rock band , period . It was n't until the mid eighties that the really caught up with the rest of the world . The hits started cranking out on their & quot ; Permanent Vacation & quot ; album with cool rock like & quot ; Dude ( Looks Like A Lady ) & quot ; , a very cleaver smack at make up laced heavy metals stars . I also ca n't forget the sensitive , sweet sounds of & quot ; Angel & quot ; ( talk about your AC Top 40 stuff ) and the unforgettable & quot ; Rag Doll & quot ; ( Joe and Brad at his best guitar work not to mention a great drum part on behalf of Joey and thumping bass by Tom ) . The & quot ; Pump & quot ; tracks also rock hard . You got everything from the catchy horns of & quot ; The Other Side & quot ; to the painfully great love county type song & quot ; What It Takes & quot ; . The ultimate & quot ; Pump & quot ; songs are Aerosmith 's generally best ever from the mesmerizing story of & quot ; Janie 's Got A Gun & quot ; to the party fest of & quot ; Love In An Elevator & quot ; . Then comes the mixed bag of everything that is & quot ; Get A Grip & quot ; . Everything from the breakup standards like & quot ; Cryin ' & quot ; to the driving & quot ; Eat The Rich & quot ; . Do n't forget the new tracks & quot ; Walk On Water ( sounds like old experimental Aero ) and the hard rock wisdom of & quot ; Blind Man & quot ; . The extra & quot ; Deuces Are Wild & quot ; is a big could have been hit from the group off of & quot ; The Beavis And Butthead Experience & quot ; .The band really has it together here . Great party music with that 's fun and with nice writing . It 's not as big as some of their old Columbia stuff and not as gritty either . It 's just the band playing their best and Steven singing his heart out . I think I like the & quot ; Pump & quot ; tracks the most and the & quot ; Grip & quot ; tracks are the least awesome ( still really good though , just not as exciting to me ) . If you love hard rock , this set is really for you . The album is full of the best of the decade and is a lot better-played then hair band stuff .	1
Throughout their career , Aerosmith has been known for signing contracts with new labels before fulfilling the obligations of their old ones . As a result , they are constantly releasing greatest hits albums as well as live recordings . Here is yet another one . This covers all the singles from & quot ; Permanent Vacation & quot ; through & quot ; Get A Grip. & quot ; Singles like & quot ; Janie 's got a Gun & quot ; and & quot ; Cryin & quot ; are bound to require multiple plays if you have n't heard them already . The downside of this album though is the blandness of the two new tracks , & quot ; Blind Man & quot ; and & quot ; Walk on Water. & quot ; These uninspired tracks left fans in an oblivion after this release , wondering where the future of the band 's songs would lie . Thankfully , they rebounded nicely with & quot ; Nine Lives. & quot ; However , if you are interested in the greatest moments during Aerosmith 's rise to rock/pop kings , here is the release for you .	1
This has to be the one of best home videos ever made ! Bought when it came out on vhs and own it on dvd.Bonus material very cool .	1
This DVD is awesome and show why Nirvana were the best grunge band ever and one the best bands ever in general .	1
I love anything by Nirvana & Kurt Cobain , he is a huge influence on me as a songwriter and muscian so I own most of Nirvana 's cd 's videos books etc.I recently bought a new copy of this live documentary on Nirvana which i had on VHS when it was released in the late 1990 's the first time and I replaced it with a dvd copy.the footage is not all great quality the interviews and apperances on UK German Japan tv are funny , the club show footage the video is not great viewing but this is a great film mostly.I agree that big hits like Come As You Are Teen Spirit there are no versions of those songs b , but for any Nirvana fan it is a must own . Kurt and the band were working on this before Kurt 's death so it was what Kurt would have put out had he lived . this dvd makes all music fans and muscians remember how great Kurt was and what rock and roll fans lost I highly reccomend this dvd for any Nirvana or music fan you will enjoy it !	1
This movie has got to be my # 1 favorite concert movie ! Excellent songs along with excellent footage . I love nirvana , i think that they made the most interesting songs , i got the cd neveremind about two or three years , and my cd didnt have Endless , Nameless on it , but this did , so now do i not only know how it goes but i also got to see them smash their guitars . If you like nirvana , even the least little bit , get this , PLEASE GET THIS	1
I can sum this up easily : I 've watched this concert now about 10 times ( and I just got it ) . Every time , I find myself wishing with all my might that I could time-travel back and be there in person . WONDERFUL . Worth every penny and then some .	1
Again , I 'm not even going to attempt to describe the awesomeness of this DVD , as I 'm sure there are plenty others who 've already done it better than I ever could . Just want to say that this is absolutely one of the greatest live music DVDs of all time . Too bad Queen did n't have time to tour anymore after this . Would have loved to see the later material in live form .	1
This is one of those DVDs that you never get tired of watching . It is a historic concert and makes you wonder what Queen might have been had Mercury lived on .	1
This is how a DVD should sound and be filmed . This is one of the best concerts I 've ever seen on DVD . Queen at their best .	1
Wow -- DVD at home -- with Bose sound sure beats the 8 tracks and wedge speakers in my 69 Mustang . Beats the turntable and nickles taped to the needle and giant home made speakers ( thank you Radio Shack ) . Always liked Queen -- this is my first Queen DVD and it is great . Nice variety . Freddie whips up the crowd ... . goose bumps . Program the DVD to play REPEAT . I like this better than vinyl -- Night at the Opera.Another One Bites the Dust -- good for pregame in the locker room .	1
I got this DVD yesterday . It is incredible . Finally they put the whole show on DVD.The sound is incredible , and of course the performances ara amazing . The band is in top form . You can see that the band and the crowd are having a great time.The extras on the second disc are incredible . There are interviews with the band , footage from the show on Friday , documentary on how the shows were put together . You are also able to choose a band member from a list and then see about four to five songs with the camera focused just on him.It is definitely the best DVD I own.I highly recomend it .	1
I have a number of Queen concert CDs and DVDs and I think this is probably the best one of the bunch . Filmed when they were at their best , in the mid-80s , the set list is great , creative , and comprehensive . An added bonus is the covers they play midway thought the show ( & # 34 ; Hello Mary Lou , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Tutti Frutti , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Gim me Some Lovin ' , & # 34 ; etc. ) . In this DVD , Freddie shows just why he was the greatest front man to ever play in a rock and roll band . Brian 's guitar sings , Roger rocks out , and John brings a cool bass line . It 's really worth the money , and if you 're going to get a Queen concert DVD , I certainly recommend this one .	1
By 1986 , Queen was at their absolute peak . They had placed themselves up there with the greats . So during their Magic Tour , they decided to professionally film their Wembley Stadium concert . They played two nights at Wembley , July 11-12 1986 , and each night they packed in 70,000 plus . Since it rained the first night , the Wembley Concert DVD is from the sunny , July 12th.Since there is no track listing to be found ( except for the Live At Wembley CDs ) , I will provide you with one.1 . One Vision2 . Tie Your Mother Down3 . In The Lap Of The Gods4 . Seven Seas Of Rhye5 . Tear It Up6 . A Kind Of Magic7 . Under Pressure8 . Another One Bites The Dust9 . Who Wants To Live Forever10 . I Want To Break Free11 . Impromptu12 . Brighton Rock Solo ( Brain May 's Guitar Solo ) 13 . Now I 'm Here14 . Love Of My Life15 . Is This The World We Created16 . ( You 're So Square ) Baby I Do n't Care [ Cover ] 17 . Hello Mary Lou ( Goodbye Heart ) [ Cover ] 18 . Tutti Frutti [ Cover ] 19 . Gim me Some Lovin ' [ Cover ] 20 . Bohemian Rhapsody21 . Hammer To Fall22 . Crazy Little Thing Called Love23 . Big Spender [ Cover ] 24 . Radio GA GA25 . We Will Rock You26 . Friends Will Be Friends27 . We Are The Champions28 . God Save The QueenThe first thing to point out is that Seven Seas Of Rhye is only 1 minute , 18 seconds long here . In other words , it 's not the complete song . That 's okay though , since the Rest of the DVD is a gem . Brain 's guitar solo ends up at more than 9 minutes , and in the middle of the concert , Queen throws in covers of old songs . Ending out the DVD is We Will Rock You , followed by Friends Will Be Friends . First , it 's only 2 minutes of Friends Will Be Friends , but surprisingly second , it 's not the We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions combo . That 's okay , I never mind a little change once and a while.Overall , the concert is excellent . It contains many great Queen songs , and other great non-Queen songs . You have songs on here like One Vision , Another On Bites The Dust , Now I 'm Here , Bohemian Rhapsody , Radio GA GA , We Will Rock You , and We Are The Champions just to name a few . The stage is huge , and Freddie Mercury manages to cover every square inch of it . Every moment , he 's somewhere different.The bonus features are as followed:1 . New Interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor2 . Multi Angle Feature3 . Rehearsal and Friday ( July 11 ) Concert excerpts4 . Backstage DocumentaryWhile watching the bonus features , you 'll learn more about the Wembley concerts and how rainy it was at the Friday concert . You 'll also learn about the camera positions and see Queen in multi angle . For four songs ( One Vision , Under Pressure , Now I 'm Here , and We Are The Champions ) you can select one band member and watch him for the entire song . The Queen Live At Wembley bonus disc is better that most bonus discs are.In the end , you get a wonderful Queen concert and an excellent bonus disc , along with a photo booklet for a list price of 20 dollars , but the sale price is usually under 15 dollars . It 's a great DVD set and I recommend it to anyone who does n't yet own it.If you like Queen Live At Wembley , then you will also enjoy the Live Killers CDs , The Platinum Collection , and Queen On Fire : Live At The Bowl .	1
The Lion King helped rekindle my interest in Disney 's animated features . Though a long time fan of the Disney Company 's work in animation , I had become somewhat dissatisfied with Disney 's animation after a string of the likes of mis-hits like & quot ; The Rescuers , & quot ; & quot ; The Rescuers Down Under , & quot ; & quot ; The Great Mouse Detective , & quot ; and the like . With the release of films like & quot ; The Little Mermaid , & quot ; & quot ; Beauty and the Beast , & quot ; & quot ; Aladdin , & quot ; and & quot ; The Lion King & quot ; I find myself once more enjoying Disney 's animated features again.The Lion King boasts a top-notch cast of voice actors , great music , no , make that fantastic music , starting with the opening number -- clearly inspired by music of Africa . There are also endearing characters in the form of Pumba and Timon , Scar -- the conniving 2nd in line to the throne , majestic King Mufasa , and the snivelling trio of hyenas . Oh , Simba was all right , but his was n't the character that made the film for me.The story , dealing with royal succession , could have come straight from the European continent , and may well have , but it sets up the stage for a great show.The animation is good , the chracters are likable ( or dastardly ) , and the whole film comes together exceedingly well.5 stars for an animated feature.Enjoy ! Alan Holyoak	1
This movie is similar to Bambi : The hero is born , loses a parent , grows up to be brave and good , and has a child of his own . The drawing is beautiful , the songs are very singable , and the story is touching . The modern , wise-acre dialog of Timon and Pumba at times detracts from the film , but other than that , the tale of little Simba growing up to be king is terrific . Adults will love it as much as the kids , and you 'll want to see it again and again .	1
I love this movie soo much ... it 's a great disney movie to have in your disney collection , yup it really is : - ) ! So please buy this movie , it 's worth everything ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
If you or your kids love The Lion King , Disney has produced another of their extraordinary DVD ensembles , jam packed with goodies , games , interactive stuff , cut songs and scenes and loads of other extras.Oh , and by the way , the movie is presented in a beautiful , crisp , transfer with Disney Enhanced Theatre Surround Sound that makes for a remarkable home viewing experience.I wo n't bother to review the film . If you love it , you will love this DVD . If you do n't care for it , then do n't bother . Disney is to be congratulated , again , on putting a great deal of thought , creativity , and new work into these kid-friendly packages . Worthwhile family entertainment .	1
This new two disc set for the Lion King is yet another masterful DVD production job by the Disney folks . The video and audio quality are top notch , with plenty of choices how to see the film ( both original and extended ) . There are an amazing amount of extras included on disc two , it will take some hunting to find them all , and quite a bit of extra time to view the entire contents . A few are overly self promotional , but there is so much stuff here , just skip to the next item if that bothers you . Some of the games are actually fun too.With both Lion King and Sleeping Beauty being newly released on DVD right now , if you can only get one of them , there is no question this is by far the better choice . The impressive animation , the story , the fantastic sound , the extras are all superior in this Lion King package . This still is n't my favorite Disney release ( Roger Rabbit will always have that honor ) , but maybe top 5 -- certainly top 8.Lion King Platinum is well worth the investment for your DVD collection . Your family will get many years of enjoyment from it .	1
The circle of life . It 's funny how an old African tale taken by Disney and made into this film captures some of life 's truths and shows some of the great sadness and joy most people experience as they repeat the steps of those that came before.Death and loss , love , birth , great friendship , responsibility , loyalty , betrayal , evil , bravery , and more are shown in the transformation of these creature characters as well as the land itself.Following the birth of Simba , seeing some of his childhood adventures , his self banishment , his upbringing with a wort hog and meercat , going back to face his fears , and the interaction of his family , friends , and subjects is very well done.The animation is incredible . Still before Pixar and mostly computer animation . Music and score are also incredible with several catchy and fun tunes , a great love song , African flavored beats and chants , and touching instrumentals.The Lion King is in the group of Little Mermaid , Beauty and the Beast , and Aladdin as what I consider 'Modern Day . ' Disney classics where it was still hand animation with artists before Pixar and computers took over.There still is n't a Pixar film that feels the same as classic Disney or the 4 films listed above .	1
If you are searching for the Lion King , there are several versions , this one was great . Certainly , a Disney classic , which children love over and over .	1
This one of the best films Disney ever released & quot ; The Lion King & quot ; , with it 's extraordinary animation and Academy Award winning score . The animation and special effects are incredible . In fact it 's so good my family and friends have seen this many times at the theater and purchased the video . Now we have this first time on DVD , with a 2-disc Special Edition chuck full of extras.For the first time never before seen footage with an all new song & quot ; Morning Report & quot ; ~ *first ever digital presentation ~ *bonus features with all new animation ~ *deleated scenes ~ *music videos ~ * & quot ; Can You Feel The Love Tonight & quot ; performed by Sir Elton John ~ * & quot ; Circle Of Life & quot ; performed by Disney Channel & quot ; Circle Of Stars & quot ; ~ *exciting journeys that take you beyond the film ~ *DVD-ROM links ~ *THX-certified ~ and much much more.This is a must have for & quot ; Disney-classic-collectors & quot ; that will do your ever growing collection proud . This is someting you 'll cherish and watch over and over again through the years . Disney has done it again ~ it just keeps getting better with every DVD release from the Disney people ... got ta love it ! Total : 2-DVD-Set ~ Walt Disney Home Video 30387 ~ ( 10/07/2003 )	1
The product arrived in a very short period of time . We are enjoying watching it with our grand daughter ... On to Disney World soon .	1
A wonderful tale of a young lion who has to grow into the responsibilities of leading his pride . The music is wonderful..	1
This movie is so great ! Obviously it 's one of the greatest Disney movies of all time , and the music and plotline speak for themselves . I love this movie and am so glad to have it for myself !	1
I loved this movie when I was nine , and I still love it at the age of 25 ! The animation is incredible , such a good use of color , and effects ! The story is incredible , I think it 's the most mature story Disney has ever done . I love the characters in this movie , very funny , and compelling . The music is amazing , Hans Zimmer , and Elton John , does n't get any better then this ! And the voice acting is top notch , and so are the songs ! I recently got the Blu-ray release of this movie , and I have to say , I was not disappointed if anything I am wowed by the clarity in the picture , and the sound ! , The menu 's are beautifully done ! This is a must buy to any Disney fan , and especially for family 's , a true masterpiece !	1
Disney 's THE LION KING ( 1994 ) is , as if anyone really needed to tell you , a true modern Disney classic . I first saw it when it was released in late 1994 ; in fact , I saw it during the first weekend ! This was something I never did with any Disney film before or since , but I had seen the full five-minute trailer a few times during the two-month buildup to its release and it looked incredible . It did n't disappoint ; in fact , it turned out to be one of the greatest films of 1994 -- -and that was a *busy* year for great films ! In fact , if it were n't such a busy year for great films ( PULP FICTION , FORREST GUMP , THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION , IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER , etc . ) then THE LION KING would have easily garnered a Best Picture nomination . Better than the great ALADDIN ( 1991 ) , even better than BEAUTY AND THE BEAST ( 1992 ) -- -which *did* get nominated for Best Picture -- -this film was state-of-the art in every way : The incredibly vivid visuals , especially during the opening sequence and the awesome Wildebeest stampede , the DTS digital sound , the voice-over actors , even the script ... it all came together in a whole new way , to create a film that was probably even more for adults than it was for kids -- -but one in which the kids enjoyed immensely as well . This animated masterpiece provided a great theater experience , even with all the kids there ! Well , it 's just as great on VHS , especially considering our 51 & quot ; widescreen TV and Surround Sound capabilities ( *smile* ) . I imagine it must be even greater on DVD , but we will have to wait till later in the year to be able to get the Special Edition DVD , which I badly want ! This is just one of those films that make you smile ; it is so special in so many ways.But why is it so special ? I mean , it 's basically Hamlet for kids -- -and not even young kids , considering the adult themes of betrayal and murder -- -and tells a relatively simple story . Ah , but its Shakesperean thematic model is filled by a story that *is* original in its characters , in its setting and in its ability to awe us with its sense of wonder and purpose . One last thing : we can relate to its main character Simba ( voiced as a cub by & quot ; Home Improvement & quot ; actor Jonathan Taylor Thomas , voiced as an adult by Matthew Broderick ) , who runs away from a past he ca n't face and harbors it as a guilty secret till he is able to face down his demons in adulthood . Come on , most of us can certainly relate to that in one way or another ! You know the story , but here it is again : Simba , after a restless but happy cub-hood , runs away from home when his majestic , all-powerful and seemingly invincible father , the Lion King Mufasa ( majestically voiced by James Earl Jones -- -as if it could have been anyone else ! ) , is betrayed and murdered by his brother , the evil and scheming Scar ( creepily voiced by Jeremy Irons -- -as if it could have been anyone else ! ) , who guilts the young Simba into leaving and never coming back . Of course , Scar then becomes King , much to the chagrin of Queen Sarabi ( voiced by the illustrious Jamaican actress Madge Sinclair , in what would be unfortunately her final film role ) . Meanwhile , Simba goes off to the forests where he meets a couple of best pals -- -a wisecracking Meerkat named Timon ( Nathan Lane , in a piece of inspired casting ) and a big , flatulent Warthog named Pumbaa ( Ernie Sabella , also inspired ) -- -who teach Simba the value of & quot ; no worries & quot ; ( & quot ; Hakuna Matata & quot ; ) and who shine in all of their scenes . Simba grows up with them into a life of no worries . Eventually , the young girlfriend he left behind , Nala ( voiced as an adult by Moira Kelly ) , finds Simba and tries to convince him to come back to Pride Rock and fulfill his destiny . Simba has long been resigned to his present fate , and refuses to do so -- -until he is confronted by a wise baboon named Rafiki ( Robert Guillaume , in yet *another* piece of inspired casting ! ) , who shows Simba that his father truly lives on within himself . Simba returns to Pride Rock to reclaim the kingship , evil Uncle Scar does n't want to go lightly , and in a truly climactic scene , Simba avenges his father 's murder and takes his place in The Circle of Life , becoming a dad himself in the very last frame ! I know I did n't have to go through all that , but I wanted to ; it 's just a great film with great songs ( the magnificent & quot ; Circle Of Life , & quot ; the Oscar-winning & quot ; Can You Feel The Love Tonight , & quot ; & quot ; I Just Ca n't Wait To Be King & quot ; and & quot ; Hakuna Matata & quot ; -- -all written by Elton John & amp ; Tim Rice ) , and it is still such a pleasure to watch it a whole decade after its original theatrical release . Do n't let the G-rating fool you ; with humor so hip and violence so intense ( especially in the climactic fight scene ) , it 's really not for young children . I still feel that it should have received the PG-rating . Still , no matter what the rating , THE LION KING is a must-have , for *any* film library.MOST RECOMMENDED , AGES 8 & amp ; UP	1
Since 1989 , I have bought several formats of RHYTHM NATION.This is the best album for Miss Jackson , I give it a 5-stars since 1989.One of the few albums that every tracks are FABULOUS.There are some messages that Miss Jackson wanted to get through to her fans and listeners.I have been Miss Jackson 's fun since CONTROL.Hope Miss Jackson can produce a project similar to 1814 in the near future.GOD BLESS U.2007 nov	1
This is one of Janet 's best CD 's . Great beats , melodies , music and lyrics . Nice slow tunes also for relaxing with a significant other ! . I highly recommend this for old and new fans ! Enjoy ! ! !	1
We are a part of the rhythm nation . Absolutely LOVE this Janet Jackson album . My 9 year old granddaughter , who is a total Michael Jackson fan , is now learning to love his sister , too ! !	1
This is the best Janet Jackson album ever . Nuff said .	1
THIS ALBUM WAS WHEN JANET WAS ON TOP OF HER GAME . SHE WAS DANCING AND SINGING . ALL HER SONGS WERE N'T SEXUAL.THIS IS JUST A GREAT ALBUM .	1
I bought this cassette in February of 1990 ( believe or not ) along with the single & quot ; Heartbeat & quot ; by Seduction . Anyway , I was sooo happy with my purchases . I took both cassettes with me when I went away for three weeks . After listening to Rhythm Nation for those three weeks , I fell in love with the album . The songs are so uplifting and upbeat . The album does not have only one breakout song . All of the songs are breakout songs ! ! !	1
In 1986 , Janet Jackson burst onto the music scene with the cd Control . In 1989 , Rhythm Nation surpassed it . I do n't believe Janet has made such a consistently pleasing cd since . 1993 's Janet and 1997 's The Velvet Rope did n't quite match the consistency nor the great songs that Rhythm Nation had . Half of Rhythm Nation is hits : & quot ; Miss You Much & quot ; , & quot ; Rhythm Nation & quot ; , & quot ; Escapade & quot ; , Love Will Never Do Without You & quot ; , & quot ; Alright & quot ; , & quot ; Black Cat & quot ; and & quot ; Come Back To Me. & quot ; Janet and The Velvet Rope lack these kinds of remarkable songs . Control is more adolescent in nature than Rhythm Nation . This is a must have for any rock collector .	1
Janet Jackson 's Rhythm Nation 1814 would most likely fall in my Top 5 recordings ever , and honestly I 'd have a tough time not making it number one . And , like any great album , it is n't simply because it is a brilliant piece of music.But yes , first , and foremost , it is a brilliant release . The concept , the message , the lyrics , and the composition all shine brightly and emanate a light that pierces your very soul.Every single released was brilliant , and the videos for each were spectacular visual and/or dance masterpieces . I still practice and use Janet 's dance steps from `` Miss You Much '' and `` Escapade ! '' Further affirmation of this album 's brilliance was the fact that every remix issued for every single was an awesome piece of work . [ As a side note to you Janet RN1814-aholics , if you look hard enough and are willing to pay for it , you can still find the 8 track CD remix release of `` State of The World '' - IT IS WORTH IT ! ] I even `` collected '' remixes off the radio and made my own remixes . I would stay up all night on weekends listening to Mix Party shows on the radio trying to catch those awesome , unique remixes of Janet 's songs . I compiled a tape of 1814 radio rexmies that I collected in both Indiana ( while at college ) and in Kansas City ( while home for holidays ) . I also pieced together my own crude remixes from the original and remix tapes , making my own personal remixes that I could `` own '' and enjoy . Perhaps a tad illegal , but it was for my own personal use for my own personal collection ( they are NOT for sale ) . I could n't get enough Janet , and this was my way of expressing the love and joy I felt for this release.Even further proof of the mass genius of this release was the production of the 1814 video . Shot in black and white , this is a powerful testament , not only to Janet and company 's talents , but also to the strength of the human spirit.More proof still : the Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour that supported this album . This was the first concert I ever went to . I was so committed to seeing this concert , I left college during the week , flew home to Kansas City , did n't tell my parents , and arranged to be picked up from the airport , go to the concert , and stay the night with friends . I still have tour t-shirts , sweatshirt , buttons , hat , and bandana ; it meant THAT much to me . I had lousy seats and took pictures where the stage is just a dot , but that still is the best concert I 've ever attended.For me , this album is , by very definition , pure genius and an example of what `` perfection '' is in terms of music . It is n't simply listening and appreciating the music that makes it great - it 's also having all these wonderful memories and associations that enrich the release far beyond mere music . This is how music becomes a classic , by becoming a part of one 's very being.Having said that , it is somewhat hard for me to offer a truly objective opinion for those who missed this period from late 1989 to 1991 . However , I believe that , even without the references above , this release still stands as a brilliant piece of music that speaks to young and old alike . If you are the type of person who really listens and tries to `` experience '' the music , listen to Rhythm Nation 1814 . Then perhaps you can develop your own personal experiences that speak to you and help you appreciate the timeless message of this recording - hope , happiness , and the strength of an individual to overcome .	1
I really love this CD . `` Escapade '' is my favorite track on this CD because it is so fun and can always bring a smile to my face .	1
Thank Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis for this one . You 'll be bobbin ' your head from start to finish . This is not necessarily ( artistically/critically ) Janet 's 'best ' work but it is probably the most responsible and definitely the most dance-able album of her career.The title cut will definitely get your blood pumpin ' .	1
Janet has produced so much great songs and this one is fantastic from first interlude to last ... pound the dance floor , go slow with your loved one and enjoy .	1
Without sounding like a broken record , Rhythm Nation is truly Janet 's best album to date.The album proves that Janet is a versatile artist , because it includes a number of genres.She tackles social topics on songs such as `` Rhythm Nation '' , State of the World '' without sounding preachy . The album also has up-tempo R & B/Pop classics such as `` Alright '' , which is brilliant song , although it 's lengthy to `` Miss You Much '' , '' Escapade '' and `` Love will never do ( without you ) '' but my favourite songs are `` Black Cat '' , a sizzling rock track and the heart-wrenching ballad `` Come back to me '' .She also sounds sexy on songs such `` Lonely '' and `` Someday is tonight '' , without being explicit.Even the interludes do n't sound bad.This album is funky and unpredictable !	1
Social conscious album . Great messages throughout the cd , from track to track . & quot ; janet & quot ; is my favorite Janet Jackson album , & quot ; RN1814 & quot ; is right up there next to it . I highly recommend the album . Sometimes in a chaotic world , it 's good to listen to the it [ the chaos ] and 'do something ' .	1
In concept and material , RHYTHM NATION 1814 is a fantastic album . A warning to the 5 or 6 people out there who do n't have it already : the LP versions are not what you heard on radio and in videos . All of the songs are wonderful , but many of them are just not found in their best form here.It 's too bad that often , the video or radio versions of Janet 's singles are far superior to what 's actually offered on the albums . However , the album version of the gorgeous and timeless COME BACK TO ME is superior , with its beautiful vocal intro remaining intact.I find the way the album was mixed to be completely unsatisfactory . It 's like hearing the instruments ( keyboards ) being played underwater , with over-magnified beats and Janet 's whisper thin voice buried in synth and echo , barely audible in many cases . The dance numbers are extremely overproduced , and too long , in particular the title track . ALRIGHT is a one-chord pony that thumps on and on for 6:30 minutes , begging for a remix edit.If someone took on the task of remix-and-remastering RHYTHM NATION 1814 ( eliminating the unnecessary synth coating and echo effects ) and including the best single/video/import versions of the songs , you would have arguably the best Janet album ever .	1
Janet Jackson 's Rhythm Nation 1814 is a phenomenal album that had many hits . The social themes are common in songs like State of the World , the ultra funky The Knowledge , the rapidly paced Rhythm Nation , the emotional Living In A World They Did n't Make and some others . The rest of the album consists of some very funky songs and some smooth ballads , including Miss You Much , Escapade , the funky Alright , Come Back to Me , Someday is Tonight , and others . However , I do n't like Love Will Never Do Without You . It still sounds like some limp , bland , midtempo song that put me to sleep when I first heard the album . And that 's on the 5:49 version on the album versus the better single version . This album really gave the year old Paula Abdul album some stiff competition with its Minneapolis-driven sound . And it had 7 straight top 5 hits , a rarity in pop music , winning countless awards and a tour that the band should have taken time with learning the songs and its rapid pace . Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis still pair well with Janet for this album . Had Janet did this album with an anonymous producer , it would have flopped big time . But this album succeeded on its own merits and Janet sounded her finest vocally and artistically here .	1
The song that took me to a different level with this album was my favorite BLACK CAT ... ... ... I love that song .	1
The socially-concerned Rhythm Nation 1814 is pop star Janet Jackson and mega-producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis at their collective best . The album was an unprecedented success , spawning a record-setting 7 top 5 singles , with chart-toppers in 3 different years - 1989 , 1990 , and 1991 . No album since has matched these accomplishments . The synth-driven songs range from the funk-heavy societal commentaries of `` Rhythm Nation '' ( built on a Sly and the Family Stone sample ) and `` State of the World '' to soft ballads dripping with harmonies like `` Come Back to Me '' and `` Lonely . '' In between are dance-pop classics like `` Escapade , '' `` Love Will Never Do , '' `` Miss You Much , '' and the rock song `` Black Cat , '' all of them Billboard number-ones . `` Someday is Tonight '' closes the album perfectly with a tantalizing preview of Janet 's awaiting incarnation . Rhythm Nation 1814 is the rare album with no filler ; I regularly listen to it from beginning to end without ever skipping a track . Janet and her Flyte Tyme producers managed to create an album that was timely and remains timeless . 5 Stars .	1
Janet Jackson 's Rhythm Nation 1814 is such a pleasure album , is truly her masterpiece , no wonder this is the only album of a woman to include a total of 7 top 10 singles ! , imagine that ! , what a great album ! , 4 # 1 singles , this album showcased a more self consious Janet , interested not only in love , but social injustice , illness , and equalities , above all this album is in no way a boring and skipping songs one , from the beggining to the end this is Janet 's Best Album Ever ! Buy It !	1
**This review also appears on my Epinions page . **When Janet Jackson 's 1986 album Control topped the charts and broke ground in the music industry , the calm before the storm was quite long . Fans were calamoring for more than just a sparse nine tracks , and it 's not like they were all that interested in her earlier two albums . Though Ms. Jackson had seemed to take , well , control of her life , nobody really knew whether or not this was going to become an ongoing thing or if she would burn out still in the shadow of her famous brother . The long wait came to end in 1989 when Janet dropped one of the most important records of the eighties in Rhythm Nation 1814 , an album that took the focus of Ms. Jackson herself and placed it on humanity and the world . This record is a global record that is considered to be landmark for a pop/dance record , similar to the introspective album of the same year , Madonna 's Like a Prayer . The old adage that you have to help yourself before you can help other seems to fit Janet Jackson 's career . She learned about herself with Control , and then , she took on her environment with an empowering album that discusses children , homelessness , violence , cruelty racism , and prostitution , with a little bit of sexuality and love sprinkled into the mix . This record saw the first use of interludes , which , admittedly , Janet got a little carried away with on future projects , but on Rhythm Nation 1814 , Janet 's artsy-fartsy sound-bytes make this record a cohesive concept album that flows in such a beautiful way . This is , without a doubt , one of the most important albums of all time.With Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis still on board with Janet in the studio , the three of them wrote a record that would shove Janet out from Michael 's rather large shadow and made her not just another Jackson . Marlon , Jermaine , and LaToya all released albums , too . What 's to set them apart from one another ? Well , Ms. Jackson-if-you're-nasty stripped her music of color and made a starkly distant dance record that is both catchy and intelligent . The record begins with a forty-seven second introduction ( mislabeled as an & # 34 ; interlude & # 34 ; ) that features clock chimes and the sounds of whirring machines before the Rhythm Nation Army counts down from five , warning you that they are about to rock your world . The title-track is a heavily produced and loud dance track that featured a black and white video of Jackson and her dancing in uniform on scaffolding . Janet was serious , and the world responded with praise . Janet 's voice performs their first real back-flips , as Control was a bit for straight forward and did n't really challenge her . She screeches and hollers and commands attention with her voice and the matches beats . This record is an important precursor to the new-jack sound , though on this particular album , she mixes it with that glossy 80s sound : & # 34 ; With music by your side to break the color lines / Let 's work together to improve our way of life [ ... ] People of the world today , are we lookin ' for a better way of life ? SING ! We are a part of the Rhythm Nation. & # 34 ; The intensity is consistent for the entire song before it ends with television static and flipping channels , and you are listening to another interlude . Unlike some of her other albums , these do n't take away from the overall mood of Janet 's idea . State of the World does n't mix words when it tells the tale of a homeless grammar school student and a prostitute who sells her body for her newborn infant , then Janet switches gears to battle illiteracy with education on the funky dance track The Knowledge.With three social conscious songs under her belt already , Janet gives the listener two lighter songs in the new-jack party song Miss You Much , and the sultry mid-tempo R & B ; outfit that is the catchy Love Will Never Do ( Without You ) . Janet Jackson was never really considered a sex symbol until the video for this track was released in 1990 . Dressed in nothing but a tank top and some jeans , Jackson dances around with a love interest on the beach to make the perfect summer love video . Her attitude is still all over this song , but she 's a lot softer with her message . This is considered to be a bit of break before she shoves you into the political heavy-handedness on the ballad Livin ' In A World ( They Did n't Make ) , which find Janet once again giving children a voice . It 's the few sub-par song on the album , but the message is important suits the record just find . Janet makes up for slapping you in the face with such an abrupt end to your summer fun with a song about true friendship in Alright , which is one of the most infectious tracks of her career , featuring a happy-go-lucky vocal performance and an upbeat production that blends the future of house music and new jack swing . Janet was on the cusp of dangerous genres but she made them work better than anybody . Escapade is a glittery pop song that reminds me of some of the work she did on Control , and I absolutely love her good-time vibe : & # 34 ; Lookin ' shy , you caught my eye -- thought you 'd wan na hang for awhile ! & # 34 ; For those who do n't believe that Ms. Jackson is a pop singer who ca n't write her own material , Rhythm Nation 1814 proves that she can work with songs handed to her or she can work on her own . Black Cat , a hip-rock song with some heavy metal influence , was written entirely by our girl , and it features some very smokey and steamy vocals as she belts out a song that relates to anybody about to go over the edge . This could be gangs , this could be drugs , this could be anybody , but & # 34 ; you better watch ya step , or you 're gon na die ! & # 34 ; I was raised on this record when I was lucky enough to receive it as a gift -- and what a gift it was ! That said , as a child , I was never interested in the last three tracks featured on this album . But then again , I was really only interested in upbeat pop songs . Lonely is a catchy ballad with some adult contemporary sounds , but Janet manages to make them honest and personable . Though she did not write the track , she certainly makes it her own with her sugary sweet voice that accompanies the classical guitar beautifully . Her version of the adult contempo sound is much like Phil Collins 's in that it still interesting and was n't overly saturated as it got in mid to late 1990s . I do n't like Come Back to Me , though , as it 's a bit of a useless song as well as a direct knock-off of the track before it . And , unfortunately , Janet decides to re-hash Funny How Times Flies from her Control album with Someday is Tonight . But then the flourishes sounds of the discs first kick in again before the record closes on a swirl of spacey samples . What did you learn ?	1
90s kids will love this . 90 's nostalgia does n't get more 90 's than this and it could n't be more satisfying . My friend and I found this in my parent 's basement last week and watched it on an old 90 's TV and it was hilarious , relaxing , nostalgic and very very interesting . Many of the animations on this tape were not only just pure experiments , they were just someone testing a single effect on an animation program . This sounds pathetic but it actually produced a really interesting variety of shorts that make up the various music videos on the tape . Everything else is mostly an assortment of demos sent to hollywood movie studios by hopeful animators . The music , I ca n't lie , is some of the cheesiest corniest new age I 've ever heard but some of the songs like `` Leaving The Bonds of Earth '' , `` The Mind 's Eye '' and `` Civilization Rising '' are actually really cool and as bad as some of the music is , it 's all heady nostalgic stuff . The back of the box claims there 's a plot but nope , it 's just random images that start with prehistoric themed stuff , moving up to stuff with buildings and technology , then just random stuff . While we were watching it we were literally just yelling out `` Stuff ! ! , STUFF ! ! . It 's a bunch of STUFF ! ! '' lol . Well , I 'm sure you can tell this tape is a lot of fun , especially if you grew up in the 90 's . I highly recommend it , both versions are great but I recommend the version with Q-Factor , Tingri , and The Way I Feel	1
This video , while famous for its compilation of then ground-breaking CGI , is really most interesting for the story that it tells . The sequence of the segments ambitiously chronicles the the formation of Earth ( `` Creation '' ) , the rise of human civilizations ( `` Civilization Rising '' ) , the technological advances of humanity from the advent of agriculture to the future exploration of the cosmos . The video speculatively concluded with a segment of what might be the next sentient species to arise on Earth ( birds ? ) .It is visually stunning and James Reynolds 's soundtrack is perfectly crafted to evoke a sense of wonder , awe , and contemplation . I never tire of watching this jewel .	1
never mastered any tap but it 's fun to try	1
A tripped -out view of a day in the lives of the boys.Coherent ? Naw , but you 'll have a good time ! The Monkees poke fun at a lotta stuff , including themselves ! Got ta love 'em ! Great songs and guest stars , but pretty & quot ; hip & quot ; for a G rated film .	1
They Get The Funniest Looks From Everyone They Meet ... And It 's No Wonder , This Film Is Truly Bizarre ... The Monkeys Were Hurtled To Some Fame In The Aftershock Of The Beatles ' Success ... Their Ingrating Series Was Accused Of Imitating & quot ; A Hard Days Night & quot ; , But Their Innovative Feature-Film & quot ; Head & quot ; Was Ahead Of Its Time ... A Free-Form Product Of The Psychedelic Era ... Starring Mickey Dolenz , David Jones , Mike Sesmith , Peter Tork , Teri Garr ...	1
I do love the movie head , I still give it 5 stars , but Davy and mike share the same birthday , Why was n't both their birthdays celebrated in the film ?	1
One can only imagine what director Bob Rafelson and fellow screenwriter/stoner buddy Jack Nicholson were packing into the bong during the writing sessions for this memorable cult film starring the Monkees . The film actually has n't `` dated '' quite as laughably as similar flower power romps from the era like `` Candy '' and `` I Love You Alice B. Toklas '' . Made up of equal parts avant-garde satire , slapstick comedy , metaphysical musings and cynical self-parody , this is a movie that will thoroughly entertain if it catches you in the right mood ( and I do n't neccessarily mean `` under the influence '' ) . There is actually some method to the madness if you give it a chance . Hilarious cameos from Victure Mature and ( genuine nutcase character actor ) Timothy Carey spice things up . You will also have fun discovering early-career appearances by Terri Garr and choreographer/actress Toni ( `` Hey Mickey You 're So Fine ... '' ) Basil . Some of the bands best ( and most mature ) songs are featured on the soundtrack . The Rhino DVD release is perfectly fine ; I am a little puzzled by some reviewers claiming that the transfer is `` bad '' . It is as good a print as I have ever seen of this film . OK , so it wo n't ever be a candidate for the `` Criterion Collection '' , but it is a brisk and lively 84 minutes of mindless fun . So , just lighten up ( or , uh , `` light '' up ) and enjoy !	1
I loved & quot ; Head & quot ; but it was hard to figure out , because it had no plot to it . I loved the songs and the psychadelic look during & quot ; Porpoise Song & quot ; and & quot ; Long Title : Do I have to do This All Over Again. & quot ; My favorite part was the Coke Machine because it was hilarious ! It 's a must for Monkee Fans however , but it just does n't make sense .	1
This is one great movie ... Head the turning point in monkees history was not that great of a success in its time but has now become a cult classic ... I personally love this movie because its trippy ... like after u ate a crap load of shrooms yes ... very fun ... the monkees were known for being funny and with only 2 seasons of there show its not hard to see why they made this movie ... Written by jack Nickelson , They start out with the mayor opening the new bridge , and the monkees come running threw and micky jumps off ... then there are some mermaid who rescue him and etc.. they are inside a vacuum and stuff its really wierd ... But this movie is not funny ... Not at all like there show and the music is differnt on the show not at all like previous things ... some monkee fans have been shocked but i was very excited to see it and was very Surprised afterward the movie had more meaning and was not just them running around like crazed freaks but this movie really makes you think and u have to watch it many times and u still will not fully understand Each time u watch it u notice something else ... I suggest this movie to anyone Monkee fan or not	1
towards the end of the series , the members of the Monkees kept figuring ways to sabotage their teenybooper image . And this film truly puts them over the top . There 's no need to tell you the plot cause there is n't one . There is Annette Funicello . An amazing free form film - and it 's easy to see how this film freaked out their fans .	1
Do n't get weirded out , yes the date of this review is years before the Criterion version was issued , but I 've gone back and edited my original review because it had false info about the aspect ratio on this DVD.The new ( 2010 ) Criterion version of Head is far , far superior to this release in every way . At this writing it is only available as part of the `` America Lost and Found : The BBS Story '' box set -- but with that you get Easy Rider , Five Easy Pieces , The Last Picture Show and 3 other great films , so it 's worth it ! Otherwise , following Criterion 's usual practice , I 'd say that an individual release of `` Head '' should follow in the next year . This link is to the DVD version but the blu-ray is strongly recommended ! America Lost & Found : The BBS Story - The Criterion Collection ( Head / Easy Rider / Five Easy Pieces / Drive , He Said / The Last Picture Show / The King of Marvin Gardens / A Safe Place )	1
A classy one-of-a-kind psychedelic masterpiece which makes the original TV series look like the infantile nonsense it really was ( has n't it dated badly ? ) . The soundtrack 's wonderful ( great songs by Goffin/King and Peter Tork and Michael Nesmith leading the group through a live & quot ; Circle Sky & quot ; ) , the 1000-films-rolled-into-one style is thoroughly engaging , as is the cyclical end-as-beginning story ( ca n't really say 'plot ' ! ) . Full marks to all involved . If you 're a fan of 60s culture , check this out !	1
The Monkees television show was terminated at the end of its second season . The reasons are complex , but one reason was that the Monkees , Peter Tork , Michael Nesmith , Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz , were dissatisfied with the format of the television show and they wanted to appeal to a more adult audience . Once the television show ended , the Monkees decided to declare their freedom with a movie , which eventually was called `` Head . `` The movie has no opening credits and no plot . Some have called the movie a visual `` stream of consciousness . '' Others have called it psychedelic , anti-war , and anti-commercialism . In fact , the movie is all of the above as well as a uniquely artistic film . Elements of `` Head '' can be seen in some later films ; perhaps most notably in the Mel Brooks film `` Blazing Saddles . `` The movie is free-form movie-making , with writer Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafaelson tying together vignettes focusing on key images and concepts throughout the film . Some of the concepts are quite complex . The box seen in several places in the film represents the room built for the boys at the studio , but also represents the trap the boys felt they were in while making the Monkees television show . In another aspect , the box also represents the constraints of commercialism and being pigeon-holed by fans.There are several songs used in this movie that count as some of the best ever made by The Monkees . `` The Porpoise Song '' is easily one of the best Monkees songs recorded . The live version of `` Circle Sky '' is another winner . Other good songs include `` Can You Dig It '' and `` Do I Have to Do this All Over Again . '' There are some weak songs as well , and the soundtrack for this movie is definitely a mixed bag of quality.Another interesting feature of this film is the cameos . Actor Annette Funicello , boxer Sonny Liston , Actor Vitto Scotti , football star Ray Nitschke , famed musician Frank Zappa , actor Teri Garr , and actor Victor Mature all made appearances . Jack Nicholson can be seen briefly in one scene . Gossip queen Rona Barrett appears . Toni Basil performs as a dancer . The list of cameos includes many more well known individuals.This movie also contains a strong link to another ground-breaking film , `` Easy Rider . '' Many of the people involved in the making of this movie participated in `` Easy Rider '' the following year , and the gold helmet used in that film came from this movie.The question that one must inevitably face in any review is who will like this film and who will not . The people who will like this film fall into two groups . People who considered the Monkees a serious group and empathized with their desires to break out of the cookie cutter mold created by television will enjoy this film . Students of cinematography and avant-garde film techniques will see a rare example of a studio produced experimental film . Those students will also immediately see the inspiration for later films . Fans of the Monkees television show have had differing opinions about this movie . I was a fan of the show and I enjoyed the movie . However , others have felt that the movie is worthless . If you like experimentation and you enjoy psychedelic movies from the late 1960 's , particularly if you ever liked The Monkees , you might wish to give this film a try.The Monkees were a cultural phenomenon . The group was originally meant to capitalize on the success of the Beatles , but they ended up being much more . The four boys of the Monkees showed that just because they were chosen to be on a comedy show , they still had talent and they had an incredible amount of influence . The Monkees refused to be placed in a niche by television , even if it meant that they gave up an award-winning and successful television show to do so . `` Head '' remains a unique film that would be impossible to imagine making today . We are fortunate that The Monkees were able to stay with this project long enough to see it made , and more fortunate that Jack Nicholson and many of the other people involved in the film were sufficiently enthused about the film to keep working on it even though several of the key individuals involved lost interest while it was being made . Though not for everyone , this film is special and belongs on the extremely short list of influential , experimental rock films.Enjoy !	1
In 1968 , some time in the Autumn , this movie was shown on BBC1 . My Mom and Dad , who were strict Bretheren types , & quot ; approved & quot ; of the Monkees , but this one only got five minutes , and that was it . Off . My older sister sneaked in later and we watched bits of it with the volume way down.When I came across it in later years ( first kid just having arrived ) , I was totaly in awe . This film is like , a masterpiece , man . Even if you take into account the fact that it must have been conceived under the influence , it is very clever . The whole theme of head is basically the idea of continuity , or rather the issue of continuity . What can you do if you are prepared to view a movie as a series of mere transformations ? The whole point is not so much that there is n't a plot , but that the world the Monkees really live in is in fact too complex and confusing to support one . Over and over again they find themselves way out of their depth , pursued , chased , threatened by incomprehensible enemies , sometimes known , sometimes familiar , but never explained much . At times there are moments of tenderness , even real desire and longing , but these are transitory , often followed by more confusion.The music is very good and gives you a very nostaligic feeling about Vietnam and Carole King and all those long ago days . Even Uncle Frank Zappa makes an appearance , albeit under strange circumstances ( which I have no doubt he specified in advance ) . My son ( who is now 15 or so ) thinks the funniest scene is when Mickey gets angry with the Coke machine in the desert.The humour is clearly a general product of Mickey Dolenze 's fevered imagination . The slippage of the real with the unreal is very much in line with the sort of visual and conceptual surrealism that Zappa pursued in his more inspired 60 's sessions . The fact that the film director and crew are often featured ( or at least appear from time to time , looking their best to be totally cool and just working ) , and the often unrehearsed feel for some of the scenes ( especially the scene after the cafe ) gives you a really unusual feeling of being integrated in with the movie . Given the fact that this is one of the most psychedelic and mind twisting movies ever anyway , and especially if you 're smoking anything , you 'll walk away from this and maybe miss the door and go straight throught the wall.Do n't miss this for goodness sake .	1
Precisely not the kind of movie anybody would have expected the Monkees to make , this film ( co-written by Jack Nicholson , and featuring Frank Zappa and Victor Mature , in the same film , together ! ) was either a calculated go at making the Monkees counterculturally acceptable , or just an inspired set of non-linear , 'Python'-esque sketches on the subject of manufactured fame . Released at the same time as the Beatles ' 'Help ' , this is closer in tone to the unstructured 'Magical Mystery Tour ' , but whereas the latter Beatles movie was curiously joyless and forced , 'Head ' is actually pretty funny , in both senses of the word . Attempting to describe it is pointless - it opens with a Monkee leaping from a bridge , and ecompasses war , a Coke machine in the desert , and a giant eye in a medicine cabinet . Think of it as a set of short bits of the television show , edited by a man with no idea of structure , only weirder . And you 're half-way there . It 's a shame it is n't out on DVD .	1
First of all , let 's get the facts straight on the aspect ratio . The only DVD of this movie so far has been released `` full frame '' , or , more commonly called `` open matte '' , or 1.33:1 ratio . It is NOT Pan & Scan , and you 're not losing information . At the same time , it is NOT the correct aspect ratio , which is 1.85:1 . In April 1953 , Columbia announced that all forthcoming productions would be composed for the 1.85:1 ratio and that Columbia would be 100 % widescreen . Later , it would also adopt Cinemascope for 2.35:1 ratio for specific movies , but most still used 1.85:1.They were looking at how to achieve wider and taller images without investing in costly new equipment , at least on their part , and the exhibitors would have to fork over some money to take advantage of the plans of the studios . They achieved this by filming in the old 1.37:1 ratio ( what you see on the DVD ) , but then `` soft matted '' , or cropped , the image in the theater on the top and bottom to achieve the 1.85:1 ratio . This is the ratio for which the movie was composed . You 're not meant to see the top and bottom of the image.This is evident , and proved , by the black hard mattes that pop up on the bottom of the screen during the shots of the Monkees jumping off of the bridge . All special effects are shot only for their intended theatrical framing . This is due to the high cost of their development . This means that when you see a special effect shot on a non-widescreen home video , it has surely been pan & scanned ( not on this DVD ) , meaning that a part of the picture has been chopped off . This holds true for all movies , including all matted films and films shot on Super 35mm . The hard mattes seen during this scene gives an indication of the intended aspect ratio of the picture.One reviewer stated `` I saw it in a theater and it was 1.33 or 1.37:1 '' . Big deal . Projectionists often guess on how to exhibit films if they lack proper information . Technically , this film can be projected in academy ratio , but it is wrong , as it is not how the film was composed . I read where Andrew Sandoval attended a theatrical showing and the projectionist thought it looked a little tight at 1.85:1 , so he projected it at 1.66:1 . He was incorrect , which is why the mattes were still partially seen.Anyone who has a widescreen TV ( such as myself ) , can use the zoom feature to closely approximate the 1.85:1 intended aspect ratio . It 's not perfect , as widescreen TVs are 1.78:1 , but it 's pretty darn close -- and guess what ? It looks great . This is why TCM also shows it in 1.85:1 -- because they are educated in film.Anyway , regarding the movie , it 's a fun film , with many visually beautiful sequences , great music , and humor . If you do n't get it the first time , try again . It 's worth anyone 's time who like the Monkees , Rafelson , or is curious about one of the finer examples of psychedelic pop-art.This DVD from the 90s would benefit from a restoration , and a new release on DVD or Blu-ray disc . I doubt that it 's popular enough to warrant a full-blown restoration , which is too bad . Do n't let that distract you , though , as there 's only some minor damage here and there , but overall , visually pleasing .	1
Micky , Davy , Mike and Peter 's 1968 cult film is not anything like the television show . The Monkees destroy their burdensome `` manufactured pop '' image in a wild series of satirical and psychedelic vignettes co-written by Jack Nicholson and directed by Bob Rafelson . `` Head '' has no plot , but does have Victor Mature , Annette Funicello , Sonny Liston and Frank Zappa . A surprisingly good soundtrack includes the classic `` Porpoise Song '' ( written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King ) , Tork 's `` Do I Have to Do This All Over Again '' and Nesmith 's `` Circle Sky . '' Though the initial failure of `` Head '' hastened the Monkees ' demise , it has been reassessed in some critical circles as a minor masterpiece . In 1990 , the movie was showcased at London 's National Film Theatre as part of its `` Rock on Film '' retrospective - a well-deserved honor .	1
This is a marvelous insight into a concert of the greatest pianist of our time at the age of 83 . It is remarkable how well he plays in the beginning , and everything he plays is from memory.Yet with all my admiration , I assign this performance more a sentimental value than the true virtuoso one ; in a way , it is a sad recording , because it is noticeable of how tired maestro becomes towards the end , not able to hide the mistakes ; it is somewhat disheartening to see him making a tremendous effort , yet the keys seem not to obey him as they did 20 years before . I think he was unhappy that he could not play flawlessly and could not control his own inability . It must have been deeply frustrating for Horowitz to play with clearly heard errors.I suspected that many would assign people 's tears during Schumann 's `` Traumerei '' to the artistry of Horowitz playing . The truth is that whenever someone important in USSR died , the radio would endlessly play this music . It has become so closely associated with death ; and during the concert those shedding tears were probably recalling the losses of someones dear to them , reacting as Pavlov 's dog to this tune . Of course , Horowitz plays it masterfully , but this is not why people in the audience were crying.It is actually quite interesting to see the attendees of the performance ; the tickets were definitely distributed by unions , given as rewards to exemplary workers , as to USSR Army officers that one can see in the sala , party bosses , young communist leaders , etc , - in short , to all those who had never attended a classical music concert before in their entire life . Moscow Conservatory concerts were normally half-empty , but Horowitz was so exotic and notorious - a former emigrant , a suspect , in a way . Viewers should not take what they see by face value and imagine that everyone in USSR knew and loved Horowitz ; those who defected to the West were never viewed favorably from within mother Russia.But for this visit Horowitz was ordered to be celebrated and loved . I am sure he felt some falseness in all that.To anyone who is familiar with his life story , and who had similar experiences in life , this video is full of nostalgic moments . It is hard to say what Horowitz really experienced during this visit . Stravinsky years before cut his visit short . For a Russian emigrant who left because he could not stay it is never so easy and pleasant to be back , and I think Maestro 's anguish after his sixty one years of absence shows - not when he is playing , but in the off-stage settings.This is somewhat a very emotional film ; more than a concerto . Recommended with care .	1
My reviews of these violinists and this pianist are becoming redundant . The performers are all so good , that I 'm reduced to admiration and have little else to say . I remember many years ago I was listening to NPR , they had a female musical expert on and they were testing her , they had both Rubinstein and Horowitz play something by Chopin , she was supposed to identify the pianist . She guessed wrong both times . I guessed right . I thought at the time that Rubinstein was the supreme player of Chopin , and I thought the Horowitz version was cold . This was many years ago , and while I still prefer Rubinstein 's Chopin ( warmer ) , Horowitz is my hero , my favorite pianist , though I 'm not nuts about his customary choices of composers . But this flick . It is a perfect gem ( and so tragically underpriced , anyone can afford it ) . The drama of the arrival , Horowitz ' conversation , the shots of the audience ( some of whom , yes , were crying ) , the marvelous close-ups of his hands ( his nails were unclipped and seemed to be dirty , and he does n't arch his fingers which my very dim and distant piano teacher used to tell me was imperative , though he does it some on the right hand ) , and the music . It was glorious . I love Horowitz . One glitch . There would be . My disc was defective , and somewhere during the penultimate piece it screwed up , so I did n't get to see the whole thing , I missed the last 2 pieces of music and whatever dramatic or `` human interest '' ending was on the film . But good old Amazon is already getting ready to ship me a replacement and tonight I returned the defective copy . I 'll have the new one in 2 days . One last note . I 've been going broke the passed few weeks buying musical performances on DVD , and one thing I 've noticed , it 's unmistakable . These people , these musicians , apart from their wonderful skills , are intelligent , humorous and compassionate . All 3 , and all of them . It 's humbling and refreshing .	1
The selections on here ( especially Scarlatti ) seem so up close and personal . I love this DVD , and it is a top choice in my selection . I especially like getting to see Horowitz speak with Scriabin 's daughter .	1
The incomparable Horowitz ! Though very late in his career , his technique and musicianship is without equal . Though this recording is before digital video media , the overall sound is very good and the `` emotion '' of the event come through briliantly . The variety and complexity of the music belies a man of Horowitz 's age . No fan can be without this immortal recording .	1
After recovering from accidentally setting himself on fire while smoking crack , Richard Pryor returned to the stage at the top of his game . This is truly his finest performance . He even makes a joke about his accident . Ranchy , nasty , and witty as hell , this is the master comedian doing what he does best . If you are easily offended , too uptight , or 'born again ' , this is not the concert movie for you ! Nobody gets away from being made fun of , especially white people ! It is truly amazing to watch Pryor slip in and out of his countless characters . His genious plays out with ease and he improvs alot of the show . Seamless bits go by and you 're so busy laughing , you may miss the next one . Pryor even brings out his famous friend 'Mudbone ' for a full 15 minutes . All of the younger comics working today owe one to Pryor . Eddie Murphy looked up to him as an idol and even used the same song for his end credits in 'Raw ' . A comic I knew stopped doing standup and went into film instead . When I asked him why he did , his answer was simple : 'If I ca n't be as funny as Richard Pryor , then forget it . '	1
For someone like me yeah part of the appeal of the videos on this DVD might be mildly generational.I 'm sure it is with a lot of people . Either way you look at this or at Michael Jackson this is the best visual example I can think of what made him such a beloved talent in the beginning.Even though I can not at all get into all the idolation that plummeted him as the 80 's went on ( and even here you 'll find a kind of over-the-top document of that with the `` Brace Yourself '' intro ) the ten videos featured here ... ..well it 's hard to put into words.These are Mike 's classic videos , the ones that made him.Probably the first major artist to come from the field of R & B ; to cross over big time to MTV.And he did so by being a trend setter , blending the influences from his past into a quality all his own . As I did withMichael Jackson - History on Film , Vol . 2I will list each of the videos with a mini review ; seems the only way to do it.BILLIE JEANThe video that broke Mike onto MTV features his match point choreography with some very noirish and syncopated backdrops.THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEELA mini movie featuring the very curvy Tatiana Thumbtzen being pursued by an at first somewhat shy Michael.Note for music fans Roy Ayer 's 1985 funk classic `` Hot '' is playing in the backround.BLACK OR WHITEIn terms of drama and even humor this is one of Mike 's best videos.The intro with McCauley Caulkin and George Wendt is hilareous.As if Mike doing an explosive dance from behind images of KKK members burning crossess stating `` I AI N'T SCARRED OF NO SHEETS '' was n't enough , this is the version with the `` controversial ending '' , featuring a stunningly angry and funky dance routine.Of course Michael also morphs into a black panther ( I get it , by the way ) and violently smashes car and store windows griffito tagged with racial slurs.For who he was this has to be the most obviously racially charged imagry of anything Mike ever did.It 's a pity he later withdrew it in favor of an edited version.ROCK WITH YOUOne of two videos here fromOff the Wall . A lot of people find this video low budget and tacky and ... I have to admit I don't.It makes great use of disco-like projected light effects up against Mike 's glitter suit creates this great rainbow of colors . That mixed with his dancing in place gives this a real kind of performance feel.BADIt had been a while since I saw this mini movie directed by Martin Scorsese.Mike goes from this timid prep school graduate out of place with his old friends , one played by Wesley Snipes to this mean leather clad dancer and back by the time the video is over.Nice touch with the `` B & W ; /color/B & W ; '' effect.THRILLERI already reviewed this video as it is featured on both Mike 's video volumes.For more info refer to my review ofMichael Jackson - History on Film , Vol . 2.BEAT ITThe fact that Mike had the clout to get dancer and real gang members for this video is amazing enough.Not only that but he leads them in this dance I can only describe as a funk era version of something out ofWest Side Story ( Full Screen Edition ) .Also the first appearance of his famous red leather jacket.REMEMBER THE TIMEA great celebrity cameo video with an Egyptian motif starring Iman and Eddie Murphy and Pharoh and Neferttiti . Mike literally comes out of a pile of gold dust and goes into some involved moves invoving a little escape.A lot of fun.DO N'T STOP 'TIL YOU GET ENOUGHMike 's first music video as a solo artist is a favorite.He is working his way for the first time through some of his own moves with this tux and oversized bowtie in kind of a psychedelic blue screen setting.Sort of looks like a dreamy American Bandstand.HEAL THE WORLDSimilar video to `` Man In The Mirror '' , only here Mike is completely absent.More or less a PSA for Mike 's Heal The World foundation dealing with children from poverty and violence ridden areas looking for a world of peace.A noble cause if not the strongest video here.I am not going to nitpick that many videos such as `` She 's Out Of My Life '' , '' Dirty Diana '' , '' Leave Me Alone '' , '' In The Closet '' , '' Jam '' , '' You Rock My World '' and the `` Ghost '' feature lengh video are n't included on either video set . Well ... ..if these videos interest anybody there may be a HIstory Video Set Vol # 3 coming our way fairly soon .	1
I think that this is a wonderful dvd . I especially love how it has the long versions of `` Black or White '' `` The Way You Make me Feel '' , and I definitley love the 18 minute version of `` Bad '' that is on this dvd . I think that this is a good collection of videos , and I love every single video on this dvd .	1
There is nothing to say about Michael Jackson , nothing I can say . If you do n't like Michael Jackson , you do n't like music . A performer better than Elvis . The best performer that I 've ever seen . This video is an amazing compilation of his ability to sing and dance .	1
I absolutely loved this video ! ! ! Although there were a lot of videos I already own , but I never get tired of those and the ones I do n't have is always a welcome addition to my collection .	1
great video to have for al the Michael Jackson fans	1
As far as I am concerned , all the MJ videos are must haves . It will help me show my grandchildren what they missed by being born after MJ was gone .	1
Michael Jackson is a Pop Culture Icon known around the world . Everything on this DVD is his best - from his beginings to the present and a few surprises as well.Watching him and his Docuvideos and then the actual multi-million dollar videos themselves will make you wonder where his energy comes from.The vidoes are sharp and exciting and filled with special effects . The one overwelming observation that can be made is that Micahael loves children.I really liked this DVD .	1
this is just one half of a perfect two cd mix and it is one of the best of any of mjs products.get the greatest hits cd two , it is even better .	1
not only has his music been a real treat but his videos as well.they have taken the concept to greater heights.his vision & amp ; dancing are still major events as far as i 'm concerned.he was already bad musically and then came video and he ran away with it.folks might not want to fess up but alot of folks rock on his style .	1
I bought this as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loves MJ . As usual he does not disappoint with his fancy moves and creative music . Although I bought this as a gift , I have enjoyed it for myself . This is a true collectible item and you also get the opportunity to view the entire video . There are parts shown in this DVD that I did not know were part of the video . MJ had the ability to turn each song into a theatrical performance . Great gift for all music lovers .	1
Ok , somehow I missed Pink Floyd . I 've still never heard `` Dark Side of the Moon '' in its entirety . But lately , I 've been noticing certain songs like `` Comfortably Numb '' and `` Wish You Were Here . '' And they are GOOD . This DVD came out of a local library and I was stunned by the visuals . Really trippy . Now I know why people used to say Pink Floyd was a great headphone band . Everybody is really old now in this film , but they can still play great . I 'm going back into Pink Floyd to see what else I 've missed all these years .	1
It took Pink Floyd 10 years to put this out on DVD , but it was worth the wait . I own the original VHS , and the video quality on this is excellent , nicely enhanced from the original video tapes . The sound mixing is awsome coming through a 5.1 system The packaging is very slick , with a promo post-card for David Gilmore 's solo album `` on an island '' and then a very intricate map of the menus of the DVD . Sure it is odd that they split up the concert onto 2 dvd 's , but the continuity to the original 2 cd set is a neat concept , because they added bonus features to both discs to compliment them . Overall , the original concert footage is 145 minutes , the total runtime is about 4 hours of footage and Concert . Too bad they chose to shoot this in a 4:3 aspect instead of widescreen film when they did it orignially . Say Goodbye to Life as We know it is a neat feature , and the `` Wish You Were Here '' with Billy Corgan is also interesting . There are also promo videos for `` take it back '' and `` learning to fly '' tucked away on the discs , and a `` bootlegging the bootleggers '' section . Just a well done set of discs , and currently going at a great value from 12-16 dollars at different places . Get it while the getting is good .	1
Great show , disc two is the best , with all of Dark Side Of The Moon and a great version of Comfortably Numb . David Gilmour is simply one of the all time great guitarists . The stage and lighting for this show are simply spectacular ! The image quality is very good , considering it was originally filmed on video . The sound is excellent , I dont have a 5.1 Surround system , but it sounds awesome in plain old stereo . Yes , I could nitpick about some things , the tempos are rushed on some of the old tunes and the extra percussionist guy is a little annoying . Overall though , all the tunes are very well done.Lots of cool extras , like the ability to watch the screen films by themselves.If you will bear with me I am going to address the age old argument about whether this is really Pink Floyd , without Roger Waters on stage . It is true that Waters wrote all the great lyrics and came up with the concepts . However , the classic `` Pink Floyd sound '' has little to do with Waters . It is David Gilmour , Richard Wright and Nick Mason . Here is a direct quote from Waters in Musician magazine in 1992 : `` I was never a bass player . I 've never played anything . I play guitar a bit on the records and would play bass , because I sometimes want to hear the `` sound '' I make when I hit a string on a bass with a pick or my finger ; it makes a different sound than anybody else makes , to me . But I 've never been interested in playing the bass . I 'm not interested in playing instruments and I never have been ... '' In fact , Gilmour played bass on a lot of the studio recordings ( One Of These Days , Pigs , to mention a few ) ! So there you have it folks . Yes , this IS Pink Floyd playing Pink Floyd music , with lyrics by Roger Waters . Give Roger his due , but it is absolute rubbish to say that these guys are not Floyd witout Waters . End of rant.If you like Pink Floyd , you will love this DVD . If you are not a fan , you will be after watching this . Buy it !	1
Who needs Rodger Waters ? ? ? this DVD is so good without him . David Gilmour is great , his guitar work is awesome , glad to see Richard Wright at the keyboards and Nick Mason really plays great . I only wish they would tour again but I guess I will just watch this DVD and enjoy some of the greatest music ever written . Wish they would have played some songs off Animals , but you cant always get what you want . Highly recommended for Floyd fans ... ..	1
Been a Floyd fan for over 30 years , and PULSE is too amazing to accurately describe . Once you start it , you watch it all because you quickly become 'under the infuence ' of this band even without all the original members . It has everything , new and old stuff . And if you remember when Dark Side of the Moon came out - and how awesome that album was - disc two of Pulse is that album but on DVD with mind-blowing visual effects ! ! These guys talent has only improved over the years so you 'll be bugg-eyed like a Chihuahua in heat when you see it .	1
I would wait for a decent DVD of Pulse than have them rush out a deficient , half-assed release.Please stop your whining . I have waited 20 years for the Rush ... Exit Stage Left DVD , but I still have a copy on VHS . It 's not like none of you have NEVER seen this concert.PF will do us right . I am dissappointed , but , once again , let them do this one right .	1
Simply put , this is the best there is in large-venue concert production . ( If you prefer smaller venues , you may also want to pick up the David Gilmour in Concert DVD . ) Even though the promised DVD of PULSE has n't yet arrived , it 's very apparent what a work of art the well-coordinated light show was , and Mr. Thorgerson 's beautiful videos are also outstanding , and surreal.It 's clear from this that Pink Floyd is not at all a destroyed band , but one very much alive . The video allows for a close-up glimpse of the band in addition to the light display , that might be lost to the audience at the actual concert . For that it may even surpass the concertgoing experience for those who prefer a more intimate musical experience . At times it may seem that the younger touring musicians are more & quot ; into it & quot ; than the band , but then Pink Floyd has always been more reserved than some . The Floyd members show their passion in subtler ways . If anybody in the band has a tendency to be visibly animated , surprisingly enough ( or is it ? ) it 's the softspoken keyboardist Richard Wright , who reacts very clearly to the music. & quot ; But if I have the audio CD , should I buy this too ? & quot ; Absolutely ! Even though most of the tracks are similar in style , on some the combination of light and sound heightens the experience . Also , the video-only tracks are well worth hearing . But perhaps the most stunning difference is in & quot ; Sorrow & quot ; . While the CD version takes a more mournful , softer approach , the video version is a hard-rocking tune that draws the most passionate playing out of all three members . If David Gilmour and Nick Mason are on fire , then Richard Wright is positively explosive on this song . Letting loose with a screaming , uncharacteristically aggressive Hammond assault , one almost wonders if the keys will survive such a performance ( especially given the fire in his eyes ! ) .The only thing at all lacking on the video is the picture quality , which although good , is not up to modern standards of clarity . Hopefully the upcoming DVD will rectify this . Even considering this limitation , I ca n't possibly lower a hard-earned 5 star rating !	1
Sound quality is very good.Picture quality is very average ( and this is not a compliment ) .Yuo may be a hardcore Waters fan but this show is highly engaging and entertaining.I liked it a lot .	1
My favorite version of PF included David , Roger , Nick and Rick , and I 'd be thrilled if they reformed to record again . Never cared much for the Syd stuff but I have immense respect for those that do . Pulse and Delicate Sounds of Thunder are sorely missing Roger 's vocals , but the situation is what it is and I am still very grateful to have a PF dvd involving the other three . And were they generous with the extras on this dvd or what ? ? May I also suggest Roger Waters solo cd 's , especially The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking . Eric Clapton 's guitar is great ... A superb cd.Someone called David Gilmour a session guitarist ? Wow that 's like calling the bible a paperback book , or Pink Floyd 's The Wall `` just a cd '' ! That man plays the most emotional guitar I 've ever heard , and his voice is perfect for Floyd ( along with Roger 's ) . And as for Roger Waters , what an incredible writer , and his voice is unique and outstanding ! I can not begin to say how many times and to what depth his voice , lyrics and music have deeply , deeply touched my soul like no other music.I salute all of Pink Floyd - Syd , Roger , Nick , Rick and David ! God bless them all and may we be blessed with more of their recordings ! ! !	1
Fantastic music with a Big show.But where are the easter eggs ?	1
This dvd is quite good . It would have been much better if it was redone in blu ray format with the upgraded sound .	1
Stellar light show , awesome performance from one of the greatest classic rock bands . Pink Floyd seems to get better with age !	1
I had been following this release for about 5 years now or so and finally I heard it was released ! ! I grabbed it up , ( for 16.99 I might add with a five dollar rebate.. ) I saw the concert on VHS and shhh ... bootleg , but the concert and sound is great . You have many choices in the sound categories . The screenshots are true pink floyd films , great for everything from pondering reality to pulling out the old college hukka from the attic.One downside though ... the documentary on the crew and bootlegging the bootleggers is lame to say the least . Its a bunch of crew members in their spare time filming stupid stuff and rough cuts of the concert from the audience ... both very poor and a waste of time.But ... but besides those two things this is a must have for everyone who is into music period . Highly suggested ! ! *****	1
Finally available on July 11th now I can replace the worn out vhs tape .	1
The VHS was great , the DVD will be spectacular . Now the problem -when can you puchase it ? Hmmmmmmmmm . After checking reliable sites worldwide ( including all international Amazon sites ) , the releases date varies from as early as 1-31-2006 to 5-26-2006 ( the majority seem to say mid February ) .So , 2010 ? Nope . That 's an Amazon default when they do n't know the release date . It will be out this year , but keeps getting pushed back due to authoring and quality issues . Nevertheless , when all is finished , it will be THE DVD release of 2006 . Way too long in the making agreed , but it will be worth the wait.As of this point , I 'm going with February 24th ; we 'll see if I 'm right ... ... ... ... ... ... .	1

This cd is one of the best pink floyd dvd the music was great and the effects were awesome it was almost like being there . I am a big fan of floyd and I highly recommend this dvd its fantastic . It had alot of the songs from the dark side of the moon which is my favorite cd . I throughly enjoyed it and I know you will to if you are a big fan like me .	1
Esperamos bastante por este DVD pero vali & oacute ; la pena . Mi calificaci & oacute ; n : Concierto : ExcelenteCalidad de Sonido : Muy BuenaCalidad de Video : BuenaExtras : Muy Buenos	1
Just to clarify those video details . As an ex-editor I can tell you this was probably shot on a ( at the time ) broadcast quality Betacam cameras . The biggest problem was that because of the spectacular light show which will range from a few lights to a lot of lights , sometimes the gain on the cameras is so high it 's more grainy than it should be . But only sometimes ! Basically , when it 's low light a camera will artifically 'enhance ' the video , and the side-affect is grain . And sometimes the Pink Floyd light show is low , so the camera compensates , and then next thing you know the lights are way up and the quality of the video is n't grainy at all because the camera doesnt have to compensate . Does that make sense ? So compared to David Gilmor 's or Roger Waters ' solo dvds the quality is n't AS GOOD , but it 's a vast improvement on VHS days still.But the audio is great ! Althought this new Dolby Digital higher bitrate soundtrack is n't playable on my somewhat new Denon DVD/DVD-Audio/SACD player which is a bit perplexing . But the mixing is great . I thought they would just put people cheering in the rear channels of the surround mix , but they 've actually put music back there . It 's like listening to a Super Audio CD in 5.1 surround , but with video ! And someone earlier said the inflatable 'pigs ' have been cut out of the film . I 'm glad to tell you that they are in plain sight ( and cut to shots of a little more frequently than what I would have liked ) during the non-Pulse-CD-track : 'One of these days ' at the end of disc 1 . They do n't float down , but just sit there . I vaguely remember a pig floating in the Delecate Sound of Thunder concert video ... .maybe thats what they were thinking of.Oh , and before I go I got ta say the editing in general is a bit poor for those interested in the techicality of making the music . As someone who loves Dave Gilmor 's artistry with the guitar I found the shots were way too short of Dave . And rarely did they focus on his hands while playing except for when it was just simple pieces . When he is on the slide guitar for instance , most of the shots are dedicated to the light show . Great to look at sure , but I would have preferred looking at Dave get right into the music and make those 'guitar expessions ' when he gets to the high notes . I just do n't think the editing was really in synch with the feel of the songs .	1
This video is absolutely amazing . I did n't think that at first when I bought it , though . The salesman said it was a pale imitation of their previous concerts . He is solid proof that most PF fans use drugs ... ( j/k : ) As soon as I saw & quot ; Shine On , You Crazy Diamond & quot ; for the first time , I knew this would be the best concert I 'd ever likely see . The rest of the concert confirmed that . & quot ; Shine On ... & quot ; is incredible , as is & quot ; Learning to Fly & quot ; . & quot ; High Hopes & quot ; is stunning . The rest just gets better , including & quot ; Dark Side of the Moon & quot ; live -- all of it . Not to mention the encores , which has more lighting effects than the Eiffel Tower did on New Year's*.So hurry out to your local video store and purchase this video . Overnight shipping is too long to wait for Pulse ! G'night to you ! *well , almost : )	1
Do n't buy this for the spectacle . ( It IS worth that investment , the video/film debate notwithstanding . ) Buy it for the writing , the music , the performances , and the slice of history that never will be repeated . Especially with the passing of Richard Wright , Pulse is a monument to Pink Floyd 's musicianship , their singular accomplishment as an act , and a body of work like no other .	1
... of all of the music/concert DVD 's I own , and that numbers in the 100 's . This is the mother of all rock concert videos . Production , in sound and visually , is off the charts . It grabs you by your privates and does not let go until the ending credits . David and the boys ( no Syd of course , no Roger either ) have never sounded and played better . I saw this concert live in New Orleans and I would give that experience of a lifetime up to own this video if I had to make a choice . If you love PF , buy it NOW ; if you like PF buy it now , if you think you like PF buy it now , and if you just like one or two PF songs ... ..buy it NOW ! ! Crank it up and let the 5.1 take over . View it alone the first time , it is a rock religious experience ! All the eras and periods of the Floyd are represented . `` Shine on you Crazy Diamond '' as the opener will peel your scalp back . If it does not , then check your own `` Pulse '' , you are dead ... ... . !	1
I give this disc 5 stars because it is the best sample of Gilmour doing what he does availabel on DVD.Lets first start with the video quality . To correct the last reviewer this is a 4:3 DVD NOT 16:9 . When stretched out to 16:9 the video is decent , but not great . Dont expect a R.W . In The Flesh Live type of video quality . This concert was recorded on video instead of film , and that is a mistake . Never the less you wont be disappointed with the results of the digital remastering.The sound quality is amazing . The band is tight and very talented . This disc is more of a Gilmour production then Pink Floyd . He is clearly the star of the show and does almost all of the singing.The first disc is almost completely Division Bell and Momentary Lapse material . If thats your bag you will love that disc . I prefer the older and deeper Floyd sound . However Gilmour makes the newer Floyd material amazing when heard and seen live . A major complement to the various talents of this great performer . The second half is Dark Side and some classics for the encoure including the best version of Run Like Hell you 'll hear . I saw Gilmour this year and this disc does a great job of recreating the experience . I highly recommend this disc but In The Flesh Live is a better disc with better songs .	1
When I purchased this DVD I had high hopes . I thought the concert was great especially the lasers , special effects , and screen films . The biggest highlight for me though was when they performed `` The Dark Side of the Moon '' in its entirety.However I felt some of the bonus material was unnecessary such as the footage from their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , which I thought was bland . I also did n't care for Billy Corgan 's speech . I also did n't like the footage from `` Bootlegging The Bootleggers '' . It was terrible ! Despite these setbacks the rest of the DVD was incredible . Even without the extras this still would have been a great DVD . Wish Roger was there .	1
I love this DVD , ca n't get enough of Pink Floyd .	1
I own about 25 concert dvd's- blues , historical , guitar players , rock and metal and this is by far the best dvd I have ever watched . The light show alone is worth the cost 2 times over . The song list is great and the quality of sound and video is exceptional . The only one close to this would be Rush in Rio . I practically had an out of body experience watching this , levitated , and was taken to infinity . Amazing !	1
I was fortunate enough to attend Pink Floyd during this tour and must say it was the best concert I 've ever seen . At the end of the concert when Gilmour is playing the extended solo at the end of Comfortably Numb and the huge disco ball rises up and cascades the audience with lights is one of the coolest things I 've ever seen . You can relive this experience on these DVD 's or experience it for the first time if you missed it . The DVD 's are high quality footage of a great , long , Pink Floyd concert that you can put in anytime you want to escape to the Dark Side of the Moon . There are a few extra features that are worthwhile on these discs also , quite a bargain for the price , highly recommended .	1
I followed Pink Floyd on `` The Division Bell '' tour through all of their California dates , and those concerts were among the happiest moments in my life . No joking -- Floyd took me on an inrcedible journey . It was an ethereal , almost un-Earthly journey : the moment they opened with `` Astronomy Domine '' ; ended the first half with the incredible inflateable pigs in `` One Of These Days '' ; began the second half with a visual trip through space with `` Shine On You Crazy Diamond '' ; and ... well , basically everything else . I 'm not a big fan of concert DVDs , but this will be a must-have . No doubt , this will leave me wanting to see it again and again .	1
Which means we will never have a blu-ray high def version of this great show and we 're lucky to even have it on DVD . While I am somewhat of a Floyd purist and consider this to be a bit of Pink Fraud , I still love the performance and sound and the show . Roger Waters WAS the lyrical genious that made most of this possible , but I guess I 'll have to still be limited to this show and the few others . ABSOLUTELY perfect reason that these guys need to pull together before they are eligible for Social Insecurity , which is soon , and put on one more tour so we can get the Mighty Floyd on HD . Yes , the voices probably wo n't be as fresh , but its effing Pink Floyd which is so far better at their lows than any of the garbage out there these days.Part of an older review that I wrote : Now for the negative . I have to give this 5 stars for the show and music . However , Roger Waters is largely responsible for who this band is . It is hard for me to accept them without him . The post Waters stuff is right around mediocre usually and has some bright spots . I guess it was the lawyers that say they can call this band Pink Floyd . They are still great live because a lot of the hard work , Waters ' vision , writing and other stuff is already done . They are still phenomial live because they ARE great musicians and can sure put on a great show with excellent sound and visuals .	1
What a great DVD set . Especially considering that it was recorded in 1994 when the audio/visual technology was still far from the high def/digital audio available today . The picture quality is crystal clear , and the audio has been enhanced to provide you with two Dolby 5.1 choices ( 448kbps & 640kbps ) . The sound is incredible , especially with the 640 option . A stereo option is also available if you do n't have a Surround system.Enough of the technicalities ... the performance was spectacular . David Gilmour , Nick Mason and Richard Wright were all perfect . 8 others joined the band , including Guy Pratt who filled in the gaping duet hole for Roger Waters in Run Like Hell.Disk one , or should I say Pulse One , features Shine On You Crazy Diamond , Learning to Fly , High Hopes , Take It Back , Coming Back to Life , Sorrow , Keep Talking , Another Brick in the Wall ( part 2 ) , and One of These Days.Pulse Two is The Dark Side of the Moon disk . You get : Speak to Me , Breathe in the Air , On the Run , Time , The Great Gig in the Sky , Money , Us and Them , Any Colour You Like , Brain Damage , Eclipse , Wish You Were Here , Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell.There are tons of bonuses that include screen films , Bootlegging the Bootleggers and other shorts ... 2 hours of bonus material in total.Everything is here that a Pink Floyd fan could want ... except Roger Waters . What a shame that whole thing is . How I wish ... how I wish you were here.But rest assured that this is an absolutely amazing and fulfilling show . No expense was spared on the theatrics either . Very cool lights , video and stage . And everything from the performance to the stage show is captured expertly ... especially the performance . The video never jumps around before you have a chance to take the shot in ; you feel like you 're sitting in the front row ... not watching a DVD.I 'm not the biggest Pink Floyd fan out there . I do n't have all their albums ; I have the studio versions of the recordings that any rock fan has . But let me just say that I was blown away by this DVD release.It goes without saying that true Pink Floyd fans do n't need to be told to add this upgrade to DVD from video to their collection . It might need to be said that if you 've ever listened to Pink Floyd or enjoy their music at all that this DVD needs to be added to any rock fan 's cart . It is superb , and a valuable addition to any music collection.Buy it !	1
Is the release date someone 's idea of a joke ? I 'm sure glad I ponied up the $ 50 for the bootleg . It beats fastforwarding and/or rewinding !	1
I want it . I 'll have it . End of discussion . I 've had the VHS for years . It 's excellent .	1
I love Pink Floyd but was not able to attend any of their concerts . This dvd gave me the opportunity to see them and it was AWESOME . The sound and video is very clear and it was amazing - especially the light shows - it felt as if I was sitting in the audience . Well worth the purchase if you are a Pink Floyd fan .	1
Good seller , would do business again . Make sure to stipulate , and make clear , you want the US format . Otherwise you might get the PAL version . It was , of course , filmed in London . US and PAL are not compatable , just ask Obama .	1
Swan Princess is a cute movie , but I can see that it 's not quite a Disney epic . The characters seem a bit shallow compared to the better Disney movies . Odette is just a beautiful blonde and Derek is a strapping prince . The sidekicks - a frog , turtle , and puffin - are decent , and the villain gets downright silly . Still , it 's an entertaining princess story and should appeal to young girl . Some of the tunes are really catchy ( such as `` No Fear '' ) .	1
I first saw this movie when I was about eight or nine years old and I loved it , and I still do . It 's a classic fairytale/romance that is very similar to Disney 's `` Sleeping Beauty , '' `` Beauty and the Beast , '' and `` Cinderella '' . Although it is very similar to those movies , it is still original . The theme of loving people for who they are is a vital theme to this movie . The animation is beautiful and the songs are great . I greatly recommend this movie to everyone , especially those with children .	1
I have bought this DVD not too long ago and I absolutely LOVE it . I saw this movie first when I was a little girl . The story is very charming and adorable . I love all the characters . The plot is full of adventure , romance , comedy , and suspense . A very perfect and brilliant blend . I will not give too much away because I dont want to spoil the movie for anyone who has not seen it yet . All I will say is this movie holds a VERY special place in my heart and I am a VERY satisfied customer .	1
Sweet movie for kids and I love it too . True love wins in the end and that is always the best ending . One bad guy tries to take over the kingdom through taking the king 's daughter . The music is so cute and some really funny like `` this is not my idea of fun . ''	1
The claymation is remarkable . Yes , you MUST see it . BUT , the COMEDY is a TREASURE and off the charts FUNNY . WALLACE is an inventor and he invents a pair of MECHANICAL PANTS to put on his dog , GROMIT , so he no longer has to take his dog for a walk ( the pants will do it for him ) . That 's funny enough . BUT WAIT . FEATHERS , the penguin , steals the pants to scale a wall to do a diamond robbery . UNIMAGINABLY HILARIOUS ! ! ! . I was really glad to see every one else who left a review thinks so , as well . YOU MUST SEE THIS . YES , AN ABSOLUTE TREASURE . SO VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Do n't make the mistake of thinking , because this is a cartoon , it is for children , only . Kids will like it , but it is , absolutely , for adults , as well.A 1993 ACADEMY AWARD WINNER .	1
This looks to be the best collection of Wallace and Gromit short films yet . First off all of the films will have a commentary by Nick Park . This should be a treat for fans . You also get a number of documentaries : - `` Amazing Adventures of Wallace & Gromit '' featurette- `` Inside The Wrong Trousers '' featurette- `` How It Was Done '' featurette- `` How They Donut '' The Making of A Matter of Loaf and Death featuretteYou also get an episode of Shaun the Sheep : `` Off The Baa '' and all ten of the Cracking Contraptions shorts that aired on the BBC website and AtomFilms back in 2002 . Technical aspects include MPEG-4 AVC video in 1080p with Dolby Digital 2.0 audio.Just a little bad news . It looks like it 's confirmed that the short film `` A Close Shave '' is the altered version that does n't have the Happy Birthday song in it . Instead of that song another one is dubbed just like in the WB DVD release . Kinda sucks that they wo n't pony up the royalties to make this disk as true to the original broadcast as possible . Oh well ... it 's a small detail.If you like Wallace and Gromit and have any of their previous disks this collection may be worth the double dip .	1
I am partial to Wallace & Gromit because it 's heartwarming and beautiful story telling . The characters are endearing and unforgettable . Great Family entertainment , you will want to watch again & again .	1
Cyndi is so cool . This Cd is fun and so great those of us who have seen her in person know that not only is the CD awesome but so is she ... Support this artist buy a truck load ! !	1
ive always loved cyndi lauper and her music ever since i was a kid , and especially since growing up in the 1980s , she and madonna were pretty much all i listened to back then.. i was always wondering if there was a video collection for her , so then i stumbled on to it through here . i own the cd version of this particular dvd , and i must say , this collection is pretty darn accurate and wonderful in the simple fact alone that it showcases cyndi laupers older videos and some of more recent ones as well ... the only part of this dvd i could do without are the interviews interlaced throughout the videos , as i find them a bit boring and takes away from the good material , but its not that big of a deal.. some of my favorite videos on here are true colors , sallys pigeons , thats what i think , which is a live video , and a couple more which i cant think of right now , but overall , its a must have for any true cyndi lauper fan , and the only music video collection available as far as i know ... great price too.. deffintiley check it out ... ..	1
So I netflixed this , man am I glad I did . The sound quality is incredible as is the song selection . The video is great for something that was filmed in 1980 , you can tell they really cleaned it up , and the many different camera shots made me feel I was right there . The Skits in between were fun , the cameo bits with the band members.The best part of this DVD ? The special features . The 5-6 extra songs included are the best ones on the DVD ! If you 're a fan just go get this . Really great show - although I think it 's a compilation of different nights - not sure about that.Either way , a very unique and entertaining Dead DVD .	1
The release of `` Grateful Dead : Dead Ahead '' to the DVD format has brought a flood of liquid memories coursing through the various synapses in my brain . I had originally gotten on 'the Bus ' ( with gusto ! ) at a Merriweather '82 concert . Thus begun my `` Looong Strange Triiipp '' of following Jerry & the boys during the Ronald Raygun ( ZAP ! ) years of the '80s . I have hazy college memories of duping a VHS to VHS copy of `` Dead Ahead '' at an off campus apartment , not far from Towson State University.Fast forward over twenty years later . There 's now a lot less hair on top of my head and a bit more ( O.K . a lot more ) belly on my frame ( Shades of Jerry ! ) . Still lovin ' the Dead , but I 'm getting a little snobby in my old age , mainly listening to their '70s material these days . I 'm taking down the family Halloween decorations , while my brand new copy of `` Dead Ahead '' is hitting the DVD laser . This grabs my 4 year old 's attention , because the TV lights up with an opening , trippy montage of band members , skeletons and other symbols ( which fascinates him ) . For those not up on their Dead History , in 1980 the Grateful Dead did a month long stint at both the Warfield in S.F . and Radio City Music Hall in NYC . `` Dead Ahead '' captures a Holloween night , when the band kicks back on the Radio City stage ( made up like a folksy , country porch at dusk ) and reaches back to their folk/jugband roots with acoustic instruments . Thats right ! The Dead were going unplugged , way before it became hip and the insideus weasles in the MTV Marketing Dept . co-opted the concept . Well as I 'm getting my work done ( with one eye on the TV ) I suddenly realize that I 'm humming the tunes and getting into the show ! There are just beautiful versions of songs like `` Uncle John 's Band '' and `` Ramble on Rose '' . I especially love Jerry 's guitar parts on `` Bird Song '' , which just seem to magically go on forever . By the time `` Ripple '' ends the acoustic portion of the show , I 'm in DeadHead Heaven ! Bravo GD ! The rest of the show is an electric set , which pretty much sums up the band 's '80s concerts . It features fine versions of `` Lost Sailor/St . of Circumstance '' , `` Franklin 's Tower '' and `` Fire on the Mt '' . Emceeing the show is SNL comedy team 'Franken & Davis ' . While they might not be everyone 's 'cup of tea ' I always found their persnickity , smart a** sense of humor , to be right on target to the Grateful Dead sensibility . I especially found their 'Henry Kissinger gets caught bootlegging a GD show ' ( featuring Mr. Bill Kreutzmann ) bit , pretty darn hilarious ! As for the DVD itself , not too bad . Love the DVD menus featuring the original concert artwork ( infamously hated by the Radio City management ) of two giant skeletons hanging out on the iconic venue . The picture quality and sound is OK and it 's the best your going to do with over twenty year old video tape . The DVD 's bonus section features 50 more minutes of material , not included in the show 's original release . This includes a beautiful acoustic/instrumental version of Bob Weir 's `` Heaven Help the Fool '' ( which I always thought of as a vastly underrated song ) . For a laid back evening of wonderful music , I highly recommend `` Grateful Dead : Dead Ahead '' .	1
I was 21 in 1980 , and I managed to snag tickets for two shows of this run : the 31st , and one other , maybe the second or third show . For the 31st - where most of this was filmed - I had pretty good seats around the 10th row on the side.Having seen the Dead in a number of venues , from the Palladium to MSG and Nassau Coliseum , it was a real treat to see them at Radio City . But on top of that , hearing them play acoustic sets , the first time they did so since 1970 , and pretty much the last time ever , was awesome . While the band phoned in a lot of the electric stuff - you can see from the songs on this DVD that the setlist was pretty sedate , with no real jamming - they were on when they played the acoustic sets . The Reckoning album is certainly one of the best live Dead albums , and the re-release with a second disc is even better than the first one , which I had on LP back in the day.In any case , the band was clearly enjoying this show , and it 's worth getting for the acoustic set , even though it 's kind of short on the video compared to what they played live . With so little good footage of the Dead from the 70s , this remains one of the only documents of the tie - together with the Grateful Dead Movie , and especially the bonuses , and the Closing of Winterland . ( The Closing of Winterland is a much better show , with a real strong setlist . ) It 's a shame that so little was filmed back then , especially in the great year of 1972 . But we 'll take what we can get .	1
The picture clarity and camera shots are way better than the Winterland DVD filmed in '78 . The Al Franken skits are a little goofy in the context of modern times ( you have 2b pretty old to remember who da heck Henry Kissinger wuz , dig ? ) But what counts here is da music and it 's supa badazz . Performances are the same ones I believe as the audio release Dead Set ( electric part of the show ) and it 's audio companion , Reckoning ( the 'acoustic ' set ) . Great version of Me and My Uncle . Do n't Ease Me In , great version of Ripple and the old Lovin Spoonful song that was given the 'acoustic ' treatment by da guys , On The Road Again . Also this is the earliest video availiable commercially that documents the Brent Mydland era and he kills it vocally and instrumentally as always ( check his badazz B3 on Little Red Rooster ) Deadheads should get this .	1
If you like early Brent-era Grateful Dead , you 'll love this DVD which finds Jerry and the band in great form . Bobby sports an Izod polo shirt , marking him as the godfather of prep school hippies nationwide .	1
I did n't even know this was out until i heard news about the dvd 's release date . Slayer playing live on their `` Divine Intervention '' tour is perfect since i love that album . I watched all of the concert footage on youtube and it is excellent ! I have n't watched the behind the scenes stuff yet but the concert footage alone is worth it . The dvd comes out in a month or two and its only $ 10 on amazon . Support your Slayer !	1
So fun to watch and relive all the music I grew up with and share it with my kids sure there is some that may not b to appropriate for there age but when they r ready they will watch them but for me its great to watch and exercise with . on A minor note I believe this video was burned since it wo n't play on my PS but does on my DVD	1
the dvd seems to be really nice including janet 's video 's from the early 80 's with her first comercial success `` Control '' The only thing viewers would have liked to see were some of janet 's newer video 's like You want this , If or anytime , anyplace . Due to contact rasons this video 's can not be released because this was a greatest hits compliation made by A & M record not janet 's current label Virgin they came to an aggrement due to the begging of A & m to feature that 's the way love goes on the DVD but none the less this is a good buy . janet has yet to relesase a collection of all her video on a two disc set so to get all the goods you will have to buy this and From janet to damita jo and or the Rhythmn nation compliation to get all the goods	1
When I saw this video for sale a couple of years at the mall , I was so very happy . Most music video compilations feature only three to five songs , in conjunction with a particular album that an artist might be promoting . For example , Janet had already come out with two VHS editions for her 'Control ' videos in 1987 ( out of print ) , and then she also released the 'Rhythm Nation Compilation ' video in 1991.So when I saw this VHS - that is , all of her videos from 'Control ' , all of her videos from 'Rhythm Nation 1814 ' and bonus videos like & quot ; That 's The Way Love Goes & quot ; , & quot ; Runaway & quot ; and & quot ; Oops Now & quot ; , I was sold . She ( or A & amp ; M records ) really did n't have to do this for her fans . Very cool ... Just so you know , the & quot ; Alright & quot ; video on this VHS does not contain the rap break w/Heavy D ; you can only get that version on the 'Rhythm Nation ' compilation video , which I think is a great one to own as well since it contains interviews and other extras . Also , the & quot ; Miss U Much & quot ; on here is the shorter version w/out the brilliant dance sequence incorporating chairs . You 'll have to get the 'Rhythm Nation Compilation ' or the 30 minute short film that came out in 1989 to see it.Thanks for your time ...	1
This DVD version is identical to the original release of DOAD in 1995 . Since it 's not yet released in the UK , I bought the US Version ( which moreover has a different cover to the video cover ) . The DVD contains all the ground-breaking videos off Janet 's Control & amp ; Rhythm Nation albums , plus Runaway & amp ; That 's The Way Love Goes . What is amazing about this DVD is that it chronicles the exceptional contribution that JJ has made to the MTV era , from the streetwise dance of Nasty ( still one of her best ) to the euphoric street carnival of When I Think of You & amp ; to JJ 's solo dance routine in The Pleasure Principal . Then came Rhythm Nation , a veritable candy store of musical & amp ; visual styles . From the ground-breaking chair routine of Miss You Much to the live ! experience of Black Cat & amp ; the ultra-sexy Love Will Never Do , JJ captures the screen with her effervesence , beauty & amp ; exceptional dancing ability . Forever my idol , this DVD will make you appreciate not only the brilliance of DVDs but the briliance of Ms Jackson	1

Pictured here in concert are the Rolling Stones in Miami 's Joe Robbie Stadium in the early '90s . The South Florida crowd really enjoyed this concert , as you will see and the old codgers - the Stones - did n't disappoint , putting on yet another entertaining show.I do n't remember all the details but I remember this concert was a bit on a raunchy side , with Jagger french-kissing - or pretending to - one of his backup singers during the show and more than a few sexual gyrations by a few people on stage ... .more than normal.Other than that , it was the usual exhibit of the incredible vitality the group still has at these performances . One wonders when they peaked , or is that yet to come ? Almost all the songs here are good , even if they are so familiar . Facially they make look like they 're near the end but `` Not Fade Away '' is appropriate opening number because that describes this band .	1
This is an excellent concert film . I wish that more songs performed on the tour would be on this DVD . I attended 3 concerts on this tour and this film captures some very happy memories for me .	1
I have always been a fan of Mariah 's but I have to say that when this video came out she was definetely at the high point in here career . Vocally , artistically , and mentally . She performed her best songs ( not only at the time , but even out of the ones she does today ) live . I am still a fan but I am not as devoted as I was back in the day before the Rainbow album . I still think she is a fantastic singer , especially when compared to many of todays non-singing Britney 's , Mandy 's , Heather 's , Buffy 's and Kim 's . But admittedly , she is not as amazing as she was in the mid 90 's . Her voice was absolutely fantastic only rivaled by Whitney and Celine . At that time in her career , she had a superior vocal range of any other singer hitting her trademark `` whistle notes '' as well as singing in a lower range than most female singers could . She also had a power in her voice that she only uses sparingly today . Now she whispers through most of her songs until the end where she tries to blow you away with a bunch of vocal runs and screechy sounding whistle notes . In addition to her voice being of better quality back then , she also sang more skillfully by holding notes longer and not going crazy with all of the riffs and runs . Contrary to what another reviewer said , Mariah Carey not only did not lip synch this performance , but she has never lip synched her songs . She has occasionally used a backing track that she sings over ( particularly in recent years ) but she always showcases her true voice . You can tell because she sounds different every time she sings a particular song than she did the last time ( sometimes better , sometimes worse ) . The quality of this video sounds like studio because it has been processed and edited but the performance was clearly live because she ad libs , and improvises many notes and runs . She does n't do much dancing in the video so there would have been no need for her to lip synch anyway . I wish that Mariah would go back to singing ballads , and up tempo pop songs that she was so good at . I love hip-hop and R & B music , but that is not what I want from Mariah . She needs to go back to showcasing her vocal and songwriting skills that made her famous instead of whispering her way through lame hip-hop songs with sampled music and tired rappers . She also needs to be more conservative in her appearance now that she is getting a little older instead of trying to be the sexy temptress . At this point Christina Aguilera not only sings better than Mariah , but is more convincing and tolorable as the [ ... ] . With that said , this is a fantastic video and if you are a fan of Mariah and/or great singing , you wo n't be dissapointed with it .	1
We recently viewed this video again after several years , and it was worth viewing over and over . The show is elaborate but not over done , and Mariah sings the songs that first brought her to the top.I was convinced for a while that Mariah was average , but after seeing American Idol and hearing her on the radio again , I know that few women are blessed with her voice . My taste is heavy rock , and I bought this video years ago for my wife , but I am so glad we kept this video . Talent is talent . I know many of the songs are remakes - good choices and very well done.I am sure if you are an old Mariah Carey fan you will especially like this performance - sold out Madison Square Gardens .	1
With no regard to other aspects of her career , of which I know nothing , Fantasy proves a fine showcase for a personable singer with the gospel sound in her voice . The 60 minute duration allows no time for a letdown or lull in entertainment quality as the star and a sizable cast sing and dance their way into one 's favor . Ears unaccustomed to the intonations of the voice , which sacrifices clarity to vocal embellishment , in the common modern mode , will still find pleasure in the performance . Whether one enjoys the brief insertions of the star `` up front and personal '' is a matter of taste . There are not enough to cause a measurable degree of frustration for most viewers . Over-all , a show easy to recommend .	1
I consider this to be the best TV show-concert she ever released ( before the Butterfly ERA ) . My VHS is old and shabby , I am happy they released this finally ! MAKE IT HAPPY is the best ! I also love OPEN ARMS and WITHOUT YOU ! I can play it over and over . She sound amazingly LIVE better than in a studio ! This is a great catch DVD ! 5 STARS !	1
... I 've seen so many stars change for the worst at pivotal points in their careers ; Mariah is one of them . The & quot ; Around the World Video & quot ; ca n't even remotely compete with this stunning performance . The power and emotion expressed in these songs by her could never be reproduced ( there are points in the video where she seems to be posessed , at the end of a few songs it looks like she is snapping out of a hypnotism ) . Everything about her was beautiful at this time , but now ... I do n't even consider myself a fan anymore . The new and improved , & quot ; trendy & quot ; Mariah Carey is just a prime example of an artist making the wrong decision . The hip-hop attitude just does n't fit her . I was still listening to her until the & quot ; Around the World & quot ; video . I was so happy to think that I was going to get to see her perform songs of the & quot ; Butterfly & quot ; album ( her last good album ) . But the sultry dancing and lip-syncing just do n't work well with Mariah . I 'm sorry Mariah , but you 've lost this fan ( I 'm only one of 1,000,000,000 other & quot ; band-wagoneers & quot ; out there so it wo n't hurt that bad ) . She states that she is making up for lost time , but in reality she 's just trying to create a new image to sell more records . & quot ; If it ai n't broke ... do n't fix it ! & quot ;	1
Synopsis : Young French boy discovers a red balloon on the streets of Paris . When he discovers the balloon is too large to take on the bus he decides to walk to his destination . His new acquisition is soon noticed by a group of bullies who desire the balloon for themselves and a chase ensues . Will the boy get away with his balloon intact ? What eventually happens is both bittersweet and unexpected . It 's truly the stuff from which delightful day dreams are made.Critique : For me , the charming little '56 French film ` The Red Balloon ' carries with it fond memories of grammar school . Whenever it was too rainy outside for recess the student body would be gathered into the cafeteria to watch a short film or a couple of cartoons . Without question the film most requested by the young audience was ` The Red Balloon . 'It had been at least forty years since my last viewing of this childhood classic . I 'm happy to say that it still possesses all the charm and childhood wonder as it had upon its initial release fifty years ago . Looking at the streets of Paris as they were in the mid-fifties is a delight all its own serving as a mini-time capsule of a more innocent , nave time in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. ` The Red Balloon ' is waiting to enchant a whole new generation of viewers ! This is definitely a film that belongs in every child 's DVD collection .	1
I first saw this movie when I was a college student nearly half a century ago . The images from this short ( approximately 34 minute ) film have stayed with me all these years . What a beautiful tribute it is to the joys of childhood and the wonderful pleasure that something so simple as a balloon can give to a child . This is a wonderful movie not only for children but also for adults , for it reaches into our hearts and reawakens that carefree love of our surroundings we had when we were young . No wonder it remains a widely-watched movie after all these years . It is truly a classic .	1
Review To : '' The Red Balloon '' ( Janus Films , in assoc . w/The Criterion Collection ) ( DVD ) -- ASIN : B0012Z361MAs I write this on 16-Apr-2008 , [ But See Below ! ] this DVD has not yet been released , so I obviously am not reviewing the actual DVD itself . However , I just saw `` The Red Balloon '' on our local cable system ( that 's why I 'm on this page ! ) . What MEMORIES that film brings back ! And what an ADORABLE story ! As you watch it , DO look for one of THE most memorable scenes in the film , early on , when the Boy ( about six years old ) leaves school to find the Balloon waiting for him . It 's raining , so the Boy dashes from passerby to passerby , each of whom graciously shelters his Balloon beneath their umbrellas ! I swear , that has GOT to be one of THE Cutest , THE Sweetest , and THE Most Adorable scene in any short film , EVER ! : ) Additional post-review NOTES:1 . I did finally purchased this DVD on Thu. , 17-Apr-2008.2 . The original French title to this film is `` Le Ballon Rouge '' , which ( for a wonder ) means exactly and precisely what the English title says it is , except that in French , as in many languages , the adjective follows the noun instead of preceeding it , so if you REALLY want to be literal , it 's `` The Balloon Red '' .3 . According to the liner notes , the Boy 's name is Pascal , and he was six years old at the time of filming .	1
The Red Balloon is a charming , childhood fantasy set in Paris , `` The City of Light . '' This short film is the story of a lonely little French boy who makes friends with a lonely red balloon . The balloon seems to have a mind of its own , waiting for the small boy , following him , and obeying his orders most of the time . The film makes its way with pretty much zero dialogue , and focuses on the lovely visuals . They used to show this film to us in elementary school , and I 'll always remember the scene where the little boy encounters a little girl with a blue balloon , and the balloons want to follow each other as if they were a pair of dogs out on a walk with their owners . The story takes an ugly turn when a group of bullies decide to hunt down the little boy and destroy his balloon , simply because they have nothing better to do . But upon doing so , all the balloons in all of Paris come to the good little boy , to carry him off into the sky , and to who knows where ...	1
Here is a work that transcend story telling , film , time , culture , thoughts and value . It has the ability to move people and collectively capture something so simple and timeless . Every frame and every shot is like a masterpiece painting capturing life 's simplicity . The red balloon is a metaphor for friendship and love . The brilliance of using very little dialogue that worked without coming off gimmicky is a great achievement . The minimal score adds instead of taking away the overall work of art . The film is a pacifist inspiration for many generations to come . The red balloon is a poetic work of beauty and minimalism .	1
This live concert from the Point Theatre in Dublin , Ireland is terrific . The VHS has excellent sound and excellent video . There is great tap dancing with terrific audio . The show is breathtaking , thrilling and visually stunning . The speed and co-ordination of the dancing is wonderful . The show includes:1 . Reel Around The Sun2 . The Heart 's Cry3 . The Countess Cathleen4 . Caoineadh Cu Chulainn - Davy Spillane5 . Distant Thunder6 . Firedance7 . Riverdance8 . Lift The Wings9 . Freedom10 . The Russian Dervish11 . Heartland12 . Riverdance InternationalThis show is starring Michael Flatley , Jean Butler and Maria Pages . It is 71 minutes in length.Live Concert ( Memorial 336/6 )	1
& quot ; Riverdance & quot ; is defintly one of the greatest shows I 've seen . The celtic music and dancing is heavenly . I 'd recommend this to anyone . It 's beautiful . I 'd give it 100 stars if I could !	1
If my daugter was old enough to rate this , she would give it 5 stars . She is 1-1/2 year and loves this video . She asks to watch it several times a day . The short scenes of `` activities '' , such as bending , jumping , and twisting , are appropriate for young toddlers that are not ready for choreographed workouts . The length of the scenes are appropriate for this age group as their attention spans are not very long . It has lots of singing and some `` free-style '' dance and of course the favorite Elmo .	1
This is a great video for anyone who loves performance horror ! Ai n't it dead yet portrays Skinny Puppy in the earlier years before the ultimate masterpiece concert : Last Rites . I wish there was a professionally shot video from that tour . I did manage to pick up the Last Rites video , but not professionally shot . Missing quality . Ai n't it dead yet has the quality in tact . Worth it if you can find it .	1
muppet treasure island is inspired by a certain classic that I 'm sure everyone knows and me and my family enjoyed it.i recdommed this film for anyone who enjoys the muppets .	1
With Pirates being popular , this was a must have in my collection . I thought it was one of the better Muppet DVD 's . It was shipped in the time promised and I am happy with my purchase .	1
I have always enjoyed this film . Only the original Muppet Movie is better . But , the DVD of the Muppet Movie is far superior . Why ? The film is letterbox ! ! Who ever thought of putting this film out nonletterbox should rethink what they are doing .	1
I bought this one as a gift , so I do n't know how it played . It arrived sooner than I thought it would , and it was in excellent shape when it arrived .	1
If you have seen The Muppet Christmas Carol , then you should know to expect that the Muppet Treausre Island , the Muppets are playing the most of the roles , and then human actors take on what ever partes are left , but there are muppet perfomers do these roles , but in the films , you just see the Muppets and they are Dave Goelz , Steve Whitmire , Jerry Nelson , Kevin Clash , and Bill Barretta . Now in Muppet Christmas Carol , it was Michael Caine as Scrooge , in this movie we have Tim Curry as the villian , so I do n't know if somebody seat around the casting office , thinking `` who can I get for the role of Long John Silver ? '' . `` I know how about Tim Curry ? '' . Okay , maybe I don'tr know how Tim Curry got into this project , but he pulls it off , and the hardest thing about the character , is that Long John Silver has only one leg , and humans are born with 2 . We meet our hero off the story Jim Hawkins ( Kevin Bishop ) , at the inn along with Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat , along with some other Muppets in the scene , and Billy Bones ( Billy Connolly ) . And once again they have taken a story and turned it into a musical which means singing . Jim Hawkins works for Mrs. Bluberidge ( Jennifer Saunders ) whom seems to know what ever that happens in her inn , even when she is not in the room , which leaves Jim , Gono , and Rizzo wondering how does she do that . While doing thier choes after closing , a pirates comes to the door looking for Billy Bones , and if you know the story good , you only that he is blind . Once he finds him , is gives him a sheet of a paper with a black spot , which causes Bily Bones to start packing his bags , but he dies while packing . And then more pirtes , break into the inn , looking for Billy Bones , while seting the place of fire . Jim Hawkins , Gonzo , and Rizzo manges to escape , but Mrs. Bluberidge magnes to convice the group , she will be alright . But before his death , Jim Hawkins recieved a map of a treasure from Billy Bones , which is told is in his bag , he sets off to search for a sip so he cna get his treasure , and then as we go along we meet more of the Muppets , the cre of the ship is made up of villians , but there are some good guys around , and then we meet Long John Silver ( Tim Curry ) . Not that I do n't like Tim Curry , and is his a good actor , and he has some villains roles before , including animated movies , and of course maybe he was one of few British actors , that would come abroad this project , since you have to work with Puppets , and who knows how many actors would want to do something like this .	1
The muppets are back , and this time they are sailing on the sea and fighting pirates ! As every other muppet movie , this is a great family film , with lots of laughs , and a few catchy singing numbers . Tim Curry also appears in this movie as Long John Silver . If you 're a muppet fan , you should definitely check this one out !	1
Annie Lennox is the best , and it certainly shows in this DVD . Her band is tight , and she clearly likes to perform . The interviews provide a lot of insight , and the bonus videos are nice . The huge audience at Central Park really got into the show , with lots of folks singing along . A great DVD , and highly recommended . I purchased my copy used on Amazon Marketplace ( It 's out of print ) for a very reasonable price , and the disc was in like-new condition .	1
Annie Lennox is one of modern music 's most gifted vocalists and songwriters . Captured on this DVD live from Central Park , Annie shows the remarkable range of her career - from the cutting edge sounds of Eurythmics to the sophisticated leanings of her recent solo albums . It 's all here in one gorgeous package ! As a bonus , four promotional videos from the & quot ; Medusa & quot ; album are included as well as interview snippets . Watch Annie 's transformation in the interviews from feelings of insecurity about performing live after so long , to exhilaration and amazement after the actual event . A chronicle of her psyche , so to speak . What a prelude to the Eurythmics tour that came just a few short years later !	1
I am an Annie Lennox fan . I enjoy her powerful alto voice and respect her vocal range . I would listen to her sing anything . Because of that , this is a very enjoyable DVD for me . If I try to be objective , it may lack in video presentation and have some audio issues . It was recorded outside and the lighting and stage setting may not impress a lot of people . I also think it takes a while for her to hit the kind of intensity that would impress the less dedicated fan . If you are a hardcore fan , it 's all good , but if you want a spectacular stage show and pristine audio and video , you may want to pass on this one .	1
I 've bought quite a few used videos lately , as the selection is better than what the stores are carrying lately for Sesame Street . This video is a riot and my daughter begs for it almost daily . Set-up like an awards show , the songs `` Fur '' and `` Fuzzy and Blue '' are fun and entertaining even for adults . I like this video because it includes the character Frazzle , who was dropped because he was deemed `` too scary '' to kids . My 2 year old LOVES Frazzle and begs for his song over and over . How 's that for scary ? This video is cute and the songs are fun . From the songs mentioned above to `` C is for Cookie '' this video contains lots of monster fun !	1
... .. but our beloved Boingo 's immortal soul is captured lovingly in this , their final and only video concert recording . Along with generous amounts of concert performance , this two-tape set WHICH SHOULD REALLY BE MADE INTO A DVD ( hint hint MCA ) also includes a bit of Boingo history recap . Some of us in the Los Angeles area were fortunate enough to be witness to Maestro Elfman ' s curiously evolving ensemble , which had its genesis as far back as the mid-70s , and it is indeed unfortunate more of those early years were not captured for posterity.Anyway , along with Frank Zappa 's & quot ; Baby Snakes & quot ; , I would have to call & quot ; Farewell & quot ; the ultimate Halloween party video . The music is also available on CD , but the true Boingo enthusiast would not want to miss out on the live experience . Danny Elfman 's stage presence was always formidable , sometimes imposing ; when you consider this man 's overall musical output , in both rock and film soundtracks , and then watch what he does on stage , his consummate brilliance really hits home . The way he utilizes theatrics , exotic dance moves ( quasi-Balinese on & quot ; I 'm So Bad & quot ; ) and good old bad-boy playing ( his onstage roughhousing with bassist John Avila on & quot ; No One Lives Forever & quot ; ) , elaborate props ( the gargantuan skeletons on & quot ; Dead Man 's Party & quot ; ) , digressive instrumental line ups ( accordion and troubador drum on & quot ; Helpless & quot ; ) , and yes , even the inevitable light show ( on the psychedelic homage & quot ; Change & quot ; ) provides a showmanship that crosses genres , rivals anyone in any style of concert performance.The other members of the ensemble deliver as well : trusty sideman and guitarist Steve Bartek is a low-key , confident performer of controlled intensity ; the horn section of Dale , Leon and Sluggo are a vital element of the Boingo sound , though not on hand for every number , provide that element flawlessly and with high energy , and even the odd vocal ( Sluggo on & quot ; Reptiles and Samurai & quot ; ) ; drummer Johnny Vatos , whose rhythmic precision seemed almost mechanistic in the early days , offers thunderous fluidity in this outing with his own spark of mischief ; and John Avila on bass comes closest to matching Elfman 's stage energy , proving himself an indispensable buffer and contributor to the legend that was Boingo.The familiarity and quality of the song selections depends on how closely one has followed the band . I 'd say they hit most of the winners here , touched on a few obscurities to the delight of the more hardcore ... .. I 'd say they could have gotten away with more of the latter : this being their final bow-out , a three tape set would not have been too long . Overall , this collection is a flawless legacy to an American musical treasure , another one of those that will endure and be rediscovered again and again , because REAL music , regardless of genre trappings , is TIMELESS . The fact that this concert was filmed as opposed to merely taped does it proper honor , and the overall production ranks with works like & quot ; The Last Waltz & quot ; and & quot ; Stop Making Sense & quot ; . & quot ; Farewell & quot ; is a concert , a documentary , a shared event , a transcendent video treasure.It is so deserving of a digital transfer . I think I can speak for all Boingoites in urging & quot ; Farewell & quot ; 's release on DVD . The Mystic Knights command it !	1
GOOSEBUMPS : A NIGHT IN TERROR TOWER includes three episodes of the GOOSEBUMPS tv series from the mid-1990s . `` A Night in Terror Tower '' - Sue and Ed are touring London while their parents are off at some conference . The two children begin seeing things at the Tower that apparently are n't there . They also keep getting behind the rest of the group and soon find themselves being chased by a mysterious man in black . Who is the man and why is he chasing Sue and Ed ? This episode is of note for two particular reasons . The first is that the events are loosely based upon real , historic people , Prince Edward & Prince Richard and their imprisonment in the Tower of London by their Uncle , Richard III . The second reason this episode is noteworthy is that it is bookended by an introduction and concluding remarks by R.L . Stine , ala William Castle . `` Stay Out of the Basement Pts . 1 & 2 '' - Margaret and Casey Brewer are left at home with their botanist father when their mother has to go visit her injured sister . Mr . Brewer has n't exactly been himself lately as he is busy working on a very `` hush-hush '' experiment . However , his behavior continues to become more and more bizarre and the kids begin to suspect that something has happened in the basement to affect their father.GOOSEBUMPS : A NIGHT IN TERROR TOWER is an excellent `` Goosebumps '' collection . All three episodes contain just the right mix of humor and thrills that originally made `` Goosebumps '' so popular . This is a DVD that not only fans of `` Goosebumps '' will enjoy , but is a great compilation to introduce newcomers to the `` Goosebumps '' series .	1
Mark Knopfler and his band do justice to the Goldenheart album and other songs . Personally , my favorite guitar player and I love his songwriting , too . The band plays well and the sound quality is good . Not quite as big a production as the On the Night DVD and it feels like a more intimate concert which has its benefits . All in all , a great show that I enjoy playing my acoustic to .	1
I have to admit being almost completely unobjective where Mark Knopfler is concerned , and it 's comforting to know that I 'm not alone - I 'm sure he could raise his own army if he was so inclined - so it will come as no surprise that I was glued to the set watching this performance . It so happened that the first edition with which I came into contact was the VHS copy of this concert ; unwittingly , I picked the item with superior content ( upon reading reviews of the DVD edition with the idea of upgrading , it became apparent that the DVD is , instead , a step backward ; it does not contain essential pieces , like Sultans of Swing - perhaps this omission will be remedied if there is another pressing of the DVD ) . I am pleased to note that Mark Knopfler never fails to impress , any time I have seen him in any capacity ; he works well with the musicians he convenes for his concerts , and over nearly thirty years has quietly amassed appearances with such a diverse assortment of performers and projects , nothing he could do would seem off . This concert - how great would it have been to be in that cosy little hall and witness it - seems to have been a promotion for `` Golden Heart '' ( which came out that year ) and I may have to go back and revise my review of that album - I was slightly harsh on it , although I still consider it a true first effort - as the biggest part of the concert on the VHS is from that album , and is VERY good . There are a LOT of musicians on stage - three keyboardists , four guitarists ( besides Mark ) , a string quartet , four Irish musicians - it 's amazing to me , with all those musicians in that small space , that nobody got in anybody else 's way , but that 's just how well this group worked together . Mark Knopfler possesses the magic to get the best out of everybody he collects to assist him , and make it look effortless . There were a lot of smiles all around as well - both on stage and in the audience . A relaxed , cohesive performance , well-balanced between new and old material ( even though this was primarily about Mark 's re-entry into the musical bullpen with `` Golden Heart '' , there are about an equal amount of pieces from older works , going all the way back to the beginning and touching on mid- and late-Dire Straits and some of his movie scores as well ) . I had a great time watching this and can tell it will be played a lot . I 'm planning to introduce my nephew to it before long - there 's a whole new generation out there to enchant .	1
He 's the soul of 'Dire Straits ' , and he 's the best guitarist of the world.If you only like 'exaggerated ' and 'exciting ' performance -- do n't bother to be one of Mark 's fans -- he 's too good to be your cup of tea ; but if you like real musicianship , there 's no reason why you do n't like him ! I 've been waiting for this show to be released on DVD , but I just could n't resist buying this , even it is only on VHS.The songs Mark played mainly come from the & quot ; Golden Heart ' CD , and still almost every song from this CD worth listening ; other songs played , which include Mark 's Dire Straits ' era and his soundtrack works are excellent too.Still , I look forward to seeing that all Mark as well as Dire Straits ' materials to be released on DVDs !	1
I have 2 versions of Sleeping Beauty with me ; 1 is this DVD and the other copy is the Bolshoi Ballet 's Sleeping Beauty which they performed for their Japan tour in the 1980s.I personally prefer this version because of:1 . Excellent choreography particularly in Act 1 with the entrance of the Corps de Ballet and the various fairies2 . Nice acting towards Act 1 and Act 2 where the evil fairy forcibly removes the hair of the King 's servant in her anger3 . An excellent demonstration of the Kirov style5 stars from me	1
This is one of the greatest rock videos out there . It captures 1968 London in a way no present day documentary can.Highlights include Jethro Tull , yes , Jethro Tull , doing a wonderful rockin ' blues tune . It 's well before the Aqualung phase , and not at all & quot ; progressive & quot ; or & quot ; art rock & quot ; . It 's just great rock 'n roll.The Who is unbelievable , with a romping then calm then romping-again version of A Quick One , a mini opera of sorts ; like Tommy in 8 minutes , only better . Pete does the patented windmills , Roger seems to be twirling the mike to 100,000 fans , and not just a little studio . Keith looks fanatic . They look like stadium rockers before stadium rock , which , in this case , is a good thing.Taj Mahal is wonderful and reminds us what rock and roll was , modern blues interpreted by white guys . He adds the soul to it.Skip Marianne Faithfull . The Dirty Mac is okay as far as superstar jams go , but did n't do a lot for me.As for The Stones ; they 're great ; but I must admit , The Who is much more tight and exciting.I 've been told that the special never aired because Mick was upset that The Who stole the spotlight . Oh well . See this film .	1
This is a great show in itself , a one-time only gathering of the greats , and one of the few times that you can actually see the original Stones with Brian Jones playing together . `` Gim me Shelter '' is almost a polar opposite in comparison , this being filmed around the time after `` Satanic Majesties '' and right around `` Beggars Banquet '' . I wish the `` Jumpin Jack Flash '' promo had been included in the DVD.A point off for the variety show concept and the Stones not being up to par ( compared to the Who that night , only Hendrix would 've been able to pull out all the stops ) , but they still sounded great , but Lennon delivers with `` Yer Blues '' in a truly all-star band.Tull ( pre-Aqualung ) does a decent job ( Black Sabbath 's Tony Iommi fills in this one time ) , Marianne circa '68 sounds totally out of place there , and because John and Yoko were glued together at the time , she did her `` performance piece '' that makes her and John sound like goofy kids making noise `` just because '' even though her later albums are actually good.It 's a huge part of rock history encapsulated in this DVD . Every so often , you 'll watch it , but it 's not `` Last Waltz '' .	1
This DVD has a little something for anyone who is a fan of late 1960 's Rock and Roll . Impressive performances by Dirty Mac , the Who , the Rolling Stones ; stupidity by Yoko Ono that made me laugh and entertained my cats ; interesting joking between Lennon and Jagger . The circus theme and organization of this DVD was a nice entertaining surprise.Too bad many of the performers ( Keith Moon , John Lennon , Jesse Ed Davis , etc ) are dead . That fact makes it even more special.Very enjoyable .	1
the who , taj , dirty mac ( john , yoko , clapton , keith ) and the stones are all very good . the circus concept is slightly embarrassing , claustrophobic and does n't work . that 's why this show has never been released before now . not essential but interesting to 1960s veterans .	1
On this DVD is what must be one of the best Jumping Jack Flash renditions.Among great footage is Marianne Faith ( so beautiful ) singing Something Better . Keith Moon , hmm , You Ca n't Always Get What You Want . Very interesting to watch John Lennon.All in all a great purchase.Recommended .	1
Does anyone remember when rock was more free form and true ? Well , this DVD will show you a time that has since long past . In a modern world where music is as canned as can be , watching this DVD really shows you true creativity and artistry . I can see why the Stones did n't want to release this back in the day : The Who blew them and everyone off the the stage hands down . Their performance was raw energy caught of film . A must see ! ! ! ! -Mike [ ... ]	1
Well , as much as I often have great distain for self-absorbed jerks like Mick Jagger , I have to admit to getting a certain tingle while watching him strut his stuff . Let 's face it women ( and gay men ) , we think he 's the sexiest rock'n'roller God has presented us with.As for the silly program , the concept was uninspired at best and idiotic at worst . Several of these acts are mere curiousity for most viewers : Taj Mahal is present only to provide some racial diversity , Jethro Tull is present because at the time they were thought to be a promising band ( not the intolerable prog-rockers they would become ) . Marianne Faithful ? Let 's just say we women are not FAITHFULL to MARIANNE . She represents pre-feminism of the worst kind.Why did I award this release 5 big ones , you may be asking ? Let me make is very simple for you , dear reader : YOKO ONO . Her bracing , ahead-of-it's-time performance on the Dirty Mac 's `` Whole Lotta Yoko '' is the antithesis of Marianne 's so-called performance . This , ladies , is proto-feminism at it 's best . If you want Girl Power , put down the Spice Girls cd and take a look at Mrs. John Lennon .	1
A wonderful document of the swinging London scene of late 1968 , full of little gems . There is the opening act by Jethro Tull , with a 20-year old Tony Iommi ( of Black Sabbath fame ) playing guitar for them , and Ian Anderson nervously trying out for the first times his trademark one-legged Pan stance . Then there is a wonderful blues perfomance by Taj Mahal , an artist I was not aware of but who really blew my mind ( awesome bass player , nice guitar player , the whole band kitted out in funky blues/cowboy gear ) , and a rare interchange between John Lennon and Mick Jagger ( the Beatles/Stones rivalry is well known , but these guys manage to be civil to each other ) . It is also apparently the last live appearance of Brian Jones , who barely does anything throughout - although he does put in a really great slide guitar performance.The reason that the release of this document was delayed until 1996 was apparently that the Stones were unhappy with their performance , and envious that of the Who , who had just come off tour and were at the top of their form ( and had performed earlier in the night , with good energy , whereas the Stones were playing at 2:00 in the morning and rather pooped ) . For me , The Who 's performance of `` A Quick One ( While He 's Away ) '' was theatrical and boring , not superior to any of the other pieces at all . The Stones had six numbers , including a rip-em-up rendition of `` Sympathy for the Devil '' which was probably only slightly less interesting than the Godard documentary of the original recording of the song . Mick also does a cool , dramatic strip show that reveals some pretty interesting body art . Great historical artifact , great great great .	1
This has to be my favorite `` music video '' of all time . This is more David Lynchian than anything David Lynch has ever produced . It is such an odd episode in time , such a weird floating bubble of brilliance . It is a Festival of the Bizarre and the Hilarious . And , in my opinion , the music is superb . Approach this with the right expectations , and you will be dazzled ! ! ! For starters , the colors are super-saturated , rich and deep reds and oranges and blues . It is a warm viewing experience . Every attendee is wearing a truly strange pull-over type robe with bright colors . Everyone is preternaturally happy and involved . Coupled with all the other other-worldly behavior , one wonders exactly what planet this circus tent is on . Is this a rock show , or Star Trek ? Then we have Jethro Tull take the stage . This guy jams on a petite little flute like most rock stars jam on a Flying-V . It is a great performance . Someone says it is dubbed . If so , I never even noticed , and it does n't really matter . The ambience is one of pure elation.Marianne Faithful is unbelievablly beautiful and elegant in a very formal performance which is in wonderful contrast to the raunchy rock festivities around her . She 's wearing a beautiful dress , and she sits on the ground . Classic-beyond-belief.The Who : Great . Daltry and Townsend are in their primes , and everyone else looks sober , even Moonie and Entwhistle.Okay , the ultimate killer here is this : John Lennon does an awkward little comedy shtick with Mick Jagger . Lennon ends up handing Jagger his dinner plate , and Mick nibbles the left-overs . Very charming because it all seems so natural and unrehearsed . They display a fondness for and a familiarity with one another , but with a little bit of competitive edginess . Lennon actually seems like a guy attending a party or a barbeque . He does not seem to be performing here ; he is participating , and having a good time . He does his little jam with Keith Richards , Clapton , and Mitch Mitchell from the Jimi Hendrix Experience . Think of that ! ! ! ! That 's the equivalent of Sinatra , Dean Martin , Ronald Reagan , Churchill and Teddy Roosevelt doing a session ! ! ! ! This is monumental history folks ! ! ! ! Beyond Belief ! ! ! And then Yoko comes out and starts screeching this painfully odd wail . The pain is deep and vast . This is where the experience become priceless : look into the faces of the musicians , look into the faces of the intimate little audience : they all look like they are about to bust out laughing at this strange noise emanating from Yoko 's mouth ! ! ! They are as astounded as we are ! ! ! ! The confusion and disbelief is palpable . John Lennon keeps on jamming , looking a little embarassed , but fully supporting his nihilistic little wife ! ! David Lynch must be crying as he watches this , a celluoid moment of astonishing inexplicability , contrasting vectors of logic and nuance which quite simply blow-out our normal thought processes . Try as he might , he can never match this kind of shtuff ! The the Stones climb on up and have at it . Mick steals the show . It is a 110 % Stones experience in four songs.Pete Townsend does an interview as an extra and it is worth watching as he recollects on the events of that day . He describes how Mick handled the entire project with his characteristic `` responsibility and ruthlessness . '' Apparently Brian Jones was falling apart during the course of the filming and Mick was having to help him remain composed , as well as dealing with all the other logistics . And , Keith was literally `` green '' from his ingestions of God-knows-what . So , Mick has to run the show from a business perspective , and then he has to perform . I personally thought he was awesome , especially in the rendition of `` Sympathy for the Devil . '' The man quite simply defines Larger-Than-Life-Legend as far as I 'm concerned.Folks , the four-star reviews here are missing the point just as much as the one-star reviews . Do n't buy this for the music , per se . Buy this for the Overall Weird Scene Which Hails From a Bygone London Era . This is beyond mere psychedelic , this is Alternative Universe Stuff . The intimacy of it , the authentic , ad hoc nature of the entire setting , accented by little circus performers here and there . If I could chose to go back in time to this R & R ; Circus or to Woodstock , I would take this in a heartbeat . There 's something for everybody here , and it is all good , and all strange in a friendly sort of way . It does n't get much better in my book .	1
If you 're for a Stones concert , instaed look for Bridges to Babylon . If you 're looking for a Who concert , check out the Kids are Alright , which features their performance from this . If however , you 're looking for a tme capsule of almost all fairly new acts finding their voice and as an interesting period peice.First it starts out with an introduction of all the performers . It 's interesting to see Roger Daltrey and Eric Clapton playing saxaphone because you surre as hell wo n't see it anywhere else.Jethro Tull is the first band to play . I know them now as the band who disapointed me when i saw them live . Here they are all miming to A Song for Jeffrey , except for the greet Ian Anderson , who also provides commentary on the DVD . That 's Tony Iommi playing with them . Yes , tony Iommi . Another intresting fact here , is that Jethro Tull were welcomed in favor of what was to become Led Zeppelin . I would n't complain to much.Next is the Who . What can be said . There ' even better camera angles here than in the Kids are Alright . They 're on fire here . They are the show , just like the concert for NY.then is an embarrengly bad circus act . I guess that this is for the whole circus idea , but I always skip this.Taj Mahal is pretty good , but I was never a fan of his . They never play him on the radio . The DVD includes other songs they recorded at the circus.Then Marianne Faithful . I always thought this song was too short , but she signs it preety well.Then there 's a fireeater or something , I do n't remmember.Then a really dated introduction between Lennon and Jagger . It 's not needed.The Dirty Mac is compiled of Mitch Mitchell ( from the Jimi Hendrix Experience ) , Eric Clapton from Cream or one of his other 30 bands , Keith Richards from the stones playing bass , and John Lennon from some band , I do n't remmember who they are . * They play Yer Blues which is good.Then yoko ono comes on . Some people call this irony , I just call it dated . Ono would n't stand in front of a crowd and do this now.Then an intro from Lennon that looks like it 's from 5 years later for the Stones . They do about five songs . Most of them are of the same energy , trying not to be tired . Most of them are good , but it often cuts to people trying to have more fun then they actually are to the cameras . Brian Jones looks really pale , and this was , I believe the last performance they did with him.Then they do Salt of the Earth . they sing withtthe remaining audience . You ca n't ask for more than that . They would only do that then . Now you would have to pay the band to let them sing with you . Good rendition though . Moon and Townshend seem to be having a lot of fun , and what they do is pretty funny.Other extra 's on the DVD are an interview with Townshend , multi camera angles for Yer Blues and the Clowns . It 's pretty unfunny , but you can hear Keith Moon laughing his head off.So this is n't the best Stone performance . I do n't think it 's anybody 's best performance , except for The dirty Mac 's . A Ha Ha . But it 's a great timecapsule for anybody who is a fan of any of these bands . *Just kidding . The Beatles are my favorite band .	1
... and will be buying the DVD the moment it hits the stands.The only knock against this film could be that it does not show the way Bruce Springsteen normally records , meaning that he is spending months in the studio recording eight songs for every one he releases . Then again , he has n't recorded in the & quot ; normal & quot ; way for him since the Born in the U.S.A. sessions in the early '80s and only Ken Burns could make a documentary about a & quot ; typical & quot ; Springsteen recording session.The VHS tape version is still worth the money , unless they are including the same 5-song CD with the DVD , too . Buy the tape , keep the CD and give the VHS to a relative for their birthday .	1
I enjoyed this very much . Not quite as bad as some mention here with the lip syncing as I was still able to appreciate their music . It was great to see Peter Green happy and enjoying himself . The music is wonderful and still current for me . I have always loved and continue to love Peter Green 's Fleetwood Mac ! ! !	1
This is an outstanding production of one of the most beloved ballets in the classic repertory . Fortunately , there are several very rewarding DVDs of Coppelia , including the 1993 version by the Australian Ballet , but the 1993 Kirov rendition does an exceptional job of capturing the spirit of the story and portraying the characters . It is beautifully choreographed , staged , and photographed , including some charming close-ups and overhead views from the vantage point of the mechanical doll , Coppelia . The famous Russian choreographer and set designer , Oleg Vinogradov , never wanders far from the story and charms the viewer with some clever surprises . He carefully integrates the corps de ballet by having it reflect , at times , the movements of the principal dancers.Unlike other versions of this ballet , the Kirov production includes an extensive and humorous dance scene , in Act I , with the mechanical doll in the town square . Franz and his friends are attracted but bewildered by its mechanical responses as they try to help it unwind . The character of Swanilda is charmingly portrayed by Irina Shapchits in both her expressive dancing and facial expressions . She shows remarkable balance and flexibility in her solo routines and duets with Franz . Act II provides a lively and inventive display of Dr. Coppelius ' mechanical toys , including the amazing gymnastics of the Nutcracker . On a humorous note , Swanilda , posing as the doll , kicks and slaps Franz for being unfaithful to her . The town square scene demonstrates why the Kirov is probably the world 's premiere corps de ballet . Its stunning and versatile performance reminds one of a corps of gold medalists . While Vinogradov has choreographed many of its movements to support the lead dancers , he also allows it to be inventive with a lively Mazurka , and a wooden hammer and legwork routine that would impress any gymnast . This is followed by golden spinning wheels accompanied by expressive armwork . This provides a lovely transition for the principal dancers as they try to reconcile their differences with the active engagement of the entire ensemble . Yes , Vindogradov introduces some innovative and new choreography to a classic ballet , but so did George Balanchine.Ballet lovers should probably purchase copies of both the Australian and Kirov versions . Each one takes great liberties , as does Offenbach 's popular opera , with E.T.A . Hoffmann 's Medieval tale of an eccentric inventor . Hoffmann would have been pleased with Coppelius ' Gothic workshop in the Australian version . I suspect that he would have been charmed by each of these interpretations . The Australian production provides some outstanding dancing , especially by Lisa Pavane , as Swanilda . She displays a remarkable range of technical skills and talent for mimicing several mechanical toys . The Australian version is performed before a live audience . While we never see the audience , it makes itself known by frequent outbursts of applause that , at times , tends to distract from the flow of the story and dancing . ( Now I can understand why Russian audiences tend to be rather reserved until the curtain calls . ) The final scene tends to become a showcase for displaying the formidable skills of the lead dancers , including a series of spins , turns , leaps , and lifts . They are rewarded with generous applause . In direct contrast , the Kirov version is performed without an audience , and this provides a continual flow of action and a character intimacy that is very satisfying . However , you may be disappointed if you consider the audience 's reaction to be a necessary part of the experience . Watch for the clever method that Vinogradov employs to allow the corps and lead dancers to take their bows before an empty house . He makes certain that Coppelia is not forgotten . What a treasure ! ( For the purpose of comparison , please see my review of the Australian version . )	1
I love this version . The Kirov knows how to make this ballet exciting . Very colorful . Especially the four young men in the photo on the cover . They gave this opera a gusto by their dancing . I recommend this to other ballet lovers .	1
Michael did a superb job of putting this show together . I believe he was under a great deal of stress . You have to remember , he was just asked to leave `` Riverdance '' not that long ago . He was hurt , felt betrayed , and was left wondering what was going to happen to his career now . I have to give him credit here ; because , he picked himself up and started this show , funding it with his own money he earned off of `` Riverdance '' . Wow ! That took some backbone ! ! Also , a lot of the dancers quit their jobs , taking a chance with Michael , which had to be more stress on him to succeed.Michael is a very talented man , his 28 taps a second is mind boggling to say the least ! ! Now he has to go and show Ireland once again that he still has what it takes . That he was n't beaten down by the `` Riverdance '' fiasco . `` Lord of the Dance '' was filmed at the Point Theater in Dublin Ireland , July 6 , 1996 . Needless to say , the show was a success.The drawbacks are the editing , the lighting , and the cameramen . Amatuers ! Also , way too much fogger ! ! I could n't see the dancers very well.So ... not the best of viewing ... but , you can still enjoy the mastery that is Michael . The extraordinaire dancers , the two lovely violinist who played some great pieces , Anne Buckley songs were sung beautifully , and the little spirit was spritely and cute . It all fits somehow and was a joy to watch .	1
This is a rather traditional , if spare , presentation of Verdi 's masterpiece with a superb cast . Domingo and Te Kanawa are at their peak and both sing and act magnificently . The real surprise for me was Leiferkus , whom I have seen in person in the past and have not enjoyed ; here , however , he is absolutely marvelous . In short , you ca n't go wrong with this DVD , which should make a fine companion piece to the later film of Domingo and Fleming at the Met . And how poignant it is to see Lady Diana applauding from the audience during the curtain call .	1
The acting was first rate , the singing excellent . The only & # 34 ; failing , & # 34 ; if one must see one , is the technology of the time when it was recorded . Domingo is at or near his peak and te Kanawa is just at the age-induced , edge-end of her peak .	1
This live Covent Garden performance is a stellar event ... Domingo , the most famous modern Otello , the sublime Te Kanawa , the evil Leiferkus and the brilliant fiery Solti all together for a memorable Gala evening of Great Verdi.In the title role , Domingo sings and acts well , but his Otello is so overly documented ( two commercial recordings , the Maazel film and soundtrack , the famous Scala performance and pirate recordings from 1976 ... did I miss any ? ) , that there really are n't any surprises . He 's pretty much at his best here . Too bad there is n't a live Vickers or MacCracken performance for some balance ... Te Kanawa looks and sings sublimely , and this is the true reason to get this tape.Though she has recorded extensively , there is n't a whole lot of her visually , and to catch her live in one of her best roles is a real treat.Leiferkus , much criticized for being too light weight may be more ideal for the part than he 's given credit for . Much of the part is lyrical , with a high tessitura , meza voce in Era la nott & eacute ; , or a light and agile pizzacato in Questa & eacute ; una ragna . Far too often we 're hearing bassos doing baritone roles , and it 's refreshing to hear a less heavy or power-house interpretation.The ever controversial Solti , assistant to Toscanini at Salzburg in the late 30 's , conducts with the vigor of a man half his age . It 's good to have a document of him conducting a live opera.Brian Large , to me vastly over-rated , directs with much attention to detail ... so much that often the larger picture gets lost . Do we REALLY need an extensive close-up of Domingo 's right eye and nostril as Desdemona lays dying ? THis would be a case in point for multi-angles in DVD.All in all , a really good performance of some of the finer interpreters of Otello today . And do n't go by a bored Diana 's obligatory applause , this is truly a grand event !	1
I saw Domingo sing Otello at about this time . This DVD is a wonderful souvenir of him in the role at that stage of his career . Although the voice was smaller than some of the other famous Otello 's , it carried through the house and had a baritonal timbre in the lower register that made him very effective vocally . As for many tenors , his entrance , Esultalte , is an act of will to meet its demands . All the other big moments are effected wonderfully.His acting vocally and visually is superb wonderfully transitioning from swagger and impatience , through anger , to despair . His `` Dio ! mi potevi `` is spellbinding . I have memories of the live performance during this aria in which my wife , then new to opera , sat leaning forward in her seat transfixed . All in all one of the great Otellos that no one today can match . I will look forward to seeing the Vickers , Met DVD for another interpretation.Kiri Te Kanawa is also excellent . Vocally she is quite good , and I found her acting credible -- bewildered by her husband 's anger and cruelty and resigned in the end.The vocal weak spot is Leiferkus as Iago . The voice is light for Verdi and has a grainy sound . That having been said , what one loses in not having a true Verdian baritone is in part compensated for by his superb acting.Solti leads a well paced performance . Stage direction is good though I prefer Act 4 's `` a kiss , another kiss ... to really be kisses rather than Otello crawling towards Desdemona as he sings them . The staging is Covent Garden grand.In summary , if you can accept Iago 's voice , this is an excellent production and preservation of a performance by an Otello who was a true presence in the role .	1
Otello has always been among my favorite operas . The first time I heard it was as a boy listening to my parent 's Toscanini recording . While I am aware that there are those who regard this as a reference , I will withhold comment since I have not heard it for decades . However , in addition to this DVD , I have the Von Karajan film on DVD , and on CD , the first recordings of Domingo and Vickers , both on RCA , and Von Karajan 's 1960s Decca recording with Del Monaco and Tebaldi . What for me separates this recording from the others is that it possesses a truly gripping sense of theatricality from all the principals involved . In contrast to the other recordings I have mentioned , this is a live rather than a studio production , and although I would not argue this automatically makes it better ( assuming , of course , a comparable level of quality in vocal and instrumental execution ) , there exists the potential to reach a more transcendent level of intensity and involvement over what is generally achieved in a studio setting , and that potential , I feel , has been abundantly realized here.More specifically , I feel that both Domingo and Te Kanawa sing beautifully while , at the same time , very effectively convey the pathos and suffering of their characters , and , I would add , that for Domingo , this is what distinguishes his performance here from his RCA recording ( for a more stentorian approach , try Del Monaco with Von Karajan ) .As for Leiferkus as Iago , I would disagree with those who regard his portrayal as undercharacterized . Perhaps his voice is a little bit on the light and dry side , and he avoids obvious theatrics . He does , however , convey Iago 's evil and malice , just in a more subtle and restrained manner , all the more chilling and believable as a result , for Iago is supposed to be an insidious villain , not an obvious one.Finally , Solti 's conducting conveys true dramatic thrust and burning intensity . Only Von Karajan , I feel , in his Decca recording comes close.If you want to see and hear how effective Otello can be in a superior live setting without paying the elevated ticket prices for actually being there , do get this one !	1
A very good performance of a traditional ballet made exceptional by Anthony Dowell 's wickedly wonderful Carabosse , Durante 's incredible point work and costumes which move the whole thing into a different dimention . I had read that the costumes were & quot ; a point of controversy & quot ; . I thought they complimented the performances and gave the whole ballet a beautiful and refreshing newness .	1
Disney Studios saw some hard times in the `` war years '' resulting in some lesser know or well received titles to sustain the studio with these short subjects and war films for the military . The studio 's 9th effort Fun and Fancy Free is a charming group of short subjects worthy of a place in any Disney fan 's library . While certainly not on par with any of their previous efforts this is still Disney when Walt was still alive.It 's a shame that the studio seems to disregard these selections from this time period because I think restored versions for the 6 films during this period could be put into one Blu Ray box set and maybe entice Disney fans to purchase these forgotten little gems . This film does n't have any edits Hooray ! ..at least none I 'm aware of ? If the studio wants these films to sell well , they have to show a little effort ! . I own the Gold Edition of this release and it will have to do until a decent upgrade comes along.I hope Disney is listening and does a decent job restoring this ( , Saludos Amigos ( unedited ) , The Three Caballeros ( unedited ) , Make Mine Music ( unedited ) , Melody Time and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad . Then releases them on Blu Ray in a single box set and adds as much bonus material as they can find . Then maybe they 'll see that even the little guys can make them a profit again.The Gold Edition is the way to go for now as it looks very good considering and has some bonus material .	1
This was great for my collection , I have been collecting disney movies since I can remember . It will be great to have them all by the time I have kids .	1
Christopher Robin tries to tell Pooh that he is going to go somewhere . However , the subject just fails to arrive . Instead , Christopher Robin leaves Pooh with these wise words : You 're braver than you believe , stronger than you seem , and smarter than you think . Little does Pooh realize that these words will soon have significant meaning for him.The next morning Pooh wakes to find a jar of honey outside his tree . Pooh begins to dip into the honey , but then has second thoughts as he considers whether the honey might belong to someone . Unfortunately , Pooh 's dip into the honey obscures the writing on a note attached to the side of the honey . Pooh and his friends eventually discover the night and attempt to decipher it , only to learn that Christopher Robin has somehow gone to `` skull '' and will not be returning . There is only one thing that Christopher Robin 's friends can do : they must go on a quest to find Christopher Robin.Pooh , Tigger , Piglet , Eeyore and Rabbit set off to `` skull '' to find Christopher Robin . Unfortunately , Rabbit 's map skills are insufficient to the task of finding `` skull , '' and the world outside the hundred acre wood is big and scary . One might wonder how Pooh and his friends will conquer gaping chasms , monsters , and dark scary caves . Where is Christopher Robin ! Wherever he is , his friends will rescue him ! This animated 1997 movie was direct to video . However , the quality of the story and the animation are good , and this movie is captivating . I believe this movie might have done well as a theater release . I think fans of Pooh and his adventures will enjoy this family friendly movie , and families with young children will want this movie for their film libraries . Enjoy !	1
WOW ! I just finished viewing this fabulous opera.La Boheme has long been a favorite opera of mine . I cut my operateeth on the Von Karajan reading showcasing His Highness Luciano Pavoratti & Mirella Freni . I did n't think anythingcould better that monumental effort.I must confess I was wrong.There are the technical issues other reviewers havenoted . Ghost images and such.The scenic designer deserves their kudos because they accomplished what the opera callsfor.Rusticness was in abundance.I half expected a mouse to run across the floor of the garrett in Act 1.Benoit should have been reported to the Housing Authority . Guess that 's what landlords can get away with when you don'tpay your rent . I shudder to think what Mimi 's place looked like ! Ileana Cotrubas was born to play this role . Physically , she is the Mimi & Gilda not the Traviata & Manon.Herperformance I find difficult to put into words . She wraps each note with so much beauty one can hardly stand it.Perhaps , because of her reputation of being difficult , she knew that she always had to bring her `` A '' game.She couldnever phone it in . Not that she ever would.Her coyness & elation in the role establish her , to me , as the greatestacting opera singer , bar none.The role will never be sung and acted better.Neil Shicoff was a wonderful Rodolfo.Singly and when paired with Ms.Cotrubas , he was magnificent ! His , too , is aninstrument beyond compare.The supporting cast is stellar . This is the definitive La Boheme on film.Puccini wouldbe very proud indeed . A must for every collection !	1
Even if the majority of opera videos were of traditional stagings ( which they most definitely are not ) , I daresay this would still be high on the list of worthies . No , I am not a reactionary ... but I 'm really only interested in seeing productions that try to remain in line with the composer 's intentions . ( Yes , I do like some modern touches . Electric lighting is mandatory , and subtitles are appreciated : )	1
Placido Domingo is just FANTASTIC ! ! ! All the years I 've been watching him he NEVER let me down.The first time I ever went to the opera back in 1969 he was the tenor ( calaf ) I saw him in so many productions after that ! ! ! Lohengrin was made for him , He looks great and vocally incredible.Not to mention the rest of the cast ! ! ! ! LOVE IT ! ! ! !	1
This really is a joy to all who watch this . I had a New Year party last year and had it on my TV . Everyone loved it . And most of the people there are n't even Opera fans . It 's just a fun Flederous , and superlatively sung and acted.The bonus is the retirement of the one and only La Stupenda . Who , at 63 still raises the temperature of the House when she entered it . Along with Pavarotti and Horne ( both of whom adore her ) , they sing up a storm . No , Sutherland had sung better . But this is her retirement . She was all choked up . Pavarotti and Horne sung stupendously in their tribune to one of the most celebrated and beloved of all opera singers.Bravisima , La Stupenda , we adore you . And agree with the countless opera fans who consider you , Prima Donna Assoluta , for all time .	1
Usually I avoid extravaganza extraspecials . It would be a mistake here . Despite the unfortunate fact that Dame Sutherland has a hard time singing , this is a good Fledermaus . Best feature is that it moves along well and is tightly acted except for the rather long visitor section , which is very forgivable .	1
Filmed during a live performance 3 February , 1988 , within Sydney 's justly esteemed opera house , Franz Lehar 's Merry Widow is sung here by soon to be retired Joan Sutherland , in addition to a splendid supporting cast , with Richard Bonynge leading his established pick-up orchestra , here dubbed The Elizabethan Philharmonic , in an outstanding rendition of Lehar 's scoring for an evergreen operetta that depicts in spirit and particulars Belle & Eacute ; poque Paris . From the original , a stage play of intrigue within high society that debuted in 1861 , WIDOW ( Lustige Witwe ) is adapted wonderfully well under the direction of Lotfi Mansouri for this production made for Australian television that includes enormously agreeable `` business '' and choreography in support of the vocal soloists who act their parts in pleasing fashion for the familiar Christopher Hassall English language translation , from which one finds that only Act III differs substantially from the standard libretto , although the entire work 's origins do frequently seem to be grounded at D'Oyly Carte rather than in Vienna . Several critical observers have stated that , at 61 years , Sutherland is too old to play this part of Anna Glawari , `` The Merry Widow '' , additionally commenting upon her prognathousness and girth , and it is manifest that the diva does not readily rise to her feet from a sitting position . Nonetheless , she is palpably comfortable in the role , and it is clear that her musicality is as estimable as ever . Indeed , the only obvious clinker here comes from below the boards , within the orchestra 's string section . Although never sylphlike , Sutherland 's musical career has been aptly advanced by husband/coach/manager Bonynge ( who certainly knew a good thing when he heard one ) and opera lovers the world over have gladly sanctioned Coleridge 's `` willing suspension of disbelief '' to place the soprano firmly into her most successful characterizations , each of which her followers have greeted with idolization . A house filled to capacity and ripe with esteem for Sutherland as a national treasure , evinces its satisfaction during balloon popping curtain calls , after previously halting the action often with its applause , notably following Sutherland 's ardent show-stopping rendering of `` Vilja '' , sung amid opulently created period ornamentation . Despite Sutherland 's accomplished turn as Anna , the evening belongs to tenor Ronald Stevens who , as male lead Danilo Danilovitch , captures each of his scenes through his gusto . The striking soprano Anne-Maree McDonald sings well and acts gracefully as Valencienne , while other supporting cast members are , for the most part , at least proficient . The WIDOW 's narrative has been in a continuing condition of flux since its inception and this film 's alternate English translation has been particularly favoured in Australia for many years . Directed with exhilaration and designed with a refined eye for detail , this whimsical musical play is certain to be welcomed into an operetta lover 's cinema library . Both VHS and DVD versions offer first-class visual and sound quality and each includes a leaflet of synopsis that also lists all involved with the production .	1
There certainly are a lot of warts on this Australian production , and to blame them all on Joan Southerland is , I think misguided ... .. I mean even the editorial review is less than flattering to the aging diva ... meeoww meowww ... little plate of milk for , on the floor though , the ed reviewers ... ..This is one of the very very few DVD 's of this opera and that is what makes it enjoyable , to be able to at least see in in your home . The dance numbers are exquisite and as a whole the lighting and video are excellent ... .If there is a down on this DVD well I am disgusted that it was only cut in two channel Dolby ... what ... 2 channels ... I did n't even know there was a dvd available in 2 channel stereo ... WOW what a bummer ... As a die hard audiophile I could n't take it and left the room ... but my wife and all her friends who are card carrying , season ticket opera NUTS ... all enjoyed the DVD ... go figure ... .	1
Director Robert Abel and producer Pierre Adidge present a marvelous look at Elvis in this documentary , using concert , rehearsal and backstage footage , as well as clips from the early days of his career , and a montage of him kissing his co-stars while `` Love Me Tender '' is performed . Excellent use of split-screen techniques are used , and the cinematography is always interesting.Elvis looks in great shape from the neck down , quite trim and with the athletic flexibility to do deep leg lunges , and delivering each song with enormous emotional and physical energy . His face shows much dissipation however , and tells another story ; the feeling one gets from this film is of a desperately sad man , a hurting soul , putting a brave mask on for the world . There is also not even a flicker of ego ... we see only a hard-working guy , with not a shred of arrogance . He wears his flashy clothes with grace , style and humility , and sings his heart out , and it 's a beautiful thing to see.His voice is occasionally wobbly ( and the sound quality also has its variables ) , but for the most part he shines , particularly in the songs with a spiritual theme . `` Bosom of Abraham , '' `` I John , '' and especially `` American Trilogy '' and `` You Gave Me a Mountain '' are very moving , and terrific listening.His band is wonderful , and his back-up singers , The Sweet Inspirations and J.D.Sumner and the Stamps Quartet , an added delight.Song list : '' Johnny B. Goode '' ( film titles ) '' See See Rider '' '' Polk Salad Annie '' '' Separate Ways '' ( recording studio ) '' Proud Mary '' '' Never Been to Spain '' '' Burning Love '' '' Do n't be Cruel '' ( over early stills and clips ) '' Ready Teddy '' ( Ed Sullivan Show ) '' That 's All Right '' '' Lead Me , Guide Me '' ( rehearsal ) '' Bosom of Abraham '' ( rehearsal ) '' Love Me Tender '' '' Until it 's Time for You to Go '' '' I John '' ( rehearsal ) '' Bridge Over Troubled Water '' '' Funny How Time Slips Away '' '' An American Trilogy '' '' Mystery Train '' ( at an airport ) '' Suspicious Minds '' '' I Got a Woman '' '' Amen '' '' A Big Hunk of Love '' '' You Gave Me a Mountain '' '' Sweet , Sweet Spirit '' ( exquisitely sung by J.D . Sumner and the Stamps ) '' Lawdy Miss Clawdy '' '' Ca n't Help Falling in Love '' '' Memories '' ( final credits ) You do n't have to be an Elvis fan to enjoy this film , but you 're guaranteed to have a deeper appreciation of his talent , and understand why he was `` The King '' after seeing it.This is one of the best music documentaries I 've seen , up there with Martin Scorsese 's `` The Last Waltz , '' who incidentally , is listed as Montage Supervisor in the credits of this film.Total running time is 93 minutes .	1
& quot ; Elvis On Tour & quot ; captures a loose , energetic King on the road . It features dozens of innovative split screen shots of Elvis . Whether he 's making a quip or showing off his karate moves , this is Elvis at his peak. & quot ; Elvis On Tour & quot ; is much looser than & quot ; That 's The Way It Is & quot ; . He does not seem nervous like he did on the previous tape , and he adds extra flare to the songs that he performed in the previous outing . Elvis 's voice is in its greatest shape ever here . He delivers a powerful , intense vocal performance on & quot ; Bridge Over Troubled Water & quot ; , then gives a gentle reading of & quot ; Funny How Time Slips Away & quot ; . The rockers are also extremely good . Elvis gives electrifying versions of & quot ; A Big Hink O ' Love & quot ; and & quot ; Lawdy , Miss Clawdy & quot ; , plus a good version of & quot ; I Got A Woman & quot ; . Closing this magnificient video is a beatiful rendition of & quot ; Ca n't Help Falling In Love & quot ; .I do have one gripe however . On the & quot ; Lost Performances & quot ; video , there are several performances filmed for this video that should 've have been included . These songs are a powerful & quot ; Are You Lonesome Tonight & quot ; , & quot ; I Ca n't Stop Loving You & quot ; , & quot ; All Shook Up & quot ; , & quot ; Release Me & quot ; , & quot ; Teddy Bear & quot ; / & quot ; Do n't Be Cruel & quot ; , and a stunningly beautiful & quot ; How Great Thou Art & quot ; . However , this truly is a must - have . Elvis is truly at his finest hour , his last moment of glory before sinking into the pits of drugs and fatty food .	1
Elvis in 1972 was still at the top of his game , lean and mean and energetic . In `` Elvis on Tour '' we get a fantastic snapshot at the King in top form ; I only wish 1 - that it was available on DVD and 2- that some of the concerts with clips included in the movie were available on video in their entirety . Very highly recommended !	1
I SAW THIS WHEN IT WAS FIRST IN THEATRES IN 1972 AND IT STILL ROCKS ON BLU-RAY THE PICTURE IS TOTALLY AMAZING AND THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THAT THEY DID NOT INCLUDE ANY EXTRAS AND WERE NOT ABLE TO USE JOHNNY B GOODE AS THE OPENING SONG.NONETHELESS THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT CONCERT MOVIES OF ALL TIME IT WAS TRULY AHEAD OF ITS TIME FOR 1972.ELVIS IS IN TOP FORM ESPECIALLY ON THE GOSPEL SONGS SUCH AS HOW GREAT THOU ART AND WHEN THE STAMPS DO THEIR SOLO SWEET SWEET SPIRIT.I RECOMMEND THIS 100 % TO ALL ELVIS FANS.LONG LIVE THE KING .	1
Thanks for the memories ... ... ... The man was so talented , timeless and he 's gone down in musical history as a icon of the 50 's and his music has captured longevity beyond most other entertainers/singers of his era . Truly Missed ! He would have been 75 years old had he lived.Excellent DVD ! Any Elvis fan would appreciate to watch as we have several times . Like hooking up with an old friend .	1
If you like this movie , you 'll LOVE the blu-ray . At first I was hoping for additional stuff like Turner had done with That 's The Way It Is a few years back , but this movie is exactly the same as it was when I was a kid . I 'm sure other 's have mentioned some audio differences due to licensing ( Johnny B. Goode is replaced by Do n't Be Cruel in the title sequence , etc ) .The picture and audio quality are about as good as you can expect for how old the movie is and the fact that I 'm sure the master 's where never taken care of as well as Elvis ' other pictures.Overall , it 's a great BD release .	1
I remember the day Elvis died . I was at summer camp . Granted , he probably died the day before and word finally got around that particular day . Either way I thought to myself , 'wow the guy from those tv commercial ads for his 8 tracks is dead . ' Then a couple years later the family went on a trip to Gatlinburg . Every single attraction between that town and Pigeon Forge had a tie in with Elvis . The car museum had one of his cars . The wax museum had his wax likeness . The water fountain show had his music playing . For a northerner all I took away from the experience was that the south were just mesmerized by this guy . That and business owners & promoters will sell out anybody for a quick buck.Then sometime later after I graduated college and started to listen to music that i liked rather than music that i thought was necessary to define me I got into Elvis . Sometimes it 's a relief to listen to music that you like instead of picking stuff based on the genre , the attitude , the style , the message etc . Music for music 's sake sure beats listening to the same type of junk just cause you 're caught up in how you identify with it . It 's music not a tee-shirt people.Actually before I really started listening to Elvis I read the seminal book 'Last Train to Memphis & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Careless Love. & # 34 ; Peter Guralnick . Man deserves the highest order of author/writing that this country needs to have . I read the book . Found out who Elvis was . Then I listened to his music.And that brings me to this Blu Ray . I do n't care if somebody prefers the 'skinny ' Elvis to the 'fat ' Elvis . He 's Elvis . Just like Jesus on earth or Jesus on the cross . It do n't matter where you put him he 's Jesus . Wallow in the glory of it all and stop being picky . This movie nails it when it shows the crowds heading into an auditorium . Half the old people in that crowd were probably barking at their kids to stop playing Elvis ' pesky music only 10 or so years earlier . But Elvis won them over . It 's cause he was Elvis . Southern Gentleman . American Icon.I never got to see Elvis in concert but I 've seen this Blu Ray a million times over . Just about got a groove in the disc from how many times I 've listened & watched the show . He invented Rock and Roll performing and still nobody does it better . Yep , he 's performing up there but you also see Elvis the human equally bemused at Elvis the persona and the fans . Only Bruce Springsteen captures the ability to put both his persona and himself on the big stage . The rest of them guys singing up there are way too caught up in their persona or hiding behind their guitars from it .	1
This is a very good Elvis movie , boxing and fighter was something that Elvis enjoyed and did a very good job in this movie .	1
Elvis at perhaps his best ... . Very cool songs ! and this movie showed his early acting ability ! This movie needs re-master and in Blu-ray ! It 's that good ! ! !	1
This picture is a great improvement over the movies of the previous three years ( especially when compared to EASY COME , EASY GO and CLAMBAKE ) .In this more adult-oriented comedy , Elvis plays a photographer who gets stalked by a rather eccentric woman , who gets him fired from his job and moves him out of his own home . How does she do it ? I ca n't tell you , you have to buy the picture . He , he.Anyway , you 'll have fun watching Elvis juggle between two jobs , and the songs in this picture are actually GOOD ( especially & quot ; Edge of Reality & quot ; and & quot ; A Little Less Conversation & quot ; ) . The & quot ; Edge of Reality & quot ; sequence is actually pretty psychedelic , an Elvis film highlight , indeed.Finally , Elvis was getting more quality scripts in this period . Unfortunately , his movie contract was almost up , so that 's probably the reason for it.Buy this picture , you 'll be glad you did .	1
This film is very in tune with the 1960 's and even has an acid-influenced Elvis-dream sequence ! Elvis is very relaxed in the role and seems to actually enjoy it . He gets to be a cool photographer with a cool dune buggy and a great big dog for a pet . This is fast-paced , not slow , like some other reviewers have said ... Elvis fans will be surprisingly pleased by this very-late-stage film . I think he made only 1 or 2 others after this one . I bought it for the psychedelic acid-dream sequence and ended up really enjoying the whole movie and I 'm was n't even a hardcore Elvis fan . ( But now I am ! )	1
Love Elvis , love all his movies and especially his concerts . This was a lot of fun . Good music , good fun . I enjoyed it a lot .	1
Really loved this movie because it 's racing and it 's clean . Good family movie . Liked the music in it as well .	1
OK , people , we are talking 1968 here . Granted , this movie is n't War and Peace , but was never intended to be . Elvis , by the time this movie was filmed , knew there was no chance of being considered a serious actor , although that was his dream.The chemistry between Elvis and Nancy Sinatra is very evident ... on and off the screne . Great friends and they had a blast making this movie . I recall Nancy saying they would ride around the MGM lot on a bicycle built for two when tour buses would come around and the heads would turn . That sounds like an enjoyable experience to me . The film is enjoyable , funny , and for its time , the racing scenes are action packed.It does n't get any better than Nancy singing `` Your Groovy Self '' with the blonde hair , [ lightened around her face more for the movie ] and those smokey , almond eyes . WOW ! BTW , Nancy was the only performer to have a solo song included on a Presley album . Impressive and enjoyable.SPEEDWAY , is a fast paced , fun loving , Elvis flick that just happens to `` tickle me '' . Sorry , could n't resist .	1
This is a good movie love it to watch it and see my guy starring in it and just this man .	1
There has never been a video about the BeeGees better than this . But I STILL ca n't find one that explains all of their albums up to date . Barry , Robin , and Maurice each explain stuff , mostly Barry and Maurice , and they even show parts of songs , like I Could Not Love You More , I Surrender , and Just Incase . They talk about their childhood and show their house when they were young . They also show the funny Children of the World impersenation and have other little parts of songs like I 've Got ta Get A Message To You , Ordinary Lives , How Deep Is Your Love , Stayin ' Alive , Fanny Be Tender , World , Massachusetts , Saved By The Bell , How Can You Mand A Broken Heart , Harry Braff , and many , many more . This biography is both informative and interesting , at the same time fun .	1
I have n't seen this VSH yet but I am sure it 's going to be a great VHS about the brothers Gee . I am still looking for one they did years ago on MTV . I look forward to see the brother Gee this weekend .	1
Prequel : It is not possible for reviewers to write separate reviews of the single and of the two disc deluxe versions even though they are not the same . This is a listing arrangement beyond the control of reviewers . Consequently this review covers both options together so please be patient and extract whichever information applies to your particular interests . Thanks , Ian Giles ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..This original version of the original three tenors concerts given in Rome in 1990 was much copied but never matched for the sense of a unique and very special occasion . The actual recording is given good sound presented in stereo and DD 5.1 surround sound . The imaging is adequate by today 's standards on close ups and only breaks up on distance shots . The camera work itself gives a good sense of immediacy and involvement - probably much better than being there at the time ! The selection of music , largely from opera and operetta , is unashamedly popular and is performed with total skill and a performance-aware delivery that positively invites increasingly enthusiastic audience support . All three singers are in good voice , probably more so than on the sequence of such concerts that followed . It would be easy for this to become a competitive activity , and so it is to a degree , but all three men are able to unite for the two encores - two Pavarotti specials ( 'O sole mio ' and 'Nessun dorma ' ) that are shared out between them with great camaraderie . Otherwise any competition is good humoured and fully understood as an essential ingredient to a very joyous occasion.Everyone who buys this disc will have favourites in terms of aria and in terms of singer . Nevertheless , it would be hard to imagine anyone experiencing disappointment . Both Mehta and his orchestra accompany with evident enjoyment , rising to the occasion , including the orchestra only items which give the singers a bit of a 'breather ' and add a touch of aural variety.The booklet in the original single disc version provides all the texts and other basic information . The later 'deluxe ' two disc set , published in 2007 , provides subtitles which is a far preferable option to the supplied texts of the first version . There are no texts supplied in the abbreviated booklet of the deluxe version . The later deluxe version is not significantly sonically or visually superior to the first version and this has been carefully compared . The second disc in the deluxe version provides a second disc a documentary describing the creation of this concert narrated by Derek Jacobi . There is also a track enabling those who wish to join in a karaoke version of 'O sole mio . 'The single disc , or two disc deluxe version , of this unique concert and occasion can not be compared to others and can confidently be recommended to anyone who finds the idea of such an event an attraction . That is why it has been such a top seller ever since it was issued .	1
The best opera performance ever ! This needs to be re-released in high definition . It would be a showcase HD disc because the details of the orchestra on the wide Caracalla stage would show off the HD . I hope they shot this on film so we can get an excellent transfer but even if it was video , it will still exceed the standard DVD quality that we have now .	1
This is one of the most enjoyable DVD I have . I wish the picture quality was better but the sound is great ! The song selection is outstanding !	1
Wow this concert was very good . Great costumes and song choices , I did n't blink at all watching this concert . Great Job Madonna .	1
I loved this concert ! I always liked the routine she did for Bye Bye Baby . Very clever . She had a very tight band on this tour , including Omar Hakim on drums , who has played with Sting and many other artists . He keeps the beat like no one else . This was such a playful show . Her later tours were a bit political in overtone , but this tour was like a circus . I much prefer Madonna in this context . No message - just singing and dancing . Hot .	1
I just watch it 3x then put the blond ambition tour that i recorded live on 08/5/90 HBO.. And yes These shows are very different from each other , even madonna looks different . But what im really back to say is I think Cher took lessons from Madonna , on putting on great show 's . Cause all this was before cher came back in to the main stream about 5 years later . I think ... ..	1
Almost 17 years passed since Madonna hit the road with her amazing Girlie Show , promoting one of her best ever album Erotica . It was all so special ... .the songs , the mood , the quality , the times . And I was only 18 ... Madonna then had guts to produce high quality , hi-end music , without caring about commercial aspects.Now to the show - this was one of the greatest shows of 90 's , both musically and stage-wise . The sound quality ( note : not on this DVD ) of the actual show broke all the boundaries of the existing expectations . Live acts of Fever , Erotica were breathtaking . So many years passed since , I feel like Madonna herself is still underestimating or discriminating the Erotica period.I would n't really say I love all of the performances on this DVD , however , the tour highlights like Erotica , Fever , Rain , Deeper and Deeper , La Isla Bonita , Justify my Love makes it all special . Visually , this recording is stunning . Given the time it was show , almost 17 years ago , the colors are amazingly fresh and vivid , except for some blurry moments . My biggest disappointment is the sound quality on this DVD . AC3 Digital Sound featured on US Version is such an embarrassment for the great show and Madonna herself . I still can not believe that Madonna , the biggest quality freak in the world , has absolutely no control over the quality of her released materials . Given the available prints of this DVD , I would highly recommend to buy the European two-sided edition featuring Dolby Digital Stereo ( the best sound available ) .Now to the presents times of 2010 - with all the amazing restorations available on BlueRay , I see no justification for failing to release the Girlie Show on BlueRay , having both the video and sound restored into DTS7.1 ! And not only this concert ... common Madonna , with all the hundreds of millions of dollars that you made thanks to your dedicated and insane fans , you should really invest some money into re-releasing your greatest albums and performances in BlueRay , DVD-Audio and/or DTS CD . We all deserve it , we do ! God Bless Queen !	1
What are you waiting for ... click on the order button .	1
This is an outstanding musical presentation . There are a variety of excellent performers . The orchestra was great . There was a variety of comical and serious numbers . Leslie Uggams rendition of 'If He Walked Into My Life ' brought tears to my eyes . Lorna Luft 's song 'Take It All Off ' was hilarious . I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes really great music .	1
I remember watching the Capser movies when I was a little girl in the 90s . I like them most of the capser movies NOT including the stupid Christmas Casper , but Casper a Spirited Beginning and Casper Meets Wendy are my all time favorites . Its sort of a prequel to the Christina Ricci film Casper . Casper at first does n't know that he 's dead and he skips ghost training school that the train is going too . But when he goes into town people start screaming Ahh Ghost ! ! ! Casper does n't realize why people are screaming at him until he realizes that hes the ghost everyone screams at . Later on he befriends Chris Carson a lonely boy whose father is to busy working to hang out with him and be involved in his life , and is bullied by Broc and his crew . In fact Casper is his only friend . Soon afterwords Chris introduces Casper to the Ghostly Trio Stretch , Stinky and Fatso and they try to teach Casper how to be a scary ghost but Casper finds it hard because he does n't want to scare people he would rather be friendly and nice to humans . This movie is hilarious when Casper and Chris get the bully Broc in trouble . I wo n't give away too much for people who 've never seen it . But its a great film for all ages . When its on t.v . I still watch it and I 'm 19 and I was 5 when this movie came out in 1997 and remember watching it over and over again . If you 're a fan of Casper and Casper Meets Wendy I recommend this film !	1
Being a mere mortal i am hesitant to even begin to rate this come back by Fleetwood Mac.How these gods and goddesses managed to get together to perform for us mere mortals is a miracle ! Seriously , this is one of the finest ( in my opinion ) shows put on by any classic rock and roll group in a long time and is setting a standard for all other rock groups to rise to.Stevie Nicks ( looking good-must be witchcraft ) , Christie Mcvie , John Mcvie , Mick fleetwood and Lindsey Buckingham are all giving their all during this performance.They manage to work in all their major hits , plus some new stuff thrown in for good measure.The electricity between these group members seems to want to jump from the stage and at times literally seems to do so.If like the majority of us you were not able to attend oneof their concerts than please do yourself a big favor and purchase the DVDor at least the VHS of this concert.You will be doing yourself a huge favor by doing so !	1
This is an excellent concert for fleetwood mac . I am a long time fan , total fan , absolutely love them , and this concert is undeniably one of their best . If you get any fleetwood mac concert get this one , it 's better than live in Boston , it 's awesome . Get this one ! ! !	1
IF YOU LOVE LISTENING TO FLEETWOOD MAC , THEN YOU 'LL LOVE WATCHING THEM SING YOUR FAVORITE SONGS . THERE 'RE TWO VERSION ON THIS DVD . SO YOU HAVE A CHOICE ON HOW YOU LIKE YOUR MUSIC TO SOUND .	1
I would not consider myself a Fleetwood Mac fan , but when their songs would come on the radio , I would not change the station , so I guess you can say I enjoy their music . I purchased this DVD on a whim and LOVE it ! I 've watched it many times over the past couple of weeks that I 've owned it and I 've been really impressed with the quality of the live performance . I guess now I am a Fleetwood Mac fan !	1
Take 5 eager/artistic rock musicians - bring them together in a studio and unleash them - the result is solid gold masterpieces . Take the same group of eager/artistic rock musicians - rake them over the public a few years - relying on ingested chemicals to keep them going in order to keep the public happy - and the result is abused musicians - no good to their audience but mostly no good to themselves - if they are strong enough they will survive - if they are not ... .. Now - take these broken abused musicians -extract the chemicals - - give them a few years to rest and heal - come to life - and the result is Healing . Bring these musicians together on stage when they are ready to begin again - and unleash them once more - the result is - ~~~~~ The Dance ~~~~~ ! i wept tears of joy as i watched this healing unveil before my eyes as i watched FM join together as one for the first time - such love filled the stage . So much energy flows from Christine - Mick - John - Lindsey and Stevie that it is very hard to sit still and watch this video ! It was as if the healing was completed as a whole as soon as they hit the stage . i would strongly recommend this video to all FM fans ! ~Legends - Poets - Priests of Nothing~ So VERY TIMELESS !	1
It has been countless times that I 've heard somebody say that it was The Dance show that made them become a Fleetwood Mac fan . While my indoctrination to the group 's music was n't because of The Dance , it was my first viewing of Fleetwood Mac ( the Rumours era ) live , in concert . I was n't disappointed ... well okay I was , I wish they did Little Lies.Still , The Dance is pure Rumours era Fleetwood Mac . There are the classics from the Rumours album ( the most represented album on this DVD , ) a few from The White Album , the title track from Tusk and two releases from the Tango In The Night album along with a few new songs an old B-side song ( Silver Springs ) and an acoustic version of Lindsey 's Go Insane.All in all , just to see Lindsey fingerpick on Big Love and Go Insane was worth it for me . This is definitely one of the best live shows you 'll ever see .	1
My sons , who are both elementary school age , love this concert . The hooks are Tusk -- with its stunning inclusion of the USC marching band -- and the close-ups of Mick Fleetwood , who has inspired my boys to assemble home-made drum kits out of anything they can find . Every time we watch this , they pepper me with questions about how songs are written , what bass guitarists do , who decides which instrument plays when , why singers have different parts in a song , and so on . Who would have thought that this DVD would have made this impression ? It 's a tribute to the production values that the children always know exactly what 's going on and who 's doing what . And the sound quality is terrific !	1
After a long period apart ( aside from a one-shot reunion for Bill Clinton 's 1992 inauguration ) , the `` Rumors '' era line-up of Fleetwood Mac -- Mick Fleetwood , John McVie , Christine McVie , Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham -- reunited in 1997 and the results are breathtaking and magical . This is a group of muscians who simply get better and better with age . The opening number , `` The Bridge , '' brings all the pieces together for a stunning beginning , with the impeccable rhythym section of John McVie and Mick Fleetwood , the incredible guitar playing of Lindsay Buckingham ( just watch him pluck the notes from his guitar , why the man is not mentioned in lists of guitar greats is a mystery to me ) , and the harmonizing of Christine Mcvie , Stevie Nick , and Buckingham . All are in top form , although the voices of Nicks and Buckingham are not what they once were , but they still put every ounce of heart and soul into their performances.The band performs its classic numbers , mixing in a few new songs as well , and each of the singers ( McVie , Nicks and Buckingham ) perform their signature songs.But it 's Lindsay Buckingham who simply steals the show ( with Mick Fleetwood right behind him , joyously playing his drums ) . He performs with passion and incredible musicianship , whether it 's his mind-bogling guitar solo on `` Big Love '' to his performance of `` Go Insane '' and `` I 'm So Afraid . `` Stevie Nicks also has her moments as well , particularly the emotional `` Landslide '' and `` Silver Springs , '' and the interaction on-stage between Buckingham and Nicks is intense , even if it 's the two just exchanging a look . `` The Dance '' on DVD includes many songs not on the CD release and is well worth the purchase for that reason . This is an early-era DVD -- one of the first , really , so for the 21st century viewer , this is not something that is going to look very good on your 52-inch high-def television . It 's full-screen , non-anamorphic and looks slightly better than the VHS version . The Dolby Digital 5.1 track is very good , though , and surround sound is used extensively , with a lot of activity in the rear channels.There are no extras , this being an early DVD , but there is an option to enable on-screen lyrics which is a nice touch if you 're like me and want to know what exactly is being sung.Fleetwood Mac continued in early 2003 with `` Say You Will '' and followed that album with a tour ( without Christine McVie , unfortunately ) and The Mac was still in fine form , even better than they were in 1997.It would be nice to see a remastered , updated version of this DVD , with perhaps some interviews with the band to get their perspective on the reunion . Until that happens , this will have to do . Sit back , turn up the sound , and be prepared to be blown away .	1
the world was ready for silver springs when this came out . on video , on dvd , on tv , live in concert and on the stage ! magical fleetwood mac reunion tour on tape !	1
This is an awesome production . The stage set-up was striking in appearance . The camera work is excellent and the sound quality is outstanding . I have watched this many times and never cease to enjoy it .	1
This concert from the Mac is essential for two reasons : 1 ) you get to hear/see the songs left off from the Dance CD and 2 ) it was probably the last time Christine McVie toured with the band . Even if you are n't a fan of Christine 's songs , her voice beautifully fills in the 3-part harmonies that made Fleetwood Mac so famous . And those 3-part harmonies were sorely missed on FM 's latest album and tour ( Say You Will ) , as good as that record and tour were.The Dance concert is amazing from start to finish . There 's not a dud in the entire set , although naturally some songs are better than others . ( Stevie 's Sweet Girl , for instance , while pleasant enough , sounds like a cast-off from her solo albums , and it may very well have been just that . ) A few comments : -- Great version of The Chain ! Lindsey , Stevie , and Chris at their harmonizing best. -- Gold Dust Woman rocks . Stevie really gets into this one and we get a chilling `` scream . '' They should have bumped Dreams off the CD and included GDW . Really. -- One of the best versions of Gypsy I 've ever heard . Again , should have been on the CD. -- Buckingham shines on his two acoustic efforts , Big Love and Go Insane . You really get to see what that man can do with a guitar . Wow. -- Both Say You Love Me and Everywhere sound better than ever . The banjo gives Say you Love Me some extra playfulness. -- Rhiannon , great as always , but I much prefer the `` Dream on , silly dreamer '' version . : ( -- Silver Springs - what can I say ? Chilling and intense. -- Encore of Tusk , Do n't Stop , and Songbird is a great all-around effort.Finally , a comment on some of the reviewers ' observations that Christine McVie looks bored . Yes , she 's more subdued than Nicks , Buckingham , and Fleetwood . But in a band of the eccentric and insane Buckingham and the twirling rock goddess Nicks , someone has to play it cool .	1
That 's simply unbelievable ! I 'm definitely not a fan of Fleetwood Mac and you would be ashamed of me if I told you that the only 2 songs of Fleetwood Mac I liked before were & quot ; Everywhere & quot ; and & quot ; The Seven Wonders & quot ; , the latter being not on the DVD.That said , I was really intrigued by the other reviews and , baffled , I decided to give it a chance . Ooooh , I wish I had more inspirations like this one ! ! ! In this concert , shot in the premises of Warner Bros Studios , the band reunited to give the audience the best , the *very* best of themselves , humanly speaking . The old songs are all performed in a new version , giving them an emotional power they did n't have before . Fleetwood Mac also plays stupendous unpublished works , including instrumentals and brand-new songs , which proves that Fleetwood Mac is as sparkling as in the past and , in my opinion , even more sparkling than ever ! Look at Mick Fleetwood ! Yeh ... look at him ! Have you ever seen an old timer like him playing the drums with so much pleasure , conviction and dexterity ? I bet that from the very first song ( & quot ; The Chain & quot ; ) , you 'll know what I mean.Lindsey Buckingham is really impressive . He plays several guitars and even the banjo in the concert and it 's a delight to watch him juggling with the notes . You 'll be very likely amazed by his solo performance in & quot ; Big Love & quot ; and & quot ; Go insane & quot ; .And especially , do n't watch the grand finale of & quot ; I 'm so afraid & quot ; with a friend at home . If he falls on the terrific instrumental duet between Mick and Lindsey , his first idea might well be to get the hell out of your house with your DVD in the pocket ! ! As for Stevie Nicks , she still has her angel voice . She 's very convincing when she sings , because her tone and pitch always match the lyrics but never in an exaggerated way . You 'll also notice that she dances like a bird flies , it 's so light and aerial . You 'll also appreciate Stevie 's cheerfulness . When she talks to the public , she sounds so happy to see you there that you really sympathize with her feelings . Why , it makes you feel good ! ! I read some reviews saying that Christine Mc Vie had lost the magic of her voice after all these years . Maybe . But I do n't care . It is perhaps a pitch lower but she knows how to master it and that 's why Christine and her voice will seduce you a long time yet . Just listen to her version of Everywhere : is n't that cute ? Her ex-husband John , because he plays the bass , stays more in the background . That said , he 's a great support for Lindsey and shows his great sense of humour when Christine tries to force him to sing with the whole band in & quot ; Say You Love Me & quot ; .The songs are all absolute gems . Yet you may have difficulties to tackle & quot ; My Little Demon & quot ; , because the tune and the words are weird ! I learnt to like it and understand it ( a lot of Lindsey 's songs have a context related to his life ) and I no longer skip it now . Expect a surprise at the end of the concert and do n't forget to savour the conclusion song , offered by Christine . You 'll be so upset that you 'll be mad at them for leaving so soon.The quality of the DVD is excellent ! The sound , Dolby 5.1 or PCM Stereo , is perfect . The picture is clear and flawless . My God , how did they do that ? ! You want to be forgiven by your wife ? Offer her this DVD ! You want to be spoilt by your granny ? Ask her this DVD ! Whatever the way you 'll get it , watch it in the evening . & quot ; It 's going to be a special night for us & quot ; , Stevie Nicks said . For you too .	1
Fleetwood Mac : The DanceRecorded at Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank in 1997 , this is a reunion concert for Fleetwood Mac ( with a golden & quot ; Rumours & quot ; line-up of 1977 ) , who had been in hibernation for a while at the time of recording The Dance album . The fact that they had not played live together for a while did not seem to be a problem for these great musicians as they jumped straight into one of the best renditions of & quot ; The Chain & quot ; I have heard from them . And the concert just went off from there . A collection of some of their best known hits interspersed with new tracks from & quot ; The Dance & quot ; album plus some solo works from Lindsey Buckingham , this is a very enjoyable concert indeed . 106 minutes and 22 tracks of real good rocking . The finale ( & quot ; Tusk & quot ; and & quot ; Do n't Stop & quot ; ) with additional eighty piece brass marching band is really something ! This is really great live music from one of the genuine legendary bands of the rock era and it is a fine way to get to know this great band ( except for those who remember Peter Green 's Fleetwood Mac , of course ) .Try it anyway , and you wo n't be disappointed !	1
I love Badfinger . Earlier this year I attended an event called `` Hippiefest '' which featured a bunch of nostalgia acts from the '60s and '70s . Among the featured performers was Joey Molland . His set featured `` No Matter What , '' `` Come And Get It , '' `` Day After Day , '' and `` Baby Blue . '' Of course , Joey Molland is the last living member of Badfinger , and I was very anxious to see how they souned in their heyday.This documentary showcases the talent of all original members , which is great to see . You will even get some footage of their pre-Badfinger days , when they were known as The Iveys . The interviews with Joey Molland and Mike Gibbons are very informative , and there are some funny stories to keep you entertained.We all know the tragety of the band - the poor manegement and two suicides - so I wo n't go on about that . If you like Badfinger , get this documentary . It 's very well made . And if you ever get a chance to see Joey Molland , take my advice : go . It is a lot of fun .	1
The terms which this movie is billed as , & quot ; emotionally gripping & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; riveting , & quot ; may be overselling a little , as the story is quite enjoyable up until the unpleasentness discussed in the last 10 or 20 minutes . The first thing you may notice is that the story is unnarrated and told via interview footage in the style of the Beatles Anthology . However , seeing as how there is not an endless supply of photographs & amp ; video footage of Badfinger like there is for the Beatles , this creates a problem of seeing the same pictures a few too many times throughout the video . ( For instance , a black & amp ; white photograph of evil manager Stan Polley is shown at every mention of his name , which gets a little irritating . ) The only other real problem is that , because of the lack of narration , you pretty much have to already know the basic gist of Badfinger 's story to know what 's going on.The interview portions with Joey Molland & amp ; Mike Gibbins are pretty good . Entirely unprofessional , but at least they 're not phony . Mike can be a little long-winded , but it 's all right because you learn a few minor facts that you might not have already known.What this collection is most valuable for , however , is the live performances . Before buying this , I was under the impression that the performances were all lip-synced ( the album version plays as it shows the band performing & quot ; live & quot ; ) . That turned out to not be the case , save for two performances at the beginning . You get to hear Badfinger 's biggest hits played live in footage taken from TV shows : & quot ; Come & amp ; Get It , & quot ; & quot ; No Matter What , & quot ; and & quot ; Baby Blue , & quot ; as well as a rocked-up version of & quot ; Suitcase & quot ; where Pete Ham 's lead & amp ; slide guitar sound awesome . The performances are all complete and without any annoying voice-over interruptions.If you already know all there is to know about Badfinger , you wo n't find too much of interest here , but for anyone else who is a fan of their Apple days ' music and wants to know a little bit about this band , I give this tape my full recommendation .	1
George did n't make but a couple videos , These were all good , The bonus videos were my favorite , Especially & # 34 ; Living for the nite & # 34 ; Seeing George in his later years was a change , he ages well , wiswh I did . I received it before expected .	1
There is no concert I have watched more than this one since I first bought the VHS tape and then acquired the DVD when that came out . After many , many viewings of it , its still great stuff - especially that first 50 minutes.The music is a little bit more diverse than on Yanni 's first concert DVD : `` At The Acropolis . '' This concert features India 's Taj Mahal and China 's Forbidden City , In addition to the music , we have stunning color added ; a great mix of purples , yellows , blues , pinks , etc . The concert stages - particularly in China - are bathed in these colors.For most of my many , many viewings of this I would have the opening song , `` Deliverance , '' and the title tune , `` Tribute , '' are my two favorites.Although many of Yanni 's band members from the first concert were not with his group any longer by the time they did this one , they have been replaced by people are even more talented in many cases . It 's hard to find a more talented musician that Pedro Eusteache , who plays a number of wind instruments and excels , of course , in all of them . I 'm also in awe of new keyboard player Ming Freeman . These two are still in the orchestra today.Violinist Karen Briggs is as animated and talented as ever and , along with Eustache , is the feature musician in the band . When the two of them alternate solos , playing off each other in `` Renegade , '' it 's about as entertaining a few minutes as you 'll ever find on an orchestral stage . I 'm sorry Briggs is no longer with Yanni 's band.Ten years after first seeing and hearing this for the first time , I can still safely say music does n't get much better than this , unless , perhaps , Yanni '' s latest : Yanni Live !	1
This is one of my all-time favorite music DVD 's . There are so many reasons why this is a great show to watch . The music is all original , written by Yanni and played by a proffessional symphony orchestra . The setting is in both India 's Taj Mahal and the Forbidden City in China . It was the first live concert ever played in the two settings , and there was a lot of red tape that the producers had to go through in order to get the authority to play in front of these monuments.Also featured are violinist Karen Briggs and woodwind instrumentalist Pedro Eustache . Both are superb improvisational soloists and really add to the entertainment factor of the show . There are also four female singers , all of whom are excellent in their own way , and are featured both as soloists and providing background harmony.Yanni 's talent , along with being a prolific pianist , composer and arranger , is bringing great musicians together and directing them in a way to fully exploit each musicians unique and individual sound . His band contains musicians from all over the globe , and is something of a `` United Nations '' band.For these reasons , I enjoyed this DVD much more than any other Yanni 's other material . Most of his albums that I have heard thus far are just him playing , using synthesizers and drum machines to try to get the sound that he wants . Where this gives him the opportunity to explore the art of composing , there is nothing like hearing the music come alive with real musicians and orchestrations of what he wants to do.I also compare this album to `` Live at the Acropolis , '' and feel that buying this DVD would be a much better purchase . I think that Yanni 's music was still in the developmental stage when he recorded at the Acropolis ; with `` Tribute , '' he has had a chance to try things out , and this is the culmination of all his years of hard work as a composer and arranger . I do n't know if Yanni himself will be able to top this performance , let alone any other musician .	1
I got this video back in 97 ... I still love watching it today ... it almost makes me wan na cry because THEY WERE SO LITTLE ! lol . Itz the cutest video..you have to be a Hanson Fan to really appreciate it though . Itz great : o ) : :This is a young cave dweller , running back and forth , beating trees : :	1
I 'll get to the point and be brief ... Great performances , great sound quality , great interviews and commentary , and especially beautiful scenery : not the least of which is the captivatingly sensuous Marta Sanchez ( sings on `` Vivo Por Ella '' ) what a GORGEOUS woman ! ! !	1
I have a very high opinion of this man and his voice . Anyone who hears his voice is automatically captivated by it ! I am so thankful to have lived in this era so as to hear and enjoy his voice and the music produced by him .	1
Bernadette Peters , Natalie Desselle , Paolo Montalban , Brandy , Veanne Cox , Whoopi Goldberg , Victor Garber and Whitney Houston all sing and dance up a storm in this glittering new mounting of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic CINDERELLA.This time however , the score is augmented with three new songs , written by Rodgers and Hammerstein in their seperate early careers.They include 'The Deepest Love In All The World ' , sung by Brandy and Paolo Montalban , 'The Music In You ' , sung by Whitney Houston , and , my personal favourite , 'Falling In Love With Love ' , sung by the incomparable Bernadette Peters , with additional vocals by Natalie Desselle and Veanne Cox.The entire production is flawless , and I loved every minute of it.It has previously been recorded live on television with Julie Andrews and again with Lesley Ann Warren . Both of those cast albums are still available .	1
If you 're just curious about what Corpse is live , but you 're not into them , DO N'T GET THIS VIDEO . It 's basically a bunch of camcorder videos compiled onto on video . There 's one view per song . It 's got great songs on here , especially & quot ; Hammer Smashed Face , & quot ; but to truly appreciate this , you 've probably got to be a big fan of these guys or a collector . One really cool thing about the video though , it contains the video for & quot ; Devoured By Vermin. & quot ; It 's ... interesting , you could say . You might even wonder what the hell just happened . You 'll have to see it . Get & quot ; Live Cannibalism & quot ; if you want more quality , but get this if you 're a Corpse fan .	1
I just saw this video for the first time , so you may have to forgive me if nostalgia causes me , to some anyway , to over-rate this . I notice some reviewers have dissected this filmed 1962 t.v . performance like a cadaver , but this is what I got from the viewing . I like varied styles of music , I 'm not an expert , I like what I hear , or I do n't . I found this filmed musical special just great ! Seeing these legends perform together still gives one goosebumps . The entertainment industry back then was a smaller community , and the obvious affection , support , and comaraderie between these `` friends '' , who also happened to be three of the biggest names in show-biz , is magic . Some find the staging , patter , etc..corny , I loved it . It 's SHOW-BIZ , Baby ! ! ! I found them all in great voice , Sinatra & Dino the definition of cool . And JUDY ! ... oh Judy , is so fantastic , when she sings `` The Man That Got Away '' , from her `` A Star Is Born '' , it 's easy to see why many consider her the greatest talent Hollywood ever produced . Her voice , and the emotion in her renditions , justify the legend . And her finale may bring you to tears . This Baby-Boomer is SO glad I was around at that time , so that I was very familiar with these entertainment giants ... was I lucky . I love music ... many kinds , I 'm just as likely to follow a Patsy Cline c.d . with Blondie , then Jefferson Airplane . But in this era of Puffy Daddys & Techno-Floozies , it is so refreshing to be reminded of these dear , now-gone people , all of whom evoke the term `` God-given talent '' . A great video for `` those who were there '' , and maybe even for those younger who were n't . As time goes by , and when all 's said and done , these three will be of the relative hand-full of performers who will be remembered .	1
Judy Garland was super-hot in 1962 -- so hot that she could easily coax stars Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin into appearing as secondary attractions when she decided to recreate portions of her legendary Carnegie Hall concert for television . After opening the program with a medley including & quot ; Just in Time & quot ; and & quot ; When You 're Smiling , & quot ; Garland introduces her guests , and both Sinatra and Martin have their musical moments and share a bit of comic banter . But this show belongs to Garland , and she dominates it with considerable ease.Garland 's voice was a delicate instrument , and although it was not in truly superior form for this performance it was certainly solid enough to deliver one knock-out punch after another , beginning with a ferocious performance of & quot ; The Man Who Got Away & quot ; and then a charming and memorable & quot ; I Ca n't Give You Anything But Love. & quot ; But the highlight of the program comes at the end , when Garland dispenses with her guests and stomps out onto a runway surrounded by her audience to toss off a handful of songs as only she could : & quot ; Swanee , & quot ; & quot ; Rock-A-Bye Your Baby , & quot ; & quot ; San Francisco. & quot ; And while she does n't quite manage to catch that Carnegie Hall lightening , she still makes it more than worth the trip.The program has been tinkered with , of course , first remixed into stereo and then colorized . The stereo is n't bad -- but the colorization was a mistake : Sinatra 's famous blue eyes have a truly peculiar cast , and the skin tones have a painted-on look . But I would n't avoid this tape on that account . On the other hand , a lot of Garland 's television work is being slowly but surely released on DVD , and you may prefer to bypass this particular out-of-print tape in favor of a future DVD release . But one way or another , this is one that hardcore Garland fans will want to have in their collection .	1
Forget the videos from her '63-64 CBS series , some good , some bad ... a patchwork of quality . If you want to own the ULTIMATE 'Garland On TV ' video , buy this one ... .immediately . Her television work never reached this level of excellence , before or after , and say what you may about 'colorization , ' it adds a lot to the over-all impact of her performance . She had just reached the zenith of her concert career in 1961 at Carnegie Hall , and this '62 TV special is the closest we will ever come to witnessing the magic she created there.Her showmanship supreme is introduced by THE original , earth-shaking Overture from Carnegie Hall , which will put you in the mood to start clapping and shouting her name even from an easy chair in your living room . With & quot ; JUDY & quot ; in slowly illuminating lights as a background , she delivers a powerhouse version of & quot ; Just In Time & quot ; and then swings into her wonderful rendition of & quot ; When You 're Smiling. & quot ; & quot ; I Ca n't Give You Anything But Love & quot ; is sung more poignantly than ever before , and she delivers the most heartbreaking version of & quot ; The Man That Got Away & quot ; you will ever hear . It will take your breath away and make your spine tingle , and she does it in a simple cocktail bar setting , very restrained , no arms flying everywhere , just pure raw emotion in her voice.Fellow 'Rat-Packers ' Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin , certainly legends themselves , are perfect guests , and do some fine solo numbers . They also display their obvious affection and respect for their hostess when joining her in & quot ; You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby & quot ; and an upbeat version of & quot ; You 're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You & quot ; that is truly fun to watch . Then ... POW ... Judy finishes the performance of her life with showstopper versions of & quot ; Swanee , & quot ; & quot ; Rockabye Your Baby , & quot ; and & quot ; San Francisco & quot ; that equal or surpass anything she ever gave us at Carnegie Hall or anywhere else.If you are 60 and you were actually there to watch this TV special forty years ago , or if you are 16 and just starting to discover The Greatest Entertainer Who Ever Lived ... .you need nothing more than this one video to 'know it all . '	1
I gave this five stars because I love Judy and Liza . However , some serious remastering needs to be done on this . The picture is very shaky and the sound is tinny . Great show and well worth the price , but once it is clearer , like Judy 's TV show , it will be more enjoyable .	1
Liza proved herself on this stage with her mother . I do n't know of many people who could have stood up to Judy the way Liza did . Judy was simply Judy . Singing songs the only way she knew how , from the heart . I loved it when she got the audience to sign along with over the rainbow .	1
Judy Garland 's Palladium performance remains a historic event as she shares the spotlight with Liza Minnelli . This 1964 concert displays the undeniable chemistry between mother and daughter , which makes for a powerful and intimate experience . Transferred from video to film for British television , the rough-edged broadcast adds to the live atmosphere . Reportedly , the unedited video recordings may come to light in a future DVD release .	1
Very nice video . Showed John riding horseback and his guest stars as well . All were singing and enjoying the holidays in a barn . John 's baby Jessie was present too . It was like having your own personal Christmas celebration being enjoyed . Even showed them all dining around a big table piled with food that you could almost imagine smelling . Made one want to draw up a chair and join in too . John preformed but not quite enough . He was gracious enough to not share the entire limelight by allowing his guests to do their own thing too . Nice video . No one will be disappointed in buying it themselves . enjoy .	1
I saw this years ago on PBS and was thrilled to find it on DVD . This is a great inside look at the Dead and the process they went through recording Anthem of the Sun and American beauty . Amusing and enlightening interviews with band members and others involved in the scene and some great performance footage makes this an absolute joy to watch . Anyone who loves the Dead will love owning this video .	1
This entry in the Classic Album series is EASILY the juiciest and best . This was a band dealing with internal strife , drugs , jealousy , and pain . And it all came together into what would become one of the most iconic albums in rock and roll.In this series of interviews , you get the dish from each and every one of the band members as well as some objective comments from the album 's producer and engineer . It is a fascinating peek behind the curtain and rivals any soap opera you 've ever seen.Absolutely worth watching !	1
This is a great doucumentary on the making of & quot ; Rumours. & quot ; Great interviews with all the members , detailing each track and offering information on just what it took to put together this landmark album . It includes some very rare footage , and frank discussions about each track , including the illustrious & quot ; Silver Springs & quot ; which was bumped from the album in place of & quot ; I Do n't Wan na Know. & quot ; When the band finished the album , they had no idea what to call it . Since the tabloids were going crazy with rumors of who the band mates were sleeping with , if they were breaking up , drug use , and calling Stevie Nicks a practicing wiccan witch ... John McVie came up with & quot ; Rumours. & quot ; Hence the british spelling of the word !	1
Fascinating to hear how each song came about and resulted in an album that was truly something extraordinary . The crosscurrents of emotion from the many relationships in turmoil must have contributed to the passion that resulted in this legendary album .	1
First off , let me say that several people have reviewed this item incorrectly . The item above is NOT the AUDIO DVD of the Rumours album ( DVD-A ) . The Audio DVD is a completely different experience than the item you are looking at . This item is a regular `` movie '' visual-type DVD that includes interviews with the band and that breaks down the music peice by peice . It 's been on TV before ... and , it 's been available on VHS for quite a long time . With that said ... Being a huge FM and Stevie fan , I purchased this on DVD hoping that it might have additional footage or features that were not on the VHS ( which , of course I have already ) . Well sadly , there is nothing additional on the DVD . However , this is still such a GREAT thing to have . It 's absolutely amazing to listen to Stevie , alone at her candlelit piano , singing `` Dreams '' . It makes me cry because it 's so beautiful . That 30 seconds of video ALONE is worth the purchase price . It 's incredible to hear the music `` taken apart '' at the soundboard , instrument by instrument , sound by sound , voice by voice . It really helps you understand and appreciate the painstaking process this was for all of them . If you 've never seen it , you really should buy it - on either format - DVD or VHS - it really makes no difference .	1
I 've always been a Billy Joel fan and have been collecting all performances that I can get my hands on . This being one of them . I really dig the energy the crowd brings and the song selection is perfect . A must have for any Billy Joel fan .	1
Even though I came of age in the 1980s and do n't consider myself a Luddite , I 've never been enamored of the music-video genre . To me , it 's simply a very creative form of advertising geared at the TV Generation . I am not saying there 's anything intrinsically wrong with music videos . I just find them limiting in the sense that once I ( and I say this so I wo n't be unfairly generalizing ) see a video of a song I particularly like , it 's then very difficult to shake off the video-director 's visualization of it , particularly if I have my own cinematic images in my mind . The & quot ; real & quot ; video then overrides my own interpretation of , say , The Beatles ' & quot ; Yesterday. & quot ; Call me a purist , call me a dweeb , but I prefer to hear songs with few visual aids.In spite of this bias , I do make an occasional music-video purchase or even ( are you sitting down ? ) watch one or two on cable . ( I remember waiting rather impatiently for the world premiere of John Williams ' & quot ; Duel of the Fates & quot ; video on MTV , but that was in 1999 ... ) Sometimes the music videos are included in the extra features of a feature film 's DVD -- the two Star Wars movies , Spider-Man , and both Lord of the Rings have a related music video included -- but once in a blue moon I buy a stand-alone collection of videos.Ironically , Billy Joel does n't like the idea of making videos , but he makes them for his label , Columbia . He says ( in the liner notes to his Greatest Hits boxed set ) that he is short , a bit bug-eyed and not exactly the handsomest fellow in the business , and that when he is behind his keyboard and performing he imagines himself as NOT looking short , bug-eyed and not handsome . ( Or something along those lines , anyway ... ) Videos , for him , shatter that illusion . So in a strange dovetailing of attitudes , he 's done videos , and I own some of them.The clips Columbia Music Video assembled here for Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume III : The Video span a period of 14 years , starting with 1983 's & quot ; Keeping the Faith & quot ; ( from & quot ; An Innocent Man & quot ; ) to Joel 's 1997 cover of Bob Dylan 's & quot ; To Make You Feel My Love. & quot ; As a result , each video has a different style and look , as does Joel himself . We see him aging gracefully from '83 to '97 , and his & quot ; look & quot ; evolves along with his music . And although most of the videos are conventional MTV-style & quot ; conceptualizations , there are a few songs that were shot & quot ; live & quot ; on a stage , particularly & quot ; Shameless , & quot ; & quot ; All About Soul , & quot ; & quot ; To Make You Feel My Love , & quot ; and his cover of & quot ; Hey Girl. & quot ; Of the & quot ; concept & quot ; videos , I particularly like & quot ; A Matter of Trust. & quot ; In it , Joel and his band give an impromptu ( and to some , annoying ) performance as they practice in a New York City apartment ( my favorite bit is the angry neighbor who twice yells for the loud rockers to & quot ; Shut up ! & quot ; ) . It not only looks realistic , it 's fun , especially since & quot ; A Matter of Trust & quot ; is one of Joel 's few guitar-based songs . I also like the clip for & quot ; Lullabye ( Goodnight , My Angel ) . & quot ; It is more abstract , but the images fit the song 's melody and emotional context perfectly.Joel also provides some explanatory comments prior to most of the clips . I was surprised to see how erudite and soft-spoken he is , and he often reminds me of my college humanities professor ( who was also a trained musician ) , a man who spoke about music , philosophy , politics , and history without being boring . His brief intros give the viewer some insight into how and why Joel wrote each song.While I prefer CMV 's Billy Joel : Live at Yankee Stadium , Greatest Hits Volume III : The Video is still very watchable , especially on the DVD format .	1
Almost did n't buy because one customer complained about Billy Joel talking before each song . I actually enjoy that part because he sets up the song . If you do n't want to listen just press the fast forward key . Great list of songs for Billy Joel fans .	1
For God 's sake people , the Classic Album series by Eagle Eye Media is a series of DVD documentaries about the *making* of classic albums . These are not DVDs of videos and music . This series will probably be of highest interest to musicians and recordist . And it 's an excellent series with quality production .	1
For the last two decades Earth , Wind & Fire has continued to tour regularly , though they have not come up with much in the way of memorable fresh material to add to a legacy that provided many timeless performances from roughly 1973-1981 . As such , on this 1994 Japan concert video -- one of Maurice White 's last before illness took him off the stage -- all but a couple of tunes are from the above-mentioned era . However , the performances have too much vitality and freshness for one to think this is just another oldies act going through the motions . Accordingly , this DVD is a good option for those wanting to get a taste of the group near if not quite at the peak of their performing powers . By the way , note that there is also a 1990 Live In Japan DVD , just in case anyone is confused about which tour this video represents.Although I miss the extended jams ( e.g. , `` Africano '' ) , EWF does offer strong , concise versions of mostly their greatest hits , covering the seventeen tunes in the DVD 's one-hour running time ( note that several songs are brief interludes ) , and performed with a full band including a horn section and two female dancers . The between-song moments are edited down , so you get wall-to-wall music which mostly replicates the sound of the original recordings . In general both White and particularly Philip Bailey are in top form vocally , and in-step with the choreographed moments . Still , although his performance does n't suffer it is a little disconcerting to see White have this `` far-away-look '' in his eyes at times , leaving one to wonder if this is a sign of things to come ( to be fair , it may be unrelated ) . Nevertheless , I find his presence to be crucial in making this video recommended over any of the post-White EWF DVDs in circulation .	1
Sarah Brightman 's first concert video , performed live at the Royal Albert Hall and recorded in September 1997 , contains material taken from Time To Say Goodbye , The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection , and songs not on any other album . Hearing the latter material is the real treat , and makes me wish a studio rendition would be put out on a future album . The opening number , & quot ; Bailero , & quot ; would later appear on her Eden album.In particular is her rendition of the Spanish-tinged & quot ; Chanson Espagnol & quot ; and Grieg 's & quot ; Solveig 's Song. & quot ; In the latter song , she covers her face with her hands , removes them , and sings , finishing the song with the covering gesture.Ever since hearing & quot ; O Mio Babbino Caro & quot ; on Classics , I 've really come to enjoy this song more than ever since hearing it on Time To Say Goodbye . And seeing her perform & quot ; Tu Quieres Volver & quot ; and & quot ; Who Wants To Live Forever & quot ; alone is worth the video.No , she does not bow out after & quot ; Music Of The Night. & quot ; She does an encore by dragging out Andrea Bocelli , and singing ... um.. oh yeah , & quot ; Time To Say Goodbye. & quot ; She concludes with & quot ; Do n't Cry For Me Argentina & quot ; from Evita.The concert is divided in three sections , the first set of songs being the more operatic , up to the medley , and the second set utilizing her pop vocal , from & quot ; Tu Quieres Volver & quot ; to & quot ; Whistle Down The Wind , & quot ; by which time her voice is all rested up and ready to go on the Phantom songs and the encore . One comment on & quot ; Music Of The Night. & quot ; What a nerve ALW had in giving that song to the phantom ! It 's Sarah 's by right and she proves it too ! Sarah 's face is a little moon-faced here , and that aspect of her lends to her beauty . It gives her face more articulation , especially when her eyes bulge round whenever she hits a high note . She reminds me of a very cute hootie owl . And I am blown away by that sweet smile of hers.Sarah is easily a supernova compared to her guest performers , even ex-husband Andrew Lloyd Webber , who plays piano as she sings & quot ; Whistle Down The Wind. & quot ; Young choirboy Adam Clarke , who joins her on & quot ; Pie Jesu , & quot ; looks very bashful , but that 's understandable , as he is no doubt overwhelmed at performing on stage live and alongside a goddess . And as for poor Andrea Bocelli , well , need I say more ? At least someone made sure his tie was straight.Seeing Sarah sing instead of hearing her merely sing her on five-inch silver disc is a triple treat , of which there are two other servings : the Eden and La Luna concert videos . Stay tuned !	1
Sarah Brightman has such a beautiful and divine voice . I highly recommend this concert video . Sarah sings many beautiful songs on it . I 'd give it ten stars if I could !	1
What this DVD includesThe Making of & quot ; Everybody & quot ; ( Backstreet 's Back ) & quot ; Everybody ( Backstreet 's Back ) extended dance mix with dialougueOn the Set of & quot ; As You As You Love Me & quot ; & quot ; As Long As You Love Me & quot ; & quot ; All I Have to Give & quot ; ( Sneak Preview ) & quot ; Quit Plaing Games ( With My Heart ) & quot ; Get Down ( You 're the One For Me ) & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; Anywhere For You & quot ; & quot ; I 'll Never Break Your Heart & quot ; & quot ; We Got It Goin ' On & quot ; It also includes unreleased concert footage and personal interviews with each member of Backstreet Boys	1
Skynyrd 's & quot ; Lyve from Steeltown & quot ; is a companion video to the CD , and it is a very well-produced look at the band in concert . Skynyrd are in rare form in this video , and it is obvious that this is the best lineup the band has had since the 1977 plane crash . Highlights for diehard fans include & quot ; Travelin ' Man & quot ; and & quot ; Freebird & quot ; .	1
I bought this DVD in order to replace a VHS I still have since 1999 . The sound is far better and the image , of course , is upgraded to the possible level , since it is a show from late 90 's . There are some interesting bonuses , including interviews with some members of the band . For Lynyrd Skynyrd fans and Classic Rock aficionados .	1
I 'm biased - I love John Fogerty . Bias aside , even the greats put out duds now and then . This is n't a dud . It 's the best of Fogerty 's career . Lots of old favorites from CCR are included , some hits from Centerfield , and of course , some great new songs from Blue Moon Swamp.I 'm buying this on DVD because I know I 'll wear out the tape !	1
I never had the chance to see Creedence Clearwater Revival live , having been born after they split-up , so I was very happy to at least have their frontman captured on DVD . Neither the performance nor the DVD disappointed me ( except for the cardboard case , because I hate those , and think they should be banned from production ) . This is a must for John Fogerty and Creedence fans ; Mr. Fogerty gives the performance of his life on a great line-up of songs spanning his whole career , and shows that he can still rock at 50+ . I 'm not sure what more can be said , except , it plays great , it looks great , buy it !	1
For the fellow who found this a little Milli Vanilli , I can assure you , I 've been to Fogerty 's concerts . If there 's anything dubbed or fiddled with about this ( except for a couple of tracks the producers openly acknowledge ) I 'll eat my hat . It 's nonestly not as good as being there , if you ever get that notion , but it surely captures the je ne se quois of a Fogerty concert . I 'm not ashamed to have this in my collection .	1
John Foggerty who made a name for himself with his brother back int he 60's/70 's `` Creedence Clearwater Revival '' had finnaly gotten his copyright back to own the songs he wrote with CCR and has perfromed them well on this show.Some people have complained about the sound quality and faults , and even over dubbing ... I dont know if I heard that on my disc or not ? I do have the Regoin 4 version , but if its the same as R1 then I dont know what there on about ? Maybe thats been corrected ? I owned the Video of this show when it came out , and the CD ... and i 'm glad to see that this show has had the cut songs put back into the show , espeicaly `` Walking In A Hurricaine '' and now the show is bigger and better with the full show on DVD.There is not bonus features unfortuanlty , it would be nice to have some , but the show itself is great if you like John or his kind of music . But dont expect any pryo or props , thats not the kind of rock band they are . Just enjoy the music performed clearly , nicely , and well done .	1
This an excellent DVD . The video and sound quality are excellent . Good selection of tunes . This is one of my favorite DVD 's . Highly recommend !	1
Fogerty is da bomb . This DVD and the live concert - two of the best I 've seen . The sound is awesome . And Kenny the drummer - rock out dude . But , has anyone noticed anything a little milli vanilli about this ? hmmmm .	1
I have never listened to the music of G.G . Allin , but I 've heard about his infamous stage antics which have pretty much overshadowed the fact that this man even had somewhat of a musical career . This documentary , by director Todd Phillips ( you may know him as the director of films like Old School and The Hangover ) gets up close ( but not exactly personal ) with the legend that was G.G . Allin.The documentary opens with a quote by John Wayne Gacy , the notorious serial killer who got to know Allin through prison visitations . Other people interviewed include some fans of Allin , Allin 's brother/bass player Merle Allin ( who sports a strangely menacing , ridiculous Hitler-like moustache ) , and a former member of Allin 's band who had no respect or admiration for what Allin was doing on stage . The documentary shows Allin on-stage at various venues , as well as a spoken-word performance where Allin attacked a woman . That 's hardly the worst thing you 'll see Allin do in this doc and , with that said , be aware : this is a graphic , disgusting documentary . There is full-frontal nudity from both genders , consummation of bodily waste , images of self-mutilation , etc.Little seems to be known about the true character of G.G . Allin and this film does little to enlighten us , but I do n't quite consider that a fault . I do n't think anyone , let alone Allin , had a concept of who he was . Being neither a fan nor a hater , I was entranced by this documentary but I 'm still unable to come to a conclusion about G.G . Allin . Was he an insane , vile human being ( as many think ) or a symbol of the animalistic nature that exists in all humans ? People seem to be drawn on this as I am , but I find it hard to deny Allin had some mental issues . Maybe Allin ( and others ) saw his antics as representing something important , but how do you justify eating your own feces in front of an audience ? Not just that , but smearing it on yourself and throwing it into the crowd ? Anyone hoping to understand Allin will have to continue looking in vain , but this short documentary does serve as a visual presentation of one of the craziest , most violent musicians who ever lived . If you 're a fan or just curious about this infamous character , this is worth your time.GRADE : B	1
I recall thinking to myself after watching Hated - did I just watch a brutally honest man who embodies all that is the punk rock ethos or did I just watch a psychopath at work ? I still do n't know yet I ca n't help but find myself steeped in respect for this man . He refused to accept the life on life 's terms . He lived on his terms more than anyone I can think of . Did he shock for the sake of shock ? Absolutely not . He was shocking because he was who he was and would not give in to anyone or anything . Allin seems to be the combination of every shred of anger and rebellion from every artist that ever tried to break the mold . When others put down their pens , paints , guitars and typewriters , Allin kept screaming.Think about it . Almost every one of us has compromised to keep a job , a woman , a man , a family , a house , car , whatever . We need to pay the rent , the bills , eat and get to work so we do n't end up living beneath a freeway . Allin did n't care . He told everyone to eat sh** and he was more than happy to sit in a jail cell if need be . In some strange way , this apparent lunatic transcended life itself where everything was equal and nothing mattered . Not life , jail or death . But he was no lunatic . He was a bright man who had huge balls and was never hesitant to tell anyone exactly what he thought . Because the consequences were meaningless . If you can live your life where consequences mean nothing , I really think , dead or alive , you 've won.Overall , Hated is a good film . The 50 minutes in the extras can be tough to watch because of the handheld camera bouncing all over the place . This is one of the few things I 've seen where I was not only asking myself , `` Who is this guy ? '' but `` Who the hell am I ? '' I still do n't know if I think GG Allin is repulsive or inspiring but the fact I 'm torn tells me he was one hell of a man .	1
I found this DVD while surfing youtube . Ordered it `` used '' and it may be the best buy for the dollar I 've ever purchased . I was 18 when the Beatles hit the US and this is without a doubt the closest I 've ever come to seeing the Beatles live . Golden Slumbers , Yesterday and Hey Jude were incredible . But 14 of the 18 songs are terrific ...	1
I first viewed a portion of this event on Youtube and liked it enough to look for the entire event . That event is Music for Montserrat , an event staged for the intent of generating aid for the Volcano stricken island of Montserrat . It deals with several musicians including Elton John , Sting , Eric Clapton and Mark Knopfler who each do from two to four songs and the others accompany them during the performance . My favorite bits were Mark Knopflers Brothers in Arms and Money for Nothing with Phil Collins on Drums , Eric Clapton and Knopfler on Guitar and Sting doing backup vocals.All in all a worthwhile DvD . I enjoyed it immensely .	1
This is a great music DVD I love it . Lot 's of rock stars and loads of songs , I am very pleased . Money well spent , If you like this DVD you will love `` A Concert For George '' that was a ten plus+++++	1
This terrific 1997 concert , complete with a cadre of British rock aristocracy , was put together by producer extraordinaire , Sir George Martin . A couple years earlier the huge , long dormant volcano on the Caribbean island , exploded , destroying much of the island nation . Many , including most on this concert bill , had recorded there in years past . A couple of Americans ( Carl Perkins , Jimmy Buffett ) sing a tune but this show is a wowser for the Brits.Phil Collins takes the lead and acts as a co-host . He also shows up on drums for most of the performances shown on the DVD . While I liked everything , my favorite numbers were by former Dire Straits leader Mark Knopfler , Elton John , Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney . John does one of my favorites in `` Your Song , '' perhaps his earliest hit . `` Live Like Horses '' is another song he does well . When I first saw this concert , I had never heard it before . Clapton is at his blues belting best , especially on `` Same Old Blues '' with help from Collins , Knopfler , piano man Jools Holland and entertaining percussionist , Ray Cooper . McCartney looks like he 's 25 and does a great job in his closing numbers which includes everybody on `` Hey Jude '' and `` Kansas City . `` If there is a quibble it might be that the songs are all very familiar . But let 's face it , this is what the audience wanted to here . The concert , filmed at famed Royal Albert Hall in London is one of the earliest DVDs and has some quirks . This version does n't seem to have a top menu . Load it up and off it goes . Dolby Digital 5.1 is the only surround option on this disc , but it is very good . The picture has an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 but looks pretty good . The concert has aged gracefully , like most of the performers .	1
This is one of the better ensemble concerts I have heard . `` Brothers in Arms '' by Mark Knopfler ( Dire Straits ) is the most exquisite song on the program and Knopfler 's `` Money for Nothing '' with Sting and Eric Clapton is the most rocking . Clapton 's mostly-acoustic guitar set ( with Knopfler backing ) is superb , and I ca n't complain about Elton John on solo piano . He is truly an outstanding performer . The finale with Paul McCartney leading endless choruses of `` Hey Jude '' with all the performers was way , way better than good.Smallchief	1
It was excellent ! It was my first time hearing most of the music , but it left a great first impression . Sarah Brightman was her usual hauntingly angelic self . Donny Osmond and his chorus of kids , though they had little time on stage , started the show magnificently . Michel Ball , who I later realized , after thinking over and over that I had heard him before , was Marius in the Les Mis dreamcast in the tenth anniversary concert , was a great inspiration to young singers in his many contributions during the show . The only thing I found wrong with it was Antonio Bandaras ' attempt at the Phantom . The guy 's got a nice voice , but he 's no Phantom . It really could have used Micheal Crawford at that point , but the rest of it was just perfect . I highly recommend it to all fans of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Musical Theatre .	1
Although I usually prefer classical music or pre-1950s popular music , I do enjoy the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber . This is a very good sampling from his musicals . My only complaint is that some of the singing is not as good as it should be . Except for the opening number which was poorly sung , it sounded OK until I heard Sarah Brightman and Kiri Te Kanawa towards the end of the concert . Then I realized how much better this concert would have been if it had all been sung by singers of their skills .	1
I love ALW 's music , and this video . But ... Antonio Banderes ? as the Phantom ? no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! He was great in the Evita sequence but not Phantom , c'mon !	1
Good recognition and praise for an entertaining phenomenon , with many pearls of his creations performed by various great artists , including his ex-wife.Very enjoyable .	1
So much to enjoy in the collection . It 's like going to the theater in the comfort of your home . Each artist delivers the best of their artistic talent to this venue .	1
The opening song WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND is sung by Tina Arena . The music and the way Tina performs the song is very powerful . She has a great voice but she sings it too aggressively , I better like the way Lottie Mayor sings it , at the end of the concert.Donny Osmond sings ANY DREAM WILL DO and CLOSE EVERY DOOR together with a children choir . Donny has a great charisma and voice . It sounds fantastic with the children . Julian Lloyd Webber plays cello - the music from VARIATIONS ( a symphonic concert from 1977 ) .Antonio Banderas : HIGH FLYING ADORED . Elaine Paige : DO N'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA . She sings it as beautiful as 20 years ago , when she had the leading role as Evita.Dennis O'Neill sings in Latin the song HOSANNA from Requiem . There is a girl in the choir , she looks like Charlotte Church ? Sarah Brightman appears like a magic woman , and the dancers fall to the floor . Sarah sings in Latin and the young boy Ben De'ath comes to the stage . They sing PIE JESU together - a very beautiful and moving church mess song . Sarah 's voice is incredible beautiful.Michael Ball : I ONLY WANT TO SAY ( GESTHEMANE ) from Jesus Christ Superstar . A very vigorous song.At THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA , when Sarah Brightman enters the stage I get chills because of her beauty and presence . She is the most wonderful person , with a warm-heartedness charisma . She definitely has the best and most beautiful voice in the world . She and Antonio Banderas sing THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA together . It 's 10 years ago , when Sarah played Christine in the Phantom.Michael Ball and Sarah sing the beautiful duet ALL I ASK OF YOU . They suit each other well . Michael Ball has a great charisma . THE MUSIC OF THE NIGHT , Sarah sings it as beautiful as ever.Boyzone : NO MATTER WHAT - the best sound on this DVD.Michael Ball : VAULTS OF HEAVEN together with a gospel choir - it sounds fantastic.Glenn Close plays Norma Desmond from Sunset Boulevard and sings WITH ONE LOOK.Michael Ball sings the great song LOVE CHANGES EVERYTHING and all the artists from the concert appear , singing together . Elaine Paige sings MEMORY from Cats.Kiri Te Kanawa sings the very beautiful song THE HEART IS SLOW TO LEARN . Kiri has a beautiful soprano voice . It could be great to hear Kiri and Sarah together in a duet . All the artists sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY for Andrew . At the final song , Andrew plays the piano while Lottie Mayor sings the beautiful song WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND.Andrew Lloyd Webber must be the greatest composer of all time.This DVD is fantastic , whether your are a fan of Andrew , Sarah Brightman , Michael Ball , Elaine Paige or you just love great musical music . The picture and the sound are excellent on this DVD .	1
I am not a real critic of performing and producing . I was not familiar with many of the performers so I could not say how they compared with other works that they had produced . I appreciated the variety of works , and that is what you would expect from someone who produced Broadway musicals . Some of the music was not the type that I would choose on its own , but I knew that ahead of time from other reviews . Even though it might not have been something I would choose I appreciated everyone 's effort . Some performers are past their prime and I ca n't expect as much from them as when they were younger . Possibly other choices of performers could have been made , but maybe that was not possible on that night at that location . I enjoyed the performance and will enjoy listening to it many times . Some performers were better than others , but that is always the case with entertainers . Some you will like and others you will not . Try to choose those that you do like . I found the performance pleasant and relaxing and is n't that what entertainment is all about ?	1
This is a wonderful dvd ... if your a fan of andrew lloyd webber you will NOT be disapointed..all the songs and artists are great..gives you goose bumps on some of them . I was impressed and am highly recommending this dvd . It is simply a must have ! ! ! !	1
I am so glad I made the decision to buy this DVD . Orginally I was a little hestitant I figure I would n't enjoy it much since I 'm much of a Webber fan . I only bought it because I heard that it contained my favorite singer of all time Michael Ball ! But after listening to it I can now understand and appreciate the true genius of Webber.The singers were all singers who gained fame from Webber 's masterpieces-all except Glen Close . Donny Osmond opens the show with his `` Any Dream Will Do '' with the help of the London 's Children Choir . Followed by such wonderful and impressive hits as `` Do n't Cry For Me Argentina . `` , `` Hosana '' , and `` The Music Of The Night . '' I was so excited to see Michael Ball perform he performed the most moving piece of `` Gestheme '' in this DVD . I only wish that there was a CD from the night . I also loved his performance singing the song that launched him to super-stardom `` Love Changes Everything '' which was the highlight of the night- sung along side the entire cast ... Michael Ball seemed to really be enjoying himself ( Lately he said he has been getting annoyed with the song since he has to sing it so much ) . A little dissappointed in `` All I Ask Of You '' which has always been my favorite Webber song- for some reason I did n't feel it this time . I loved Boyzone 's performance of `` No Matter What '' - THOSE BOYS CAN REALLY SING ! But my favorite part of the evening was seeing Andrew Webber come on stage , while the cast sang a surprise `` Happy Birthday '' song . At the end of the evening Webber got on the piano and began playing `` Whistle Down The Wind . '' All in all it was a beautiful evening and wonderful music . You can tell that the stars put enormous event into this special birthday event for Andrew Llyod Webber.I was a little disappointed that there were not really any special features ... it would be nice if it had a biography on Webber 's life and career . My biggest regret is this was not made into a CD . However it 's nice to own a DVD you can watch again and again . Broadway and Michael Ball fans must own this DVD in your collection !	1
These are all my favorite performers singing my favorite songs . I especially loved the songs from Whistle Down the Wind . Antionio Banderas was excellent , as were Tina Arena , Glenn Close , Michael Ball , and Kiri Te Kanawa ainging the Heart Is Slow to Learn . I would love if someone threw me a birthday party like this ! Anyone who enjoyed this would love My Favorite Broadway Leading Ladies ! I wish more of Lord Lloyd-Webber 's musicals to the states . The last we had was By Jeeves and that closed early . Why no Beautiful Game or Whistle Down the Wind ?	1
Overall this is certainly worth adding to your DVD collection if you love ALW 's music as I do , especially , `` Phantom '' and `` Evita '' . However , Antonio Bandaras , needs some voice lessons before he tries singing this music again . Very disappointing , no matter how cute he is . As Che he can get by , barely . I hate to see a performer struggle to sing the material and he was in big trouble vocally . I did n't like the rock numbers and the Whistle Down the Wind music never thrilled . I found the performances of Michael Ball , Elaine Paige and Donny Osmond to be the best in this concert . I love Kiri and have a huge number of her recordings , but this song was n't worthy of her talent . I 've never been able to stand Brightman as she is far too mannered with inferior vocal technique , so the Phantom music was a disappointment except for the duet , All I Ask of You , with Ball . Ball can sing `` Music of the Night '' better than Brightman . Right ! where was Michael Crawford ? ! Seems he has disappeared from ALW 's doings . Too bad but Michael Ball is better in almost any song than Crawford . Colm Wilkinson does a credible Phantom on another concert called `` Hey , Mr. Producer '' from 1998 and now only available on VHS . Too bad that the movie of Phantom was such as disaster . I 'd really like to see a full length video of the stage production with great voices . The production of `` Cats '' for video was terrific ! If you like all these shows this is a great addition to your collection ! There is so little available on video of great Broadway shows that you ca n't afford to pass this DVD up . Ball is the star though ! Very passionate performance and good vocal technique . He nails everything ! Osmond was surprisingly good as well . The photograph and staging was also quite good .	1
This is a great musical presentation , with many talented performers singing Andrew lloyd Webber 's songs . I 'd give it ten stars if I could .	1
There are a few performances on this DVD that I could live without , but the ones I do like are excellent . Donny Osmond - Joseph ( good songs - performed well ) . Antonio Banderas - Evita ( quite good ) . Glenn Close and her dramatics from Sunset Blvd - wow ! Boyzone - yes a boy band ( No Matter What - a terrific song ) - good job and great voices . But the most excellent and my favorites here are from Michael Ball - boy I wish I could sing like him . Excellent voice and great stage presence . What a performer . Not many can hold a candle to him . Great DVD overall - buy it now and be prepared to be entertained .	1
I have every live video of this band - no bragging , just perspective . Most of what I own is on laserdisc ( remember laserdiscs ? ) . This concert is the best live Yes video ever produced.For a start , the performances are nothing short of inspired . Everyone is at the top of his game ; Howe has never played better ( rivals Yesshows ) . Wakeman is superhuman , but very tasty . Bruford is a joy to watch - his fluidity is hypnotic . And Anderson dances all over the stage like an elf ( why does n't he do that anymore ? ) . The support musicians are also excellent ( Jeff Berlin replaces an ill Tony Levin for this show ) .Everyone is having so much fun , and the fun is really infectious.This is a FULL LENGTH SHOW , not a & quot ; highlights & quot ; show like the Philadelphia disc . You get everything , including Anderson 's vapid pre-show pay-per-view babbling ( very amusing ) . & quot ; Close To The Edge & quot ; crackles with an energy rarely seen . & quot ; And You And I & quot ; is most moving . Even the ABWH tracks sparkle and shine like diamonds.All Yes concerts should be this good . Heck , all bands should be this good . Show it to your musician friends - if they are n't fans when you 're done , there 's no hope for them !	1
One day at Horrorland was a classic Goosebumps book . Then it was released on VHS . Now , along with Welcome to Camp Nightmare , is on DVD.Both are decent episodes , even though Horrorland should have been a three or even four parter so it would be able to have the other scary rides like the doom slide , and end more like the book , whatever happened to the whole pinching sidestory . I also noticed that the friend was n't in it , bummer.The should just make a Goosebumps season one , season 2 , and a season 3+4 box set , but I guess these will have to do , but next time make it episodes that are n't on VHS	1
Many of us have waited almost forty years to see what we heard back then . Anyone that doesnt like it shouldnt have bought it because they just must not have liked Yes that much . They dont understand how central to the time in our lives this album was . Thats Ok because they can keep listening to the crap they make today.Ironic that you can get all the crap you want on video nowadays that was recorded new and digitally but the great stuff like this is just fine for us true fans ! So shut up you who put this down , it wasnt meant for you.As a review for the DVD , just what I thought it would be like . Makes you shake your fist in the air and scream out Yeeeeaaaaahhhhh ! ! ! ! at the end . Nuff said.All that can be said about this is put on the album and imagine what Yes playing their instruments and singing would look like . That is what this is . Audio and video are as good as you could get from then . This is history .	1
I give this DVD ***** because I saw it when it was first shown as a movie in theatres in the mid 1970 's . I am very happy that someone choose to preserve this gem . I am a progressive/progressive metal aficionado from before YES & ELP . `` In the Court of the Crimson King '' is probably the first recognized progressive album/ group and it still is alive and well today . King Crimson lost Greg Lake to ELP and gained Bill Bruford from YES . Bill Bruford did play on some of songs on the Yessongs album , but Alan White replaced him during the Yessong tour ( s ) and played drums & percussion on the Yessong movie , which was from a performance recorded during the tour ( s ) .It is correct that the quality is not Blu-Ray or even HD-DVD . It appears to have been transferred straight from the 16mm ( ? ) film to DVD with little or no re-engineering . It would interesting if somebody were to clean-up the picture and re-mix/produce the sound . But then you 'd loose the ambiance of the era . It is very much influenced by the psychedelic . Perhaps it could be sold as `` Collector 's Set '' of both the re-processed and the original , much like the CD set of Deep Purple 's 'Machine Head ' which has both the original and the 25th anniversary remix by Roger Glover.Yessongs is the best of Yes Mk 2 ( more or less +Howe , Wakeman , -Bruford ) . It is a legendary performance of music made before it 's time . The incredible Howe-styling on his many Les Pauls , And Wakeman on the Hammond C3 and the much ignored mellotron , Anderson 's unique high vocals , and Squire 's characteristic chunky Rickenbacker . Then the stage ambiance , enhanced by Wakeman ' sequin cloak and Squire 's winged cape ; the incredible tension of the simplistic music , tight vocal harmonies and CO2 fog of 'Close to the Edge ' is haunting . GET THIS DVD if you have any interest in progressive rock . This , in a large nutshell , is the essence of progressive.A Question to anyone else who remembers the original theatre film : I seem to remember more footage , songs . In particular , Steve Howe playing his unique pedal steel guitar stylings . The DVD seems to be an edit of the original film ?	1
So , there are three DVDs available of Mozart 's Cosi fan tutte conducted by Muti : this 1983 Salzburg production is the first , then in 1989 the La Scala , and 1995 the Vienna.I have seen the 1995 Vienna production , and must say that it is about the BEST DVD of Cosi fan tutte ! Here , we have Muti in probably his first 'outing ' of this work , and in Salzburg.He has a group of capable ( if not better than the Vienna production of 1995 ) soloists . The men side largely equalled the ladies ' side : Araiza 's Ferrando , Morris ' Gugliemo , Bruscantini 's Alfonso ; Murray 's Dorabella , Marshall 's Fiordiligi and Battle 's Despina.If you compare this cast with Muti 's 1995 Vienna cast ( Schade 's Ferrando , Skovhus ' Gugliemo , Corbelli 's Alfonso ; Kirchschlager 's Dorabella , Frittoli 's Fiordiligi and Bacelli 's Despina ) , I would say that the 1995 cast is a tad better than this 1983 cast , especially in the ladies ' side.Even so , we have some exceptionally good performances here , and it is principally in Anne Murray 's Dorabella , and Francisco Araiza 's Ferrando.Murray edges out Kirchschlager in the Vienna production by a more expressive and colourful vocal performance . While Michael Schade actually is a terrific Ferrando , Araiza 's singing is again a tad more refined , and his acting equally effective as Schade's.Morris I find a bit wooden in his acting ( as compared to Boje Skovhus ) , and Bruscantini less of a vocal actor than Corbelli.Kathleen Battle , however , has a clear edge over Monica Bacelli as Despina.Then we have Fiordiligi , one of the most difficult Mozartian soprano roles to pull off . Frittoli definitely outshines Margaret Marshall , though the latter is by no means second-rate.It is always a big shame that not all the solo numbers are being included on DVD like Muti 's , especially when the singing casts are so exceptional .	1
I have had this dvd for several years now , and I can say after many other purchases of this opera . Muti 's production is the best Cosi I have . ( He has a new version from 2008 that I still have not purchased . ) This is Mozart 's most Italian opera in terms of music style and Muti knows how to bring this Italian component out . Staging , lighting , costumes are all first rate . Singing and presentation are also very , very good.To say ( as one reviewer has ) that the opera is dull is just not accurate . This is n't Avatar or Star Wars , it 's about people and relationships ! What is brought out in this production is the fact that all 6 people come out of this experience learning something . Cosi is usually presented as a story about women being tempted and degraded by a master puppetier ( the Don ) . That is not what this production brings out . Don Alfonso and Despina both have issues with their past love life and failures . The Don feels he can tempt any women to stray , but in the end he fails and must rely on Despina . How ironic . She actually seals the deal . Despina 's weakness is gold , money and men who have wealth . If you ca n't have love , at least find someone who is . In the end she finds out that does n't work that well also . The Don says you ca n't trust women , Despina says men are n't worth trusting and loving . Two very bitter people.In the middle of this are the 4 young lovers who are just that , young lovers ! They do n't have a clue what love means long term , it 's all passion and fire . Chivalry , ethics , morality , honor , all strong virtues . Compassion , understanding , vicarious experience are way down the list at this point in their lives.This is a great opera . As Bernard Shaw once wrote , Cosi is Mozarts most psychologically sophisticated opera . It does not win you over right away , but when it does it does so in the most complete way . But the production must bring this quality out or the opera is just a shell of what it could have been.A lovely , lovely production .	1
I was at this performance , so I 'm severely prejudiced . I had not heard Marshall in person before and never Bruscantini in person , which was a great treat for me . Muti and Battle I knew as fan who went backstage at their performances and talked to them , got their autographs , if that counts as 'knowing them ' ... .Araiza and Morris I heard many times at the Met , especially Morris from the time he started at the Met ... like 'homecoming ' that night in Salzburg was . Wonderful memory that I can relive with this dvd . So , yes , my 5 stars are biased !	1
All of the participants in this endeavor are excellent on their own terms , but the total effect , while a treasure trove of parts , remains an indifferent whole . The chief problem is the lack of balance between singer and orchestral volume . Muti , despite his profound respect for this miraculous score , carries on as if he 's the early James Levine conducting Wagner at the Met , seemingly intent on drowning out the singers whenever the opportunity presents itself , and thereby pushing the orchestra into excessively high relief . Too many soft , reflective , and strikingly beautiful parts of the vocal line accordingly disappear from due prominence , and this despite presentation in a small theater ideal for Mozart . I am of course assuming the problems manifested themselves in performance and are not just a matter of engineering fault in the transfer to DVD . But in any event they do interfere with the excellence of the performance on disc .	1
In rock music , the difference between a great performance and a bust can be razor thin . Which was this ? You can see Jimi talking , while playing , clearly concerned about something . In All Along the Watchtower , the dreamy tones of the studio version is replaced by a powerful , high distortion version . On top of everything else , he briefly forgets the words . Was this a great performance relete with spontanaity or was Hendrix , a little more than two weeks before his death due to a drug overdose , starting to lose it ? I do n't know but one thing I do know , I am captivated by the performance . I liked observing the small things such as his switching from his signature stratocaster to a flying V. Quite frankly , I had n't been aware that he p [ erformed with a V so this was a revelation . If you are a Hendrix fan , this DVD will fascinate you . If not , I doubt that it will make you into a fan .	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this 1982 Zeffirelli production from the Met . It has much to recommend it : passionate singing from the underrated Jose Carreras , terrific acting from Teresa Stratas , an excellent supporting cast , great sets and direction , and first-rate conducting from James Levine.I bought this DVD primarily because of Carreras , and it 's a treat to hear him before the onset of his illness and vocal problems . True , he is pushing a little here at times , but his ravishing timbre more than compensates . Pavarotti may have the freer high notes , but Carreras ' performance has a passion that most other interpreters lack . By his own admission not the world 's greatest actor , he is nevertheless convincing as a young , idealistic poet , and this ( along with Stiffelio , Don Jose and Andrea Chenier ) ranks as one of his best roles . My only quibble is that he is a little hammy during Mimi 's death scene ( though few tenors can probably resist such a temptation ! ) Teresa Statas is the consummate actress , and there is not one moment when her portrayal of Mimi does not ring entirely true . I was unable to hold back the tears during her aria in Act Three , so heartbreaking was her farewell to Rodolfo . Interestingly , she makes her impression without the benefit of a magnificent voice . This is a singing actress rather than a vocal great . Her voice strikes me as somewhat plain of timbre , lacking the beauty of , say , a Mirella Freni , but in this performance , at least , it simply does n't matter . Her Mimi will stay with you for a long time . ( I do , however , agree with one amazon reviewer who thought she looked too ill from the outset . The over-zealous make-up artist should have shown some restraint ! ) Renata Scotto , in the role of Musetta , has a larger vocal presence , despite a wobbly vibrato when she 's under pressure . Hers is a good overall performance , and her comic skills in Act Two add much to the liveliness of the Cafe Scene.The rest of the cast was uniformly good , and the amusing horseplay between the four young Bohemians in Acts 1 and 4 was a real delight . Richard Stilwell as Marcello is outstanding in the reconciliation scene with Musetta in Act 2 , and later in his duet ( O Mimi , piu non torni ) in Act 4 with Carreras.The sound quality is fine , and I had no problem with the slightly dark ( but highly atmospheric ) visuals.Overall , an excellent Boheme with much to recommend it . ( And while you 're about it , do check out the 1982 Covent Garden performance with Neil Shicoff and Ileana Cotrubas for an equally well-acted Boheme . )	1
I have all the Bohemes availabe on VHS and Laser and still come back to this one to show anyone new to opera as it 's the best video available . The version spoken of from the UK I have only been able to find on VHS and it is truly excellent . Not seen it on DVD but would buy it the minute it is released . Until then this production and cast ca n't be beat . Scotto is getting by on her acting ability , not her voice as Musetta . That high note is not unlike a cat getting its tail trod upon . I agree with all the comments about Stratas and enjoyed Carreras ' performance very much . James Morris as Colline is a surprise . If you collect opera on video this is a must buy . The production is glorious and the overall atmosphere created is the standard for Boheme .	1
I have owned this Version for a few years now and play it quite frequently ... this Tosca will NEVER be surpassed ! I totally agree with all the praise given it by most of all the other reviewers . You do n't need me to now tell you how fantastic it is . But I am adding my two cents ( for whatever it 's worth ) now because of that horrendous NEW production which just opened at the MET . Do modern Directors even bother reading the Composer 's Libretto ? Now , I have not seen this new production yet . I have read countless reviews of the Opening Night performance , spoken with friends in New York who have seen it and listened to it on the Met Sirius Radio . I was not impressed with the singing at all . Obviously I have to go with what the press and friends said about the physical production ... the booing for the director and his `` creative '' team was loud and sustained . It seems that the Met is doing away with all things Zeffirelli for more `` modern '' approaches to its productions . What a shame ! I 'm sure that this new version will eventually come to our PBS stations as a MET HD LIVE performance . You may want to watch it but have THIS marvelous Domingo , Behrens , MacNeil , Zeffirelli production on hand to see what the great Puccini really had in mind . If after I do see it on PBS and have any corrections or new feelings about the new production , I will certainly edit this review . UPDATE ON JANUARY 20 , 2010 ... I have seen the new production on PBS ... what an insulting mess ! ! ! But I have some good news ... the Met has recently announced that it is thinking about REVIVING the Zeffirelli production ( it was never destroyed ) for the 2010-2011 Season . It appears that everyone ( including the New York Times ) is now saying that the new production is a dismal failure .	1
Tosca was the first opera I ever saw , in 1964 , from the last row of the topmost balcony of the Rome Opera . I went expecting not to be impressed , feeling a twenty-something surliness toward `` bourgeois '' art . Fortunately , it was a grand production , though I ca n't remember who sang or conducted , and I 've loved opera ferociously ever since . I was living at the time in an apartment just outside the Campo dei Fiori , with a close-up view out my window of the great domed church of San Andrea , where the first act of Tosca unfolds . The opera stage was a near-perfect recreation of that church , where I often sat and thought . I 'd never seen such stagecraft before , and the recollection of its impact makes me think that opera should always maintain its tradition of visual magnificence , if only to dazzle the neophyte.I 've kept that apartment for nearly forty years now , and being there for a few days , I watched this Tosca . How could I give it less than five stars , when it seems so true to what I saw first ? I have to agree with the review by `` fiordiligi '' that Behrens is n't Tosca , however well she sings . Domingo is almost too forceful for Cavaradossi , that eternal wuss in revolutionary plumage , but who can complain about such vocal command ? The character who makes Tosca , however , is Scarpia , a villain so odious one anticipates his destruction gleefully even after seeing the opera many times . It 's the villains who make melodrama appealing ; the heroes are always mawkish or wispy , and the heroines are never quite fully human . Cornell MacNeil is superb as Scarpia , both vocally and visually . He 's not much of a physical actor , I suppose , but the skillful use of camera close-ups reveals his face to be a mobile mask of hatefulness . The cinematography of this DVD is so good that I have to place it on a par with the singing . If you ca n't afford time-travel to Rome in 1964 , I 'd say this is at least a fine evening 's consolation .	1
Domingo gets 5 stars in this performance of tosca . his voice is at its most dark and dramatic stage and it fits the role perfectly . His aria 's are tear jerking and the pathos with which he carries himself is maddeningly exciting . He commands the stage whenever he is on it and you can see and feel the excitement in his acting . E lucevan le stelle was the highlight of the Dvd . There is the occasionally nasal high note but ; whatever he was still fabulous ! Behrens does fine . I do , however , have a few problems with her . Her voice is drmatic and glorious but there are many suspicious passages where you arent sure if she is purposly croaking in anger for effect or whether she has lost control of her voice . Her speaking voice is ghastly when she uses it , hoarse and hard to listen to . Other than that she is a joy to hear . Her high notes are full and forceful right to the end of an extremely difficult role . Her tone is , however , evocative of Wagner and if that bothers you then you wont like her Tosca . I disagree with the argument that she is not a convincing looking tosca . Part of what I love about opera is that its not about the beauty of thee performer . She is not a youngster or a knockout , but that did n't keep me from beleiving she was in love with the dramatic painter.Scarpia was poor.His acting was extremely convincing but his singing was poor . It was hard to listen to his forced sound for several hours . His vibrato came in , occasionally , but more often it was straight and flat . When he sings high he appers to be under great strain . This is too bad because i have hear Macneills Scarpia on records in hbis prime and It is really quite excellent ; but not here ! This role was too much for macneils aging voice to handle.BR > If you can get past scarpia this is a excellent Tosca , and certainly a must have for Domingo fans !	1
PRIME CUTS is just that cuts of performances from Alice Cooper . Commentary from Alice Cooper hisself as well from Slash , Bob Ezrin , Shep Gordan.These cuts are top choice and very rare . A priceless collection of performances , the best performance of BALLAD OF DWIGHT FRY I have ever seen , his acting out this song is incredible.So buy Alice Cooper 's story of his climb to stardom and enjoy these PRIME CUTS yourself .	1
Ramey and Studer triumph in a spectacular performance . Ramey 's resonant bass rings true and powerful . Ranks up there with his Mefistofele ! I can not imagine this role more superbly sung and acted . Chicago Lyric Opera is in for much excitement next season when he does this role for them with such commanding and thrilling tone . Studer sings in the same league and calibre : rich tone , secure and powerful high notes with dramatic intensity , simply an all out no stops performance . Her soft notes are beautiful and her duets with the tenor Kaludov are equally memorable . He is not quite in her league but he does some fine singing . Wonderful production . Only Zancanaro lets down the side a litle but then it is not much of a role to start with . La Scala can be proud of this performance - which ranks high with their Domingo & quot ; Fanciulla & quot ; - and we are luckier than the audience present since we can see it at will .	1
Loved it from the moment Odabella ( played masterfully by Cheryl Struder ) jumped into Attila 's face , and took his sword . She sings a song about killing him for vengeance , while he falls in love with this fiesty slave . Well sung and played by all four of the principles . It remains on my `` desert island '' list of 6 , out of about 120 operas I have seen . If you love Verdi , as I do , you wo n't regret buying this one .	1
Blue Oyster Cult live at the Capital Center in Largo Maryland , December 1976 . This show was in support of their fantastic albumAgents of Fortune . This concert was great ! I do not understand the low marks given for this DVD . The picture and sound quality are pretty good IMHO . The reviews stating blurry visual are enigmas to me because the video on my copy rates a 8/10 , and I have seen alot of concert videos . The audio does have a few moments of fading but these instances are few and brief , therefore not really distracting from the viewing experience . As for the show itself , BOC was in fine form and not lethargic at all ! BOC delivers at full intensity and every band member is in top form ! The reviews stating `` Buck Dharma '' seems lethargic are wrong and misinformed . Donald `` Buck Dharma '' Roeser 's stage persona was of the mysterious man in white that showed little emotion . Donald played this character on stage so as to appear strange and engrossing . Donald never moved around alot on stage and his movements were sparse so as to have greater theatric effect . This in no way takes away from his guitar playing . Donald 's playing at this show is tremendous ! He is spot on , hitting all the right chords with no mis-strokes . Eric Bloom is the stage leader and he is great on this night . Eric 's stage persona as the mystical and enigmantic man in black wearing tinted sunglasses was awesome . Eric delivered a memorable performance and was very animated and calculated , timing each gesture for maximum effect . During `` Dominace and Submission '' , Eric gave his state of the union address , just weeks before Jimmy Carter was sworn in as president , whipping the crowd into a raucus frenzy . Eric is upset over the cost of fine columbian smoke , BOC concert goers getting hasseled for no other reason than wanting to get high and have a good time , and the then new 55mph speed limit ( pre-empting Sammy Hagar 's `` I ca n't drive 55 '' by a good decade ) Eric tells the crowd to march downtown and demand for changes . Eric then has the audience yell out `` Dominance '' to Eric 's `` Submission '' and the energy goes off the scale ! Great performance ! The whole show is other wordly right up to `` Buck 's Boogie '' and `` This Ai n't The Summer Of Love '' , which ebbs the momentum during Albert and Joseph Bouchard 's extended solos . The solos are pretty simple and the only saving grace is the light show . The extravagent soloing really deflates the energy that had been building up . Oh well , the closers `` Born To Be Wild '' & `` Do n't Fear The Reaper '' rebound the flow of energy and allows BOC to exit on a high note . I really enjoyed this DVD and any BOC fan will also enjoy it . The band is tight , enthusiastic and putting on a show that helped them achieve the pinnacle of being the most mystical performers in the music biz . BOC fans - buy it , get high on eyes and enter the nexus of the crisis and the origin of storms ! Set List : Stairway To The StarsHarvester Of EyesCities On FlameME 262Dominance And SubmissionAstronomyETIBuck 's BoogieThis Ai n't The Summer Of LoveBorn To Be WildDo n't Fear The ReaperPS - Go see them on tour now as they might be even better !

Got to love Blue & Ouml ; yster Cult ! = ) One of the hardest , breathtaking bands around in their day and still at it.The sound on this isnt bad but its not the greatest so be expecting it not to be the greatest , but still , its Blue & Ouml ; yster Cult back in the day , not New & Ouml ; yster Cult nowdays playing old songs ! The famouse lazer show where they eventually gotten sued for supposedly blowing out someones eyes with a reflection from one of the lazer lights shinning off Buck Dharma 's gutair out into the crowd is in here as well ... not the eyes getting blow out inccodent but that would of made for a nice show too = ) If you like Blue & Ouml ; yster Cult this does capture the raw might they had in their earlier shows ! Enjoy !	1
This DVD is relatively short , about 1 hour . It is , briefly , narrated by GRACE SLICK and PAUL KANTNER ( Jefferson Airplane ) . Some of the film is kinda ' grainy , but for the most part , it looks good and the sound is good . It is an excellent SNAPSHOT IN TIME . The Star of the show is JIM MORRISON with his STRONG VOICE , THEATRICS , and , of course , his GORGEOUS looks . BUT of EQUAL POWER is the MUSIC , the BAND . RAY MANZAREK on KEYBOARDS is EXCEPTIONAL . JOHN DENSMORE on drums and ROBBY KREIGER on guitar compose the rest of the band . The band 's EXCELLENCE is showcased in this dvd , UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL , ESPECIALLY in an improvised LIGHT MT FIRE . They were/are INCREDIBLE MUSICIANS.THE DOORS , truly , were a PHENOM . Their IMAGE and MUSIC remains as strong now as it was 45 years ago . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dvd for Doors fans .	1
Ok so the guy has aged a few years and he sweats like a stuck pig before slaughter during most of the show ( damn could n't they at least have given the guy a towell ) but then for those of us that buy this DVD we probably suffer from the same problems and , at that age , we probably could n't sing worth a damn.Cocker serves us his most popular hits with each one being a memory for me and probably most fans of his . During the more than solid one and a half hour live show , backed up by an exceptional band that knows how to rock Cocker does not hold back . Although I noted that he could n't quite hit the high note screams in 'With a Little Help From My Friends ' but then who would even attempt that piece after an hour long concert.The technicals and the sound quality of the DVD are exceptional for a live outdoor concert and I reccommend this performance toanyone that enjoys rock in its purest form ... ...	1
Great product , great vendor , great price , dynamic artist . Buyer insure that you check the format prior to purchase .	1
Live in Concert is Richard Pryor 's best stand up comedy routine by a comedian ever ! Finally , this concert has been given the respect it deserved and has been REMASTERED ! HBO Home Video has done a fine job of REMASTERING this concert . There is no more ghosting of the images like the horrendous MPI version ( which by the way , I own and can now turn into a coaster or frizbee ! ) GET THE HBO HOME VIDEO 2006 REMASTERED version !	1
What makes this DVD so neat is the first half of it was taped probably 20-25 years ago ( judging from the clothes everyone is wearing and the haircuts ) . Whoever had this original tape did an excellent job preserving it as it is crystal clear and the sound is above average for its ' age . My main dissapointment with it is the fact that it lists & quot ; Melissa & quot ; on the cover , yet all you get for that song is about a 2 minute acoustic intro taken from a tv studio tape - no singing and the guys look clearly stoned out of their minds ! Still , though , it is a gem if you 're an ABB fan ( no , I did n't say ABBA ) . I had the VHS version of & quot ; Great Woods & quot ; and I thought that stunk . This is a much better show .	1
I was at the Gainesville portion of the DVD ( the first half ) recorded at the University of Florida Bandshell in 1982 . I was a senior at that school and you can see me after the last song at about 40:10 . I am the guy with a turtleneck sweater ( it is 1982 ! ) holding a coat . I had hair then and even a small beard.I remember the concert being filmed but did not think about it again until 20 years later when I saw the DVD and knew that I had been there . I can now show my wife and kids now who I was then . Anyway , no it is not ABB 's best lineup ( the Arista years ) , but it is a Florida band playing to a mostly rural Florida college and redneck crowd . We loved it and I think the band loved us back for it , and it shows in the great playing . The sound is very good given the era and location . It was a cold crisp afternoon and a great time was had by all . This DVD will not disappoint .	1
The Good : This is the earliest official released Allman Brother 's Band on DVD . For being filmed in 1982 , you get great sound and picture . The band really kicks it up a notch , with Mr. Betts really shining . David Goldflies does yeoman 's job on bass . As big ABB fan , I have really enjoyed this DVD.The Bad : This the `` Arista Years '' version of the ABB- I have learned to ignore the odd synthesizer . Jaimoe 's drums are sorely missed.The Ugly : On one song from the Capital show- Mike Lawler comes out with a `` synthesizer Guitar '' ( i kid you not ) and emitts some very ill sounding shrieks and shronks . Thankfully his solo does not last to long .	1
Werner Herzog clearly loves dark operatic gestures . This production brings many characteristic Herzog touches to something that might not immediately seem to be his interest -- the stylized and elegant music of Rossini . But he and Muti bring it all alive in a way that is totally involving and convincing . Dark , craggy cliffs , caves and a final throne room complete with stalactites predominate -- green seems to have been banished from the production but an evocative combination of reds and oranges brings life where needed . It 's hard to imagine five better principles -- Anderson is light and ethereal , Dupuy agile , the tenors ( Blake and Merritt ) voraciously compete for top honors , and Surjan is strong as well . The orchestral sound is sharp , well detailed and lively . Altogether a highly effective performance of a romantic drama .	1
There are no subtitles recorded but there is an English close captions which has subtitles .	1
I could not figure out how they picked all my favorites . Then I realized all her songs are my favorite . `` Dreams '' , `` Talk to Me '' , `` Stand Back '' and `` Edge of Seventeen '' are touted on the cover.The visuals added to the experience Colorado can be considered part of the team . The white winged dove seems a little hesitant but was a nice touch.I am sure this is a pail reflection of the real thing and many people buy it to remember that they were there . I was not but this is the closest the rest of us will get.I will not compare this presentation to others that I think are better because everyone will have a favorite and there is room for them all .	1
This show is classic Rock A Little Stevie , the Edge of Seventeen is killer , one of my favorites . There 's a wild energy and playful Stevie talking about the doves released by the crowd , Red Rocks is beautiful and the concert amazing !	1
This DVD is POWERFUL ! The combination of wide open mountain splendor - brought together with Stevie Nicks and her star filled band - enhanced and enchanted the innocence of untouched beauty that seemed to embrace the audience . The music and energy of Stevies music pierces the darkness - and even lightning flashes in rythem with the band . The special effects ghosts Stevie - and captures her spirit in many different sets - as if the meaning of the lyrics begin to be revealed in your soul.At the close of the evening - white wing doves are released - one is given to Stevie as a token of appreciation - when Stevie tries to set the dove free - seems the dove agrees with Stevies fans and wishes the night to never end - she embraces the dove and keeps it along with her audience - players - the night at Red Rocks ! This is a must buy for every fan of Stevie Nicks - you have just have to experience this one for yourself ! You 'll find no danger here !	1
Remember when Stevie Nicks struck out on her own and everybody said Fleetwood Mac was finished and the world would be hit by a comet ? Well here we are 20 years later and she 's still belting out notes with that unique voice of hers . As for Red Rocks what better place for a still awesomely beautiful legend .	1
Murray Lerner , premier film-maker once again produced a first rate concert film , marked by his ability to let the band do the talking , so to speak , by their performance . Very tough job to accomplish . Few producer-directors are able to subordinate themselves to their subject . Aside from a minimum number of audience shots to remind us of what the introductory note tells us ( and that is all it is , one or two sentences of text to set the context ) there are something like 600,000 people out there and it is 2 AM so we know they have seen a good many acts before this one.Subtitle of the title of the rview should be : for people who have never seen or heard the group before . Inevitably , the percentage of potential buyers who fit this category , whatever it might be today , almost forty years later , will increase exponentially ... if any material is available for them to see/hear and if the group somehow survives in the collective memory . Both are unpredictable . Just knowing the two facts given , and what we know about human interaction , it is clear that the instrumental and vocal music , together with the physical movements of the band , are only one part of what goes on in this sort of event . It is a happening built on the justification of listening to music ; far more than that , far more than even a Murray Lerner can give us , is taking place . Even for those who were there , watching the DVD , of course , can not repeat the happening . The storehouse of memory is too dynamic for that to be possible . ( One thing I can assert with confidence , if you have been around Rock for forty years , and are still turning it way up , you already have serious hearing damage which is worsening each time you turn it way up . ) At any rate , making due allowance for the difference between listening now and being there then , this disc is an excellent way for the newcomer to get some sense of what this very popular band , part of most histories of Rock , was about one day in 1970 .	1
On August 28 , 1970 , the Who took the stage at the Isle of Wight festival and delivered one of the most memorable performances of their career . The following was their set list : Opening : '' Heaven and Hell '' '' I Ca n't Explain '' '' Young Man Blues '' '' I Do n't Even Know Myself '' '' Water '' Tommy : '' Overture '' '' It 's a Boy '' '' 1921 '' '' Amazing Journey '' '' Sparks '' '' Eyesight to the Blind ( The Hawker ) '' '' Christmas '' '' The Acid Queen '' '' Pinball Wizard '' '' Do You Think It 's Alright ? `` `` Fiddle About '' '' Tommy , Can You Hear Me ? `` `` There 's a Doctor '' '' Go to the Mirror ! `` `` Smash the Mirror '' '' Miracle Cure '' '' I 'm Free '' '' Tommy 's Holiday Camp '' '' We 're Not Gon na Take It '' Encore : '' Summertime Blues '' '' Shakin ' All Over / Spoonful / Twist and Shout '' '' Substitute '' '' My Generation '' '' Naked Eye '' '' Magic Bus '' Of the thirty songs performed , 23 are included here . Not bad . Unfortunately , many of them are shortened , sped-up , or performed out of order . For example , Tommy is placed at the end of the set , and is missing such gems as `` Amazing Journey '' and `` Sparks . '' Unfortunately , much of this footage has been lost or is in poor shape , and the abridged version of Tommy here is actually , for my taste , quite good . I would love to see this DVD be re-released , in chronological order . The only tinkering I would do with the set list is this : I would omit `` I Do n't Even Know Myself , '' `` Water , '' and `` Naked Eye , '' as they were new Who songs intended for an upcoming album called Lifehouse ( which eventually became `` Who 's Next '' ) and failed to make the cut , both for that album , and as a live staple . I would also omit `` Substitute , '' as the current disc does , not because it is n't a great song , but because this is n't a great performance of it . Also , it would be nice to see a little variation in the camera angles . I would have loved to see more shots of John Entwistle . Here is my ideal cut : '' Heaven and Hell '' '' I Ca n't Explain '' '' Young Man Blues '' Tommy '' Summertime Blues '' '' Shakin ' All Over/Twist and Shout '' '' My Generation '' '' Magic Bus ''	1
Very good concert footage but because of the age of the video it 's not really up to BR video standards ( not what I 'd call a demo disc ) . If it was much cheaper on DVD you may want to go that route .	1
The Who were so good . Fun to see them in their younger days , esp . Keith Moon and Roger with long hair . Love the rare songs ... even the Tommy songs tho I 've heard them a million times . Let 's hope Pete gets his hearing back and finishes the next Who album we 've heard about .	1
i know a few nitpicky naysayers have savaged this released . take it from someone who loves the who-THIS DVD KICKS BUTT ! if you love the who get it . i got it super cheap , like for $ 4 ( that 's including shipping ) . the complaints about this dvd stem from the editing and the fact that it is out of sequence . what is great about the dvd is the music . the who 's studio albums are great too but the who live is just an incredible experience . also you get to witness just how tight the interplay between pete , john , and moonie really is . roger 's vocals are spot on , as always . check out pete 's guitar work on water and the opener , john enwhistle 's heaven and hell is on fire . for the price , you may not find a better deal on amazon for a cool music dvd .	1
The original Who line-up performingia full live set in front of 600,000 people at the Isle Of Wight Festivaliin the UK in 1970 . At 2am August 30th ... The Who appeared on stage and gave one of the most memorable concerts of their careers.The Who were at their truly pinacle when this gem was made . Not only were they at their maximum loud style , but the video gives you an insight to their legendary on stage fun and banter . The performance itself is completely flawless , and as a four piece band their sound has not been tighter.Although the film has been known to have existed since 1970 , the quality was considerd to be too dark for it to have been released untill now if only live at leeds hade been recorded on film as well as record , we would have had a better performance , but we should be deeply greatful that we have this , lasting reminder of the greatest rock band that is is lively now as it would have been thenThirty-four years later , the filmed negative of the show , shot Academy Award winning Director Murray Lerner , has been conformed to the highest visual quality . The sound has been remixed from its original 8 track tapes under the personal supervision of Pete Townshend at his El Pie Studios in London . The result is a stunning 24 bit available for the very first time in 5.1 Surround Sound and DTS.The complete highest-energy performance of The Who is now reproducedi in superb quality on this DVD , with an additional exclusive interview with Pete Townshend shot this year by Murray Lerner.wish I 'd been there..	1
Having seen The Who live and in concert with Keith Moon on drums I was a happy guy when I started watching this concert video . Considering the fact that this video was shot in 1970 , and outdoors too , the audio is excellent . But back to Keith . I was about 50 or so yards away from Keith Moon when I saw the band and he was , and forever shall be , the most amazing rock drummer . The Who : Live At The Isle Of Wight features many great scenes and tight shots of Keith in action . This DVD also includes a very in-depth interview with Pete Townshend that was surprising and interesting since I thought I knew this band fairly well . The only down side to this concert , in my humble opinion , was Pete 's performance . If you are expecting `` The Who - Live At Leeds '' Townshend guitar perfection it 's not here . There are moments of classic Townshend greatness however and overall this is still an excellent Who concert but it 's sloppy at times .	1
The quality of music in this dvd is some of the best in rock history & amp ; a classic example of what made the Who such an exciting live act . Keith Moon , while not the most technically proficient player , seems inexhaustable in a constant whirl of energy and always hilarious ; the consumate showman . The interplay between he & amp ; Townshend is quite funny & amp ; Townshend is in his prime , an energetic dynamo himself with the classic windmill always generating excitement . & quot ; Young Man Blues & quot ; in particular from this show is worth the price alone . Let us not forget the incredible Entwisle & amp ; Daltrey . The only reason I did n't give this five stars is that Rhino put this together quite sloppily . The song playing many times is n't in sync with what we see on the screen as other reviewers have mentioned , but it is a valuable historical document of one of rock 's greatest of all time . I do n't see anyone replacing them or the Stones in the current & quot ; changing of the guard & quot ; . The Who have n't seemed to have held their place in history the way the Stones have & amp ; I guess it 's because they never put anything new out , but after Face Dances & amp ; It 's Hard , you might say they could 've done better , eh ? The Wolf	1
I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this DVD . Lots of music and I enjoyed the recent interview with Pete Townsend too !	1
Hard to think of the guys in The Who as young men , but there they were , in 1970 , singing `` hope I die before I get old '' and meaning it , mainly because they were not yet old ( and Keith Moon never would be ) . About 160,000 people attended the festival , and many of them were probably still there that night at 2:00 AM when the Who played , but the Who were very clubby , talking to the audience as if there were only 150 of them there . Pete Townsend played a Gibson SG and babbled to the audience . Not too much windmill swinging , but his red overalls that cut off well above the ankles were as strange-looking as his white socks . John Entwistle came out in a skeleton jumpsuit , which was pretty strange , but it was hard to notice because I was mainly awed at his fantastic bass playing - it may be hard to realize he 's the godfather of the virtuoso bass players of the age from listening to Who studio recordings , but when you watch him you 're in awe . Roger Daltry has tassles on his jacket that reach below his knees , and that 's mainly what you notice about him , while Keith Moon is noted for his insane grinning and leering . Great show .	1
Yes , this is an incredible Who concert . No , do n't buy it . Make sure you buy the `` special edition '' instead because it contains two songs inexplicably cut from this release : `` Substitute '' and `` Naked Eye '' . It says it 's the complete concert . They 're lying . The special edition is n't the complete concert , either , but at least it 's all of the existing footage . The double CD set contains the entire concert . It 's a shame that `` Amazing Journey/Sparks '' apparently was not filmed or has been lost . The performance of it on the CD set is extraordinary.Screw Eagle Rock Entertainment and Murray Lerner for me having to buy this concert yet again just to get two songs that , by your own product 's description , should have been included from the beginning . Your soaking of hardcore fans like myself is deplorable .	1
This is a great concert . I have probably all there DVD Concerts and one of the best . Will Not Disappoint .	1
If you went to the Bridges of Babylon Tour , you must have this CD ! It was without a doubt the best Stones Concert that I have seen . I totally re-experienced the & quot ; live concert & quot ; in my rec-room with this wonderful production . The flawless sound and picture quality of this edition offers you a front seat to the best production that you will ever see . Even if you did n't go to the Babylon Tour '98 , buy this CD . It is truly an excellent presentation of the Best Rock and Roll Band of all time .	1
Bridges is a very entertaining DVD for any Stones fan . A huge stage , plus a secondary stage and an energetic Mick make for a fun time . The live show includes a special appearance by Dave Matthews in a duet with Jagger during & quot ; Wild Horses & quot ; . There is also an appearance by jazz great Josh Redman during & quot ; Waiting on a Friend & quot ; . The DVD exhibits quality engineering and is closed-captioned , recorded in 2 channel stereo and Dolby 5.1 - making good use of rear channels . No other special features are added , which is a little disappointing , but nonetheless a definite plus to any DVD music collection . Recommended .	1
This solid show has some great moments . The 10 minute Miss You version here is the best available , with the whole band acting like they never want it to end . Lisa Fischer , the awesome support singer , is in rare form as she and Mick bump and grind all over the stage . She gets in everybody 's business on this one . Surprisingly , Miss You does n't appear on Four Flicks . Neither does Its Only Rock and Roll , which is a highlight from the B-stage here . Also is a terrific Wild Horses duet with Dave Matthews and Dylan 's Like a Rolling Stone-performed better here than on Stripped . Another highlight is Keith 's I wan na Hold You , from Undercover . The sound is a slight step down from Four Flicks , but certainly great for when it was released . At the end we get a blazing Juming Jack Flash with Mick sporting cool shades and Keith and Ronnie weaving in and out like they 're trying to outdo themselves . Lots of Fun !	1
This is by far the best concert video I own . The Stones were on top of their game at this St. Louis concert , soulful , bluesy , and rocking . The cameras stay on the band the whole time , unlike many current concert videos that seem to think the viewer wants to watch the audience . The sound is CD quality , the picture and color is vivid , the editing is tight . The highlight for me is Keith Richards ' `` I Wan na Hold You '' and some incredible versions of many classics . The songs from the Bridges to Babylon album are excellent and it is funny how quickly some of them faded from the permanent repertoire . The fact of the matter is the Stones have enough excellent songs to do ten different concerts.I highly recommend this DVD . It is superior to the Four Flicks , and a lot less expensive . Five Stars .	1
Helped make our Christmas more enjoyable..Awesome music I could play all the time without getting burned out listening to it .	1
The music is awesome . The sound is perfect . It 's almost like being there . I prefer widescreen dvd 's , but this one shows only a small loss of sharpness when played in widescreen mode . I particularly like how they change between showing the musicians and the over-stage screen . What a show this is ! This DVD is 55 minutes long . It is a recording of a live Christmas concert from the Orpheum Theater in Omaha . According to the technical notes here , it is recorded in Dolby Digital 4.0.The DVD includes these songs : Angels We Have Heard on High ; Chip 's Intro ; Christmas Lullaby ; Pat A Pan ; Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer ; Los Peces en el Rio ; Joy to the World ; Gagliards ; In dulci Jubilo ; Wassail , Wassail ; Carol of the Birds ; I Saw Three Ships ; God Rest Ye , Merry Gentlemen I ; God Rest Ye , Merry Gentlemen II ; Stille Nacht ; Going to Another Place . I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who loves Christmas carols . It is a must-see for Mannheim Steamroller fans .	1
For any fan of their music , the DVD -- Mannheim Steamroller Christmas Live is a must buy . Given the price of concert tickets and the shortage of time around the holidays to attend a live event , it is great to be able to `` attend '' a performance in the comfort of home.This DVD was filmed in 1997 during a performance in Omaha Nebraska , the home of Mannheim Steamroller . Filmed twelve years ago , the DVD reflects the live concert experience . The visuals are lovely , but they are not flashy , so keep that in mind . That said , in no way is the concert experience diminished . The DVD print is crystal clear and the sound is rich and has plenty of depth . It is perfect to play while wrapping gifts or baking cookies .	1
I have never seen BON JOVI in such good & quot ; shape & quot ; ! I mean , everybody 's jamming better than they had in the past 3 years , at least ! There are only 2 things partially wrong with it ... 1 . There are n't too many songs on it , that could have been changed ... and 2 . What happened to CRAZY , or IN YOUR FACE ? ! They 're not as energetic as usual , as hard as it may seem . But as far as recommendations go , I give it the full 5 ***** . BON JOVI RULES !	1
OK , so it 's not Zoo TV , but then again , there was no way to follow up that monster . Taken on its own merits , PopMart was still a remarkable spectacle . Yes , Bono 's voice is a little on the weak side here ( probably still recovering from his impassioned performance at Sarajevo ) , but the music is incredible . Highlights include the moving `` Mofo '' / '' I Will Follow '' segue , a brilliant performance of `` Gone '' , and the amazingly visceral `` Please '' transition into `` Where The Streets Have No Name '' . The show concludes with `` One '' and `` Wake Up Dead Man '' , during which one can feel Bono 's heartbreak and anguish over the death of his friend Michael Hutchence , to whom he also dedicated `` One '' on this evening . A must-have for any lover of the most original and interesting band of the past twenty years ( and probably the next twenty , as well ) .	1
call u2 whatever you want but no one can ever deny that these guys know dont how to put on a rock concert . really put on a rock concert . Popmart even on video is a bombardment on the senses just like the real thing . the glitz , flash , thematic element and natural u2 is on perfect show here which is absolutely a must for the diehard fan . For avg fans or music lovers , while the idea of popmart might throw you off a bit , a better introduction to u2 concerts would be the Zoo tv tour . Elevation isnt bad at all either but it really is nothing like Zoo or Popmart . some might say that there is so much distraction but dont fall in the trap , U2 are at their best here for musical ability BUT bono is n't his best . He 's been in far better vocal shapes in other concerts Ive seen and this is n't his best . But the musical virtuosity more then makes up for it.songs from pop , and u2 's greatest are all here , except a few . A rarity here is a live version of & quot ; hold me , thrill me , kiss me , kill me & quot ; and an emotional bono at the end with & quot ; one & quot ; . got ta buy this one , if not youve got to see it to know what a rock concert can be like ! and its even better in surround sound ! remember ... dont miss the lemon ! ~you 'll see what I mean .	1
Welcome to the Videos by Guns and Roses , well really Axl Rose 's performance in front of the Camera is an amazing show in itself . Of course the Video is the Bands performances that would warrant keeping around , I 'm sure there are more ! This is an Amazing Show . I came along long before Guns and Roses and was not privy to their shows and never went to see them live . I would say , I 'd never been a adamant fan by any standard . I am now . Axy Rose is old and Fat now , probably barely alive compared to what he could do in his prime . One can not burn their candle at both ends without costing themselves something . Some in the trade die long before they should and he surely will pass before he should and we wish he could at least stay viable while we see him still around . Saul Hudson , better known by his nickname Slash , is still kicking around and one of the best of his profession , as is Jeffrey Dean Isbell , known by his stage name Izzy Stradlin , Michael Andrew & # 34 ; Duff & # 34 ; McKagan and at this writing as far as I know , Steven Adler also . This is a wonderful DVD showing the talents of the Band .	1
I would recommend this compilation of these videos because they are all by the original line up of the band that everyone is familiar with . The only thing is that it will play in a standard definition DVD in the 4 by 3 format rather than the 16 by 9 format in a Blu-Ray player that plays both DVD 's and Blu-Ray 's .	1
Really I 'd give this DVD 4.5 stars , but I 'm in an optomistic mood so I rounded it off to 5 . Some of the videos on this disc are almost as interesting as the music . Probably my favourite GN'R song is `` Estranged '' , and the elaborate video makes for a very enjoyable musical and visual experience . The only disappointing thing about this DVD is the lack of any extras whatsoever ! In addition to this ( or is `` addition '' an oxymoron in this case ? Should I put the thesaurus away ? ) the video for `` You Could Be Mine '' is absent . Apart from this fairly minor criticism , Welcome to the Videos rocks .	1
im a big guns n roses fan and i had to buy this great collection of music videos.this dvd has paradise city , sweet child o mine , welcome to the jungle and many more ! the only complain i have about this is that some of the videos are pretty corny and weird like in estranged slash is floating on water and playing the guitor.but they also have good videos . i wouldnt say this is the best collection of videos but i say these are still damm good videos !	1
I 'm not ashamed to say it : I 'm in my thirties and I LOVE THE BACKSTREET BOYS ' music ! Thisvideo exposes the talent that their non-fans sometimes feel they just do n't possess because they 're such good looking guys . But these five young guys prove you CAN have looks , brains and talent , not to mention be gracious to fans and respectful of lyrics and not sending wrong messages in their songs . They have a great sound , very easy to listen to , and this Night Out video will convince you to head to your music shop and pick up all their stuff , even the imports that are hard to find ( BUT AMAZON HAS 'EM ! )	1
I chose to get one BSB video , and I 'm glad I chose this one . This collection features harmony-based pop/r & b ; sounds from early backstreet . It has a few songs from their European debut album , and that was a good thing for me because I love hearing songs that I 'm not already familiar with . The best one was the opener , `` Who do you Love '' . Besides that , you also get their early slow and midtempo songs , plus solos . Brian blew me away with his angelic voice and his 2nd solo song . He definitely has the r & b ; thing going on , sounds like Brian McKnight . Nick 's solo is a keeper , too . And Kevin on piano duet with the saxophone -- the true `` romantic moment '' .Very good release that puts the VOCALS above anything else .	1
The reason that there is so much negativity toward this film is for the very understandable reason that its title is & quot ; Jimi Hendrix - Rainbow Bridge & quot ; , and the DVD 's cover is nothing but Jimi . It was a marketing tool when the picture first came out over 30 years ago , and Jimi is still being used to market the film . It 's like all the folks who sat ( and still sit ) through & quot ; La Vallee & quot ; just to hear the Pink Floyd score . I guess it does n't ever occur to them that the film was made for its own reasons and in order to bring the folks in , the filmmakers made sure there was a popular reason . I doubt that 99 % of the people who rented this film would have rented it if the title or the cover did n't mention Hendrix . In fact , judging by the majority of the reviews here , I 'm sure of it . ! As a 'Jimi Hendrix film ' this film surely sucks . He 's only in about fifteen or twenty minutes of it , it 's not one of his best performances , and sadly he seems like he 's well on his way to his ultimate fate.However , if one rents this film for what it actually is ; a documentary about hippies and other counterculture enthusiasts and malcontents , it 's quite fascinating . The hippie community in Hawaii was even more 'far out ' than that of those that were on the continent . It 's a world that seems farther away from us today than that of the 1950s ( considering how much our society has regressed politically and culturally , that 's not so surprising ) . The film is very disjointed ; do n't look for any real narrative , but that 's part of the scene : spontaneous , spaced out , and experimental . That 's it in a nutshell . Jimi Hendrix is just the frosting on a VERY Alice B. Toklas brownie ( for you kids , that 's a brownie laced with hashish ) . It all looks kind of stupid and pointless , but then not so much less so than the lame-brained films about twenty-somethings today . Better 'rock-and-roll ' movies about this generation are Michelangelo Antonioni 's & quot ; Zabriske Point & quot ; and Dennis Hopper 's & quot ; Easy Rider & quot ; , and a great one is Bob Rafelson 's & quot ; Head & quot ; ( yeah , that 's with The Monkees but it sabotages EVERYTHING and hey , Jack Nicholson was one of the writers ! ) . Still , this film is a neat time capsule . Grab a bong and get it on with someone you love , and you might just enjoy it !	1
I see a lot of mixed reviews for this one . First of all , if you are a hardcore Hendrix fan like myself this is a MUST HAVE . You see rare concert footage just days before his death . You will see he was a true genius until the day he died . Hendrix also speaks which gives insight to his thoughts at the time . Man , I would have paid anything to be at that show .	1
The stunt in the title is the band making it look like they have caught on fire from the pyrotechnics . If you do n't know this the first time you watch it it 's actually a little scary to watch . Have fun !	1
Well , the performance of the band on this live show was great . Video quality and sound quality of this title are above average , and the BASS is powerful . A good Live DVD when compared to other so-called live DVDs which are not digitally remixed and only has PCM-Linear or Dolby 2-channel sound . This title features Dolby 5.1 Digital surround and Multi-Angel . A good buy for DVD buyers .	1
The DVD version is 100 times better , but the VHS is great too . The picture quality is great even on video , and the concert performance is great , especially when they destroy the stage . Buy this now , no matter what . It 's Metallica 's best home video ever .	1
I watched this video and the quality is amazing . It was so real . It was like Metallica was in my living room . Any Metallica fan will love this concert . I hear that is on DVD . WOW , I am sure that it is incredible .	1
This is quintessential Keiko , her performance is only matched by the level of clarity that this DVD is filmed/recorded at . I especially enjoyed the piano solos . Order it ! You wo n't be disappointed ! p.s . What are these & quot ; whales & quot ; reviews doing on this page ?	1
First came the video collection for & quot ; Little Earthquakes & quot ; and now this one . This one includes some live versions of songs that did n't have videos made for them - which is a HUGE plus . One of the most artistic videos on this VHS is & quot ; China & quot ; . You 'll love it . I wholly recommend this to any Toriphile out there . Whenever I 'm in a quick fix for Tori , I pop this in and turn my volume on full blast . Afterall , Tori is Tori . 'Nuff said .	1
Beautiful . Creative . Black & White . Sad . Mesmerizing . Lustrous.That , folks , is Tori Amos . And a heck of a lot more . Just do n't call her boring.1 .

The video collection spans Tori 's years with producer Eric Rosse , as well as singles of `` From the Choirgirl Hotel '' with the following tracks : Silent All These Years , Cornflake Girl ( European Version ) , Past the Mission , China , Raspberry Swirl , Hey Jupiter , Spark , Caught A Light Sneeze , Winter , Talula , God , Crucify , Jackie 's Strength , Cornflake Girl ( US version ) , Pretty Good Year.While videos of the same album do share some common production values , not one video evokes the exact same feeling as does another . It is in their unique , quirky charm that the videos truly capture the essential of Tori Amos ' songs.As for me , my favorite video is for the single `` Spark . '' We follow Amos as a bound , blindfolded woman escaping the wrecked car of her kidnappers . She hobbles through a forest , and finally frees herself of her blindfold when she submerges in the cold water of a lake . In the end , she asks for help from two people in a passing car , but they deny her of it . Even so , we get the sense that this woman is better off on her own . In the album `` Boys for Pelee , '' Amos evokes an inner-conflict through the imagery of fire . Her subsequent album ( for which `` Spark '' is a single ) shows water imagery , and through this shows a new-found sense of self . The video unites these themes beautifully , as well as making many little Tori-references that real fans will appreciate.A must have for any big fan .	1
Simply , excellent concert in a beautiful city with beautiful voices.Something to remember of every tenor at his very best.Very good slection of songs , really they are master pieces .	1
Taped during her highly-evolved `` Post '' tour ; highlights include `` Headphones , `` Hyper-ballad , '' & `` I Go Humble . ''	1
Like the last reviewer , I 've had this DVD on my shelf for a while without really watching it over the last few years . I remember not really being blown away by it so much the first time . With all the recent revival of KC through a series of reissues ( 5.1 surround mixes , multiple disc box sets like & # 34 ; The Road To Red & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; 40th Anniversary of Larks Tongues in Aspic & # 34 ; , etc . ) I have simply become enamored by this incredible band . It 's funny as I once thought & # 34 ; 21st Century Schizoid Man & # 34 ; was their only good song ( boy was I ever wrong about that ! ) . Anyway , getting back to this DVD ... it 's not my personal favorite lineup of KC ( for me , that has to go to either the Greg Lake or John Wetton versions ) but , with Fripp , Bruford and Levin in the band , how can you go wrong ? Not as much a fan of Belew in KC ... I think he takes them too far away from their roots . That said , he must be credited for bringing/leading them into a new era . All together , a simply stellar performance . I have n't yet spent any time to play around with all the features of the DVD . I am somewhat interested in Fripp 's commentaries so I am sure at some point I will check them out . I would have given this 5-stars if the video quality were better ...	1
Concert videos do n't always work for me , and I 've yet to see a perfect one , but this one I like . I missed every chance I had to see th King Crimson double trio live , and it 's often tricky on their recordings to discern who is playing what . This is a well-documented band on CD ( Vroom Vroom , for example ) , but the DVD adds a depth to the music for those of who never had the live experience.This was a very good , beastly and interesting band of world-class players that never quite fulfilled its potential , and we 're not going to see this Crim lineup again ( drummer Bruford and bassist Levin are unlikely to return ) . Here we have very strong versions of some of the older Crim material like & quot ; Red & quot ; and & quot ; LTIA II , & quot ; Adrian Belew 's Beatlesque ballads , and newer stuff like Thrak , which features a freely improvised section sandwiched by some very heavy and precise riffing . No other band around can go from etheral to raging to poignant to scary with such grace and ease.The camera work is generally very good , although I have some quibbles with the editing . I also found this 2-sided DVD a bit triKCy to navigate at first . However , with this DVD you also have a choice of player emphasis and can do other tricks as well .	1
I have to disagree with the reviewer who says this is n't a good purchase : I understand -- when I first started the DVD , I thought the same things he mentioned : the camera work is n't great . The director missed the mark a number of times , and in the first cut you realize the cameras are in EXACTLY the wrong spots leaving the mics blocking the faces ! But the work gets better , and you only notice about two missed shots after that.But all that was overshadowed by AMERICA 'S performance . I was shocked BY JUST HOW GOOD THESE GUYS ARE ! ( _I've_ always thought they were great -- but at the end of the first song , I realized & quot ; that was just an off the cuff gig & quot ; -- and then they followed with 8 more ! ) There is no & quot ; show & quot ; here . No audience , no fans , no screaming to cover bad vocals and missed cues . And what we see instead is a GREAT example of a band dedicated to great guitar work and superb sound . Seriously , you have to SEE this to believe how & quot ; casual & quot ; these guys are as they turn out these gems ! At the end of the first song , which had left me dazed after YEARS of live acts that sound terrible and ca n't be re-created outside a studio , Bunnell asks & quot ; Do we go back to fix the things that did n't work ? & quot ; WHAT DID N'T WORK ? ? ? I echo the recording engineer - & quot ; Ahhh , no -- Just go on ! & quot ; The entire session is great , and features songs too rarely heard . I _suspect_ it was recorded BEFORE the & quot ; Holiday & quot ; album became a big hit : Tin Man & quot ; and & quot ; Lonely People & quot ; do n't sound quite as & quot ; polished & quot ; and actually a bit different in arrangement.Also do n't overlook the fact this piece also features the band with Dan Peek , and it was very nice to see the & quot ; whole group & quot ; again.This is a simple , straight ahead recording session . There is n't even much for joking between the cuts -- but each cut is the best they could provide their fans , and the show is a lost treasure recovered 25 years later . Enjoy !	1
Great tracks ... but really old videos ( however , some were interesting ) ... Bottom line : you ca n't go wrong with Mark and friends .	1
Love the Bee Gees.Always have and always will.Miss Robin and Morrise.This concert was great.Covered most of their hits .	1
I am a huge fan of this band . I have never see them in concert before . It is a must but for any fan of this band	1
Having been around since the beginning with these guys , this maybe one of the best concerts I 've ever seen period.The music is great and the vocals are out of this world . I figured it would be good but it was great instead . 5 Stars is reserved for Beatle music only , so I had to go with 4 . Do n't waste any more time and buy this one .	1
This is one of the BEST Concert Video 's I have seen . It was the next best thing to being there . Barry , Robin and Maurice were in top form . Their harmonies were as good as ever and they sounded wonderful . This is a video I have and will continue to watch over and over . Knowing that we will never see that wonderful smile and playful personality of Maurice Gibb on stage again is hard to take . That makes this wonderful video more special .	1
Great audio sound and clarity . Video great - an outstanding show . A definite buy at any price ! You ca n't believe how good a concert can be until you 've seen this one . You 'll find that you love everything played !	1
Fantastic dvd the BEE GEES were and are still a part of the greatest groups list . The seller was quick and no returns needed .	1
Great concert ... ..all the hits and some gems as well ... ..one any fan should own ... ..the brother are in great form in this Vegas show	1
This is a must have for any fan . The sound is great . Show it on a large enough Flat Screen with surround sound and you feel as if you are at a concert .	1
This DVD shows how amazing the Gibb brother 's voices really are . The harmonies are just plain beautiful . And , I found myslef tearing up on the `` duet '' with Andy . Made me want to get all my old albums our and listen again .	1
One Night Only is the Bee Gees in all of their absolute shining glory . It is one of the finest performances I have ever seen by these guys but more than that , it is one of the finest performances I have ever seen of anyone . Their catalog of hits songs is so vast that I had forgotten some of the songs they made famous until I heard them again . They did a very moving tribute to their late brother , Andy . One Night Only is a must have for any fan of the Brothers Gibb . A stellar performance . It was so tragic to lose Maurice a few years ago but even though we will never see them perform live in concert again , we have DVDs like this to ensure that their memory lives on and on .	1
I remember being at the concert in Las Vegas . It was a great night . Now with only 2 remaining members it is also a great concert dvd . I 've always loved the Bee Gees . I was not a fan of Disco but many people do n't hear their songs before disco started and after disco ended . I know I 'm old enough to remember the Bee Gees before the 70 's . Great DVD if you want to hear a great DVD .	1
This DVD is simply incredible ... The sound and the image quality are amazing.Even my children aged 10 and 5 considered it as their favorite DVD.Working on my home theatre , it 's one of the best digital sound and image experiences .	1
This has been on PBS and is just like the TV special . Fantastic ! Too bad all the Gibb brothers are no longer here , only Barry , so it 's more important than ever to have this special . Would have been nice to see Andy Gibb , too . Life is short , make the most out of it while you 're here . This DVD has their best songs .	1
In 1998 , I got the rare opportunity to see Janet Jackson in concert held in Minneapolis , during `` The Velvet Rope '' tour . The show was amazing . All of the physical features and her performances were breathtaking . Though nothing beats the live experience , this DVD wonderfully commemorates the tour.Months before , she released an album of the same name that was unusually different than her previous . She was always known for her positive songs . However , the album entirely explored her painful turbulations , including abuse , loss , depression , and others . These songs are based on thoughts she endured during her two-year depression , 1995-1997 . Many listeners were shocked . Some of these songs gave this tour a new outlook . Despite revisiting many classic songs , audiences can feel her new style.The elaborate stage direction gives the concert a more enjoyable experience . The three different backgrounds and the three different costumes add to the spectacular pleasure : inside the velvet rope theme , the circus-like theme , and the hip-hop theme . All blend perfectly with the dance moves and the songs . However , her vocal expressions remain present the whole performance while never being overlooked . Her facial expressions prove that she truly feels the songs . Through the sexuality , political motivation , the pain , and the anger , she maintains her full musical quality . All songs offer a new prospective through her life . She keeps audiences excited , always having fun . `` The Velvet Rope Tour '' proves how truly great Janet Jackson is an entertainer . This DVD edition is great for all fans as this will surely please audiences for a long time . The tremendous quality proves that she 'll continue entertaining for many more years . Go Janet !	1
This is a very good live concert VHS tape with high energy and lots of colorful lights . Janet Jackson gives a 2 hour , non stop , performance in a 1998 release with Janet at her peak performance . The majority of her songs she sings live , not lip-synching . The experience of watching the video is close to being at a live concert in one of the front rows .	1
this tour is like a representation of janet as a person what she feels and what she wants in life and what she is looking for and basically happiness i personally enjoy janet in everything she does because she does it so well !	1
Okay , I 'll admit it ... I 'm a Janet fan . But you 've got to give it to her , Girlfriend is a fantastic performer . This video proves it . I 've seen her live twice and this video brought me back to the great times I had at those concerts . She gives so much of herself that you do n't mind the price you paid for the tickets . With that in mind , this video is a bargain at any price . Madonna who ?	1
but I gave it a 4 because of the audience . I would have assumed that after it being aired live on HBO and set for VHS and DVD availability-that they would drown out the crowd more , particularly the first song & quot ; Velvet Rope & quot ; and & quot ; If & quot ; . It got better as the show went on , except in some parts , where again they drowned Janet 's voice by the audience.Other than that , as I said very fun and energetic . All the great hits , fantastic stage sets and awesome costume changes . Especially the Escapade Medley stage set and costumes.Those who like Janet and those who like concerts on the screen , I recommend it .	1
NOBODY can do a show like Janet Jackson . If people THINK that Madonna and Michael are better , they have NOT seen this show yet ! This IS a must see !	1
Many have questioned why this `` film '' has n't been remastered . The simple reason is it was shot on videotape , not film . This special , and the ones that followed , were taped at NBC Studios in Burbank ( when Frank leaves his car at the beginning of the show , that 's the Tonight Show studio on his right ! ) , along with `` The Dean Martin Show '' , `` Rowan & Martin 's Laugh In '' , `` The Hollywood Squares '' , and many more . Everything shot at the Burbank complex , up until just a decade or so ago , was done on videotape , not film . Unfortunately even broadcast quality videotape deteriorates over time . My guess is that this special probably was n't preserved on digital disc , until sometime in the 1980 's . If you look at the DVD 's of the Dean Martin Show , or `` The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson '' , you 'll see that some of those master tapes have deteriorated as well . It 's a shame , but those were the cost cutting limitations that NBC offered at the time . Also note that this special was shot on three different nights ( hence the canned laughter at Sinatra 's jokes ) . The first installment was November 8th , 1965 . Sinatra returned at two different days that week to finish off the performance ( it took at least a day to tear down and rebuild each of those elaborate sets ) . It was broadcast on Thanksgiving night of '65 . I have read that Frank was suffering from a severe cold the night he taped the `` I 've Got You Under My Skin '' segment , and was very cranky to the directors , producers and everyone else in the studio that night . Despite it all , he turned out a top notch performance , and I for one , am glad we have it , considering what NBC did to the first decade of Johnny Carson 's material !	1
What 's interesting about this special is that unlike many singers , Frank did n't have a guest and he sang live as opposed to pre-recording a bunch of big production numbers . After all , it was about him and the music !	1
Today , Madonna is known as Esther , practicing Kabbalah and making cheesy techno music . But back in the 1980s ' , she was a force to be reckoned with . She crafted some of the best songs of the decade , and was also an amazing live performer . `` Ciao Italia ( Live From italy ) '' is proof of Madonna 's concert talents . Madonna is truly on fire on this show , whether she 's performing an upbeat number like `` Lucky Star '' or crooning a ballad like `` Live To Tell '' or just welcoming the audience , Madonna holds the crowd in the palm of her hand and never lets go . This is a great live dvd and one I recommend .	1
So the critics raved about Blonde Ambition , the Girlie Show , and the Drowned World Tour.What they , and even fans often overlooked was this gem of a tour . Ciao Italia featured Madonna 's last show of her `` Who 's That Girl '' world tour , which took place in Italy.Here , we have a much younger Madonna , in her prime , performing hit after hit and after hit and literally worked the stage into a frenzy . While Blonde Ambition was saddled with the Dick Tracy segment , Girlie Show with her Marlene Dietrich drag and Drowned World with her Flying Tiger/Hidden Dragon routines , this is non stop entertainment from beginning to end.Her renditions of Live to Tell have never been more touching and effective . Likewise with Lucky Star and the opening number of Open Your Heart , which closely followed its provocative video . Her performances of Into the Groove , La Isla Bonita , and Holiday has never been equaled or surpassed in terms of choreography and pure energy in her later tours . The versions of Into the Groove and Holiday in Blonde Ambition are anemic compare to the ones in the Who 's That Girl Tour . Madonna also performed a killer version of the tour 's ( and unfortunately , the movie 's ) title song . I can never forget the song 's haunting finale ( Whooooooo 's thaaaaaaaaat girrrrrrrrrrrl ) .Madonna is also one hell of a comedienne with the funny medley of Dress You Up , Material Girl , and Like A Virgin ( I particularly get a chuckle of her and her two dancers doing the Nazi salute as they marched down the stairs as the back-up tape sang : Living in a material world ) . Ever the consummate performer , Madonna worked the ENTIRE stage , where everybody have a chance to see her.This is pre-Like A Prayer , before Madonna got saddled with angst and inner turmoil ( and the Kabbala ! ) , so this concert was nothing but one roller coaster ride from beginning to end . Later concerts may have better sets , costumes , and came off like a big broadway musical ( and twisted ones at that ! ) , but Ciao Italia ! features Madonna at her peak and when she was least pretentious.No doubt the Madonna we all missed ! Enough with the Zen , just give us the goods !	1
Bonus materials with Anton Corbijn , music video director and Depeche Mode members are so precious as well as the 'cool ' and sophisticated video clips . Depeche Mode in this DVD confirm that they never cease to catch up with contemporary music scenes . And even they excel any other bands .	1
This is a definite must have for all you Depeche Mode fans that are out there . This DVD is a collection of the band 's videos for some of their greatest songs from 86 to 98 . It is a real pleasure watching this DVD and seeing DM throughout the years . Not only are the videos great , but you also get to see Depeche Mode talk in short interviews at the beginning and at the end . At the end of the video presentations there is a short Depeche Mode film in which is defintely a treat for any DM fan . The short film is basically a series of interviews with the band members and people that have worked with the band . The band members talk about their career as a group and the making of each album and video for the 86-98 time period . It is a great way to see each band member idividually talk and there is also a special apperance by former band member Alan Wilder ( 1982-1995 ) . Alan Wilder also talks about the band 's history and their work . A great DVD to have by one of the best bands of all time .	1
I was n't quite impressed with the plot of the videos . Some do n't even relate to the song . I thought that & quot ; Enjoy the silence was going to be a bit more dark- or gothic - but we have Gahan walking around dressed as a King with a chair . Senseless ! But some videos do give you 80 's nostalgia - the 80 's with a youthful band- which is now aged and somewhat tired . The packaging 's art fits well , since it looks like the cover of & quot ; Black Celebration & quot ; .The menus are easy to browse and select . The songs are perfect for a DVD project of this magnitude . All are hits and stories by themselves - it is the soundtrack ( videos ) of our lives . I 'm most fond of the songs included here from & quot ; Violator & quot ; . It is one of the best electronic albums of all times . By taking something from each production , the DVD flows and provides a glimpse of the band 's evolution . Should not be taken for granted ... ... .get it !	1
Depeche Mode 's Videos 86 > 98+ is a reissue of the original DVD ( except this version has two discs instead of just one ) . The first disc is basically a slightly re-worked version of the original DVD . The main menu , while it is nothing terribly fancy , is still an improvement over the menu on the original issue of the disc . This menu has the logo from the cover as the background image , and you are given four choices : Play , Video Selection , Interview with Depeche Mode , and Short Film . The Video Selection menu has the electronic Depeche Mode logo in what kind of resembles a spaceship hangar . The video selection is broken up into three groups of videos to choose from ( the groups contain seven videos each ) . The other options on the menu take you directly to what is labeled on them . If you use the Video Selection menu , the disc will play the video you choose , and then continue playing the remaining videos in sequence.If you choose the Play option , it will take you to the beginning of the whole disc ( which opens with a montage of items associated with Depeche Mode 's videos , such as the lawn chair from `` Enjoy The Silence '' ) . This is followed by a short interview section ( including interviews with Dave Gahan , Martin Gore , Andrew Fletcher , and Anton Corbijn ) that tells stories behind shooting the videos for `` Personal Jesus , '' `` Enjoy the Silence , '' `` Barrel of a Gun , '' and `` It 's No Good . '' This section also includes footage from some of the videos ( `` A Question of Time , '' `` Useless , '' `` Personal Jesus , '' `` Enjoy The Silence , '' `` Barrel of a Gun , '' and `` It 's No Good '' ) , as well as footage from a video shoot . Then , disc one progresses into the music videos ; each video opens with a title card with one of the images from the opening montage , as well as the title of the video . Two of the videos on the two discs have exclusive audio ( `` Enjoy the Silence '' and `` But Not Tonight '' ) . The disc ends with a twenty minute short film titled , `` Depeche Mode - A Short Film . '' The film includes interviews with Dave Gahan , Martin Gore , Andrew Fletcher , former member Alan Wilder , Daniel Miller ( head of Mute Records ) , Anton Corbijn , Flood , Tim Simenon , plus someone else who has worked with the band ( unfortunately , nowhere during the film did the individuals ' names ever appear on the screen to identify them ) . The film also includes footage from some of the videos ( `` Stripped , '' `` A Question of Time , '' `` Personal Jeses , '' `` Enjoy The Silence , '' `` I Feel You , '' `` In Your Room , '' `` Barrel of a Gun , '' and `` It 's No Good '' ) . Footage also appears from the 101 video release , newspaper articles about Dave 's overdose , newspaper articles about the band 's `` return , '' and footage of Dave singing `` Only When I Lose Myself '' in the studio ) .The second disc opens with a menu that has a close-up of one of the digital signs from the cover . There are three options in the menu : The Videos , 3 Short Films , and Play All . The menu for the videos has an orange curtain with a digital sign with a number `` 0 '' in the middle . The video selections appear on either side of the sign ( `` But Not Tonight '' and `` Strangelove '88 '' appear on the left side , and `` One Caress '' and `` Condemnation [ Paris Mix ] '' appear on the right side ) . The menu for 3 Short Films is a long shot of the orange curtain ( a projection room can be seen on the top of the screen ) , with digital signs in front of the curtain ( but the signs are blurred , so you ca n't read what they say ) . The three choices appear at the bottom of the screen . When you watch the three promotional films , they are left in their original form ( this means that the music videos included in the original are not edited out ) . And unlike the first disc , if you choose a video or a short film , the disc will only play what you select.When you select Play All , it goes into the `` But Not Tonight '' video , and this is followed by the `` Strangelove '88 '' video . Next is the promotional film for the Violator album ( which includes interviews with Dave Gahan and Martin Gore , outtakes from the `` Personal Jesus '' and `` Enjoy the Silence '' video shoots , as well as the videos for `` Personal Jesus '' and `` Enjoy The Silence '' ) . Overall , this promotional film was enjoyable to watch . Next on the disc is the promotional film for the Songs of Faith and Devotion album . This includes interviews with all four band members ( Dave , Martin , Andrew , and Alan ) , footage from the `` Just Ca n't Get Enough '' video , footage of the band hanging out in Madrid while recording the album , and ends with the video for `` I Feel You . '' Overall , this promo film is the worst of the three ; many of the things that happen in it are very obviously staged ( such as the woman coming up to Martin 's room ) . Also , it felt like too much emphasis was being put on Martin in the film . This is followed by the videos for `` One Caress '' and `` Condemnation [ Paris Mix ] . '' The disc closes with the promotional film for the Ultra album ; it includes interviews with Dave , Martin , and Andy , some sound samples from the album ( with accompanying lyrics on the screen ) , and the video for `` Barrel of a Gun . '' This film , while it is better than the one for Songs of Faith and Devotion , is still rather strange in how it was done.Overall , this is a decent collection . However , the videos for `` Pimpf , '' `` Clean , '' and `` Halo '' are missing ; perhaps in the future , a double DVD set of the Strange and Strange Too video compilations could be released to make up for this deficiency . Outside of that , though , this item is a great addition to a Depeche Mode collection in order to upgrade from the original video or DVD issue of this item .	1
I wo n't comment on how good the concert was ; others have already said it better than I ever could.But -- Hello ! Time-Warner ! -- please see the obvious , and reissue this DVD on Blu-ray . The millions of Paul Simon fans around the world will buy every box you make.First , the current DVD , as I write this , is virtually unaffordable . Amazon has 2 new copies for sale at $ 150 each , four used copies at $ 60 each.Second , and more important , the current DVD has no special features . Nada . ( Unless my memory fails me , or unless the Netflix disc I watched was different , condensed , for some reason . ) Blu-ray , with its huge capacity , will allow hours of special features . Here 's what I 'd especially love to see:1 . A running commentary of the concert or , if that 's not feasible , an extended interview with Paul Simon.2 . A sampling of the news reports and press conferences of Mr Simon after the album Graceland came out . Some foolishly chastised him as a thief of African rhythms , for taking advantage of his African band . I remember in particular how eloquently Mr Simon defended himself at a university , and think that should be part of the discussion of this album.3 . A sense of historical perspective . In particular , please remind us the concert took place in 1987 and what the political situation in southern Africa was at the time . After over twenty years in prison , Nelson Mandela still had almost four more years to rot . It would be seven years before he would become South Africa 's President Mandela . Tell us about Mr Mandela and Mr Mugabe , one revered around the world , a savior of his country , the other despised , a destroyer of his.4 . And if you can find any deleted footage of the concert , throw that in , too.So , Time-Warner ? Anybody awake there ? This is a no-brainer if ever there was one. -- -- -- -- -- -June 5 , 2012 : They did it , kind of . UNDER AFRICAN SKIES has just come out on Blu-ray . http : //www.amazon.com/African-Graceland-Anniversary-BluRay-Blu-ray/dp/B007P06DL8/ref=sr_1_1 ? s=movies-tv & ie ; =UTF8 & qid ; =1338927810 & sr ; =1-1If I understand the description right , we get almost two hours of the background I was asking for , but not the concert itself.The original GRACELAND DVD is still available at Amazon . As I write this , it will cost us only $ 125 for a used copy .	1
For so many acts thay have came out of Britain , it has always been a come and go method . Sometimes , we forget about them , and we choose other artists to replace them as new favorites . That case came so many times within Rod Stewart , but he has always found ways to bounce back to the top of the charts . Still , it is his amazing soulful voice that just keeps us guessing to his status.Storyteller , is a collection of Rod Stewart music videos from 1984-1991 . The collection goes from his entry to the MTV generation with his videos from Camouflage , all the way to Vagabond Heart . The songs do n't range greatfully , but it does show why Rod Stewart has remained as a constant in this industry geared toward youth . The music videos range greatly with ballads like Every Beat Of My Heart and Downtown Train , to his soulful party anthems like The Motown Song and Infatuation . The video collection was made based on the triumph of Rod Stewart 's 1989 boxed set , Storyteller . Although you do n't hear the singles from Vagabond Heart on the boxed set , they are right here.Still , it is just a shame that we do n't give Rod Stewart all that credit anymore . Still , he alwasy knows what makes a great vibe in a song , and the style as well . He has n't changed with his Earthy voice since he started his career with The Faces . I just know there is a lot more soul to come .	1
I do n't particularly enjoy this production , but for reasons that are entirely my own fault . I saw the first Amnesty International concert in Zimbabwe , whenever it was - I think the late 80s or early 90s . It was hosted in Zimbabwe but aimed at a South African audience - but for political reasons ( it was still the apartheid days ) could n't play in South Africa - in fact , South Africa was no doubt one of the targets of the Amnesty concert.For those like myself who attended , one of the most infamous aspects of the concert was the eight hours it took standing in the broiling heat to get through the Zimbabwe border post . However , it was worth it : it was one of the most fantastic concerts I 've ever been to - I 'd never expected to see Bruce Springsteen live . I thought Sting and to a lesser degree Peter Gabriel were excellent , but they were totally blown away by Springsteen.And this is what I thought I was buying . I never knew there was a second tour , and the price label blocked the concert date on the packaging . I could n't remember many of the other artists , so did n't realise it was a different concert , and where I did see artists that I knew I had n't seen - like Plant/Page - I thought maybe they 'd attended Paris but not Zimbabwe . However , I fully realised my error when Springsteen came on and played his down-tone boring renditions compared to the feverish display he 'd given in Zim.It may be a great cause , but I 've never brought myself to watch the whole show through , as most of the artists do n't resonate with me , and the ones that do - well , I have far better concert performances by them to watch instead .	1
I admit , I never knew They Might Be Giants had even made music videos . Having learned otherwise , I was eager to pick this up.The DVD is an essential purchase for any fan of the band for the videos alone . Fortunately there 's much more to recommend it . The commentary track does take a while to get going but it is a fascinating insight to the Johns . Please note , however , that anyone who is expecting an explanation of the videos and their will be sadly disappointed . Throw in the bonus Tiny Toons videos , audio tracks , live clip and trailer , and this is a bargain.In fact , my only real complaint about the disc is that they did n't include the bonus audio as MP3s or some other transportable format , because I would love to hear them away from my DVD player.But that 's a small problem in light of the quality and value of the disc . If you like They and have a DVD player , there is no question that you need to pick this up .	1
This is a truly wonderful production of one of the great operatic comedies - strongly cast , well conducted , and interestingly staged.Susanna is one of Mozart 's greatest roles , and Alison Hagley does full justice to it . She creates a character that is intelligent , resourceful , and spunky . She also sings beautifully ; `` Deh vieni non tardar '' is worth waiting three hours to hear . She has excellent chemistry with the well sung Figaro of Gerald Finley . He is likewise smart and resourceful , and he delights in outsmarting his master . Ren & eacute ; e Fleming is a lovely Countess . She creates interesting vocal colors and dynamic shadings , especially in her arias , and she blends splendidly with Hagley in the Letter Duet . She had more of an `` opera singer 's figure '' in 1994 , but she still moves gracefully , and she finds a good balance between regal and girlish . Andreas Schmidt is a choleric , dangerous Count , but his repentance at the end is entirely convincing . As usual , he sings beautifully , with a good understanding of the words . The smaller parts are also well cast . Marie-Ange Todorovich is an excellent hormone-soaked Cherubino . Robert Tear sings Basilio as well as he did in the classic Davis recording twenty years earlier , and he creates a delightful character . Conductor Bernard Haitink is in full command of the score . His tempos are brisk , but he knows when to take time for expression , and he allows the singers some stylish bits of embellishment . The performance is uncut and includes the often omitted arias for Basilio and Marcellina ; Tear and Wendy Hillhouse handle them with aplomb . The staging is an effective blend of beautiful period costumes and modern stylized settings.Several reviewers have complained about the sound , in that the voices sometimes sound distant or muffled . Having listened to the recording on headphones , I think this is clearly the result of microphone placement ; one can hear the singers go in and out of focus as they move around the stage . This was , after all , the first production in Glyndebourne 's new house , and perhaps the engineers were not quite used to the acoustics yet . This could also explain the numerous moments when the singers are not quite in sync with the orchestra ; perhaps they could not hear well . But these are minor distractions in an otherwise excellent performance . Strongly recommended .	1
A traditional staging , with simple yet attractive sets , allow the singers to shine in this production which innaugurated the Glyndebourne Festival 's renovated opera house . The music was appropriately light and airy , EXCEPT , and this is why I did not give this version a fifth star , in Figaro 's marriage scene . I feel that Maestro Haitink could have brought the volume up and sustained it a little longer on a celebratory tone . I could n't help but compare it with the same scene in the movie `` Amadeus '' , which to me , is the way it should look and sound .	1
These performers have some of the most unabtrusive and refined voices I 've heard in a long time . Hagley 's voice as Susanna stold the show . While the acting may take 2nd place to the singing , that is perfectly fine with me . The orchestra was a bit louder than usual for an Opera , but you know what ? The compositions that make up Le Nozze de Figaro are so beautiful that , to me it was icing on the cake.The set was not changed often , but with the filmography , it did n't need to . It was proper for the timeframe of the opera and visually pleasing . This was not a bland nor boring opera.Le Nozze de Figaro is a long opera , weighing in at around 2.5 hours . This is one of the few I had no problems getting a bit ansi with the story and length . Look , if you have an ear for beauty , then the beauty of this performance will bring tears to your eyes . The performers and Orchestra hit so many sweet notes.Now my favorite particular production of the dozens I own . I am very picky and get bored easy , so that should tell you something .	1
Of all the Operas on DVD that I have purchased this is my favorite . This whole performance and production come together in a special way.The singing and acting are of the highest order . The playing from LSO under Bernard Haitink is perfectly judged and paced , providing wonderful support to the singers.The staging supports the story well and it was beautifully filmed . The audio is well above average for opera DVDs . The balance between voice and orchestra is excellent . The recording could benefit from a little more ambiance , but there is nothing highly irritating in the recording to detract from the performance.This DVD would make converts of many , to using this medium to present great opera in the home .	1
Time was when 'taped ' performances of staged operas were significant only for the historical value , not for the creative nature of Opera on Film . Much of that changed with Ingmar Bergman 's unforgettable 'Magic Flute ' , but that again was a movie director 's take on both the opera and the backstage workings that accompanied its production . Now with the technical advances in sound and video production more and more thoroughly successful visual recordings of great opera performances are filling the shelves and bins of music stores . And this 2003 Glyndebourne Festival Opera performance of Mozart 's 'Le Nozze di Figaro ' ( Marriage of Figaro ) is among the best . The cameras and microphones are so adeptly placed that the performance seems like a movie.Bernard Haitink and the London Philharmonic are gratefully in the pit supporting a cast that not only sings and acts to perfection , they are also consistently beautiful and handsome actors ! Gerald Finley in the title role of Figaro is as fine as they come and his support from Alison Hagley 's Susanna is not only musically balanced but visually perfect . Ren & eacute ; e Fleming is in top form as the Countess , as are Andreas Schiff and Marie-Ange Todorovitch ( Cherubino ) . The pacing and interaction of all of the singers under Hiatink 's well thought conducting makes one of the finest performances of this opera staple seem as fresh as a Premiere . Highly recommended , especially for those with doubts as to the validity of filmed operatic performances ! Grady Harp , October 05	1
I just bought this Figaro and loved it . The cast , sets and conducting seemed almost perfect . My only complaint was that the titles were a little insufficent at times and they were way to big -- smaller print would have been less intrusive . Re the Nixon in China , I 've always loved that opera and was present the night of the taping that was broadcast on PBS many years ago . I also saw a concert version of it here in San Francisco before the stage premier in Houston . The likelyhood of it ever appearing on DVD is probably only a fantasy . I watched my tape of it last weekend and was as thrilled as ever with it . I know many folks do n't like it but for me it just hits all the right spots . With my new computer , I 've just finished converting it to DVD to preserve it since as I said before it is highly unlikely it will become available commercially .	1
Many things combine to make this an ideal production to enjoy in the home . There are enough shots of the newly-enlarged opera house at Glyndebourne to remind us that we are at an actual performance . The camera work , however , gets us closer than is possible in any theatre ; indeed , during the Countess 's first aria we are lying beside her in the bed . Amongst the principals , it is Figaro ( Gerald Finley ) and Susanna ( Alison Begley ) who dominate , and rightly so . With subtitles provided and every note of Mozart 's score included , we might well conclude that this is the most entertaining of all operas .	1
This is generally a sparkling , enjoyable production . The principal singers do a wonderful job both musically and dramatically , and it 's a treat to see people in these roles who are young enough to `` fit '' the characters properly . [ Finley and Hagley are superb ! ] Bernard Haitink and the London Philharmonic are an absolute delight.However , two caveats . The sets are a slightly uneasy mix of flats in Ellsworth-Kelly-esque primary colors and dabs of period furniture ; also , the lights dim for `` serious '' moments , an annoying , superficial touch . Much more problematic is the DVD sound mix . The orchestra comes off superbly , but voices are sometimes lost and muffled-sounding . I actually checked my center channel to see if it was active ! Balance-wise , the stereo version is no better . This is just a word of caution to those who like to hear the SINGERS in an opera . [ I am going to add a 2010 postscript to this review . I recently revisited this dvd and found I was much less put off by the sets and lighting . In fact , they 're rather creative , and seldom do they obtrude . Same for the distinctive acting/staging touches . My feelings about the sound remain about the same . The voices are occasionally put in the shade by the orchestra , and there 's a generic , mp3 quality to many spots . Perhaps this reflects the experience of live performance more accurately than the old practice of spotlighting the vocals for a recording . But the issue is compounded by the digital sound compression that was obviously used in order to squeeze Mozart 's 3 hours and 10 minutes of music onto a single dvd . ]	1
I really enjoyed this version of `` Le Nozze Di Figaro '' . The cast is superb and all wonderful actors . Alison Hagley and Gerald Finley are excellent as Susanna and Figaro . The divine Renee Fleming shines as the Countess with her dramatic ability and that creamy voice . Check out the look she gives to the Count when he sings asking for her forgiveness in the bedroom scene . Schmidt is outstanding as the Count , but is such a rogue that one does not feel sorry for his ultimate humiliation . For comedic relief , the wonderful singer Rodorovitch is superb as Cherubino . I laughed my head off at the bedroom scene where Cherubino has been dressed in women 's clothes and heels by Susanna and Countess . They are trying to teach Cherubino to walk like a lady . At one point , it seems like Renee is really laughing and not acting . The sound quality and film production are outstanding . I heard nothing wrong on the audio end so have no idea what a couple of prior reviewers are complaining about in regards to bad audio mix . Highly recommended .	1
Madonna 's first music video compilation , `` The Immaculate Collection '' was released simultaneously with its companion audio album in November 1990 . The track list between the two differed a bit : the video boasted `` Oh Father '' ( which did n't make it onto the hits album ) as well as her performance of `` Vogue '' at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards . Also , the new tracks `` Justify My Love '' - which did not make it to the DVD because of its explicit content - and `` Rescue Me '' , which were included on the CD , are not on the DVD . While the album scored # 2 on the US Billboard charts , on the American DVD charts , this scored # 1 , and remained on the charts for 76 year.1 . `` Lucky Star '' ( 9/10 ) 2 . `` Borderline '' ( 10/10 ) 3 . `` Like A Virgin '' ( 10/10 ) 4 . `` Material Girl '' ( 10/10 ) 5 . `` Papa Do n't Preach '' ( 9/10 ) 6 . `` Open Your Heart '' ( 10/10 ) 7 . `` La Isla Bonita '' ( 9/10 ) 8 . `` Like A Prayer '' ( 10/10 ) 9 . `` Express Yourself '' ( 10/10 ) 10 . `` Cherish '' ( 9/10 ) 11 . `` Oh Father '' ( 10/10 ) 12 . `` Vogue '' ( 10/10 ) 13 . `` Vogue '' ( Live at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards ) ( 10/10 ) '' The Immaculate Collection '' is an excellent DVD , packed full of great Madonna videos , that have became history . While not as good as the CD - probably due to the fact that some tracks are missed off the DVD that were put onto the CD - it 's still a brilliant buy and a worthy purchase indeed . `` Lucky Star '' is available as an extended version here , that is not available on the VHS , and the live version of `` Vogue '' is not on the VHS either , so I suppose we get some bonuses here ! My favourite videos are `` Material Girl '' , `` Open Your Heart '' and `` Oh Father '' . While `` Like A Prayer '' is definately in my top three favourite Madonna songs ever , the video just is n't as good as the three mentioned above . This music video collection is definately recommended to all Madonna fans ! My top three `` The Immaculate Collection '' pics ( based on the video - not the song ) : -3 ) Material Girl2 ) Open Your Heart1 ) Oh Father	1
`` The Immaculate Collection '' is a compilation of some of Madonna 's music videos from 1984-1990 . Every video answers why she 's the queen of pop and of MTV . The catchy songs answer why she was the biggest selling female artist of the 1980 's . She knows how to keep many interested . Her dance moves , sexuality , and outrageousness keeps many watching her every move , wondering what she 'll do next . Her brilliantly creative outlook is expressed in every video . Such risque moves deserves her tremendous respect . No female before her was performing such daring moves and attitudes . She defines girl power . Her variey and her ability to always brainstorm new and original ideas amazes everyone . The moments many think she 's done everything , she always does something new and mindblowing.Madonna 's videos are unforgettable . Whether she 's dressing like Marilyn Monroe ( `` Material Girl '' ) , a 1940 's actress ( `` Express Yourself '' ) , a mermaid ( `` Cherish '' ) , a street-wise woman ( `` Borderline '' ) , or herself ( many of them ) , her creativity starts a fashion . Many modern-day artists have impersonated and/or found inspiration in these videos . However , none have reached anywhere close to her style and quality . The stand-out video is `` Vogue '' , which VH1 named the second greatest music video ever made . This pays tribute to old-time Hollywood actresses , and it introduces the audience to her gay affiliations . Her MTV Music Awards performance of this song is also included . The dancers and she are dressed in 1600 's European style . `` The Immaculate Collection '' DVD is important material for the Madonna fan . This will keep many entertained for a long time . As every song of hers will be classics , these videos will do the same . These songs are also featured on the CD ; therefore , the two compilations will be a fun combination .	1
Overall , this dvd is very good.I was rather disappointed that Holiday , True blue and Who 's that girl were missing.I would have prefered to see the video of one of the songs I have mentioned , rather than 2 versions of Vogue.Otherwise , the dvd is very good and entertaining.Great buy .	1
First and foremost , the idea of DVD technology is to take advantage of the considerable space . With the amount of early Madonna videos around , this DVD should have included them . While what 's on offer are fantastic , it is not really worth the money for only 13 videos . Missing videos ( which we all know and love ) include : - Burnin ' Up- Dear Jessie- Justify my Love- Crazy for You- Live to Tell- Causing a Commotion- True BlueThat is seven videos that would have made this a nice collection of 20 songs , instead of only 13 . Do we really need two versions of `` Vogue '' when we could have perhaps got one of the above ? Overall , a good DVD ... but not great , simply because it misses so much .	1
Sinatra , the one of a kind all around performer comes into our living room and does what he does best -- entertain us .	1
Yes , it is always difficult for me to resist peformances by Frank Sinatra . I always imagined I would dislike him , personally , but there is no question that he is one of the finest performers of his era.This television special is a must-have for any Sinatra buff . After all , it 's from when he came out of retirement in front of an all-star audience.There 's a very nice balance between what was new material from arguably his finest album ( of the same title -- particularly including & quot ; You Will Be My Music & quot ; , & quot ; Let Me Try Again & quot ; , and & quot ; Send In The Clowns & quot ; ) and Sinatra standards ( who can resist his joy in singing & quot ; I Get A Kick Out Of You & quot ; , & quot ; I 've Got You Under My Skin & quot ; , or & quot ; I 've Got The World On A String & quot ; ) . The saloon segment is typically sentimental Sinatra.The segment with Gene Kelly is great fun ! Their personal pleasure in working together is quite evident , and the blend of flash-back scenes to the MGM years and their ability to still do a few dance steps is charming.The video quality is good for the era , but too bad it had not been recorded in stereo . However , it 's difficult to imagine many people not enjoying this delightful trip into the past , and certainly one of the best television performances by a performer who did n't always shine in that medium .	1
I became a Sinatra fan since I heard `` My Way '' being very young . Since then I learned to appreciate his way of phrasing , as unique in the musiccal world . As time passed and the voice faded gradually , he compensated that with a more dramatic , full of feeling manner of saying every word.As a paradox , one of the more interesting things about this video , at least for me , was the story that HRH Grace Kelly told at the beginning , that shows what kind of human being Sinatra was . You can also find stories like this in the book that his daughter wrote some 3 or 4 years ago.So , if you are a Sinatra fan , don ` t miss this video .	1
Sinatra , at age 56 , at his fightin ' weight , yet relaxed and congenial - the elegant venue ( and the long , regal introduction by Princess Grace Kelly ) did not make him forget his roots : his patter is pure after-hours Manhattan and , as can be expected , his performances are sensational : especially noteworthy is `` One For My Baby '' , `` I Get Along Without You Very Well '' , `` I Will Drink The Wine '' ( an off-kilter , but reflective lyric by a young writer ) , `` Something '' ( with some fine improvisations ) , and , you know it ... '' My Way '' . Why would anyone want to `` cover '' this song after Francis Albert sang it on record - and at the Royal Festival Hall -for the ages ?	1
Frank 's voice is rough at times , but he knows how to use the mike like nobody else did to camaflage it or use it for poignancy . Good selection of songs from the Great American Song Book including 'I Get Along Without You Very Well ' and 'I Have Dreamed . ' Nice version of 'Something in the Way She Moves . '' Sometimes the band is uncommony loud which Frank humourously comments on . Look for Tony Bennet in the audience at the end when the camera pans left .	1
At the very beginning of this video you see the guy who filmed this say , right up front , that he recorded this over 2 nights . So why the knock on that ? I barely noticed the change . Also , some above posters said the lighting was bad , but hey , indoor concerts are never lit right for photography . After all , it 's a concert , not a tv studio ! Van Halen was head and shoulders above their contemporaries when they came onto the scene in the late '70s , early '80 's . They more than survived a major change of lead singer and improved upon themselves . Not many , or maybe no other band can claim that . Here they prove they can still rock with the best of them ! Sammy Hagar and the rest of the band give a high energy concert . This will pump you up enough to use as background music to a workout.Eddie Van Halen has been an influential and innovative guitar player when it was thought , after Jimi Hendrix , there was n't any more innovation possible on the guitar . Before seeing this DVD I had heard Alex 's awesome solo before but seeing it I have to say it is amazing he did this with a pretty much bare bones kit . This man is a great drummer.Every Van Halen fan MUST have this DVD . Right NOW ! !	1
It 's as simple as that because basically it 's the only full concert filmed and edited professionally and released to DVD and will be the last one at the rate Van Halen is going ! So buy it and enjoy ! I 've been a huge Van Halen fan since the 80 's and own all of thier material . I personally think this is their best concert of all time . I have a copy of the U.S. Festival and while it is truly a classic , the video is horrible due to the bootlegs . But that 's understandable ! Live without a net is really good , but that whole 80 's era and the overall look of the band is cheesy . Some of that stuff including the clothing is hard to look at because I grew up in that era . There are a couple nice Van Halen concerts that are n't released to DVD that a Van Halen fan may want to get if you have n't had a chance to see them . The pay per view material such as the 1998 Australia concert with Cherone is ok , but again , you can tell Cheron did n't quite fit in . The band tried to make it work , but it was n't there . The only other concert that comes close to right here , right now is the Toronto show on their Balance tour filmed at a jam packed Molson Ampitheatre . Good set list , great sound but the band was a little banged up . Alex was in a neck brace and Eddie was hurting . But the band still sounded tight , they put on a great show and the sound was great . The Balance songs are n't as good as For Unlawful , but it 's still a great show and Eddie 's playing was sharp.But Live Right here right now is some of the best Van Halen concert footage from one of the best bands in the world that you 'll find anywhere . However , the one discouraging thing about it was they took video footage from 2 different nights and edited them together . So for example you have Eddie performing the same solo but notice him wearing different clothing . No big deal because the music is the same and sounds great , but why do that ! The songs they perform are great , the music is fantastic and Eddie 's sound is right on , but what may be the best of all is the fact that the album For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge was their best material top to bottom and it shows in this concert . I 've had it on VHS since it came out several years ago and finally updated to DVD . Not an overall big improvement on the video since it came from VHS , but it beats re-winding and fast forwarding .	1
I think this HBO concert was and still is wonderful . The audio and video look and sound great . Pat Benatar and the band are great . The playlist could have been more varied yet it contains most of her hits at that point in time . It 's a quick set .	1
I 'm not really a big Pat Benatar fan , but I caught this concert years ago on TV and loved it . I had a taped copy that I 've watched many times , and was delighted to find it released on DVD . The first couple of songs are weak admittedly , I think they were obligatory & quot ; Push latest release & quot ; performances . But then the concert slowly starts to build , getting better and better . This is a 'real ' concert , no overdubs , no retakes , no self-indulgent solos . Just drums , guitar , bass , piano and the lady herself . There are a few rough/slow spots , but I can live with that because its also balanced by those magical moments where the band really clicks and the music takes off . Thats what rock and roll is.. magic . If you 're more concerned with video/sound quality than with the performance itself then you may want to pass this one by . My main concern is & quot ; Does it rock ? & quot ; . If it does then the rest does n't matter . The video and sound is acceptable ( ie it does n't get in the way ) , the muscianship is workmanlike , and yes it does rock .	1
Okay , so it 's a 17 year old concert & amp ; the only official one available of La Benatar on the market . However , what this TV Special showcases is the magnitude of Benatar 's sizzlingly raucous & amp ; sweet voice as she strums through megahits up to her Get Nervous multi-platinum album , including grammy-award winning Fire & amp ; Ice , as well as Hit Me With Your Best Shot & amp ; Heartbreaker . What is most surprising about this performance , particularly for lesser fans , is that the album trax are the more astounding performances , both tune-wise and vocally . The title track to Pat 's first album In The Heat of The Night is a blindingly electric and sultry hot in the city type trak and the wondrous single Shadows of The Night sends shivers up your back from the opening guitar chords . Personal faves are the medley I Want Out & amp ; We Live For Love , which really wakens the crowd up & amp ; a rip -roaring rendition of You Better Run , where Pat brutally warns off an offending lover . The eloquent rock track Hell Is For Children unveils the force of Benatar 's voice and ends of a marvellous tour de force performance which reveals Pat at the top of her game . It would have been nice to see Little Paradise which was also included on the VHS version of the show or Promises In The Dark , which was included on the Live ! cd , Live From Earth . Nevertheless , with no other live video chronicles available this is all we have to relish of this legend & amp ; time allowing , you can still appreciate the savvy & amp ; the sheer professionalism which Pat had that have made her the star she is today . A well-recommended purchase	1
hi , just a ditto here to all the other comments about the songs being interrupted by interviews , and no DVD menu option to just play the music , without the inane VH1 interview formatting.anyway , that said , The music IS TRULY GREAT anyway ! The guys are at their best , and given their cumulative mileage , their energy just astounds me ! If you are an older fan ( like me ) and have fond acoustic memories of the original versions of the songs , you will not be disappointed with this performance - it lives up to , and even in places surpasses , the original.fwiw , I personally love Iommi 's restrained and meditative stage presence ! I really admire him for 'just playing ' and channeling the True Power of the Universe ( embodied in the Cross he wears ) , and not doing the usual rock guitarist aerobics . ( just have a voodoo doll handy so when the interview part stops the music , you can rip off the doll 's head pretending it is the producer . This will save your room 's sheetrock walls and your own knuckle skin . ) i would buy again , and recommend to any Black Sabbath fan.the surround sound audio mix is very good , except the bass seems hard to hear in parts .	1
I 've had this DVD on my shelf for a few months , never had the chance to watch it . Finally , on Friday night , I did . GREAT STUFF ! But then again , how could you expect anything less from Black Sabbath.Basically , the DVD shows a concert and interviews with the band at the start of their reunion tour , and all four original guys are there , looking a little older , but only Bill Ward noticably different - he 's chopped off most of that hair and beard and looks like a pretty typical guy-at-the-pub ... except that he 's BILL WARD , the legendary drummer of the greatest band that ever played ! All the members are in fine form , and the songs are great : War Pigs , NIB , Electric Funeral , Fairies Wear Boots , Into the Void , Sweet Leaf , Snoblind , After Forever , Dirty Women , Black Sabbath , Iron Man , Children of the Grave , and Paranoid.Of course , Ozzy is amusing , but it 's also interesting - and scary - to hear about the guys talking about how zonked they were on drugs . Bill claims he ca n't remember anything about the `` Heaven and Hell '' sessions , which is amazing - it 's a great album . There 's an interesting scene when Tony , who 's probably told the story a million times , tells the tale of how his fretting hand was badly mutilated in an industrial accident and then actually shows off the prosthetic fingertips that have allowed him to continue on as one of the really great guitarists of our time . Then there 's some pretty warm joking around , like when they make fun of Bill for claiming that Black Sabbath were poineers . Yep , that 's right , get on the chuckwagon , feed the horses , that kind of ribbing . `` Life and death , man , life and death . `` Learned a few things I did n't know yet , which is basically about how bands that the guys had been in before Black Sabbath were called Rare Breed , and Mythology . Ozzy had attracted Tony and Geezer by putting up a sign that said `` Ozzy Zig requires gig . ''	1
naturally , i have been aware of donna summer and her music for many years , even though i had never actually watched her perform her hits on stage . i caught this show on its original airing on VH1 , and i was completely spell-bound . Her presence on stage , her command of the audience , and , above all , the power and richness of her amazing voice nailed me . Never resorting to impossible-to-sing-along-with vocal gymanastics , unlike most modern-day divas , Ms. Summer just sings the songs the way they should be sung , with power and precision , and a lot of soul . Her performances of 'Someone to Watch Over Me ' and 'If There is Music There ' are awe-inspireing . 'Bad Girls ' and Hot Stuff ' never sounded better , and 'Last Dance ' was extraordinary . This concert should be seen by all wannabees in the dance music industry as proof that there should be first and foremost a voice to carry the song . This wonderful lady is proof of that , she 's a living legend , and has never sounded better in her life !	1
Donna looks amazing and sounds better than ever at this VH1 Special.The DVD has amazing image and sound quality . I own many concert DVDs is this is by far the best-quality one . I 'm warning you ! Turn down your volume before you put it in or your whole house will shake ! ! Donna sings a lot of her old and some new songs . Her voice is incredible . She does n't do much in terms of dancing though and whoever picked her customs should be fired.But the music is great . `` If There 's Music There '' , a song she wrote for her autobiographical musical ( that unfortunately will probably never see the light of day ) , is amazing .	1
Well , what can I add to all the compliments in former reviews ? It 's all true what they say . It 's an outstanding performance , clear and brilliant . Good musicians and good atmosphere . It 's incredible to see how Donna sings through a bunch of her early disco hits as if they have been recorded yesterday ! They sound fresh en untouched by time . Wonderful ballads ( sadly enough not issued on the album ) have to be heard and seen ! It makes me wonder how a DVD recording or the first Live and More ( 1978 ) would have been ! And that voice ... oh my ... that voice . I show this DVD to non Donna fans and they are shocked and grabbed as well by the superb singer Donna . The videoclip of & quot ; I Will Go With You & quot ; is a good bonus . Especially the remix version . Why was n't that to be seen on MTV ? I do not know ... perhaps because the charts are dominated by teens . Also for them this is a 'must see ' . Now it 's your turn to feel some 'summer fever ' and it 's time ! ! : - )	1
VH1 Presents : Live & More Encore ! Donna Summer delivers a great concert . Her voice is fantastic , orchestrations and background singers are terrific . Donna glows with the warmth and charm which made her one of the biggest disco sensations . Her talent has not diminished over the years . This DVD is worth it just for her opening rendition of `` McArthur Park '' and finale of `` Last Dance , '' She looks great in tasteful and flattering costumes . It 's also very nice to see a live audience standing on a dance floor thoroughly enjoying her music . A must buy if you like Donna Summer	1
Absolutely love this concert ! So happy I purchased this dvd . It is a great memory to have , of a true Diva ! Very pleased .	1
An early music DVD release ( 1999 ) but do n't let that put you off . The picture quality and 5.1 surround sound are perfect . We 've all heard of poor 5.1 music DVD 's , but this is extremely natural sounding and you feel like you are actually there.Donna Summer is one of the most gifted female singing artists of our time , and her voice sounds even better in 1999 ! Fans and non-fans will enjoy this show because it includes many of her greatest hits , as well as new music . Also included is the hit & quot ; No More Tears-Enough is Enough & quot ; which she originally recorded as duet with Barbra Streisand . On the DVD , she is joined by Tina Arena for this duet and it is very impressive . Tina Arena has a fantastic voice too . Tina 's career has n't been all that great possibly due to her bad choice of material over the years.Other highlights include a re-working of & quot ; Dim All the Lights & quot ; where Donna reveals the true side of dealing with record companies.I am thrilled that & quot ; On the Radio & quot ; and & quot ; I Feel Love & quot ; are included on the DVD . No sign of & quot ; State of Independence & quot ; but time does n't allow artists to sing all their songs at concerts.I now await a Donna Summer music video clips DVD .	1
This video collection of Madonna 's is absolutly amazing ! I love it . Allot of the videos in the collection are ones I have n't seen in along time . I am so glad that I bought this . This is a video collection that you ca n't refuse .	1
A great follow-up to her THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION home video . THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION home video contains her videos from early 1984 to late 1990 . This incredible home video contains her videos from early 1993 to mid 1999 . I have to say that this home video is a must-have video.BAD GIRLThis has to be one of my favorite videos from Madonna . The video features Madonna as a chain-smoking business woman , who gets off work with a different guy every night . Christopher Walktins plays a strange guardian angel of some sort who goes back in time to see how Madonna 's character was murdered . The video has that BODY OF EVIDENCE/DANGEROUS GAME theme.FEVERThis is another single from the EROTICA album , but it was not released here in the U.S . However , Madonna did shoot a music video for it and it 's an unbelievable music video . One scene features Madonna with a short red wig on , wearing a tight red tank top and flashing pants , where she stands in front of a blood red background . The next scene features Madonna in a short orange wig with a strange gold skirt , standing in front of that same red background . The third would be Madonna wearing a long orange wig , wearing nothing but two flowers to cover her chest and a lily to cover her privatesRAINWhen I first heard this song , I was amazed at how nice it was and I wondered if she had released it as a single . I found out that she did and I always wanted to see the video . I finally got the chance when I got this home video . The video features Madonna , in a short black wig , as an actress in a Japanese film . My favorite scene is wear she is standing between to thin walls that have water flowing down them . It 's a real nice scene.SECRETAlthough I love the song , the video lacks creativity.TAKE A BOWFirst off , I have always loved this song . And who would n't love it ? It was a major hit , becoming another # 1 hit and it stayed at the # 1 spot for seven weeks . The video is not that great , but she really blew me away with her looks in this one . She looked the prettiest when she was rubbing her hands all over the television.BEDTIME STORYThis has to be her weirdest video ever . The song is called Bedtime Story , but the video is a Bedtime Story that will give children nightmares . The most weirdest scene is at the end . It features Madonna with reversed facial features . She has two mouths where her eyes are supposed to be and she has one eye where her mouth is supposed to be . The two mouths are singing the last line of the song . You want a weird video ? This is it.HUMAN NATUREFirst off , great song . She is actually trying to say to the critics that she is not sorry for making the EROTICA album , she is not sorry for making the SEX book , and she 's not sorry for starring the very sexual BODY OF EVIDENCE . She 's telling everyone to `` shut the f*ck up and let me perform the way I want to perform '' . In other words , `` It 's human nature '' .LOVE DO N'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE ( REMIX ) Madonna actually recorded this song in 1984 . It can be found on her LIKE A VIRGIN album . When that album came out , Madonna did not release it as a single . In 1995 , she released SOMETHING TO REMEMBER , her greatest ballads compilation . This song appeared on there . She then decided to release it as a single . The video is not much because she was real busy shooting EVITA . So , she just did a simple video where she stayed in one place as the camera spent half of the song slowly zooming in on her and spent the last quarter of the song slowly zooming out.FROZENAwesome video . The video features Madonna in the Mujave Desert in California . The physical tone of the video is very dim , like a gothic-night time look . Madonna is featured in a long , pitch-black wig and a pitch-black dress . Her hands are covered with henna tattoos . Very creep , but amazing.RAY OF LIGHTAlthough , I love the song , the video is somehow not that impressive.DROWNED WORLD ( SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE ) Although the single was released in the states , the video , however , was not . She wanted to do a video that fit the concept of the song . She had the feeling that the critics would bother her for what the video was trying to say , despite the fact that was being shown in the video was not true . So , she decided to release the video in Europe.THE POWER OF GOOD-BYEI never , ever understood this one.NOTHING REALLY MATTERSWhen I first saw this video , I was like , `` What the hell is this '' ? Then I recognized the song and the voice . This is yet another weird video , but I love it . Madonna takes up two different looks in the video . The first time you see her , she 's in a black and green dress . Her hair is pitch black and pulled into a ponytail . Her face is painted pale white , with red make-up across her eyes . Then you see her in a red Japanese robe , with pitch black hair , let down , and her eye brows dyed red.BEAUTIFUL STRANGERAnother massive hit from Madonna . It was the main theme to AUSTIN POWERS : THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME , the second installment to the AUSTIN POWERS series . The video and song fit the movie perfectly . AUSTIN himself appears in the video .	1
At the dawn of the 1990 's , Madonna released `` The Immaculate Collection '' , a compilation of her hits from 1982-1990 , and along with it came a video collection , which was inevitably released on DVD in 1999.At the twilight of the 90 's , November 1999 to be exact , Madonna released a companion piece DVD chronicling her video work from 1993-1999 and it became another essential Madonna video collection , even though it leaves off a few essential 90 's Madonna videos ( Justify My Love , Erotica and Deeper And Deeper ) .1 . Bad Girl - while the song was not a hit upon first release in early 1993 , the video has become a true classic , one of her finest storytelling videos where Madonna plays the tragic lead of the story2 . Fever - this one was totally for the clubs , we see an orange-haired Madonna here3 . Rain - Madonna pays homage to Japanese culture here4 . Secret - Madonna walks the streets of Harlem in a sexy , sweet black and white video . This is the album version and not the Junior Vasquez mix video that MTV also played.5 . Take A Bow - Madonna goes to Spain and falls in love with a Matador , one of her biggest hits ! 6 . Bedtime Story - the earliest traces of electronica Madonna , a very cool video7 . Human Nature - Madonna in leather dancing around , another classic video and frankly the last time we really saw her cutting loose before motherhood came along and settled her down8 . Love Do n't Live Here Anymore - shot during the making of Evita , a very pregnant Madonna is glowing9 . Frozen - dark , gothic and wonderful video that ushered in a whole new Madonna10 . Ray Of Light - the VMA winning video that chronicles an entire day in 5 minutes11 . Drowned World/Substitute For Love - very controversial at the time of filming because of the recent passing of Princess Diana , this video is another masterpiece where Madonna really points out the highs and lows of celebrity , and how many Lourdes changed her perspective on life12 . The Power Of Goodbye - ER fans like this one because Goran Visnjic 's in it , but otherwise not all that memorable13 . Nothing Really Matters - inspired by Memoirs Of A Geisha but MTV viewers assumed it was a Marilyn Manson knockoff , a great video14 . Beautiful Stranger - Austin Powers was huge at the time and Madonna did the theme song for the second film of the series , Madonna and Austin really let loose and it 's a cute , classic video that was a huge hit for her.If you have The Immaculate Collection , this is definately needed as a companion piece . Hopefully at the end of this decade , we 'll get a third video collection chronicling the videos from Music , American Life , Confessions On A Dance Floor and whatever else she has yet to deliver this decade .	1
This tape has all her videos from 1992-1999 . It also has the infamous Erotica video and the brand new Beautiful Stranger so when it comes out , get it !	1
The videos from Madonna 's album Ray of Light are well worth the price of this DVD alone . They are great videos , especially Frozen . Beautiful Stranger is fun too . This is a great addition to any DVD collection .	1
Madonna is a brilliant artistic musician ... her videos are amazing ... & # 34 ; Take a Bow & # 34 ; by far is the best Madonna video and single to date ... the song captures elegance and beauty even if you are not watching the video ... the video has a timeless feel to it.. this video never gets old ... the only thing i dont like about this and the first madonna video collection is that where is the greatest video & # 34 ; justify my love & # 34 ; & # 62 ; ? I think it is about time to release that video and show people what is part of music video history . Let them see what the big deal was and still is ... .But nowadays , people get so offended so fast they dont want to know the whole story behind the story ... but that is just me ... .Other big huge videos on here is & # 34 ; frozen & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; ray of light & # 34 ; & # 34 ; beautiful stranger & # 34 ; , and & # 34 ; human nature & # 34 ; Madonna if you are reading please release a full complilation of all your videos including 'justify my love ' ... .Your still one of music videos queens ...	1
EXCELLENT RECOPILATION OF MADONNA , EXCELLENT VIDEO QUALITY BUT THE SOUND WAS REALLY POOR HOW COME IT DOES NOT HAVE DOLBY 5.1 ? . SO TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT . CUASE WHEN YOU BUY YOU WANT THE BEST AND IN THIS CASE IT WAS N'T ...	1
With a spectacular cover photography by David LaChapelle , Madonna 's & quot ; 93:98 Video Collection , & quot ; is a great addition to any music lover 's collection . As a pioneer of daring , thought-provoking videos , Madonna has always been on the forefront of creating styles and opinions.On this video collection , most ( but not all ) of Madonna 's videos produced in the past decade are included for everyone 's viewing pleasure . While such videos as & quot ; Bedtime Story , & quot ; are amazing when it comes to their composition and imagination , others like & quot ; Love Do n't Live Here Anymore , & quot ; are simple in their theme and imagery.I was disappointed in the same way I was with her prior video collection , that some videos were omitted from the compilation . If she was able to add a live performance of & quot ; Vogue , & quot ; on the & quot ; Immaculate Collection & quot ; compilation , she could have added more to this collection . Videos such as & quot ; You 'll See , & quot ; & quot ; Erotica , & quot ; & quot ; Justify My Love , & quot ; and & quot ; This Use to Be My Playground , & quot ; which were released during the 1990 's have been totally omitted , which is a complete shame . However , the video that I was looking forward in seeing , & quot ; I Want You , & quot ; was also ommitted . This video , which was based on the short theatrical piece & quot ; La Voix Humaine , & quot ; revolves around a woman awaiting for a call from her lover who has left her . In what I consider a very powerful ( and long ) video , Madonna portrays a woman exhausted by the long wait . Filmed in black & amp ; white , this is one of her most moving videos.Another two things I would have to see on this collection would have been the option to see the lyrics appear on the screen , in addition to motion menus that allows the viewer to get a preview of each video before actually playing it ( similar to the motion menus on the & quot ; Matrix & quot ; DVD ) . In conclusion , I hope whenever Madonna releases her new video compilation ( which most likley will include the videos from her upcoming album & quot ; Music , & quot ; and videos made in between ( & quot ; American Pie & quot ; ) , I hope she decides to also add all the videos she omitted in the prior two releases , so that her fans can enjoy them as much as the first time we saw them on television .	1
Madonna videos are 10000000 times better than marilyn manson videos .	1
This DVD only has 14 song videos and no extras , but that 's fine . I practically love every video here . And this is unusual for me because I do n't usually care for any kind of pop music since probably about 1986 . But , Madonna was definitely an important icon of eighties pop music . I love all of Madonna 's pop hits of the eighties so , of course , I have her Immaculate Collection on CD . However , I had to pass on her first music video collection , the Immaculate Collection of the eighties . I 'm sorry but it just seems that that video collection is directed more towards women and gays . Plus I did n't care for the visual concept she created for `` Like a Prayer '' . I love the song , I even envisioned Madonna creating some sort of video with sexy scantily clad nuns , which would have created even more controversy that would upset the church . Usually I like videos and songs that put God and sex together as if sex and religion belong together . I believe sexual decadence could be a religion in itself . Spirituality , sexual exploitation and the joy of life can easily be one and the same . Choosing sexual control and denial of your inner perverse fantasies is like not appreciating God 's gift of tapping into all your errogenous zones . If God did n't want you to explore them , then He would n't have given them to you to explore . Some people think that being religious means that you must make sacrifices and be miserable.Whoa ... ..sorry , I think drifted there.Anyway , this DVD video collection of `` Madonna : 93:99 '' is a fabulous collection of song and video . Madonna looks different in nearly every video . She has so many different hairstyles and a vast wardrobe of unique costumes . If I could put a woman to represent my idea of sex and religion , it would be Madonna.1 . `` Bad Girl '' Stars Christopher Walken as an angel watching over Madonna and her failed get togethers with men . Ending with a lover that takes her life . Nice dark theme,2 . `` Fever '' This is her take on a Peggy Lee classic.3 . `` Rain '' Madonna with shorter hair . Classy and sexy.4 . `` Secret '' My least favotite video . I do n't much care for this sort of black and white video . There seems to be some unspoken gay themes to this one . And it gets confusing when she throws herself into the video with a man and child.5 . `` Take a Bow '' A cool bullfighter video.6 . `` Bedtime Story '' A real cool kinda gothic dark video.7 . `` Human Nature '' To me , probably the third least interesting video here . I could n't help but notice that Bollywood stole some of this video concept for their movie `` Pyaar Tune Kya Kia '' . They have a sexy song video called `` Kambakth Ishq '' starring Urmila Matondkar and Fardeen Khan . Look for this song video ( maybe on `` You Tube '' and you 'll see what I mean ) .8 . `` Love Do n't Live Here Anymore '' An older song with a brownish marble room art fantasy , but nothing too impressive with visual effects.9 . `` Frozen '' Now here 's one of the four songs of Madonna 's `` Ray of Light '' CD which was produced by William Orbit '' . On this album , the music is more important than Madonna . But , Madonna and William Orbit together was just magic . `` Frozen '' is another dark gothic video with cool special effects and excellent dark techno electronica.10 . `` Ray of Light '' is my absolute favorite song from Madonna . But , just like `` Like a Prayer '' , I like the song alone , I 'm not to crazy about this video , although it does have that sort of `` Koyaanisqatsi '' fast paced world video effect.11 . `` Drowned World/Substitute for Love '' A video of Madonna struggling with fame , and trying to find time to wind down and enjoy motherhood.12 . `` The Power of Goodbye '' Beautiful beach style video . This song was also the theme for that limited appeal defunct TV show `` Felicity '' .13 . `` Nothing Really Matters '' . The fourth song of this DVD of songs from the CD `` Ray of Light '' . I love the song but the video was kinda weird . Madonna dressed as a geisha . She actually looked like a guy trying to dress like a girl . She was n't very pretty at all . Although , in this video , she does wear a more simplified red kabuki dress . Another thing freaky about this video are all the Japanese retards used in the video . So , this is my second least favorite video on this collection , behind `` Secret '' .14 . `` Beautiful Stranger '' I 'd never own , or ever sit through another `` Austin Powers '' movie , but it 's nice to own something with Austin Powers in it . Madonna continues to show , even in her forties , that she is still quite a sexy girl . Too bad I could n't get a short cameo of Elizabeth Hurley , but I guess she was in the previous Austin Powers film.I do n't need to own any of these songs on CD . I 'd rather watch her videos for this era of her career .	1
She has the best music videos , so why not own them ? Another must have !	1
This wonderful collection of videos were hand-picked by Madonna , and signify why she is one of the greats . Do n't you just love the way she changes her look , over and over . This DVD is a fine accompanying piece to the Ultimate Collection DVD - although as with that one , it is also misses several videos . The obvious ones are the first two singles from this era ( well from 1992 to be precise ) - `` Erotica '' and `` Deeper and Deeper '' which is a pity because they were great videos . MAdonna probably no longer likes them and asked that they not be included . Also missing are videos for '' You 'll See '' and `` I 'll Remember '' . Still , what 's on offer are 14 of the best ... and with plenty of re-watch factor , you ca n't go past this gem .	1
This is a state of the art DVD production with great performances , The picture and sound quality are excellent . What is more important Eric and the ban seem to be having a good time , even Bob Dylan smiles at one point . What a band ! I understand that a lot of footage shot at the show was cut from the final product , perhaps we can have a special edition with the complete show . If you like Clacton you will not be disappointed .	1
I adore Clapton , and own all of his DVD 's . I have to rate this one at the bottom of the list , though it is worth the purchase just to get the rare & quot ; Little Wing & quot ; performance . He uses the same arrangement/approach that the Dominos used , and it is good . After that , I have to agree with the other reviews here that critise the choices of selections from the concert that ended up on the DVD . I would really enjoy seeing the songs that were deleted , rather than the great , but oft repeated warhorses like & quot ; Sunshine of Your Love & quot ; , and yet another & quot ; Tears in Heaven. & quot ; There are just so many wonderful choices in his past repetoire that he NEVER performs now like & quot ; Strange Brew & quot ; , & quot ; Forever Man & quot ; , or & quot ; I Am Yours & quot ; that would be precious to many of his fans ! But to avoid misunderstanding , I must say that what is here is predominantly great . ( The only blatant exception being the horror of what is done to the usually poignant & quot ; Old Love & quot ; by a keyboardist that I have never seen with him before . I & quot ; skip & quot ; over that song always ! ) The guests are somewhat unusual , though mostly pleasing . Sheryl Crow is fine , Bob Dylan is excellent , Dave Sanborn is probably good , ( I rarely take note of horns ) , but the Mary Blige section is , ... well , ... unexpected ! .Clapton 's backing band is mostly the same folks that are usually with him ; Andy Fairweather-Low , Steve Gadd , and Nathan East with Katie Kissoon & amp ; Tessa Niles . They are always enjoyable to hear . ( He later dropped the girls from his 2002 tour , and I missed them on & quot ; One More Car & quot ; /Rider ) . I have read that he sometimes determines his song selections according to the capabilities of his backing group . If that is so , then I would appreciate a little variety in the players he recruits - time is moving on , and I would love to hear/see him do some of the afformentioned tunes before he hangs up his new , graphic strat forever !	1
It 's Clapton , so you ca n't go wrong . However , if you looking for the quality and variety of the Crossroads Concerts then just buy those . This is a preview of what he was shooting for with those concerts ( It 's all about helping people to get their lives back in order from abuses ) . The music is solid , but not a blues oriented as the following concerts would be .	1
. . . in the Crossroads benefit concert series , I wanted it to complete my collection . Not bad . . . not bad at all .	1
I have watched this DVD very often . It 's one of the best Clapton Concerts I 've seen . I have a number of Clapton concert DVDs and all are great but this is at the top of them for me .	1
I agree that Amazon 's editorial about this DVD is weird and off-base . Why compare Sarah to Julie Andrews ( who I also love ) ? It 's an apples vs. oranges type of comparison . Sarah Brightman is the top-selling performer in her class , so why would she follow in the footsteps of Julie Andrews ? Strange . Anyway , Sarah fans should be very happy to own One Night in Eden . The concert is very well done , as is the camera work . There are plenty of close-ups , so her male devotees can bask in her radiant beauty . Sarah may have performed some of the songs a hundred or more times , but you almost tangibly sense the extent to which she puts her heart into each number . When singing , Sarah goes into some other-worldly state , clearly focused on the deepest essence of every song . With her British-perfect , pale complexion , long , dark , curly hair , and the eyes the size of a doll 's , she 's a physical work of art -- even if one were to subtract her voice completely . What I found most interesting were Sarah 's comments about her work , her creative and artistic mind that remains open to seemingly almost any new idea . In her remarks , she confesses to being a life-long and unflappable optimist , and I think this inner , positive energy is what we partially view ( and are enthralled by ) as an audience . She genuinely loves the exploration of new avenues of expression . And , best of all , I found her personality to be 100 % genuine -- no false airs , no pretensions , no vanity -- just a natural , charming , intelligent spirit . This inner nucleus , spinning around a wonder-lust of possibilities , a girlish naivete interwoven with all things being possible , must ( to some extent ) account for the woman appearing half her age . Buy the DVD and see if you pick up on this miraculous and precious vibrancy . She 's a gift .	1
I am a big GM fan . The clips from MTV unplugged are well worth the price of the DVD .	1
In an industry where good looks and talent do n't often go together , it 's great to see George have the success he so richly deserves . What a talent ! His vocal abilities are mind-blowing -- I 'm sure I 'm not the only guy who wishes he could sing like him ! -- , his songwriting skills are sharp and insightful , and he knows how to put on a show ( on video and on stage ) .This DVD , with a few exceptions , is a great retrospective of his work so far . From his beginnings as a teen idol ( I 'm old enough to remember when & quot ; Careless Whisper & quot ; had the girls swooning ) to the more mature and socially-conscious messenger that he is today . Not all the videos work , let 's agree that some are boring , but most are superbly entertaining . The first video , & quot ; Outside & quot ; , is a trip indeed and is quite an aural and visual treat . You 'll remember that one for a long time ! Technically , the DVD is excellent . The images are crisp and the sound is clear and loud . One exception is with & quot ; Careless Whisper & quot ; , which I feel could have been digitally remastered since the video is somewhat grainy compared to the others and the sound is a tad lower on this one . But this is minor and really does n't detract from this classic song.The bonus BBC interviews and performances are excellent . The interview shows George as a very comfortable-with-himself person with a great sense of humor.Well worth owning .	1
George michael maybe strange ... but hes a superstar of quite astonishing talent ... this dvd shows everything he has to offer from his talents ... nothing to fault on this dvd ... even a extra chat with Parkinson on BBC TV ..good value ... . good sound quality ... . go buy it !	1
I am absolutely thrilled about the fact that DVD edition is so much better than VHS one . I mean , I love GM 's videos ( except for Monkey ) , so VHS was very good , too . But , how nice it is to see the BBC interview , too ! I have heard this interview on the radio , but was very eager to see it ... .It is very funny ! DVD also has one more track-Older . The overall DVD quality is superb and the amazon.com price is excellent , too . My only regret is that we were , once again , not to see & quot ; As & quot ; ( good video , by the way ) , and & quot ; Roxanne & quot ; ( which is once again banned in States as of now , I guess ) . Well , we 'll probably have to wait for another tape to be released altogether . Let 's be patient and wait , once again , for GM deserves that ...	1
this gives you the inside scoop . Metallica fans will love it because it 's got it all - behind the scenes footage , interviews , recording sessions , and concert footage . But anybody who 's ever wanted to live the rock & roll life ( and do it successfully ) will get a great insight into how much hard work it takes . The first half of the DVD covering the recording of the `` Black Album '' is worth the price alone . After seeing this , you 'll know what it 's really like to be in the studio and how gruelling it can be . No wonder Lars has an attitude about people ripping their songs of the internet ! The concert footage is awesome - it 's what you 'd expect from Metallica . These guys are talented musicians , cool dudes , and funny . As always , Metallica gives you your money 's worth - this is a long DVD . I suggest watching it over a 2-night period to attain maximum absorbtion . Buy it . Watch it . Crank it Loud , and Rock On !	1
I can not recommend this enough . I 'll try to keep it brief ! All singing and acting is close to perfect . The directing is , to say the least , imaginative and well-conceived.My only beef ( which prevents the 5th star ) is with the conductor : his tempos repeatedly fail to square with the score , and the orchestra seems woodwind-heavy under his baton.Buy it ? Yes , siree.Definitive version ? Probably not.P.S . buy a libretto , because the English subtitles are tremendously inaccurate	1
When I watched Luhrmann 's more recent film , Moulin Rouge , it was fun to recognize the large & quot ; L'Amour & quot ; sign from Act I of this opera production.I 've used this version of Boheme to introduce friends to opera . It 's a very entertaining production , and looks great on DVD . There are occsional minor lip-synch problems but not enough to be truly distracting.The DVD has the bonus of removable English subtitles so both opera fans and newcomers to the work can get maximum enjoyment from the disc .	1
La Boheme : What an unbelievable work by Puccini : surely the opening theme must be one of the greatest melodies of all time . It moves me near to tears : To think anyone could imagine music this beautiful and be able to write it down for others to hear for time eternal.The scene is Paris 1957 . The 2 main actors are young and handsome : someone you could really believe to be falling in love . But the best parts are the acting qualities of the singers and what voices ! ! ! ! In particular , David Hobson as Rodolfo : his rendition of `` che gelida manina '' will make the hair on the back of the neck stand up and salute ! When done well , it must be one of a handful of great tenor arias in all of opera.Cheryl Baker does an excellent job as Mimi . A great voice and her death scene in the end is very moving.This production done by the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra is a fine example of an excellent use of people and resources . Filmed before a live audience ( really the only way great opera should be recorded ) we actually see stagehands moving the sets , and yet they do not distract from the magic that is happening but instead are part of the drama unfolding before you.The only unrealistic part of the entire performance was the audience : Silent , except for an occasional cough , they sat on their hands if they were watching paint dry . Did they not see the unbelievable performances that were unfolding before them ? I mean , is that not the purpose of live theatre ? ? : Audience reaction to great performances : If I had been an actor on that stage I would have been so disappointed : wondering what we were doing wrong . Maybe the audience was instructed not to clap or shout until the end of a scene , but if that is the case why even bother to perform it live.A wonderful disc ; I would n't hesitate to recommend it .	1
This is a wonderful ... .simply rapturous staging of La Boheme . These singing actors put to shame the ancient Stand and Sing tradtion in Opera.First I will voice what few reservations I have about the prodution.Although there is no problem with the transfer to 1950 's France , the english translation is sparce , it leaves out jokes and wordplays , and taks alot of liberties . But this is forgivable.Vocally Marcello ( Roger Lemke ) has a thin and unattractive top voice . He makes up for this by being a very convincing characher with an exrtremely cool stage deportment.David Hobson as Rudolpho sounds very much like Juan Diego Florez with a piercing Rossinian tone . He delivers the top notes with great ease.David Lemke 's huge baritone makes for a excellent Schunard . Gary Rowley is a hillarious colline , the coat song is , however rushed.Cheryl Barker is a good Mimi , a touch spread at the top , but very effective . Christine Douglas is a wonder Musetta with a generously sized voice.Musically this production does not stand out from the pack . Its value as a production , however , is inestimable . The acting is on another level and the staging is so intricate . It is moving to see such involved stage action . It is a stark contrast to the immovable Pavarotti ( Who is undoubtedly a more gifted tenor ) who can not seem to identify with his characters . Carreras and Stratas , on the met Boheme , compete with this production with their convincing acting , but for this generation Baz Lurhmans Boheme has a more profound impact . it is a matter of personal taste whether you prefer the sensitive drama of classic Pucinni or baz 's in your face realism . Either way , the updating of Boheme really brings home its importance as a work . It really works ! ! ! ! This is a must have !	1
I do n't like Tennessee Williams ... such dull , dreary characters . And much of Previn 's music seems contrived . But the music and drama both go over the top when Futral seduces a seemingly stoic Gilfry ... ... the music is minimal , yet so sensuous . Futral sings so lightly , more like purring . Hot as it gets ... Yet sex is not the end , only the means for control . As Futral approaches orgasmic intensity , Gilfry grins at Rene . He 's got the power ... and he 's letting Rene know it ... ... ..big time .	1
This is a really cool videotape , but it is very short . This is n't the official Slipknot home video , but it does a good job , it 's no filler , all killer . Buy this video as soon as you can , OK , jerky ?	1
I was a little dissapointed when i watched this movie for the first time . I thought it could have been a lot better with some better interviews , and some more vidoes . It does have 3 great videos on it , one of them being the awesome & quot ; spit it out & quot ; which is a great song , and when combined with a great video based on the movie & quot ; The Shining & quot ; it makes it even better . If you are a Slipknot fan , this movie is a must !	1
This video is excellent ! I recommend this to anyone that 's a new fan or even an old fan like myself . Why ? BECAUSE YOU SHOULD ! Hell , you have the posters , you have the CD 's , hopefully you avoided that & quot ; Behind the Mask DVD & quot ; like herpes and really , what else could you spend a little money on ? I got ta admit it 's only 20 some minutes long but it 's still worth it . Seriously , go up to the top of the page , click the mouse on the button that says buy it . You know you want to .	1
Ok , I just read some of the others ' reviews of this product , and a lot did not seem to like it , etc . I remember one reviewer even saying it was lacking in concert footage ? ? ? Hey , watch the second half of this , it 's packed full of concert footage ! Ok , maybe it 's not packed full of full concert footage , but this is bacially a documentary , not a concert dvd . Not to cut some down here , but if some do n't like this , for whatever reason , I would like to see some of you make your own Kiss documentary , and release it nationally , to see if some of you can do a better job . Ok , some of you probably could , but I hope you understand what I am saying . I have liked Kiss since the age of 9 , and am now 36 . I grew up with Kiss . Yes , I have even met them . Personally , I thought this was the better of the video products Kiss released . If you do n't like Kiss for whatever Reason , step out of the way , and let the ultimate rock and roll machine Roll on !	1
Although you will find 3 or 4 songs here , this dvd is mostly about the process developed for the reunion tour , just after the original Kiss played the Unplugged concert . From rehearsals to costume fitting , to traveling and touring , this DVD is a great documentary on the return of the once great KISS . Although I still love their music , their merchantilism seems to know no boundaries [ Kiss Kasket , anyone ? ] and has made me step away from them over the years , in favor of real muscicians . Still , if you were a kid or teen in the 70 's , you will relive those great times of makeup and rock & roll , now with a few extra pounds .	1
This is a documentary about the reunion of the hottest band in the world ! After a brief review of what Kiss had done prior to their reunion , it starts with Peter Criss rejoining the band for a song at a convention . Then it leads to the Unplugged concert with both Peter and Ace Frehley joining the band and continues to follow KISS through out their re-union tour . It ends with promotions for what will be the KISS ' Psycho Circus CD . Most buyers will be disappointed with the lack of concert footage but you can get plenty of that with Kissology Volume I ( 1974 - 1977 ) . If you do n't have Kissology Volume I ( 1974 - 1977 ) , I strongly recommend getting it first . Kissology Volume I ( 1974 - 1977 ) definitely rocks ! Anyway , if you love the original KISS , this DVD is still a worth while investment . It is great seeing this documentation of Gene , Paul , Peter and Ace getting together again and the reaction of KISS fans through out the world.Note : This DVD contains some footage that may not be appropriate for children .	1
You ca n't go wrong here . These ladies show you what great character studie looks like . Just Elaine Strich alone is worth every penny .	1
If you like musicals , run out and buy this now . So many brilliant moments ... chief among these is Linda Eder 's & quot ; Man of La Mancha & quot ; . Despite someone 's comment that she did not play this role previously ( DUH ! ) , she delivers a performance that is sure to cause goosebumps . Also , do n't miss Nell Carter 's & quot ; Mean to Me & quot ; , Jennifer Holliday 's & quot ; And I am Telling You I 'm Not Going & quot ; , Audra McDonald 's & quot ; Down With Love & quot ; , and Elaine Stritch brilliantly screeching her way through & quot ; Ladies Who Lunch & quot ; ( she may not have a great voice , but DAMN , she can perform ! ) .	1
To be honest the only reason I bought this DVD was for Jennifer Holliday and I was not disapointed , what a voice , what a performence a well deserved standing ovation . I would have given anything to have been in the audience . Having watched the whole show ( I 've never heard of some of the ladies here in the U.K. ) I was amazed at the other perfomances , the highlights being Linda Eder , Andrea McArdle and the Andrew Lloyd Webber Love Trio ( Audra McDonald , Marin Mazzie & amp ; Judy Kuhn ) , it 's worth watching for these perfomances as well , and I love Debra Monk singing 'Everybody 's Girl ' ( love the lyrics ) it makes me smile everytime I hear/see it . As to Elaine Stritch , on the CD it does n't come across well but when you watch her you see the enjoyment she has and that lifts it and makes it more enjoyable . The only dissapointment : that was that Jennifer Holliday did n't sing anything else she should have been on longer .	1
One song each makes you want more ! The song selection is not the best each has done , but they are all fabulous singers no matter what the song .	1
This is an incredible special . The singing , gowns , and staging is simply incredible . Each performer walks onstage and sings her signature song.Some lesser known , yet highly talented performers are featured here - Marrin Mazzie , who delivers a sweet performance of & quot ; Bewitched , Bothered ... & quot ; and Dee Hoty is revengeful with & quot ; Could I Leave You ? & quot ; from FOLLIES.Karen Ziemba is a wonderful dancer/singer and gets things rolling at the beginning with the talented Bebe Neuwirth in a dance from CHICAGO . But I prefer Ziemba 's charming & quot ; I Wan na Be A Rockette & quot ; near the end of the show.My absolute favorites are Audra McDonald and Andrea McArdle . McDonald is such an incredible performer who deserves a Broadway show ! Her version of & quot ; Down With Love & quot ; is full of such energy and talent that I almost forgot Streisand 's version ! McDonald sings it with hilarious & quot ; My Man & quot ; , & quot ; He Touched Me & quot ; and & quot ; Music That Makes Me Dance & quot ; lyrics . She is really incredible . And Andrea McArdle cleverly reigns herself in and sings a touching , quiet version of & quot ; Tomorrow & quot ; from ANNIE . She has such a great voice -- her cameo in the ANNIE TV movie was a surprise , and she sounded great ! My one qualm with the show is Liza Minnelli 's performance . Watch this one -- I could swear they 've done some post-performance dubbing on her vocals . The whole & quot ; Some People & quot ; song seems dubbed.I wish Betty Buckley , Bernadette Peters or Chita Rivera had appeared . But the quality of the performances makes this show a hit ! I really enjoyed it . The DVD features chapters for each song . Thanks , Ladies !	1
This DVD is a real keeper for any Broadway lover . Every performance is first-rate ( althought Liza Minnelli certainly looked and sounded better in her younger years ) . The enthusiasm of these first-rate female Broadway stars is infectious , giving this viewer many hours of pure joy . Production values are superb , as is the choice of performers and songs . First rate all the way .	1
I gave this show 4 stars because of Linda Eder 's fantastic performance . I showed it to my wife and it made her cry . I was stunned that another reviewer negatively criticized her , but then again he loved Elaine Stritch 's performance , which was embarrassingly bad . Also great performances by Jennifer Holliday and Karen Ziemba .	1
This is from a live performance at Vienna State Opera in 1992 . Very dark staging . Very good musical performance . Very morbid story ... . compounded by the lack of subtitle ( you 've better know the story before hand or understand Russian ) .All the principals are wonderful . Vladimir Atlantov owned 'Hermann ' and is most convincing . I dislike this character , but Atlantov is so compelling that I have to keep watching . He has big voice and he uses it well . Mirella Freni sounds 10 years younger than she looks and is a sympathetic 'Lisa . ' Vladimir Chernov is also a very handsomely sung 'Prince Yeletsky ' and sneers very royally . The young Vesselina Kasarova makes good impression in the cameo of 'Pauline ' , though dances a bit awkwardly ( who cares ... , nothing awkward comes out of her mouth when she sings ) .But the opera stealer is Martha Moedl 's 'Old Countess ' . Utterly shockingly creepy ... the voice is shredded but the way she uses it is strangely haunting ... and as hoarse as it is , it carries somehow.Very good performance of a morbidly haunting opera . No subtitle , though ... and mine does n't come with any synopsis either .	1
If you love smooth jazz , with an emphasis on smooth , then you must be aware of the band called FOURPLAY . This live recording is proof-positive of the genius of each member of this extraordinary band . Harvey Mason makes playing the drums look effortless and reminds everyone of us when we first discovered how much fun it seemed being a drummer must be . Bob James is the reference standard for today 's would-be jazz pianist , and this DVD shows off his talent very well . Nathan East and Lee Ritenour are dazzling in their performances as are the guests , Phillip Bailey , Phil Perry , and none other than CHAKA KAHN ! This DVD is a & quot ; Must-Have & quot ; for anyone who enjoys seeing and hearing great , smooth , contemporary jazz .	1
I like Sheryl Crow , even though I 've never bought any of her CDs . But after I heard her perform one of her songs on a TV awards show recently , I decided to purchase this DVD of one of her live performances . It is , in a word , superb ! Sheryl Crow and her band sound great in this DVD , and they perform most of her big hits as well as many of the songs from her recent Globe Sessions CD . And if you have a subwoofer , oh boy are you in for a treat ! Furthermore , if your amplifier and DVD player support DTS sound , then by ALL means use it ! The DTS mix on this DVD blows away the Dolby Digital mix and sounds even better with the sub-woofer . I very highly recommend this DVD to any Sheryl Crow fans ; trust me , you will wo n't be disappointed ! It 's better than having front row seats , really !	1
Big Money Hustlas is probably the best B rated movie I have ever seen . The humor is fantastic , the action is fast and all the actors can act ! I 've seen some major budget movies that are a lot worse than this . Needless to say , I love it . If you are n't a fan of ICP , odds are that you wo n't find anything in this movie . Do n't know if it is the Shaggy/Missy love scene or Violent J doing his thing , but the movie is just awesome .	1
Look out conseratives ; hide your daughters ! The Wicked Clowns have arrived to your door once again , only this time they 're going to the movies ! Specifically made as a dirty love letter to devoted Juggalos everywhere , `` Big Money Hustlas '' is a crude yet hilariously funny film that 's chockfull of Faygo , glazed donuts , gun violence , Magic Ninjas , double-D implants , hardcore wrestling and , of course , lots of hip-hop street slang . It also pays homage to the Blaxploitation flicks of the mid-70 's . Solely written by Joseph Bruce ( AKA Violent J of ICP ) , `` Big Money '' stars his own rap partner Shaggy 2 Dope as Sugar Bear , a funky , rhyme-talking cop who struts his way out of the 1970 's and into the ghetto streets of present-day New York . Aided by the Police Department 's overweight , donut-eating Chief ( Johnny Brennan ) and a cowardly Rookie named Harry Cox ( Harland Williams ) , Sugar Bear strolls through all of New York to battle criminals and bring justice to the innocent . Violent J , meanwhile , revels in his villanous role as Big Baby Sweets , a powerful and nasty crime lord who posseses all of New York in his backpocket . He , along with his potty-mouth yes-men Big Stank & Lil ' Poot ( Twiztid ) and silent assasin Hack Benjamin ( Jumpsteady ) , assembles a rough , tough crew of thugs and gangstas to rob New York City of every dollar it has ! Will the smooth-talking Sugar Bear have enough wits to stop him ? ! Tune in to find out ! WARNING : THIS FILM ALSO DISPLAYS STEREOTYPIC IMAGES OF WOMEN , PREACHERS , POLICE OFFICERS AND THE OBESE . PROCEED WITH CAUTION.I must also comment that when I originally viewed `` Big Money Hustlas '' from beginning to end , I of course was extremely offended by the overall content . However , over time I watched the film again ... and again ... and again . Soon enough , I myself became addicted to this movie , even though I 'm not yet a full-fledged Juggalette . What I really enjoy the most from `` Big Money Hustlas '' is how Violent J and Twiztid are standing face-to-face with the camera while shouting out their lines ; it was as if they were speaking DIRECTLY TO THE JUGGALOS ! In general `` Big Money Hustlas '' is a top notch cult classic that pushes itself far beyond the social borders of obscenity ... and it 's obvious that everyone at Psychopathic had lots of fun doing it ! Nevertheless , I urge all fledgling Juggalos to NOT watch it while their parents are in the next room !	1
I 've been a fan of insane clown posse for quite some time . When I heard they made a movie , I new I was going to get it . I really enjoyed this movie . They have a really great sense of humor and throughout the movie , you can really tell that they are having fun . If you are a juggalo , this is the movie to buy . They have great love for 70s flicks and pay homage to some of the best . If you are not a juggalo , do n't buy this movie , because you do n't deserve to see it . The juggalos out there know what i 'm talking about .	1
This concert was so good ! It was my first time of seeing Art perform ( not in person ) a solo concert . All the songs are really good . All the S & amp ; G classics plus his solo songs mixed in , make this video worthy of numerous viewings . You feel like you 're really there in the audience . Art is witty and every word ( in seriousness ) is so thought-provoking . The song & quot ; Grateful & quot ; , really makes you count your blessings , and makes you see how blessed your life really is in this fast-paced world we live in . You will NOT regret buying this .	1
I love Robbie Williams and think he has been under estimated in the states . Angels is such a beautiful song , this is really a nice CD .	1
Although there are not many videos on this dvd its worth buying as you get loads of extras . The videos that are on the dvd are some of robbies best and the bonus footage is good to watch . Any diehard fan should not be without this dvd	1
This is a very simple DVD . You do n't get a whole lot , but you get a little of all , and what you get is really cool . You get the videos section ( 5 videos , including one for & quot ; Get the Joke & quot ; , which consists of him and one of his band mates with a guitar . This video is like you and I singing in my apartment , you know what I mean ? ) . You get the poems section . ( he recites three of his poems ) . The interviews section ( three short pieces of interviews about the song `` Angels '' ) . And the game section ( if you find the joker you will get to see two more videos ) .Over all , it is about Robbie as simple and natural as he can get . It 's lots of fun ! It is worth the price .	1
I ca n't believe this DVD is going 13 years old . I 'm not a Christina fan , but I always did enjoy this DVD because it 's of course , Christina 's first DVD . And this is Christina at the age of 18 , looking her finest . This was the only DVD we could get a glimpse of Christina when Christina came out with the hit `` Genie In A Bottle '' . This is a great special DVD to see Christina 's beginnings .	1
if you 're not one , then why would you watch it ? Well , I 'm getting used to the newer Christina now , but it 's still nice watching her when she still had that teenie bopper look , one thing about her , if you look at her diary , you realize that she really has n't changed a bit . She 's grown much , but she 's still really cute . This dvd consists of some songs from her 1st album , self-titled , including Genie In A Bottle , What A Girl Wants , When You Puts Your Hands On Me , I Turn To You ( video was n't released at the time ) and So Emotional . They final product is put over the live so she can have different shots during the video , more stuff , less exciting . Also , the Etta James song she always sings , At Last , the only one that 's live , crappy quality though , and The Christmas Song in a beatiful room with candles and a guy playing the piano . The dvd is 1 hour and 14 minutes long , almost as long as a short movie . We see her grow up as a child and learn many facts about her . She actually never had any singing lessons before she auditioned to Mickey Mouse which to me , is unbelievable . Amazing girl , with extrodinary vocal talents , buy this today !	1
Genie gets her wish is a movie about the talented CHRISTINA AGUILERA , but with this video it puts her back in Britney 's shadow . Genie gets her wish is cheaply made it goes back and forth and the picture is blurry and not as crisp as Britney 's far suprior dvd 's . My advice for all you POP fans get Britney 's dvd 's and wait for a 2nd Aguilera video.CHRISTINA AGUILERA GENIE GETS HER WISH : C-	1
This DVD rarely leaves my player . It is so much fun to watch . It 's always on when I 'm cleaning , doing homework , or even when I 'm bored . The songs are awesome . The band plays their eharts out and it is cool to see what this band is capable of live . The songs are all wonderful ( for a full rundown , see my review of the CD ) . I enjoy watching it . I 'm going to cry the day I finally ware it out . It is so much fun to watch , and it is a good DVD , with song selection , multiple angle viewing , good picutre and great sound . It is fun to watch this band up on stage . Through this DVD you can see why this band is so great live , they absolutely love what they are doing.Buy this DVD .	1
I got the soundtrack for this concert for Christmas a few years ago , and I was so impressed with the music that I later bought the actual video . Money well spent.First of all , I think the reason I like this concert the best out of all the other live DMB releases is because of the musical era it is from . & quot ; Before These Crowded Streets & quot ; is by far my favorite of the DMB records , and for the most part the versions of songs from the album they play are great . My one complaint would be & quot ; Rapunzel & quot ; : they slowed it down like hell , and it sounds fairly awkward . Most everything else is quite awesome , and among my favorite tracks are & quot ; Pantala Naga Pampa , & quot ; & quot ; Two Step , & quot ; & quot ; Do n't Drink the Water , & quot ; and their famous concert-ending version of Dyland 's & quot ; All Along the Watchtower. & quot ; In terms of the DVD and filming , the quality of the concert is very good , and the cinematography is also satisfactory . Also , there are alternate camera views of certain songs available to choose from the menus.The absolute best part about this concert is & quot ; Two Step. & quot ; Every part of the 14-minute performance was just freaking amazing . The song starts off with Boyd strumming his violin along with Dave 's guitar while Stephan Lessard plays some slide bass . Then , Dave opens with some alternate lyrics to the introduction , and then the group crashes into the main part of the song heard on their album & quot ; Crash. & quot ; After the main song body is over , Butch Tayler plays a stunning 2-minute piano solo , which I thought was the most amazing part of the performance . Then , Dave starts playing some cool guitar lick while the rest of the band silences down for about a minute , and then the entire group begins a 2-minute crescendo that culminates in an jaw-dropping drum solo by Carter Beauford . Again , the band quiets down for about a minute , and then music suddenly triples in volume and they play the outro that is heard in the original recording . Best performance of a song EVER .	1
The latest live effort by these fabulous five performers , is immpressive to say the least . I hels out buying the cd when it was first release . Although the DVD was not released ( while the VHS edition was ) i waited hoping it would soon be . My waiting paid off , and here is the visually stunning , absolutly rockin ' show ! MY only complaint come from the fact that the disk is not masterd in dolby Digital , these feature is sorly missed and is the reason it does not get a fifth star . The johnny cash song & quot ; long black veil & quot ; also once performed by the Cheiftans , and Boyd singing & quot ; true reflections & quot ; shows some exellent choices in shaking up the increasingly stale concert selection by the DMB . I feel they need to hurry up with some new material cause we 've heard it all and love it , here 's more to overplay . Here 's a shout out to my baby sis Lizzy ... .Peace , 5000 , Yeah .	1
Hey great inside view of the making of Blood Sugar Sex Magic album . If you John Frusciante as I do then I pretty sure you will enjoy this video .	1
THIS WAS A VERY INTERESTING VIEW INTO THIS GATHERING OF TRUELY TALENTED MUSICIANS LED BY TO THE BEST IN THE BUSSINESS TRUE PRO 'S AT WORK FUN TO WATCH AND THE MUSIC DOES'T GET ANY BETTER ! ! !	1
Some 30 years after it was released - which is several lifetimes in pop culture - The pristine production and technically-pleasing performances on Aja continue to stand the test of time.Walter Becker and Donald Fagan take the viewer through the long and oftentimes quite complicated creation of the classic album , which reached the lofty top five status in the U.S. and England , with the cool jazz-fusion delivering the signature numbers - Deacon Blues , Peg and Josie - while selling more 20 million copies worldwide.Initially airing as part of the VH-1 Classic Albums series , the insight of Becker and Fagan is bolstered by interviews with producer Gary Katz and a several of the musicians who performed in the sessions.In 1978 , the album won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Recording . There is no better way to find out what makes Aja so perfect .	1
The decade 's most notoriously quiet , rarely interviewed yet sarcastic , cryptic ( and wearing sunglasses in just about every picture taken ) , studio musicians that did n't tour , Steely Dan came out with `` Aja '' .The `` classic album '' series managed to get Donald Fagen and Walter Becker to open up about the making of this classic . By the time of this interview , they had already been touring for years and had been active in their own website.You learn : they know hip-hop . They were going to tour for `` Aja '' but conflicts came up . The more `` California-sounding '' songs were recorded in NY , and the earlier `` NY-sounding '' songs were recorded in LA . Aja used musicians from both coasts . They were perfectionists but the session musicians do n't hold grudges against them . You get little backstory on the songs themselves , but you also realize that Walter Becker 's the one who writes more of the lyrics and Donald Fagen more of the music ... Gary Katz and Denny Dias ( who was actually responsible for making Steely Dan into a band to begin with ) were also as important to those sessions..If you grew up a Dan fan , it 'll be fun to actually see and hear them talk about these songs . I do n't think it 's something that 's going to be repeated viewing , but I can see going to it every now and then ... It would have been great if they recreated the sessions with most of the original musicians and did the whole CD from beginning to end in Surround , but the discussion about this classic makes it worth watching .	1
Really insightful from Fagen , Becker & cohorts on the production of one of the truly great albums . So far ahead of its time , it remains fresh & ages like fine wine . Would 've enjoyed seeing more actual performance on the DVD , but it 's still great .	1
One of my favorite albums period ! Whats not to like . Behind the scene commentary . What a lineup . Only complaint is the complete oversight of Steve Gadd 's incredible druming on Aja . Steve at the height of his ability . Not even a mention . Still it does n't take too much away from a great album and musical group . Regardless of how many of them there were !	1
To those expecting Joshua Tree videos : Given that there were only 5 videos made for Joshua Tree Songs ( With or Without You , Where the Streets Have No Name , I Still Have n't Found , Red Hill Mining Town , and Spanish Eyes ) why the hell would one include already released video material on a & quot ; making of & quot ; style documentary ! ? BTW , most of these videos can be found on U2 's Greatest 1980-1990 VHS and videos for all other tracks are nonexistent.To those expecting live or studio action : This is a documentary , displaying the action behind the mixing console and in the sound room where all tracks were laid down . So of course it 's only fitting to have Daniel Lanois , Brian Eno , Steve Lillywhite , and Flood guiding the viewer through the recording and mixing processes while each band member embellishes with their own personal experiences and memories of those landmark recording sessions . Tidbits of live action and additional video footage are interspersed with studio interviews and commentary . The comments by world famous photographer Anton Corbijn and Marketing Agent Steve Averill add further flavor to this DVD by telling the story behind the album artwork and photographs , as well as the significance of the Joshua Tree itself.To Musicians and True Fans : Insight into the making of the Joshua Tree is like insight into the creation of the universe . The work , heart , and committment put into the making of this musical work of art is faithfully documented . If you play an instrument and or do some recording you 'll more than appreciate what this DVD has to offer . True fans will be delighted in visiting the realm where all the magic took place . But please recognize that most audio releases have time limits ... this is not a theatrical release . Albeit 60 minutes does n't do the entire album justice , but provides insight to a majority of tracks . A documentary implies commentary and insight , articulated by all those involved in the recording process .	1
The JOSHUA TREE is one of the 2 masterpieces U2 created ... the other is ACHTUNG BABY ... JOSHUA got the world classics WITH OR WITHOUT YOU , WHERE THE STREETS HAVE NO NAME and I STILL HAVE N'T FOUND WHAT I LOOKING FOR ... But the truth is that ALL the songs rocks here ! Look , if you never heard U2 in your life , this is a good way to begin ... Than , when you realize U2 is great you can explore their stuff !	1
Filmed around the same time that U2 had put together a 'Best of 1980-1990 ' , this & quot ; documentary & quot ; is suprisingly good . Producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno and members of the band provide fascinating insights and stories behind the songs on what is considered by many to be their strongest record . The weaknesses - there is no commentary on three songs on 'The Joshua Tree ' , & quot ; One Tree Hill & quot ; , & quot ; In God 's Country & quot ; , and & quot ; Trip Through Your Wires & quot ; and the awkward inclusion of the full video versions of & quot ; The Sweetest Thing & quot ; ( remixed in 1998 ) and & quot ; Running to Stand Still & quot ; ( circa 1993 Zoo TV ) .Having read the book & quot ; Until the End of the World & quot ; , I hope they take a second try at this format with the making of their other classic , 'Achtung Baby ' .	1
Yanni presented this magnificent piece of stage performance with so much energy and trilled the audience track after the track . I purchased this DVD soon after the release but even today when you listen ; you will feel like the music is new.Most magnificent tracks which I like areUntil the Last MomentNostalgiaReflections of PassionRecommended you to buy if you are orchestra type music fan .	1
My very first introduction to Yanni.I was a fan after the very first song.This concert was awesome , usingthe Acropolis as the background .	1
My first awareness of Yanni was on PBS . I purchased this concert DVD and loved it . Since then I have purchased many other Yanni CD/DVDs and enjoy all of them .	1
whitney stole the show that night ! i am disappointed that vh1 removed her unforgettable renditions of it 's not right but okay/my love is your love . whitney actually opened doors for Mary J Blige that night ( Mary J will recall that later at a Bet celebration honoring whitney ) . The `` I will always love you '' preformance was one of the best delivered ( emotional , powerful and memorable ) . Tina did a great job that night opening the show with a diva-like introduction . oh hell , faith hill , brandy , lee ann rimes were diva in process . Divo elton john was ok and cher just ca n't sing live.I am fair enough to say that Whitney and Tina saved the show ... .That 's why they can both be called DIVA..	1
I have this collection of Smiths ' videos on videotape , so I ca n't comment on the DVD aspects , but I cansay whether or not I think it 's worth getting this . The Top of the Pop videos are really awful unless you just want to see what the band looked like when they were young . Of course they were all pretty droll about it anyway . This collection , though , is a must-have for the Derek Jarman videos , none of which I ever got to see on MTV . Jarman was brilliant and the visuals go perfectly with the music . Buy !	1
Yes , the videos are kind of corny , but this DVD is a real treat for those of us who were still learning how to walk when The Smiths were at the apex of their career . I liked how the DVD combined Smiths videos with some live preformances letting veiwers who maybe be new to The Smiths see them play . The sound quality is excellent reguardless of the shorthandedness of some of the videos . The only knocks I have against `` The complete picture '' is the length ( 50 minutes ) and the `` The queen is dead '' flim at the end . If you like The Smiths you owe it to yourself to check this out , just do n't expect to see amazingly artistic videos .	1
The smiths were the greatest band of the 80 's - for some reason there are n't too many live videos of the smiths or smiths videos for that matter.. Luckily there exists a smidgen of smiths history compiled here as the complete picture - well obviously a handful of top of the pops videos and derek Jarman 's artsy medley are not a complete picture - but what else have we got ? This is it folks - a slice of pure music history ... and frankley mr. shankley morrissey and the smiths do go down in musical history..	1
This video is so funny , I could n't stop laughing ! ! It 's soo super duper funny ! It contains the videos Adam 's Song , All The Small Things , What 's My Age Again ? and the 2 best videos ever made , Josie and Dammit ! ! Excelent vids , with 2 awesome concerts , All The Small Things and What 's MY Age Again ? live in the electric ballroom ! ... Tom 's introduction was kind of different , Mark 's and Travis 's were okay ! One of the best music vids in years ! Well , the best ever ! ! The 2nd one had a way better photo booth , but was n't as funny ! That 's a different story ! This vids awesome , and watch it ! !	1
this is a great dvd showing off the early days of blink 182. while i must say the sequel to this video is much better , this one is still awesome and worthy of being in any blink fans collection .	1
you really ca n't go wrong if you 're a die hard fan of blink 182. there 's nothing to really critique here . if you love the band , you 'll love the DVD . this compilation lets you inside of Blink 182 's early days . it features just screwing around , interviews , videos , live performances , and you get the idea . but yeah , it 's really the dvd to own along with the 2nd one if you consider yourself a true blink fan .	1
I was n't expecting this DVD to be much of anything , but I was pleasantly surprised . It is an important time capsule , and we are reminded of the fashion trends , autos , music , and commercials of the '60s , exquisitely preserved on film.Nancy 's music and singing are exceptional , although some of her presentations are characteristically stiff , somewhat formal . There are some wonderful duets with Lee Hazlewood , and the chemistry between the two shines.Her father 's contribution to this video collection is absolutely superb . Frank had a natural warmth and charm when on camera.This is a cool DVD , made cooler with original `` RC Cola '' TV ads and a bonus footage section , narrated by Nancy ( she had me in stitches ; what a hoot ) .	1
Those of a certain age generally like things which bring back pleasant memories of youth , and I am among them . Though Movin ' With Nancy was aimed at young people somewhat older than I was at the time of its release , I watched with amusement as the cheesy reality of 60s TV springs to life here.Industry reviews say that this CD was meant to expand Nancy Sinatra 's fanbase beyond the square MOR crowd by reaching out on several songs to counter-culture youth . If the order of the performances on the actual TV special are the same as on the DVD , I would have predicted that this effort would fail , despite the presence of faux hipster Lee Hazlewood . At that time , there was no one more representative of the Establishment , and thus no one more uncool , than Frank Sinatra and his cohorts . And to a certain extent , that image rubbed off on daughter Nancy . For many viewers , the main attraction would have been the sex-kittenish antics of Ms. Sinatra and her sexy outfits , rather than her talents as a performer.Despite some incredibly cheesy moments , I had a lot of fun and laughter watching this DVD and will again in the future . My copy was purchased from an amazon partner . The packaging said it was region 3 ( this was not mentioned by the seller ) , but it played just fine on my US player . The package also listed a number of songs that were not on the DVD . These and all other songs are listed in the order that you would hear them if you had purchased the CD version . However , what is actually on the DVD is much different . Here is the actual order of performances contained on my DVD along with commentary.1 ) I Got ta Get Out of This Town -- -Features a cool , wealthy , miniskirted Nancy driving her hot rod in search of love and adventure.2 ) RC Cola spot featuring Art Linkletter introducing Nancy Sinatra . I had to laugh , because as he proclaimed her to be America 's biggest rising young star , he sounded like he was forced to say so at gunpoint . Not very convincing , heh heh.3 ) Up , Up , and Away -- Sappier than `` Up With People '' , believe me . This is the song that earned poor Jimmy Webb the opprobrium of generationally contemporary songwriters and socially closed a lot of doors to him . This mawkish pap would have had hipsters changing the channel immediately . I retched , then I roared with sarcastic laughter . It tries so hard for political correctness and diversity before those were mantras , that it becomes politically incorrect ! 4 ) Sugar Town -- If Up , Up and Away did n't scare away the hipsters and foil industry aspirations for Nancy Sinatra , then this saccharine sex kitten ditty surely did . Revolting ! 5 ) Some Velvet Morning -- Enigmatic lyrics and a nice video of Hazlewood singing while horseback on the beach and Nancy singing while seated among a cluster of coastal flowere in this duet that saw mild chart success when released as a single . Some say the lyrics are druggy , but I think that 's either a cynical manipulation to reach the counter-culture or just over-active imaginations . Remember all the hoo-ha about the lyrics of Puff , the Magic Dragon and Louie , Louie ? 6 ) Another RC commercial , this one set in Spain . It has nothing to do with Sinatra.7 ) Jackson -- Could have been a country hit . Good video , you have to laugh at the cooler-than-thou poses of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra . The silly expression on Hazlewood 's face at the end of the song while Sinatra rides off with her brother into the gorgeous California countryside is priceless.8 ) This Town -- Nancy 's take on a standard . Well-done , but really appeals to her father 's generation more than to her own.9 ) Just Bummin ' Around -- -All Dean Martin , but a great song . Unlikely to have had wide youth appeal , however.10 ) Things -- a corny duet featuring Dean and Nancy . As the industry reviewer said , it is one of those that poses interesting psychological questions.11 ) Another RC Cola spot , featuring Dino , Desi and Billy.12 ) What 'd I Say -- Nancy 's take with Sammy Davis Jr on an old Ray Charles tune . Not a lot of soul , but Nancy sure can go-go ! 13 ) Wait Till You See Him -- Nancy 's paean to her father . A little too much sickening `` daddy 's girl '' crap for me as she wanders through the video gallery caressing a bunch of oversized images of Frank . This is the video that is most psychologically fraught.14 ) Younger Than Springtime -- This would bring in the old-timers skeptical about Nancy 's talent . The Chairman of the Board will wow them with this , as Nancy stays in the background giggling and flirting ( with Daddy ! ) 15 ) another RC Cola spot.16 ) Friday 's Child -- The hippest song on the DVD , most likely to appeal to disaffected and rebellious youth . Good instrumentation , but very sixties . But I 'll bet Grace Slick lost no sleep over the competition.17 ) See the Little Children -- Another outreach to hippies , but not the same bunch as Friday 's Child . This likely appealed more to the Peter Paul and Mary set.18 ) Who Will Buy -- A decent song , well sung by Sinatra . One of her best performances here.19 ) Another RC Cola spot with Art Linkletter . This is the best of them , with a bit of an educational travelogue aspect to it.20 ) Ending credits featuring Nancy with reprise of her opening song . The back-up singers are obnoxious.You might be asking yourself , if this guy is so critical of so many aspects of this DVD , then why on earth did he give it four stars ? Well , its because despite its faults , it is still an entertaining blast from the past . Today , many who were thought of as uncool by the succeeding generation are seen of as cool once more . Frank Sinatra 's popularity today cuts across a number of generational divides . Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr have both benefitted as well by their association with Sinatra and Rat Pack glamor . Lee Hazlewood enjoys cult status with a huge number of up and coming alt rock and alt country musicians looking to him for inspiration . And Nancy ? While not wildly popular , she continues on the club circuit today satisfying a fan base that just seems to be growing.If you are of the sixties , you might find that you enjoy this slice of life today no matter what you might have thought of it then . Check it out , its fun !	1
`` movin with nancy '' is a spectacular special . what 's not to love ? ! lots of great nancy hits ( `` sugartown '' , `` jackson '' , `` some velvet morning '' ) , lots of great scenery , and great ratpack guests . my husband and i watch this show over and over again . we wish they still made great specials like this on tv .	1
This DVD proves one thing . We have no originality in pop culture today ! After taking one look at this in a ... bar a few weeks ago , it is certain that anything original coming from anyone in music and movies today is certainly a thing of the past ! I talk to younger people all the time and I am amazed at how little they know about `` history . '' Not the boring history from school but just history from a lot of things . Music , theatre , movies , books and opera-young people today know none of it ! Now before I start dating ... ahem ... carbon dating myself , let me just say this DVD is the bomb ! Nancy is at her all time best in this film ! She 's entirely original in this and it makes a huge statement on the changing climate of 60/70 's glitter fashion that so perfectly clothed the masses of the disco era . What 's funny in watching this `` classic '' is the uncanny similarity of Nancy 's `` look '' in comparison to Britney Spears . I am sure some marketing exec at the big bad record company probably saw this cheesy film and thought , wow , we could make Britney Spears into that ! Unlike Britney though , Nancy is actually a pop icon as opposed to Britney ... Buy this DVD for it 's nostalgic value , it 's truly a classic to behold in any DVD collection	1
I have watched this opera three times and like it better with each showing . I also have two other VHS recordings of Nabucco and think this one at least holds its own among them . True , the fellow who plays Zachariah is n't Sam Ramey , but he still does a very respectable job . Maybe I am just a hick from the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas , but I liked the opera . The chorus deserves recognition -- it was superior . Maybe those who did n't like it just do n't care for Nabucco .	1
Firstly , to the reviewers who do n't get Verdi singing , perhaps a brush up-course may be in order . Lauren Flanigan , as Abigaille , gives the best vocal performance available on dvd or video . Only the divine Maria Callas does it better ( and that is only available on a fair sounding cd ) . Madame Flanigan respects every note and marking Giuseppe Verdi indicates in the score.Her voice is in superb shape here , and her legato , coloratura , and all the other extremely difficult things that a true Verdi soprano must execute are present . Neither Dimitrova , Neves , nor the outlandish performance of Guleghina come close to this.Bruson was a superb Nabucco , in his prime . He still has the fire here and a good part of the vocal requirements , but age and wear has begun to take its toll in this performance . Still , he is very much in command.Visually and sonically this is a very fine example of this opera . The sets are stunning , as are the costumes and blocking.The orchestral components are adequate , but it could be wished that the conductor could have pulled a bit more ferocity from the memebers at certain critical moments.Patrick C. Byrne	1
So xmas has passed and you did not get this DVD , buy it for yourself . I just watched it again for the umpteenth time , still a great concert . If you are looking for special effects ( aka fog , ice , wind , etc , great photography , haircuts , stylistic editing - then forget this DVD . But if you like truly solid music by a talented musicians who are an ensemble , this is it . Thank you Mr. Frampton .	1
I bought this for my wife , and was blown away by Peter 's performance on this dvd . The band was really on that night very tight . It was great to see the late Bob Mayo with the band . His keyboards and guitar really complimented Peter . The encore was great finishing with I Do n't Need No Doctor , from the Humble Pie days . Ca n't Take That Away , was the best song in my opinion of many . Great quality , I ca n't say enough . Loved it !	1
I 'm only reviewing this because of the fact that this DVD is now out of print . I have a copy of it and it wo n't play on my old DVD player or my new Blu-Ray . Nada . It 's not like I abused my copy or anything like that . The disc is in pristine condition.Hopefully , this will be re-released in the near future .	1
This is an awesome show ... great set-list , dead-on performances , good editing , excellent DTS audio track ... too bad it 's become so rare that it 's so expensive . I 'm sure glad I picked it up not to long after it was released . A `` Must-Have '' for Peter Frampton fans - if you do n't already have it - and can afford it !	1
There are no authentic Wagnerian voices here but everyone is dramatically committed and manages to sing well . The main pleasure is the imaginative production by Werner Herzog which is absorbing and truly theatrical , to say the least . The costumes , reminiscent of grotesque medieval drolleries , are particularly interesting and the spare sets and filming are equally effective . Conducting is incisive and detailed . If you buy it in the three-disc Masterpieces of Opera set at $ 25 it is a real bargain .	1
This is a good performance of the ( revised ) Dresden version of the opera -- there is no ballet after the overture but Venus does appear at the end of the opera.This is a recording of a live performance of a production at Orchestra of the Teatro di San Carlo . I saw the same production at the Baltimore Opera and found it generally effective . The production was designed by film director Werner Herzog.The set is fairly spare most of the time , with most of the characters dressed in bright white , often billowy clothes . In this production , Herzog had offstage fans blowing , which made the singers ' clothes blow in a gentle breeze most of the time . The effect was usually pleasant , adding a bit of movement , but it sometimes was distracting . Sometimes the costumes were weird -- during the entrance of the guests in Act 2 , knights came in looking like a cross between the KKK and stormtroopers from Star Wars . The one break from the white was the scenes with Venus , who was dressed in scarlet and for whom the stage backgroup were the same color.This was a fairly straightforward , four-square production of Tannhauser . It was well-sung and played and the staging ( and costumes ) did not generally distract from the opera.The sound on the DVD is good ( though there is a fair amount of stage and sometimes audience noise ) . There are English subtitles though ( somewhat disappointingly ) no German.This is good Tannhauser , though I would also like to see the Met 's broadcast from the 80 's on DVD , in part to get a bit more color in the production . This may not be the best possible Tannhauser that you will ever see on DVD , but it is worth having , whatever competition it may eventually get .	1
Whatever happened to being polite and quiet during an acoustic concert ? Are all Texans this rude ? The whistling dude should 've been thrown out.People yelling for tunes ? That 's only kosher if the artist asksfor requests . Otherwise , shut up people ! Enjoy the set list the artist has constructed especially for you ! I attended a Guy Clark concert in Pittsburgh a few years back.Now Guy had said that he would come out and mingle with the folksafter the show , but during a delicate song about his father 's dying , somea-hole in the back broke out in some loud laughter for some stupidreason , Guy did n't take kindly to that and never came outafter the show . So we have one idiot ruining it for everyone else .	1
Filmed in Germany this incarnation of the band is the most well known with Lowell , Paul , Bill , Kenny , Sam and Richie . The concert footage is quite good considering it was done in the 70 's and is live . It 's a real kick to see how the guys looked in the 70's.The best part for me was the voice over option which has Paul , Bill and ocassionally Lowell 's wife talking over the entire concert . The value of DVD technology is really clear here . You hear the guys talk about the songs , what they were thinking the impact it all had on them and how the band has changed . Feat Fans , you 'll love this .	1
Among the many tragedies of Lowell George 's premature death is the very small amount of archival Little Feat video available of him with the band ... I still ca n't believe that there was n't film shot of any of the `` Waiting For Columbus '' concerts ; what a missed opportunity . This DVD is from a July 23 , 1977 German television concert program , and is the best overall concert video of George with Feat ; sadly it is out of print and quite expensive , although totally worth the cost.The primary reason I gave the DVD four stars instead of five was due to some technical issues in the concert and filming ( feedback , color balance , etc . ) rather than the performance itself , although I think the harmony parts on several of the songs are tighter on `` Waiting For Columbus '' . Still that 's an apples-to-oranges type of comparison , as the Rockpalast recording was not given anything like the postproduction attention that `` Waiting For Columbus '' received.I thought the band was in great form for this concert , especially George and Richie Hayward , who is one of the greatest drummers in rock history . I also loved the dueling keyboard and guitar courtesy of Bill Payne and Paul Barrere , who were on top of their game for the show . Kenny Gradney 's bass work , as always , provides a great foundation for the songs , along with the percussion of Hayward and Sam Clayton.The song selection was what you would expect from the era and included : Skin it BackFat Man in the BathtubOh AtlantaDay at the Dog RacesAll That You DreamOld Folks BoogieDixie ChickenTripe Face BoogieFeats Do n't Fail Me NowWillin'Rocket in My Pocketand a special bonus track of `` Cold , Cold , Cold '' .For me the greatest performances are at the end of the set , with `` Feats Do n't Fail Me Now '' all the way through the encore and `` Rocket in My Pocket '' showing the band at it 's peak . I love `` Fat Man in the Bathtub '' and `` Dixie Chicken '' as well , but the versions on `` Waiting For Columbus '' are so good that I still prefer them . I loved the bonus of `` Cold , Cold , Cold '' , and wish we could get a DVD with the entire show from which it was taken.Overall , this is the best Little Feat performance with Lowell George available . It 's not technically perfect , but it is still an absolute delight and I recommend paying the steep price to get your own copy !	1
If you like the idea of Stephen Stills , in no-nonsense form , playing a giant hollow-bodied guitar at high volume with grade-A rhythm players , this is the stuff that dream is made of . There 's a lot of hollow-body Gretsch but later in the set some massive , Hendrix-inflected Les Paul stuff too . ( The word is `` wahwah . '' ) The performances here are literally amped up and intensified versions of about half the tracks from the first Mansasas Lp , providing a set that moves across generic borders with pioneering verve : this band is equally convincing doing country , `` Cuban Bluegrass , '' or Stills ' odd-signatured and riff-heavy `` Bound to Fall . '' If you play this DVD loud through a nice system ( and you must do that ) , you 're there , and that 's a nice place to be . The recording is fine , although for some reason Chris Hillman 's ( also beautiful and giant ) guitar is not especially apparent in the mix , but his voice is . The band 's performance is unusual in that they are alone on a sound-stage , with utterly no audience , but they have a positive nerviness and the set gains `` sweat '' as if a good audience is present . I even like this film visually . ( Perhaps because my only caveat about this DVD is that this band , in this performance , sounds tighter with images than without -- sans-images , occasional looseness is apparent . Curious effect ! ) The jump cuts between band members are abrupt at times , but the rear-screen solarizations provide technically dated but visually cool multi-hued images of the band from camera angles varied from the main shot . I 'll be frank -- I like Stills , but I did n't know this band was this good .	1
20 YEARS ! TOO MUCH OF A HIATUS FROM STEELY DAN ! THEIR NEWEST CD IS A BLESSING . A MASTERPIECE ! IT 'S DEFINITELY MY # 1 BEST CD OF 2000 THOUGH WE 'RE IN MARCH . IT 'S THAT GOOD AND EVERY SINGLE TRACK IS A CLASSIC ! THE LYRICS HERE ARE CUTE AND SO FRESHLY ORIGINAL . THE MUSIC IS OUTTA THIS WORLD . AFTER 9 TUNES , I WANTED MORE AND MORE . YEAH FAGEN AND BECKER RELEASED A SOLO CD HERE AND THERE BUT SO WHAT ! I WANTED STEELY ! THEY RULE ! THIS CD RULES ! I SAID EVERY TRACK HERE IS CLASSIC : THE TRUE CLASSIC S.D . TUNE HERE ? & quot ; JACK OF SPEED & quot ; . I COULD N'T STOP DANCING IN THE SHOWER . I CA N'T HELP IT THAT I 'M EXCITED . IT 'S STEELY DAN DAMMIT ! TO THE GREATEST ROCK/JAZZ/FUNK IN THE WORLD , STEELY DAN , WELCOME BACK GUYS . I MISSED YOU SO MUCH . YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE A NEW CD OUT EVERY 2-3 YRS , NOT 20 .	1
Considering Steely Dan 's twenty year absense from the record racks in termsKamakiriadof new music this album itself not only came as something of a surprise but more over that it won a grammy . Personally I have n't since that time seen an album as fully creatively deserving as this every win such an award . So where were Steely Dan musically at this point anyway ? Well as it turns out much in the same concept as Al Green 's 21't century comeback they elected to do almost nothing to change their sound and concentrated mainly on new songs . So musically if you are a love albums such asGauchoand Fagan'sKamakiriadyou 'll love the music here . In the end it 's just like with Al ; it 's a sound that is so wonderful and works so well everytime you 'd rather see it used again with some melodic variations here and there than see people like these jump on a shallow flavor of the month trend that will embarrass them . One thing that has expanded to a degree is the lyrical focus . Steely Dan always tended to revel in overly cryptic lyrics that could mean a number of things , usually darkly humorous tales of sociaties misfits and such . By the turn of the millenium not only had the definition for misfit scarily broadened but this gave Becker and Fagan an awful lot of new ground to cover in their songs . Extending upon some of the ideas expresssed onKamakiriadmost of these songs have to do with different types of modern women from the shortlived summer affair of `` Gaslighting Abbie '' , the forbiddan romance of `` Janie Runaway '' , the run down addict of `` Negative Girl '' and the mecurial and moodswingy sorts featured in `` What A Shame About Me '' and `` Almost Gothic '' . One of the funkiest tunes on the entire album is `` Cousin Dupree '' , a pretty straight forward tale of a man with impure thoughts about his cousin musing over what would be so wrong about a `` good old fasioned family romance '' . It also has to be one of the only pop songs that uses the word `` quid pro quao '' in the lyrics . Even though the sound of this album has n't changed from earlier ones there is more concentration on jazzy chord progressions than outright pop melodies , especially on the title song and `` West Of Hollywood '' . And again that brings to something of a mystery to me how this album not only faired well commercially but won an award . Not that that 's what they were going for by any means but the subject matter and musical stylings of this album are a bit too obscure and sometimes very perverse for the usually more childishly explicit `` pop '' music of it 's time but at least I am happy that , at one point someone had the right idea that sometimes , even in an age of a lot of generic things that every so often pop music needs to have it 's surprises .	1
In my 20 's ( long ago ) Steely Dan , Pink Floyd , & amp ; Grateful Dead just did not put out enough raw power for me ; today they are my favorites . This DVD is the best musical DVD I own . I think the music is incredible . It sounds and looks great . However in agreement with all reviewers , the interviews need to be segregated or a feature needs to allow straight through music . I own several videos like this ; although this is the BEST in Integrated Drivel , because you can easily click to the start of the next song . ( The Integrated Drivel is tacked onto the end of each track . ) I am baffled why the producers of all videos do n't segregate the & quot ; once is more than enough & quot ; stuff from the & quot ; I want to watch it every day & quot ; music . But still love it , otherwise a 5 Star .	1
The smooth stylin ' sound of Steely Dan is back ! Tight rhythms , tongue-in-cheek lyricism , and sheer musical genius is how I would best describe this CD . Having come of age during Steely Dan 's finest hours ( Aja ) , when songs like & quot ; Peg & quot ; , & quot ; Rikki Do n't Lose That Number & quot ; , & quot ; Deacon Blues & quot ; were spun 'round the clock on the radio ... this CD brought back a lot of cool memories for me.It is however , not a retread of their signature sound , although very reminiscent of it . Fagen 's voice is as smooth as ever , as is his Rhodes piano ( sure wish I could play like that ) , and his lyrics are just as cutting and witty as ever , if not more so ! Check out & quot ; What a Shame About Me & quot ; , or & quot ; Cousin Dupree & quot ; ... you 'll see what I mean . The lyrics are definitely in the vein of classic Steely Dan , with subtle regret and humor interwoven amidst really funky rhythms and chord structures . About the only thing lacking - which gave reason to the 4 stars instead of 5 - is that there are only 9 tracks on this CD ... I WANTED MORE ! Favorite tracks on this CD ( in no particular order ) : What A Shame About Me / Cousin Dupree / Gaslighting Abbie / Jack of SpeedThis is a really really cool CD to have while driving a long distance . Just listening to it makes me feel like I 'm driving up the coast of California on the PCH ... & quot ; she said , well , yeah , Hollywood 's been good to me ... & quot ; ( What A Shame About Me ) .Peace Out .	1
20 years after Steely Dan 's last studio album , Gaucho , we have been re-introduced to the greatest band of the 70 's . The wait was worth it . Granted , Donald Fagen and Walter Becker ( the driving force behind SD ) released `` solo '' projects that they worked together on ( and I recommend all , especially `` The Nightfly '' by Fagen ) , but this is the first SD studio album since 1980 . `` Two Against Nature '' takes off beautifully with GASLIGHTING ABBEY , a heavily bass-influenced tune about a love triangle . GREAT song , funky and jazzy with a new edge to the old SD sound.WHAT A SHAME ABOUT ME is an awesome self-loathing , soul searching tune about how cruel life can be if you let it beat you down . The music is heavy on keys and guitar and has a great jazz backbeat . Pure SD negativity and sarcasm.The title track , TWO AGAINST NATURE , is a little exploratory , a bass lover 's dream with great percussion and keys and some really bizzare , jazz sax that is the closest thing to 'free-form ' jazz that I have heard from SD.JANIE RUNAWAY , JACK OF SPEED , COUSIN DUPREE & WEST OF HOLLYWOOD all strike true in the SD classic jazz/rock/blues/funk genre that they are known for.ALMOST GOTHIC is a great , soft , bluesy tune with soft percussion and soothing keys nicely supported by R & B ; backing vocals and some smooth guitar work.NEGATIVE GIRL is perfect . Another experiment in diminished sound , that comes off perfectly , showcasing Fagen 's developed style of singing and some nice piano work with smooth guitar.I am a SD fanatic , and this album did not disappoint . 20 years later , the bad boys of the 70 's still got it . They may be older and wiser , but they are still smart and socially biting , cynical as hell.The album is definitely lighter in the sound department but it seems to me that the guys have just refined their sound as they grew musically , fully embracing the jazz roots that they love .	1
This is a really good CD . Often & quot ; reunion & quot ; albums are a disappointment , but this is n't at all . Steely Dan sounds like they did way back when . This sounds like it was recorded 2 years after Gaucho - not almost 20 years . It does take a few listens to fully appreciate it , so give it a few listens . I think the standout track is & quot ; Janie Runaway & quot ; .	1
After a 20 year absence , the & quot ; Dan & quot ; is back with their first studio album since & quot ; Gaucho & quot ; , released in 1980 . Little has changed in the & quot ; Dan & quot ; formula and what changes there are , are minor and in the background . The lyrics are still clear and impressionistic with topics ranging from intra-family relationships ( Cousin Dupree ) to yet another autobiographical song about L.A. ( West of Hollywood ) . The production is purely top notch and polished . Gone , however are the & quot ; super session players & quot ; of & quot ; Dan & quot ; albums of the past ( with the exception of Hugh McCracken and Dean Parks assisting with guitar duties on & quot ; Almost Gothic & quot ; and & quot ; Negative Girl & quot ; respectively ) . A pleasant surprise on this album is Walter Becker 's guitar playing , which now takes center stage with the lack of all of the super-session guitarists of days gone by ( IE : Larry Carlton , Jeff & quot ; Skunk & quot ; Baxter to name two ) . As for Don Fagen , his keyboard playing is outstanding as always , bouncing between playing a Rhodes , Piano , Wurlitzur and on one occasion , an organ . His style of playing flows between jazz and R & amp ; B . Another pleasant surprise is found on the final trak of the CD , entitled & quot ; West of Hollywood & quot ; . Chris Potter 's long tenor sax solo is reminiscent of Wayne Shorter 's solo on the title track to the 1977 album , & quot ; Aja & quot ; .If you are an old & quot ; Danophile & quot ; like myself or are thinking about purchasing your first Steely Dan CD , and like jazzed influenced tunes with tongue-in-cheek lyrics , GET THIS CD !	1
As we all know , Steely Dan is one of just a few really legendary bands in music history . As such , no matter what they release , fans will grab it up , and most critics will praise . Yes , this is a very good Steely Dan album , winner of the 2000 Best Album Of the Year at the Grammy 's . Maybe partly because it was so long awaited and highly anticipated . It 's deviation in sound from classic Steely Dan is a welcome new experiment . While it still retains that cool jazzy funk , it takes on a more modern sound in keeping with the times , all the while compromising nothing , which shows character . I ca n't nor will not say that it is an overrated album , but I will say that Steely Dan 's followup `` Everything Must Go '' is better . It shows more maturity . I listen to both regularly , and this album has a greener character , a Summertime kind of quality . You could almost say that this one is more fun that the followup , especially with the 5 star track `` Cousin Dupree '' . If any of these songs were to be offered as a single , they would either be this one or title track `` Two Against Nature '' . Two of the best we have here . `` What a Shame About Me '' pulls weight too , getting back to the roots of Steely Dan , telling suburban tales the way `` The Caves Of Altamira '' and `` Everything You Did '' used to , while resembling `` Hey Nineteen '' slightly . `` Almost Gothic '' is one of my other favorite tracks here , smooth and cool , the way alot of their material is these days . But it does n't slide into the category of filler material . Old Steely Dan fans will feel right at home when the recognize the familiar saxaphone , ever present in the classic stuff . Following is `` Jack Of Speed '' , also to be recognized . The last highlight is 8 and 1/2 minute track `` West Of Hollywood '' . You remember how good the old songs that were this long were , like `` Bodhisattva '' or `` Time Out Of Mind '' ? Well this is a repeat . It took me a few listens to appreciate it and understand it for what it is , but it soon became a favorite . The lyrics end about half way through the song and the rest is just the signature Steely Dan beat with the long saxaphone solo we 've come to love , so its a good listen.I would n't offer this to those not familiar with Steely Dan as there is better stuff out there . Afterall this is a 4 star album compared to Steely 's usual 5 star sound , but it is not to be overlooked . Worth the buy for those of us who love Steely Dan.But do check out `` Everything Must Go '' .	1
I have seen many reviews comparing this to Fagen 's Kamakiriad and it is very true . The songs are not as light-hearted though , they are full of odd characters that you may or may not want to meet.I have to say that I wish they could make another album that compares to the first 3 masterpieces they gave us in the 70 's ( Thrill , Countdown & amp ; Pretzel ) . I did hear an acoustic guitar in 1 or 2 songs so that gives me hope for the future . So I am 38 now , that means the next one will come inmy late 40 's . I am sure it will be worth the wait.Best songs are the title track and West of Hollywood , the rest are standard Steely , which is , by the way , 150 per cent better than the dreck that you being shoveled these days . If I hear one more of these overrated talentless so called rap & quot ; musicians & quot ; sampling Steely Dan , I 'm gon na puke .	1
IMHO this Dan offering is the best collection of work since Aja . Many have mentioned the complexity of this suite of songs and I could n't agree more . At face value DF 's lyrics appear simple and straight forward , however the undercurrents that lie beneath the surface are as treacherous as they are witty and humorous.I own every SD song ever recorded for more mass distribution , including some bootleg material that was included in their box set . For me it took all of 30 seconds to be in the groove with this new CD ... I loved it from the get go.Since this CD was proclaimed as a sort of reunion effort it would have been nice to see some contributions from venerable & quot ; Danners & quot ; like Jeff & quot ; Skunk & quot ; Baxter , Denny Diaz and Steve Gadd . I know Jeff is still alive , not sure about the other two . But , hey you ca n't have everything . Two Against Nature is a fabulous start to what is hopefully a long comeback . Great job Donald and Walter .	1
Steely Dan has progressed along a wonderful evolutionary path , from the college-rock early days of CA N'T BUY A THRILL to the mellow , polished jazz-rock of AJA and GAUCHO . Through it all , the consistent thing has been the fabulously obtuse lyrics . Now we have TWO AGAINST NATURE , a worthy addition to the Steely Dan & quot ; canon & quot ; , not some lame & quot ; reunion & quot ; album with nothing new to say . Really , this album picks up where GAUCHO left off , and shows them evolving down the same paths that one can trace through their entire career . In other words , they 've grown without selling out ... truly the mark of musicians with integrity . This album should attract them a new generation of fans , please the old ones , and hopefully renew interest in the entire Dan catalog . By the way , the excellent box set CITIZEN STEELY DAN makes the perfect companion purchase to this album ... buy both and you 'll basically have everything Steely Dan has ever done . Trust me , you 'll love it all !	1
I must admit , I was a little apprehensive when I heard Steely Dan was releasing a new album . I bought it right away , because no matter what , I had to have it . They certainly do n't disappoint . I was concerned that this reunion would produce a mediocre album , but it sure has n't . This is on a par with their best work from the seventies , but it definitely has a new century feel . It 's still them , with their mindboggling lyrics , smooth vocals and spectacular instrumentals . Try it , you 're sure to enjoy it .	1
I have been a Steely Dan fan for many years and waited expectantly for the release of this new CD by them . I have mixed emotions about this CD , after having listened to it for the last couple of years . For the most part I think it is an excellent recording that continues for the most part in the vein of Steely Dan 's reputation of witty , clever , and catchy lyrics and melodies with a touch of jazz thrown in at just the right places . The production is great as usual but I have one major gripe with this CD.I am a professional guitarist and a Walter Becker fan . His solo release ( Eleven Tracks of Whack ) is one of the best CD 's to come out in the last few years ... ( in my opinion . ) The guitar work there is very tasteful and impressive . NOT SO WITH THIS RELEASE ! For some unknown reason he found it necessary to saturate this album with incessant rhythm guitar & quot ; chicken-picking & quot ; all the way through ... even during much of the vocals . The guitar solos also have this effect in them . They are very choppy and irritating sometimes , especially in comparison to the smooth jazz influenced and tasteful solos which highlight previous releases by Steely Dan and Donald Fagen ( e.g . Aja , Gaucho , Nightfly ) Walter can do better than this . Just listen to his solo LP & quot ; 11 Tracks of Whack. & quot ; Two Against Nature would be 100 % better with more tasteful , jazzy , and laidback guitar work . The & quot ; chicken-picking & quot ; just does n't fit the music ! ! I love this CD , but when i think of how much better it could have been , it disappoints me a bit .	1
The really great thing about this disc is that Fagen/Becker obviously wrote and recorded this material without even so much as a sideways glance at what 's happening in the music scene today . This stuff could 've just as well come out in 1978 , and it would 've sounded exactly the same . The bad part is that it 'll never ever get any airplay , but I guess that 's the loss of the mindless masses of sheep who follow trends.Anyway , most of these tunes are gems and overall this CD can hold it 's ground with Aja or Countdown to Ecstacy . The last song , West of Hollywood , is my favorite with beautifully and subtlely shifting key signatures . This song also features a LONG , tasty sax solo by Chris Potter in the outro.One thing that certainly has n't changed is Donald Fagen 's wierdness in his harmony as well as lyrics ( not to mention his voice ! ) . A few of these songs have interludes or bridges that fit the established harmony about as well as your car fits into Park at 75 mph . Also , these lyrics are confusing at very best ( check out the demented Negative Girl -- -what 's & quot ; chicken water & quot ; ? ! ? ! ? ) . Do n't take me wrong , I LOVE these things about the Dan and would never change them . They provide some comic relief and are an essential part of the strange and wonderful ingredients that make up Steely Dan .	1
After the VH-1 & quot ; Storytellers & quot ; edition featuring Steely Dan , I honestly did n't have too high hopes for this DVD . & quot ; Storytellers & quot ; left me wanting for better sound ( of course ... TV , what could one expect ? ) , and quite frankly , something that did n't smack of simply & quot ; PR & quot ; for the new disc . This disc , however , laid all fears to rest . From the opening moments of & quot ; Green Earrings & quot ; , I knew this one was a true winner . This disc features & quot ; bang-on & quot ; performances from the entire ensemble ... no slackers in this crew . Where do they find these guys , anyway ? Is there some top-secret underground facility that cultivates and raises top-notch session musicians for Becker and Fagan 's private stock ? Hmmm ... .. Sound-wise , there are three choices of mix : Dolby Digital 5.1 , which seems to be the most balanced ; DTS 5.1 , which features far better separation of channels , but typical & quot ; overdone & quot ; bass ; and 2- channel PCM Dolby Stereo . The folks at Digital Theatre Systems ( DTS ) seem hell-bent on demonstrating the extended headroom DTS is touted to offer over Dolby Digital by trying to blast viewers out of the room with bottom end . While it works wonders for movies such as & quot ; Saving Private Ryan & quot ; , it really is overkill here . The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix is well-balanced , and just about as good as it can get for a live performance . Highly recommended for Dan Fans !	1
Before you do anything , budget time to listen 5 or 6 times straight through- trust me , will be one of your better days on the planet . It 's so good , it was almost worth waiting the 20 years for . Fagan & amp ; Becker 's song writing has matured with age- like the finest of wines . These guys are pure geniuses- rivaled only by Lennon & amp ; McCartney ( John 's jamming by the gates with his headphoes on- God even has asked to turn it up ) . Favoties- wow , tough call . Tracks 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 are so smooth , you 'll just rock back and smile . & quot ; Almost Gothic & quot ; reminds me of & quot ; Dirty Work & quot ; - sweeter than honey- I 'm talking chills down the spine stuff . Janie Runaway ? leaving to find her in NYC , if she has n't blown out candles already in Spain . It 's so intense , I have n't even gone near the title track . Buy it- enjot it- share it with the kids and anyone else who has a brain in their head Thanks , DF/WB . And do n't worry about 35 % who are mad- if I ever played with you and were n't on this , I might be irratated too- BUT I bet they listen when no one watches !	1
It 's so great to hear the familiar sounds of Steely Dan with some fresh kicks . Too many times , Bands try to imitate a sound that they think people want to hear album after album -- & quot ; Chicago & quot ; comes to mind.These guys have a sound and feel all their own , and it still works after 20 years.Favorite cut so far & quot ; Cousin Dupree & quot ; Great to have them back !	1
If you like some jazz in your pop or pop in your jazz , this is the best stuff in ... well , two decades . This especially holds true if one is a bop or cool jazz fan . There 's Kind of Blue all over this album . The tracks were recorded by a core of live musicians , so TvN has more of a live feel than their masterpiece Aja . The integration and communication between instruments is absolutely amazing for a studio album - a seamless conversation . If the first 7 Dan albums were beautiful 2 dimensional and lyrical chess , the Two Against Nature has a special 3-dimensional quality . While LA jazz permeates Royal Scam , Aja , and to some extent Gaucho , Two Against Nature goes straight to the 50s source ( over a funk backdrop ) - the heros of Fagen and Becker . The album can be snappy ( Janie Runaway ) or just plain gorgeous ( Almost Gothic ) . Those songs along with Negative Girl and West of Hollywood are among Dan 's finest moments . I can honestly say I rank this one close to Aja and Katy Lied . Well deserving of the Grammy accolades . However , if you are a rock fan expecting to hear a screaming Elliot Randall solo , forget it . This is not your father 's Steely Dan .	1
As I write this I 'm listening to that fantastic tenor solo at the end of & quot ; West of Hollywood. & quot ; Some of the best music I 've heard in years . This is an intelligent album , rich in complex content in every way . Can sort of understand why it may be a disappointment to some -- it definitely does n't & quot ; rock , & quot ; rather it calls on the listener to really listen . As for the lyrics , they are very clever in their use of the language , but I guess I 'm a little tired of the Runaway Janie riff , a la Hey 19 ( just celebrated my 14th anniversary ... been a while since my last crazy relatinship , thank God ) . For my taste , a little too much bobo/seinfeld/woody allen sensibility on this album ( What a Shame and Cousin Dupree being the exceptions ) . But I definitely overlook that for the great overall artistic experience .	1
Steely Dan where oh where have you been all my 18 years on this earth ? These last two weeks or so I 've delved in to the Steely Dan collection , and I ai n't finished yet ... my god , it just keeps getting better and better ... I bought Aja first , as it is their most famous one , and I was immediately hooked ... Gaucho followed , and that was a revelation for me as well ... both albums had quickly become my two favorite albums , and it was hard to pick a better one ... then yesterday I bought this one ... I heard the song Jack of Speed which I loved , and I heard parts of live versions of a couple of the other ones before I bought it , and man , this is one awesome album ... Steely Dan ca n't go wrong ... Gaslighting Abbie is a very funky number with great horn and clarinet flourishes throughout , but the highlight of it is the bass clarinet solo ... yup yup , that 's right , a bass clarinet , and it fits perfectly ... the next two songs What a Shame about Me , and the title track are the two weakest tracks on the album , but Janie Runaway straight through to West of Hollywood is perfect ... Janie Runaway is a kinda laid back funky little number which is very very good ... Almost Gothic is awesome , with a great little muted horn solo ... Jack of Speed is almost like the Peg of this album , it 's the most radio friendly of the songs , but still , it is very much a part of the album , and is one of the strongest songs ... Negative Girl is probably my favorite right now , with it 's beautiful melody , and I love that , ummm , is n't that a xylophone solo in there ? It 's called vibes in the liner notes , anyways it 's awesome ... oh , and West of Hollywood has a 4 minute sax solo , which is TOTALLY awesome ... this is one spectacular album ... it 's amazing to me how Steely Dan has actually been popular on radio and stuff all these years ... but I 'm glad , cause it 's nice to hear good music on the radio ... I questioned why these guys won the grammy awards back in february or whenever it was , but that was before I had any experience with their music ... now I realize that it was the right decision ... anyways , I babble ... the bottom line is that this album is one of the best to come out in , well , since Guacho was released ... so that would be like 20 years ... it 's less accessable then Aja and Guacho , but all that means is that you have to listen to it a few times ... once you get into it , it 's very rewarding ... check it out , you wo n't be dissappointed ! ! ! ! ...	1
A great concert from a fantastic bunch of musicians , and edited in just the goofy quirky way Don and Walt make me feel with their music . Very well done ! And the little conversation in the limo at the end of the credits is just one example of why you have to see this ! Priceless ! My kids always make me slo-mo the part at the end of Pretzel Logic , where Don is nodding violently and his glasses fly off ! Do n't pass it up !	1
Wow . Fagen and Becker , these guys can make seriously good music . Despite Fagen 's continued insistence on the use of a Fender Rhodes Electric Piano in every song , lending the tracks a somewhat retro feel , this is brilliant jazz/rock invention . Never have the two sounded more dynamic and alive.GASLIGHTING ABBIE : I do n't really know what this song 's about . It 's got some very vague lyrics and sounds like a middle-aged hipster 's sexy weekend 'away ' . Nevertheless , it 's funky , full of horns and has a decidedly catchy chorus.WHAT A SHAME ABOUT ME : This one grows on you . Judging by the last verse , it seems that the protagonist 's failure as a career-man is due to his own fear of success.TWO AGAINST NATURE : Bee-boppin ' lyrics and funky horns , with an undercurrent of dissonant clarinets ala Randy Newman 's 'Guilty'.JANIE RUNAWAY : The best track on the album . Funny as hell , about a guy who 's picked up a 'wonderwaif ' in Gramercy Park , who , with the possibility of a trip to Spain , fulfils the fantasies of the perverse protagonist.ALMOST GOTHIC : A track about the elusive girl , giving and taking at the same time , obviously stuffing Fagen around.JACK OF SPEED : Like all Steely Dan songs this one carries any number of interpretations . I like to think of it as a guy who 's hooked on speed and as a result his friends have lost track of him . But it could just as well be about anything else . A great song.COUSIN DUPREE : Fun , fun , fun . Country incest made funky as only the Dan can make it.NEGATIVE GIRL : Great track , once again about girls and how they tease and tease ... WEST OF HOLLYWOOD : Featuring a four-minute sax-vamp conclusion , this one blows you away with its melancholic undertones and itsgreat bridge.All these tracks offer something . Pick it up , get it , buy it , this is the Dan at their best .	1
As a fan of all the Steely Dan albums from the 70 's , as well as the solo projects ( that is , what I 've heard of them ) I can pretty safely say that this is an instant classic among them all.From the infectious , punchy opening notes of & quot ; Gaslighting Abbie , & quot ; I could tell that the Dan had not lost their edge . The slow , but funky & quot ; What a Shame About Me , & quot ; is another worthy addition to the Dan repertoire . The title track is in 6/8 , with great bassline and manic piano riffing , is a bit different from the Dan 's other stuff in some ways . The chorus is one of the coolest thing they 've ever done . Another funky groove with a cheery horn section is found in & quot ; Janie Runaway. & quot ; The swirly , liquid texture of & quot ; Almost Gothic & quot ; are quite tasty . & quot ; Jack of Speed & quot ; reminds me very much of & quot ; the Royal Scam. & quot ; A hot beat with attitude , and one of the best tracks on the disc . & quot ; Cousin Dupree & quot ; is probably the only non-country song about incest ever made , though it has a tongue-in-cheek country feel to it . & quot ; Negative Girl & quot ; has the same feel as & quot ; Almost Gothic & quot ; with complex dissonant jazz chords and nice drumming . The 8-minute mini-epic closes the album . 2000 's answer to & quot ; Aja & quot ; ? Not really , it 's very different , but has it 's own charm and points the the future of Steely Dan.This album goes right up there with & quot ; Aja & quot ; and & quot ; The Royal Scam. & quot ; The production is crystal-clear , the songwriting is memorable and original and the playing is rock-solid . Waht more could you ask for from these guys ? This is it .	1
The nay-sayers have their day but in the end great work like this rises above the noisome patter that passes for critiques . The people who refer to this as glorified elevator music are free to give Steely Dan a pass next time around . Smooth and sophisticated is not canned . The maturity of the production evident I these tracks fools people who are used to all the sturm und drang that passes for popular music today.Reading the complaints that all the songs are the same is pretty sad but expected . There are none of the variable wanging riffs and thunderous hooks that beat their sameness set to different rhythms ( more of today 's excuse for popular music ) into poor sounding bass vs. treble mediocrity here.What is here is a subtle but observantly sharp musical performance at it 's best . Becker and Fagen take full advantage of the audio tech heads to bring wit and clarity to their craft.The first track , Gaslighting Abbie is pop decadence , sweet , potent but also subversive fun.What a Shame About Me cuts straight to the ego driven life of foundering celebrity , life passing him by as he tries to remain relevant . From a musical perspective the arrangement is spare with obvious but low key hooks acting as a sparse but strangely rich landscape that carries the first person account through it 's desperate odyssey.Those are just the first two tracks and they 're not the strongest in the line-up.In the end a person either gets this stuff or they do n't . Some nostalgia heavy fans will dismiss this as not as good as their past work in the seventies . That 's too bad because this is as good and in some ways better.This is music that digs deep and etches itself on your DNA if the listeners give in to it and stop demanding that their expectations be met . In fact this is just like their best work in that it creeps in and takes up residence.Not everyone is bound to like this . Those who do will carry these musical extravagances with them until they shuffle off their mortal coils.For what it 's worth my two favorite tracks are Almost Gothic and West of Hollywood . These two guys never cease to provide me with a sense of musical wonder .	1
This past year has been absolute Heaven for me and my three musical idols . Elvis Costello is making exciting music with Burt Bachrach , Bruce Springsteen is proving he is still the Boss , and now Steely Dan releases their incredible follow-up to Gaucho . It is amazing how many & quot ; rock-n-roll & quot ; groups can get by slumming it while these guys peform brilliantly on these songs . Their flawless execution on these jazzy tripfests will leave you waiting for another 20 years for their next contribution . Beautiful stuff by these geniuses who are still ahead of their time .	1
Here you get a very spellbinding funk riff in most of the songs , which shows that bassist and primary guitarist Walter Becker has n't been idle for the past two decades ( if you 're like me and already own his & quot ; 11 Tracks Of Whack & quot ; album , it will come as no surprise ) . I 'm not going to duplicate the efforts of other reviewers by rehashing the most noticeable songs like & quot ; Cousin Dupree & quot ; , but you will notice that the longest number ( & quot ; West Of Hollywood & quot ; at a bit over 8 minutes ) , is a bit of an anomaly . In the past , the longest cut on a Steely album was one of the slower songs -- this one might very well be the bounciest . People who do n't like long songs because they seem to drag might find a pleasant surprise in that cut . Plus , as you might expect in an album built for CD , it 's about an hour long . Which is to me prima facie evidence that anyone who calls them & quot ; dinosaurs & quot ; is blowin ' smoke -- Jurassic albums are only 40 minutes . So freakin ' there !	1
Years ago when I heard SD was getting together again after so long I was n't interested . When the cd came out I was curious but not excited . When it won the Grammy for best album I figured that a whole lot of folks thought highly of their effort so I finally broke down and bought it . It 's great . It 's funky , slick , clever and darn near perfect in its production . Every song grows on you and it 's as infectious as any of their offerings were back in the 70s and 80s . They just do n't sound like anybody else and nobody else sounds like them . That 's quite a compliment in the history of recorded music .	1
I had AJA in high school on vinyl . And I replaced it with AJA on CD . It sits side by side with AJA pt II ( ahem , Two Against Nature ) on the rack -- same melodies , same guitar riffs , same incomprehensible lyrics , same intrique , same keyboard licks , same multi-layered melodies and syncopated rhythms . Brand new century , same old Steely Dan . Absolutely nothing wrong with that , right ?	1
I agree with what some of the previous reviewers have said . The interviews are rather pointless , and I would rather have had a few extra songs instead of these . As far as the picture is concerned , yes it is a bit dark but I found some of the camera angles to be quite interesting . There were some very good close-ups of the musicians , which is great if you are a musician yourself.As you would expect from Steely Dan the music is just perfect . The muscianship is of the highest quality and the selection of songs is fairly representative of their career at that point . The sound quality is high ( Dolby Digital 5.1 / DTS ) and I ca n't see how anybody who likes Steely Dan can fail to enjoy this .	1
On Two Against Nature , Donald Fagan and Walter Becker have released an album with a very rare element in popular music : rich instrumentation . The CD is just a swirl of sound from start to finish with a number of tasteful textures . The listener hears every thing from brassy horn pops to velvety electric bass to twangy wah-wah guitars to just about every vintage keyboard ever invented . Each instrument adds its own contour to the music making for a very enjoyable listening experience where the listener keeps hearing new things throughout the album . The sound has so many layers that it is a very difficult but interesting task to dissect everything that is going on.The songs themselves are very well put together . The writing is interesting and exciting horn arrangements are on every track . Each song has its own unique character from the bouncy salsa-tinged title track to the mysterious `` Jack of Speed '' to the naive and precarious `` Cousin Dupree . '' In terms of lyrics , its not always obvious exactly what the duo is trying to say , but that is sort of how Steely Dan is supposed to be . Anyway , the nine songs all really mesh together well , they manage to fill up 50 minutes ( which is more than some groups can do with 12-14 songs ) and all of the songs are very strong . I do n't know that I could come up with any one or two tracks that definately stand out.The album also deserves praise for the sax solos by modern jazz virtuoso Chris Potter . Potter really adds to the value of the album with his legitamate jazz influence complementing the pop/funk that this album presents.As a Grammy winner of Album of the Year , Steely Dan has really produced a wonderful piece of work . They keep in the tradition of their classic music and also bring in some modern influence to really add to America 's music library with a positive contribution .	1
This is a good but somewhat uneven album . Its closest relative would be Fagen 's Kamakiriad . In fact , & quot ; What a Shame About Me & quot ; sounds suspiciously like Kamakiriad 's & quot ; Springtime , & quot ; and the bass-line in & quot ; Janie Runaway & quot ; sounds like Kamakiriad 's & quot ; Trans-island Skyway. & quot ; For my money , Kamakiriad is the better album by a nose.In classic late-Dan style , Steely Dan lays on horns , female backing singers , and tasty keyboard and guitar licks . The arrangements , style , and sound do tend to sameness on the first listenings , but after more hearings you realize that each song has its own texture and style . The album has some of the chill of Gaucho , the jazzy chord-changes of Katy Lied and Aja , and the sound of Kamakiriad . The lyrics mostly track 70 's Dan lowlife , but occasionally the strange nostalgia for 1950 's futurama that predominates in Fagen 's solo albums peeks through too.The best songs on the album are & quot ; Gaslighting Abbie , & quot ; & quot ; Almost Gothic , & quot ; & quot ; Jack of Speed , & quot ; & quot ; Negative Girl , & quot ; and & quot ; West of Hollywood & quot ; ( which has catchy and surprising chord-changes and fantastic sax playing by Chris Potter ) . I usually skip the title track , & quot ; What a Shame About Me , & quot ; and & quot ; Cousin Dupree. & quot ; For all the talk of the Dan 's high musicianship , Becker 's guitar solo on & quot ; Gaslighting Abbie & quot ; sounds like the twanging of a rubber band . Fagen 's vocals are recognizable , but his voice sounds weaker and breathier now than in Steely Dan 's heyday.Steely Dan puts most bands to shame . At a time when most groups are just sampling ( i.e. , stealing from ) old hits , Steely Dan continues to practice the art of composition , arrangement , and performance , with intelligent , sophisticated , and catchy songs.Be patient with the album . It will not grab you on the first listening , but over time you 'll come to love it .	1
Well , better put -- do you really expect Fagen/Becker to do love songs , given what you know about Steely Dan ? I did n't think so . These boys did n't do that pretty boy number even when they did & quot ; Rikki , Do n't Lose That Number & quot ; ... . but they sure had the chops and the inventiveness . And they honed their craft till when you hear Steely Dan , you want and expect jazz laced musicianship punched with Fagen 's trademark bluesy-whiney vocals and lyrics that relate some kinda nefarious scenario that personally you 'd probably would n't wan na be into , but it sounds kew-ell ... true , Fagen/Becker are probably in some arcane quantum pocket filled with literary allusions , rare jazz records of obscure artists , and midnight rides in the desert that we 'd never understand , but that 's just the point -- we , the listeners , are included in the & quot ; Nature & quot ; of 2vN ... if , for example , you ca n't understand that 2 guys could go through all the stuff they have and still be friends , and still playing music together ... if , for example , you ca n't understand Don and Walter are n't just in this biz just for the recognition and money ( although , I 'm sure they help ) and it probably would n't matter a whit if they had a top 10 album or not ... if , for example , you never had to go on any promotional effort for anything , then you will never get it ... this is more of an affirmation of the infamous Becker/Fagen collaboration and friendship -- an appreciation of each others talents and contributions to Steely Dan , Inc. than it is for us -- we 're just fortunate to be let in on the jam session . Do you get it yet ?	1
... but you have to go pick up the Imagine album first . This DVD documents the making of the landmark 1971 album , opening with a jam session and ending with a very satisfied John Lennon listening to the finished product of the title track.From start to finish , you 'll think you 're in the recording studio with John , George , Klaus , and Phil . That 's how good the picture and sound is , although there understably are a few scratches in the video here and there , but the footage is superb , considering that most of it has been in the can for almost thirty years.Watch for a snide John playing & quot ; How Do You Sleep & quot ; on the piano for George Harrison for the first time . That alone is worth the price of the DVD .	1
john was on top at this time his aura justs shines right on there will never be another person as cool as john lennon not paul not elvis not bob dylan and i dont like to use this name in the same paragraph but just to let all these country people know garth brooks dont even exist up to someone on john lennons caliber .	1
The biggest problem I had with this documentary is that it had a somewhat detached , haphazard feel , that made it difficult to follow from start to finish . Yeah , its great to see Lennon at work , cursing at the sound guy , and the bit where Yoko sings off key while trying to show one of the band how the tune to & quot ; Oh Yoko & quot ; goes is hilarious , but overall I felt disconnected from the whole process . For example , I got the impression that Phil Specter had a very minimal role in the making of this record , but was this really the case ? Or was his style deliberately low-key ? Hence my problem with this ; I did n't get a good feel for what was really going on.Still gets 4 stars ; its a tantalizing glance into the work of one of the great artists of the 20th century , and the interview with John and Yoko is fantastic , and its worth the price for this alone . Here Lennon goes into the feelings and motivations behind some of his songs ; for example , there 's a brilliant and vulnerable description about the sentiments behind & quot ; Jealous Guy & quot ; , and this is exactly the kind of thing that I was looking for in this documentary .	1
I just recieved the DVD in the mail and watched a wonderful 5.1 Dolby Digital slice of the 1971 making of Imagine . The video transfer is superb considering the source . Sound quality ( 5.1 DD or 2.0 Surround ) is also great . Any John Lennon fan with a DVD player needs this in their collection . Got ta go-Watching it again-Enjoy	1
I got this for getting good grades in the first semester of my 9th Grade Year ( Shows My Age ! ) This was something I just had to have , my mom said get good grades and I 'll get for you , and I did , and she was so proud we came on Amazon and preordered it straight away . I do n't frequent this release as much as I previously did , of course , concert DVDs lose their value quite quickly . I do fondly remember it alot and come back to it and watch it front to back of course . Great performance , great artist , and do n't forget a rather long and interesting interview . Good stuff ... Get it before it 's gone ...	1
If You Love Soul music you can not be helped to be physically moved by this concert , Jeffrey puts in a superb performance singing all his greatest hits and really rocks the house , The audience are all really enjoying themselves and Jeffrey gets them all involved in the show.I highly recommend this concert and I ca n't wait for the other shows due for release in this BET FOR JAZZ collection , Sound and Picture quality is excellant.The only thing I would have improved was the interview on the special features , the audio was drowned out and I wish we could have had this full screen In the U.K we do not see enough of these artists.Multiple camara angles would have also been nice to add an extra realism to the concert on DVD .	1
I like this one ok ... too many fast songs ... ..I enjoy Jeffery slow songs . Not enough slow music . But it was ok	1
Great CD -- very upbeat of course . I really like Bob Marley so this CD is a compilation of his music and it has some excellent selections on it .	1
the concert editing on the dvd leaves too much time to cheesy songs\artists presentations . its anoying , you have to skeep it.a good concert , with some really good performances.lauryn hill at her best , she makes this dvd , too bad only 2 songs with her . she makes other artist pale ...	1
This is a compilation of rock and reggae stars getting together for a tribute to a band that is the benchmark for reggae . The only reason it is four stars is because Bob is n't there . Fun to watch , and done with reverence and enthusiasm that the music deserves .	1
I now have two Roberto Devereux 's on DVD , one with Beverley Sills & this one with Alexandrina Pendatchanska . I raved about the Sills recording ; but having seen this one , I am gob-smacked . I thought Sills could act ! You have n't seen anything till you see Pendatchanska 's Elizabetta . It is so life-like , it 's scary . To be perfectly honest , I had never heard of this woman until now . I did not know what I was getting , as I did not know any of the cast , so I was apprehensive when I first played this DVD.All I can say , I was glad no one could see me when it finished as I was clapping and shouting like a fool . I was in tears & could hardly speak as I was so emotional . Never have I seen such a production like this . The staging , cast , costumes , lighting & Orchestra were much more than I expected . Giuseppe Sabatini 's Roberto matched Pendatchanska 's Elizabetta to a tee . Roberto Serville & Ildiko Komlosi 's Nottingham ( Duke ) & Sara ( Duchess ) were a perfectly matched husband & wife team . This is just one of those gems you stumble upon once in a life time . I just love this opera and have many recordings of it on LP , CD & DVD and I just happen to see this one and bought it on speck , not knowing what it would be like & got more than I bargained for . So it is unashamedly that I can strongly recommend this version to you over all the others . I 'm not usually pushy in my reviews , but this opera has changed that.The quality of the picture is perfect and you are offered two sound systems ; Dolby Stereo & Dolby 5.1 Surround ; which brings me to mention a couple of times the singers go off mike , but on the whole the sound is very good .	1
Roberto Devereux is considered by some authorities the finest of Donizetti 's tragic operas ( I think that 's a bit of a stretch - there is still Lucia , with more imaginative melodic invention ) . This is a very fine performance from the Teatro di San Carlo , where it was first staged in 1837 and first revived ( with the Turkish diva Leyla Gencer - available on Opera Doro ) in 1964.This may be a dress rehearsal since the auditorium is half empty ( the premiere was on May 28 1998 ) . Even though it means that there is less give and take with a responsive audience , the singers seem to benefit from the less oppressive presence of the Neapolitan operatic mob . There are no signs of anxiety , everyone warms up to their roles from the first note . Everyone , including the conductor and orchestra are in top shape and give their very best . ( Old European opera houses are infested with gangs of homicidal tradition keepers : if a singer as much as misses one note , the conductor stops the performance , conducts a hasty requiem mass and the wretched singer is dispatched to his creator with a short , sharp shock , from a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block . These frequent executions are part of an East European conspiracy to take over the opera houses of Europe , since they sustain the need for a constant supply of fresh talent from the east bloc ) .The camera crew takes advantage of the higher freedom of movement with sweeping movements that cover the orchestra pit ( and occasionally the stage ) almost side to side , with a very dynamic effect . This is the best camera work I 've seen in any `` live '' opera production on a DVD so far ( although it 's not unusual on rock/pop videos ) . The picture quality is excellent , with vivid colors and well defined picture . The 5.1 Dolby surround sound is the best audio so far on any opera DVD : very focused , with a pleasing feel of `` air '' around the voices , that carries this hollowed auditorium 's sonic signature.Bulgarian soprano Alexandrina Pendatchanska won the 1990 UNISA international singing competition in South Africa . She is Ghena Dimitrova 's student and prot & eacute ; g & eacute ; e , who is reported to have said on Bulgarian television that her student has a truly remarkable talent . A talent indeed she is . In the lyrical passages she has that young girl sound of the old Italian school - light , agile and plaintive . When she digs the spurs in the voice becomes strong and full , almost metallic and quite thrilling . Her superb Elisabetta is musically and dramatically almost overwhelming . She tears into the final scene with ferocity and real pathos . Her voice is expressing both strength and vulnerability in every phrase and the queen 's physical decadence is laid devastatingly bare - an unforgettable performance.Giuseppe Sabbatini in the title role has a such a charismatic stage presence that it is little wonder that the queen almost loses her mind over him . His Devereux is the impetuous heart breaker as well as proudly aristocratic . He is a real artist and stylist and seems to be very well versed in 19th century stylistic practice . His medium-weight voice enables him to bring out the qualities of a bel canto tenor , as well as to project a more dramatic presence . ( The historic Devereux , the 2nd earl of Essex was executed after he tried to organize a revolt against Elisabeth - nothing to do with a love triangle . He constantly provoked her - she put up with his impudence for years because he was her cousin . But she gradually grew alarmed of his behavior , finding him to be & quot ; a nature not to be ruled. & quot ; During one of their disputes , Essex turned his back upon the queen , who promptly slapped his face . He organized the revolt after she confined him to house arrest , following an unsuccessful campaign in Ireland . ) Italian lyric baritone Roberto Servile has a real personality and a wonderful voice . It is quite rare to hear such perfect diction and precise phrasing even from an Italian singer . I found his performance the most satisfying of this cast because of his unusual respect for the text , combined with his lyrical timbre and big voice that fills the auditorium with no hint of strain . His Duke is very convincing in his transformation from the loyal friend to the wronged , raging and vindictive husband . Hungarian soprano Ildik & oacute ; Koml & oacute ; si as his consort is more restrained than Pendatchanska in her singing and acting and thereby provides a musical-dramatic counterpoint . She sings Octavian on the Palermo Der Rosenkavalier DVD that is due to appear later this month.The success of the performance owes much to the sensitive conducting of Alain Guingal that sustains and inspires the singers rather than drowning them.The costumes and sets are gorgeous - all the elements of this production fit in perfectly and are very well thought out , from Koml & oacute ; si 's sad demeanor in the opening scene to the blazing red of Sabatini 's costume.Roberto Devereux is scheduled to open this season at the NYC Opera with Lauren Flanigan as Elisabetta .	1
My 5-star review is based on the two leads in this production . While the rest of the cast was adequate , these two lifted it to a high plane of achievement . Of course , the other star-performer , Donizetti , gets his accolades as ever for his rich and irresistable melodies.The singing by Pendatchanska and Sabatini was beyond praise . Both rose to an occasion that I am thrilled to have had captured ( since I was n't in Naples that night ) . I can not understand how one human can sing the queen without being scraped vocally raw by evening 's end , but Pendatchanska finished this grueling role with panache and beauty of tone . Sabatini while not having as much demanded , sang with lyricism and heart -- something I have not always found in abundance in the past with him in live performance . Perhaps it was just me , because he certainly acquitted himself beautifully here.This is a treasurable performance and will stay on my `` 5-star '' shelf with the very few others that earn that rating from me .	1
Tina was 48 when she performed to this stronge crowd of a record breaking 182,000 . They performed 13 great numbers , but the lighting is so dark in Maracana Stadium , you ca n't tell that there are 182,000 people . Tina voice is not quite at its best and breathlessly belts out most of the tunes for the crowd . At the end Tina looks simply tired and this proves that she loves to please her crowd and they give her thanks for it . Tina You are the best ! Love , Ralph	1
I saw this & quot ; Break every rule & quot ; Tour down under , it was great ! This video is just not quite there . It 's a bit dark at times & amp ; dose n't show the wide stage & amp ; other musicians up close during solos much . This could be due to editing as it 's not the full show . Her excellent band , including Laurie Wisefield on lead guitar , were featured more & amp ; to better effect at the concert . This is however a great collection of songs .	1
If you love Purple , then you know what a treasure this live performance is . If you never tried them , this is the one to buy . Geezers like me remember them when they were in the making , the bad times , the reunion , then this concert surfaces only to show the world what true artists these guys really are . Regardless of any personal issues exist among them , they REALLY come together and the music is too precise to believe.As for the director - he shot too much Gillan and not enough of the band because although John and Steve get their fair share of camera , Paice and Glover lack the spotlight they so well deserve . Both are - in MY honest opinion - the finest drummer and bassist in Rock history . The direction is wonderfull other than that , but Gillan holds the record for looong intros and endings and even the band shares the audiences annoyance over his long winded dialogues . `` Abandon '' takes the best of Purple , and exponentially increases it 's impact and the mystique of the band does n't falter for a second .	1
The first copy I got was intended to another country , would n't play . I figured every copy the store had would be bad . Not so . Had them try out another copy and it worked fine . It just kinda leaves me breathless to watch this show . These guys are great . Much like myself , I 'm surprised we are all still around . I can watch this DVD over and over .	1
I Buy this dvd today and only i can say is it 's very good ! Thanks J.Lo ! I Love You !	1
Fans and critics seem to be divided on the merits and sincerity of Jennifer Lopez ' first shot at a music career ( specifically , the mixed reaction to her best-selling 1999 debut album ON THE 6 ) .Granted , Ms. Lopez is hardly on the creative edge of popular music . Yet to me she has successfully entered the fray with an entertaining brew of Latin/soul/hip-hop , ideally suited to her attractive , better-than-rated vocals and energetic dance style . Furthermore , in the interviews seen here she seems sincere about where she wants to go with her music -- it appears she guides the production staff moreso than vice-versa . Only time will tell if she 's got staying power as a musical performer , but she could probably give up her day job as a talented actress if she wanted to ... and continue to land on her feet for some time to come.The DVD of FEELIN ' SO GOOD is a recommended buy for her fans . On the surface , it 's merely the VH1 documentary reconfigured for 5.1 DD sound . Yet nine complete videoclips ( including some remixes ) are accessible in a stand-alone manner , and there are additional live performances from various sources , plus other minor extras . Although some of the tv appearances seem to be lip-sync 'd , her dancing prowess is always a visual treat ... and a reminder of how fun and entertaining videoclips can be ( think of Janet Jackson , Will Smith , and other performers who concoct charismatic , well-choreographed mini-musicals for the cameras ) .	1

This is the DVD of the DirecTv `` Freeview '' broadcast of this concert . As was the case with that broadcast , this DVD does not include `` Close To The Edge '' nor `` Hearts '' .As one band member quipped , Igor does a better Rick than Rick ; he shines on Awaken and the Ladder tracks in particular . Billy Sherwood helps fill out the sound/vocals throughout and thanks to him we get a nice version of the Grammy award-winning instrumental `` Cinema '' but he could have been higher in the mix . ( There are some older gentlemen on stage who do their part and some of whom could use a bit of fashion advice ! ) Included is a 5.1 studio remix of Homeworld and the sound is awesome . Unfortunately , though good , the sound for the concert itself is not quite up to this standard . The aspect is 16:9 not 4:3 ... . small venue ... enthusiastic crowd and solid overall performance . No problems with my copy . Highly recommended .	1
This DVD is perfect ! The concert is played perfectly , Billy Sherwood creates more richness to the sound ( plays a nice solo on The Owner of a Lonely Heart ) and Igor Khoroshev is not worse in any aspect than Rick Wakeman ... only 2 songs The Lightning Strikes and The Messenger are not good , well , I 've never liked them at all . Here you can also see live performance of Homeworld ( The Ladder ) , some additional footage of Yes working in the Studio with short interviews . The quality of sound is perfect as well as the picture on the screen . One of the best singing of Jon Anderson I 've ever heard on the shows . Everything is played crystally clear ! Definitely buy this CD if you are a Yes fan . By the way , you may have heard that some of these DVDs have problem playing normallly , well , mine is perfectly fine , no complaints ! A must have ! Enjoy !	1
As a longtime fan of Yes , I am pleased that after 30+ years we finally have a superb concert video of the band . Taped originally in HDTV format , this DVD is a special treat for those viewers who have a progressive-scan ( 480p ) DVD player and an HD-ready television . The video is brilliant and sharp , and the Dolby Digital 5.1-channel sound mix is exquisite . Each instrument can be heard in detail , which , considering the prodigious musical skills of each band member , is a real listening pleasure.Yes fans will especially appreciate the excellent performances of Yours Is No Disgrace ( the opening number ) , Homeworld ( from the most recent CD ) , and Awaken . Standards like Roundabout , And You And I , and Your Move/I 've Seen All Good People are done competently if cursorily , and the technical quality of the sound and picture is hands above any other Yes footage to date.Guitarist Steve Howe is in great form , as good as he has ever been . He and bassist Chris Squire play a variety of beautiful and unusual instruments , which fellow musicians will enjoy seeing ( Squire even has a 3-necked bass on Awaken ; the top neck is basically the bottom 3 strings of a standard electric guitar . Perhaps this instrument was built just for this song ! ) . Squire and vocalist Jon Anderson seem to really enjoy the performance , and their positive attitude adds to the viewer 's enjoyment . In addition to his vocal duties , Anderson plays a variety of interesting incidental instruments , including a miniature harp he hangs on his chest with a shoulder strap . Unfortunately , the younger generation of Yes-men , guitarist-vocalist Billy Sherwood and keyboardist Ivan Khoroshev , do n't get enough air time . Both are incredible musicians , and it would have been nice to see more of them ( sadly , Sherwood has since left the group ) . Yes is not a big drum band , but longtime drummer Alan White gets his share of shots , and he also seems to be having a good time.Several DVD extras are worth mentioning . The best is a DD 5.1 channel mix of Homeworld , which is a totally different experience from hearing it on audio CD . The video that plays during Homeworld consists of shots of the video game of the same name ; this is also fairly interesting . There are also interviews with all band members ( except White ) and a few shots of them playing in the studio.Considering progressive-scan video source , DD 5.1 sound mix , and overall performance quality , this DVD is a must-have for the home theater enthusiast , and of course for any Yes fan .	1
I have been a fan of Yes since I first heard the & quot ; Tormato & quot ; album in 1978 , but there has never been a full-length concert video of the band , ... until now ! & quot ; The House of Yes & quot ; is beautifully recorded , both in terms of the clear , well-mixed audio , and the bright , colorful visual presentation ( although I 'm not sure why the concert is presented in the widescreen & quot ; letterbox & quot ; format ) . This also the only & quot ; official & quot ; live Yes recording to feature Yes ' late 90 's six man line-up with guitarist/vocalist Billy Sherwood , and ol ' Billy gets in some good moments here , especially on the newer tracks & quot ; Face To Face & quot ; , & quot ; The Messenger & quot ; , and & quot ; Lightening Strikes & quot ; . The bands newest keyboardist Igor Khoroshev also makes a great showing for himself , and manages to steal the spotlight in many places ! The set list really represents the overall history of Yes quite well , with a mix of classic 70 's showpeices ( & quot ; Yours Is No Disgrace & quot ; , & quot ; And You and I & quot ; , & quot ; Perpertual Change & quot ; ) , early 80 's rockers ( & quot ; Cinema & quot ; , & quot ; Owner of a Lonely Heart & quot ; ) and a healthy dose of energetic material from 1999 's & quot ; The Ladder & quot ; ( including the great prog epic & quot ; Homeworld & quot ; ) . The only major disappointment is an extremely edited-down version of the Yes classic & quot ; Roundabout & quot ; , which excludes the the acoustic intro , middle verses ( & quot ; out on the drifting clouds/the eagle searching down on the land & quot ; ) , and even parts of the instrumental break ... one must wonder why they even bothered to play the song at all ! But some of the many highpoints , like an emotionally dramatic performance of the majestic epic & quot ; Awaken & quot ; , go a long way towards making up for this disappointment . If you are a Yes fan , old or new , then this is certainly one for your collection !	1
Good quality video and 5.1 sound , I recommend it.I noticed that there is one song missing in the DVD , Close to the Edge.According yesworld.com set list : Venue : Las Vegas , NV , October 31 , 1999Setlist : FIREBIRD SUITEYOURS IS NO DISGRACEEXCERPT FROM TIME AND A WORDHOMEWORDPERPETUAL CHANGELIGHTNING STRIKESTHE MESSENGEREXCERPT FROM NOUS SOMMES DU SOLEILAND YOU AND ICLOSE TO THE EDGEIT WILL BE A GOOD DAYFACE TO FACE HEARTSAWAKENI 'VE SEEN ALL GOOD PEOPLEENCORE ; CINEMA OWNER OF A LONELY HEARTROUNDABOUTROCKIN'N'THE HOUSE OF BLUESWho knows why ? Any way , good work . Cartoons only in the bonus tracks , it is OK .	1
House of Yes includes performances of 5 songs from The Ladder and these are the highlights of the concert , especially `` Face to Face , '' `` Lightning Strikes '' and `` Homeworld '' . While performing these songs the legendary band 's enthusiasm for this wonderfully uplifting music is highly infectious and makes listening to and watching this DVD a euphoric experience . The earlier `` classic '' Yes works are performed reasonably well , although perhaps not quite up to the level of versions available on other recent DVDs ( such as Live at Montreux for `` Awaken '' and Songs from Tsongas for `` Yours is No Disgrace '' ) . Igor Khoroshev does a pretty good job subbing for Rick Wakeman . Billy Sherwood joins as a 6th member of the normally 5 piece group and his contribution is an added bonus .	1
A Great concert for any Yes fan ! I do n't know why Billy Sherwood is on it . I know he was on the Ladder tour , but Steve can do ALL of the guitar parts by himself !	1
I saw this performance shown on the HD NET . It was filmed at the House of Blues , but not the one in Hollywood . It shows Brown at his best and should be a collectible for everyone who liked his work . I have ordered it on DVD but as yet it has n't arrived . He did his best work at this performance and he is truly missed . I think you would enjoy watching it over and over , as I will . As we age we all lose our favorite entertainers . But , when they have recorded their work , they will live on .	1
I enjoyed his albums and movie . this one is a great one to get if you like to see how they made the album .	1
Having been in the same group of surfers as Bruce , surfing the Ranch at the same times ( I was the young kid that asked a million questions and borrowed wax that never got returned ) I could n't wait to see how he had set so many shots up for TES . I had a great talk with Robert August about an article I was going to do on Tahiti for Surfer . Great guy.. The '' Revisited '' version was that much more interesting.. Great laughs ! ! Its a keeper for us that can bring back memories from those great uncrowded days..It is worth every penny..Jim PilkentonClyde Beatty Surfboards , Santa BarbaraOakley Team , Kanvas By Katin TeamXcel wetsuit Team ... .	1
Once again , like in past decades , Mr Brownand now with his son , remake the classiceven better ! More of a compliation but alsomore complete ! Pick Up On It !	1
I found this worth the cost to me but mostly for the historical view . The music can be heard on a CD much better and quite honestly I did n't hear a lot being said by Basie or Gillespie ( Coltrane declined to be interviewed ) .But what a treat to see the footage of a Public TV Broadcast of the 60 's . Gleason 's questions and attempt at dialog sounds very dated . Of course it was not atypical of the era but by today 's standards he sounds amaturish and unprepared . But thankfully he did do these shows and we now get to see things in the exact setting of the era when they were done . I probably wo n't watch this all that often but I will pull it out now and again .	1
It seems as though this disc polarizes the reviewers ; either they love it or hate it . Though it has its flaws , I 'd have to say it 's very worthwhile . I agree with the ones who did n't like Ralph J. Gleason 's style . Yes , he 's irritating , but he takes up very little time on the Gillespie and Coltrane segments . See the `` Jazz Scene USA '' series with Oscar Brown , Jr. for a late 50s/early 60s era jazz program with a first rate host and better production values . At first viewing I thought the Basie segment was disappointing , but it 's grown on me . Diz was the main reason I bought this disc , and he did n't disappoint . He was even a good sport for the interview . His segment cooks at a consistent simmer . Very nice , but Coltrane cuts Diz for the highlight of the program . He 's at one of his peaks , with a killer band , and they just keep ratcheting the intensity up higher and higher until the end . I 'm not sure about the guy who gave this one star ... he talks as if the picture and sound are worse than they actually are ( reasonable but not stellar for their era ) and like Gleason was on between every song ( he was for Basie 's and The Count seemed annoyed ) . I 'd like to see more of these 3-on-1 Jazz Casual compilations . A single disc of 30 minutes with no bonus material is a waste .	1
I was hooked the very first segment with Basie backed by Freddie Green on guitar , Norman Keenan on bass and Sonny Payne on drums doing `` Do n't Know '' . Payne 's virtuoso brushwork blew me away . And his clowning never ceases to make me smile . The entire set was a highlight for me , but I am a big Basie fan as well as a drummer who enjoys watching and hearing Sonny Payne.Dizzy 's set was my second favorite . My attention was drawn to both Lalo Schifrin whose prolific body of movie and TV scores is his main claim to fame , and Leo Wright 's flute work on Lorraine . Of course Dizzy shined on all three songs in my opinion . Since I am a drummer I have to admit that I was surprised by Chuck Lampkin 's drum kit . In 1961 double rack toms ( the two tom toms on the bass drum ) were rare even in rock , and especially so in jazz . Also , many jazz drummers of the era played Gretsch drums , so it was surprising to me to see him playing Rogers . I will say his playing was superb.Coltrane 's set is what his fans come to expect . Trane somehow managed to impart an aura of spirituality in his live playing , and it managed to come through on this televised segment as well.A word about Gleason : as some have rightfully said , he comes across as , well , a dork . He also made the Jazz Casual series possible and this video and a plethora of others are - in my opinion - cultural treasures that would not exist had it not been for him . Therefore , I am not going to criticize his interviewing techniques . The music is far more important and the music in this video is both enjoyable to hear and watch being played .	1
A gift to humanity , a spiritual talent beyond discription .	1
This is an early Cece solo album . It is so profound and soulful it might be hard to compare to some of her other CDs . This is a wonderful and blessed project . God bless Sis . Winans .	1
& quot ; We came in & quot ; are the first words you hear on the epic double album . They 're spoken over some quiet music that suddenly turns into the first loud chords of In The Flesh ? that introduces to Pink Floyd , both the band and the fictional rock star that goes insane over the course of the record , building an imaginary wall that shuts him off from the rest of the world . The relaxed rocker is one of the Real Songs found on the album , not just short snippets of filler used to illustrate the point of the story . As the chords of Flesh ? fade away , in comes the short piano ballad The Thin Ice which flows into the clasic Another Brick In The Wall , Part One ( the radio one is part two ) after a bizarre guitar solo . These three tracks represent The Wall : no pauses in between songs and blending loud rock with soft ballads seemlessly . Rather than describe all 26 songs , I 'll just mention some of the highlights . Of the real songs , All Another Brick In The Wall Parts , Mother , a woonded accoustic , Goodbye Blue Sky , a dark ballad with a cheery melody for the title line , Young Lust , a rocker , Hey You , a slow accoustic song , Comfortably Numb , an amazing ballad , In The Flesh , Run Like Hell , a song you 'll swear you 've heard before with it 's jangly guitars and rock beat , and The Trial , a Crepy song where Pink prosocutes himself within his distured mind while chanting eerily & quot ; Crazy ... I am Crazy ... . & quot ; Another thing about this album is it seems like one ( well , two ) long songs . Proof of that is a guitar riff that constantly appears out of nowhere , especially on Disc Two . Buy this album , ignore the high price and enjoy .	1
Do n't bother comparing it with other Pink Floyd albums . Do n't listen to people who do n't like it because it 's `` too long '' , `` too weird '' , `` too depressing '' or anything like that . This is the definitive concept album of all time . No album has used a story to convey the emotion , philosophy , and overall knowledge of its author than `` The Wall '' .Roger Waters made a masterpiece here . Some criticize him , saying that he became a control freak and forced his ideas upon the rest of the band . How can anyone blame him ? His vision for `` The Wall '' was so perfect that he did not want it to be tarnished by other influences . Besides , the other Pink Floyd members did not have much quality material to bring to the table anyway , and what little they had ( Gilmour 's collaborations on `` Comfortably Numb '' , `` Young Lust '' and `` Run Like Hell '' ) Roger Waters gladly accepted.The album focuses on themes of alienation and the metaphorical walls that we build around ourselves to protect ourselves from the harsh realities of life . Each traumatic event in our life is a building block for this wall . Roger Waters ' motifs and symbols have been interpreted by hundreds and are still analyzed to this day . The amount of complexity in the lyrics is staggering . This album has the literary effect that any classic novel can bring , along with music that rivals any band at their best.Musically , this album has no equal . It is not the dreamy , atmospheric sound of `` Dark Side of the Moon '' . It is much more dark and melancholy than that album . It also tends to be more rock-oriented , shedding psycadelic tendencies for arena rock-esque riffs and rocking songs . But that should n't turn any `` Dark Side '' fans away . It 's just as significant as that album was . It has production and musicianship that surpasses anything the Floyd had previously done . This album proves that Pink Floyd could work in a variety of different sounds , yet still retain their trademark sound , as `` Dark Side '' , `` Wish You Were Here '' and `` Animals '' did.This album has changed my life . It 's made me more aware of the effect that the past can have on our lives , and the consequences of loneliness . There 's too many insights that I 've gained from this album , and they 're probably different for everybody else anyway . Basically , this album needs to be given a chance by everyone . It 's sheer brilliance will really astound you .	1
Please people , stop rating each track individually . You can not possible rate an album such as ` The Wall ' in this way.And those who rate it as ` gloomy and depressing ' , IT 'S SUPPOSED TO BE , FOR **** 'S SAKE ! ! It 's about the decent into madness of a Rock star who 's off his trolley on puff , neglecting his wife , lost his dad , mollycoddled by his mum and just generally hates the world . Yes it 's self indulgent , but look through the indulgence and you will see there 's a message here . It 's message is similar in a way to Supertramp 's ` Hide in your shell ' , in that it 's telling you to stop living in your own cocoon of fear and loathing , and to wake up and realise that there are people who care for you , and people with similar or even worse problems than you.If anything , I find this album uplifting . Just listen to the lyrics on 'Outside the Wall'.I 've listened intently to The Wall for over 24 years . The whole album is a master class in musical production , including the clever subliminal things that you do n't notice unless someone brings it to your attention.Is n't this where ... ...	1
I 'm not a Pink Floyd fan . But the one album which belongs in every single person 's music collection , no matter what that person 's taste is , is definitely The Wall.It is like one long song , one story , beautifully and very artistically compiled via a number of shorter masterpieces in themselves.Describing The Wall in words is a task nobody can fulfill . So just buy it . It belongs in your collection , believe me . 'Cause this is THE masterpiece of music art . The best album ever released , ever ! And I 'm not a Pink Floyd fan ...	1
Timeless . This album was way ahead of its time . I find myself always going back to it . One of there many great ones .	1
All in all this a tremendously ugly album ! The music , much of it ranging from morose/somber to angry and frustrated , is a perfect background for the poetic story of Roger Waters semi-fictional character . A character based loosely on his own feelings about growing up without a father ( WWII ) and partially on Syd Barrett , the band 's original front man . The Wall is a fascinating and artful interpretation of what happens to a generation robbed of strong father figures . This album is one of the darkest pieces of popular music ever written and undoubtedly will go down in the annals of musical history as a unique masterpiece .	1
It 's ironic that Pink Floyd 's ominous double concept album `` The Wall '' was released at a time when , to quote drummer Nick Mason , `` There was no friendship within the four members . '' And as Mark Fisher ( stage designer for the extravagant live performances of `` The Wall '' ) pointed out , `` There was this metaphor for the problems in life that arise due to noncommunication being executed by a band that was absolutely failing to communicate [ amongst themselves ] . `` But nonetheless , the album is relatively flawless . No artist has done anything quite like it since . Its power , its strength , its gloomy atmosphere all remain one of Pink Floyd 's lasting trademarks , and one of the biggest selling albums ever ( currently in the top forty highest sellers of all time ) .Pink Floyd -- always hailed as the perfectors of the concept album -- present their most complex story to date ; `` The Wall '' is the story of a pop singer , `` And there it ends , '' says Bob Geldof , who portrayed the character in the film version ( the fact that it was turned into a film alone should tell you how phenomenal the record was ) . Tracing his emotionally damaged life , the album builds the character without missing a detail , although sometimes speeding through things ; shortly before the character is born , his father is killed in action in World War II ( 'Another Brick in the Wall , Part 1 ' . This is based on a true event that happened to Pink Floyd 's principle songwriter Roger Waters ) . A related 'brick ' is the war that left his homeland scarred ( 'Goodbye Blue Sky ' ) . From there , he is faced with an overprotective mother ( 'Mother ' ) and a harsh , faceless , cruel life at school ( 'The Happiest Days of Our Lives ' , 'Another Brick in the Wall , Part 2 ' ) . After growing up , the character becomes a rock star , a desperate attempt at escaping the pain of his childhood . He also gets married , unfortunately to the woman who scars him even further by cheating on him ( 'One of My Turns ' , 'Do n't Leave Me Now ' ) . Finally , the last few bricks to his metaphorical wall of emotions are added , and he closes himself from the rest of the world ( 'Another Brick in the Wall , Part 3 ' , 'Goodbye Cruel World ' ) .The second half of the album partly depicts the character in his hotel room , dwelling on his painful past , and unhappy position as a rock star ( 'Is There Anybody Out There ? ' , 'Nobody Home ' ) . One of the strongest studies of the character is 'Comfortably Numb , ' which shows how all of the pain he has endured , added with a drug addiction , has transformed him into an emotionless being . Further expressing this are 'In the Flesh ' , and 'Waiting For the Worms ' which depict how his rock star life and dominating peers have turned him into a fascist , yet still causing him to fear for his life.Undoubtedly the most powerful piece in `` The Wall '' is 'The Trial , ' which fantastically depicts the character 's decision to 'tear down the wall ' and face his past , his present , and his future.All of these things form a metaphorical 'brick ' in a wall that the character used to fence himself from his feelings , and from the rest of the world . Although `` The Wall '' is mostly the work of Roger Waters , every contribution from each member of Pink Floyd is key to the album 's power -- though their contributions were limited ; keyboardist Rick Wright was forced out of the band by Waters during the album 's production , and drummer Nick Mason was even replaced entirely on one track . And though the tension that surrounded the band at that time is evident , it somehow adds to the gloomy atmosphere of `` The Wall '' , almost strengthening the entire album . Truly ironic . Every piece of the album is necessary in order to tell the story -- even the seemingly diminutive and forgettable pieces like 'Vera ' or 'Bring the Boys Back Home . ' To use a shopworn cliche ` , `` The Wall '' is a masterpiece that was truly ahead of its time . It has yet to be matched , much less topped in quality .	1
The wall is a treat for the ears and imagination . the songs are mostly hard rock . goodbye bluesky is anacoustic about the blitz in ww2 . is there anybodyoutthere is a nice instrametal . the sound qulity of the wall is unreal on bringtheboyshome it sounds like the drummers are inthe speaker . on the knock on the door to . the wall is easy to enjoy a beautifful listening experiance .	1
People , look up stuff before you f**king talk ! `` The Wall '' is not about some random , self obsessed Rock star , it 's about Pink Anderson , a f**king Blues musician that was one of Pink Floyd 's influences ! Hence the name PINK Floyd . Can you guess what Floyd was for ? You guessed it ! Another Blue 's musician ! How can you say the musicianship is terrible ? If I do n't recall , David Gilmour is one of the greatest guitarists to ever live , and a damn good songwriter too ! Nick Mason was a great drummer with lots of rhythm . Roger Waters ? Do n't even get me started on him . Wake up you ignorant pieces of s**t , cause you do n't even know what you 're talking about , yet you try and sound as intelligent as possible so you do n't lose your credibility , but you come off as unintelligent as possible based on your inaccurate information and ignorant opinions.And stop with the multiple posts and/or writing multiple reveiws under different names , it makes you look stupid . You 're not fooling anybody with your over-repeated nonsense , and it proves you have no life , and nothing else better to do than to try and put down and bring down the rating for one of the greatest Rock albums of all time ( even with all those negative reviews , the average is still 4 and a half stars , proving you wasted your time , buh-bye ) . You ca n't claim to be a Rock 'n ' Roll fan , and yet listen to the stuff listed on your profiles , it just does n't make sense . That particular comment is intended for about half of you losers who chose to actually use your name.Once again , stop wasting your time . Otherwise , a five star album . This was just kind of a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing .	1
Although I do n't listen to this one as much as the other Floyd discs anymore this is definately worthy of the praise its been getting . If you do n't own this album yet then you can not consider yourself a serious music fan , PERIOD .	1
I had this album as a kid and I thought it was great , but it kind of got me down because it 's mood is heavy . Roger Waters is on a bad trip . Anyway , my father had n't been killed by the Japanese and I was n't dropping bad acid either so I did n't want to share the angst . I ended up giving the album away to my brother which coincided with the start of his problems with society .	1
Wow ... ... If anyone could sum up this album in one word , that would be it . 'The Wall ' is not only the ultimate Pink Floyd album ( in my opinion , at least ) , it is the most creative and awe-inspring recording probably ever . From the explosive opening guitar riff of & quot ; In The Flesh ? & quot ; to the final harmonies of & quot ; Outside The Wall & quot ; , 'The Wall ' takes the most extensive journey of the mind , heart and soul of any rock album ever made . With the excellent production of Bob Ezrin ( who also produced KISS ' classic 'Destroyer ' ) , to the legendary David Gilmour and of course , the brainchild of the whole thing , Roger Waters , The Floyd told the story of a man who was at war his whole life with one person - himself . From the death of his father in WWII , his overprotective mother , his superstardom as a rock musician and the excess which accompanied it , his unfaithful wife , his inability to cope with the rest of the world , and finally , his freefall into insanity , no other recording in history has come as close to telling an actual story so completely and masterfully , in just the confines of music . While experiencing 'The Wall ' , one ca n't help but feel the angst of & quot ; Another Brick In The Wall Part 2 & quot ; , the confusion of & quot ; Empty Spaces & quot ; , the uncontrollable rage of & quot ; One Of My Turns & quot ; , the hopelessness of & quot ; Goodbye Cruel World & quot ; , and the guilt of & quot ; The Trial & quot ; . This album never fails to get my emotions going , and one of the unique qualities 'The Wall ' has , it that one discovers something new in it with each listen . The outstanding production covered all the bases ; there are hidden messages behind every background noise , spoken phrase , etc. , to help bring the entire plot together . This is without a doubt my favorite album out of my entire catalog , and something I can never let sit long enough to collect any dust . So , in closing , sit back with an open ear , an open mind , take the time to listen to all of the lyrics , and enjoy arguably the best album of all time.Is n't this where ... ...	1
Not exactly sure which release date my cd is , but I had no problems with the sound quality ... there are versions of this which are listed as being remastered , but that was done years ago , apparently . Will limit this review to just the songs that I think are particularly noteworthy ... or remind me of other songs . Anyway , this is the first album described as a concept album where I can actually see that the label is meaningful and not just a woolly term applied more in hope than certainty . As you listen to this double cd album , you 'll realise that it is thematically coherent and the songs relate to the unfolding story ( that second listen had me pick up on the trajectory of the album 's central character ... the album gives you their conception and points to their death ) . It comes across as filmic in quality , with ambient soundbites which paint a picture of an artist in decline ... physical and mental . These moments are like scenes in a movie . Subsequent listens reinforce this perception and make it even clearer . Recently watched a docu which made me realise that perhaps the concept behind this album was even clearer when viewed in concert . That docu might have been `` Which one 's Pink ? `` , or the multi-episode docu series on the history of rock music , by the BBC ... '' Seven ages of rock '' . The episode this album featured ( if it did ) would have been the one concerning stadium rock . In any case , my point is that watching the album performed in concert would create the necessary imagery to grasp the nature of the story contained in the work . The album did that well enough , in my view , but watching the docu made me realise I was missing elements which would have made the album clearer in intent.The Classics : The happiest days - like a lot of tracks on this album , it features a cool transition to it from the previous song . You hear a helicopter , then the musical theme of the following track is established . Great vocal theatre in the song . A brilliant , operatic score . Drums are interesting at the end . More themes and motifs of the following track are introduced.Another brick in the wall ( part 2 ) - another brilliant transition to this song . Great lyrics , cool guitar and especially bass guitar work at the start . The guitar solo at the end of this song is my pick as the greatest guitar solo of all time . The children 's choir in the middle is also really cool . An all time great song.Comfortably numb - makes use of the preceding song 's lyrics . Bassy , synth , cool vocal theatre . Has beautiful , swirling violin type sounds . The lyrics are excellent . Not sure if this is the first song that deliberately includes extraneous human noises ... you hear the singer clear his throat at the start . Maybe Jimi Hendrix did this kind of stuff too ... just do n't remember . In one Hendrix song you could hear him chewing gum , but I do n't think that that was intentional , like it was in other songs of his.Run like Hell - yet another really cool intro , with the riff and beat . Sounds like Gilmour is rubbing the guitar strings initially , for effect . This track should have been on their best of `` Echoes '' . The riff is good and open.Best of the rest : Outside the wall - pleasant , mellow , genteel music and singing . Piano accordion and children 's choir feature.Best of the rest ( on second listen ) : The thin ice - opens with a baby crying . Synthy track with a slow tempo . Piano tinkling , gets a bit rock with the lead guitar style.Another brick in the wall ( part 1 ) - very nice note picking on the guitar ... delicate and a little ethereal . Synthesiser plays musical motifs that we know from Brick part 2.and ... Mother - starts with an exhalation , as if to summon the strength to sing the song . About the unhealthy relationship with the central character 's mum . Acoustic guitar , organ and bassy sound feature.By the by ... In the flesh - has Black Sabbath open riffs type rock . Starts with the harmonica then gets Gothic . Veers to more 'normal ' type rock , with a good tone to the drums , and some 1950s style backing vocals.Goodbye blue sky - nice acoustic guitar part which reminds me of Metallica 's immortal song `` Fade to black '' ( the part before their killer riff kicks in ) . Pleasant vibe to this track.Empty spaces - an instrumental to start with , then you hear voices ( backwards ) , then the lyrics start.Young lust - riff a little bit `` Walk this way '' , by Aerosmith . Funky . Rock song with a very bassy sound . Keyboard . A key part of the thematic progress of this album.One of my tunes - arty , like a movie scene . Then it gets a bit psychotic rock.Hey you - guitar has a `` Sounds of silence '' vibe to it ( Simon & Garfunkel song ) . Delicate electric guitar and bass . Slow tempo.War - wistful lyrics of Vera Lynne ( famous English singer during World War II ) . Organ , acoustic guitar , some orchestral arrangement.Bring the boys back home - rousing orchestra , choir , military style drumming , overwrought male vocals.The show must go on - 1950s style harmonies ( barber shop quartet territory ) as well as Beatles style harmonies.In the flesh - Beach Boys type harmonies and vocals , 1950s style bass . Starts off as a rock instrumental with open riffs , then going on to bigoted lyrics ( part of the concept ) .Waiting for the worms - 1950s style surf harmonies . Some German World War II references , bigoted lyrics , piano , bassy , interesting drums . The megaphone voice sounds like that used in the all time Australian psychedelic classic `` The real thing '' , by Russell Morris.The trial - has sort of a `` Baby elephant walk '' vibe to it , with the symphony . Then gets very English musical theatre type stuff . Later there 's some rock guitar and someone who sounds like John Cleese doing a school master type voice.Recommendations ( concept albums ) : Genesis - From Genesis to Revelation . A pleasant listen . A discernable concept to be found ... not as coherent as The Wall though , it seems to me.Frank Zappa & The Mothers Of Invention - Freak out ! A pleasant listen . Ca n't really discern any concept behind this album . Occasionally challenging to listen to , if you only like pleasant music . Gets whimsical and jazzy at times.King Crimson - In the court of the Crimson King . A pleasant listen , for the most ( apart from the more raucous opening track ) . Title track is a beautiful classic . Not sure what the concept is here either ! The Beatles - Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . Over-rated , so do n't go in expecting a masterpiece . `` A day in the life '' is a bona fide masterpiece though . A very slight concept to this album ... which has been overblown , in my opinion . Some Beatles say as much themselves .	1
THE WALL is one of the best albums produced by the greatest rock bands ever.Songs like comfortably numb have made this an evergreen hit which will sell for generations to come.five stars .	1
I do n't see why anyone would n't like this album . Sure it has some bad songs ( Bring the Boys Back Home , The Trial ) but it still deserves 5 stars .	1
This is the kind of album that you ca n't really make . It 's not just the music ( which is brilliant in itself ) but it 's the lyrics , the arrangements and the whole concept together that makes it what it is . Everybody 's heard about this album and everybody should hear it . It 's a milestone in music-history , a symphony of rock .	1
While `` Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 '' may be the most overplayed track in the history of rock n ' roll , it does little to diminish the wealth of good material on this album.Many consider this the band 's true master work , and they can hardly be blamed . Concept album ? Rock Opera ? I rarely use those terms , because many disagree about their meaning , but it could be considered either or both of the those , and Waters 's song writing really shines on this album because he 's able to tell a cohesive story , with all of its ups and downs , over the course of the album 's 81 minutes . While the band often alternates between Roger Waters and David Gilmour on vocals , here Waters 's impassioned singing , which truly seems tinged by madness , is on display . He 's not a great vocalist , and many of these songs are out of his range , but that makes his performance all the more convincing , as he portrays a man slowly going mad with paranoia , xenophobia , and cynicism . As he reaches for notes he ca n't quite hit without sounding like it 's the effort of a lifetime , the listener becomes more and more convinced of the story .	1
Simply put , this is a masterpiece and it tells a story as well as paints a picture . One of the defining rock opuses that extends the creativity and talent of the members of Pink Floyd . I have to mention though that this is Roger Waters baby , he is the godfather of this project as well as Wish you Were here and Dark Side of the Moon . Make no mistake about it , Waters songwriting , Bass playing and singing was the center that did hold for a long , long time for this band.The Wall is epic , so large nobody can touch it . It is something that takes a lifetime to truly experience and understand , and even then you are amazed at how it just continues to grow and change while still showing some of the same things hold true years and years later . Some of the songs really seem like nothing more than toe tapping rockers but if you know the story then you know the depth that is behind those songs.One of the greatest Dual Album studio releases of all time . Forget the cartoon and the drugs and all that other hocus pocus and just soak this in , one day at a time for a lifetime . You wo n't regret it , it will one day be your baby also . They just do n't make records like this anymore , with so much meaning and feeling and power and social and political ideas all melded into one thing ... and that thing is THE WALL by Pink Floyd .	1
There are a lot of rock albums that claim to be the best of all time . THE WALL , in my humble opinion holds that spot . It combines poetic lyrics , atmospheric music and audio effects that continually blow my mind.This concept was turned into a stage production and a video . I feel this will change the way you listen to music . It will challenge your thoughts of what a great rock album should be . If you do n't own this peice or art , you truly have a black hole in your music collection.Roger Waters and David Gilmour have created one of the most ambitious projects in modern rock ! Only Sgt . Peppers and Tommy come close to the same level of expertise as The Wall .	1
Most of the critics consider `` Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band '' as a fundamental album in the `` modern '' music 's history and I totally agree . But if I had to choose the best album ever released it would certainly be Pinkfloyd 's `` The Wall '' . I came across this album for the very first time somewhere around 1985-86 , and at the time I did n't know much about existentialism . I liked the songs of this album , but nothing more . It 's some months later that I began to read some existentialism works by J.P.Sartre , Heidegger , etc and only then I got what Roger Waters was talking ( singing ) about . The music is so sad , but the lyrics are even sadder . Bob Dylan , Jim Morrison and many others sang about the wall ( here representing the human society as a whole ) and how it effects or determines the life of everyone of us , but Walter 's work is surely the deepest !	1
All has been said after more than a thousand review . This is a must have double cd , a great conceptual double album . All kind of musical style , rock ( In the Flesh , Young Lust , Run like hell ) , melodic ballads ( Mother , Goodbye blue sky ) , radio hit ( Another brick part II ) , prog classic ( Confortably Numb ) , classic ( The Trial ) As Amazon , I agree , this is an essential cd . A must have .	1
THE WALL . It 's a classic album and but I do n't believe it 's Pink Floyd at their best . If any other band in the world released an album like this it would be really great . But Pink Floyd can do so much better . Sure , there are great songs like & quot ; Mother & quot ; , & quot ; Another Brick In The Wall PT.2 & quot ; , & quot ; Hey You & quot ; , etc . and my vote for the best song of all-time & quot ; Comfortably Numb & quot ; , but that being said , there are too many stupid filler songs , it 's the only Pink Floyd album that I ca n't listen to from start to finish . It 's not that it 's depressing , I listen to Sentenced , try listening to Sentenced and tell me if this album is depressing . No I like slow , sad music , it 's just that the album has alot of parts that are very unneccasary . Well , that 's enough of my ranting , do n't take it from me , listen to it for yourself . All I 'm saying is I believe albums like & quot ; Wish You We 're Here & quot ; and & quot ; Animals & quot ; are better Floyd pieces than this one .	1
The wall is in my humble opinion the greatest rock album after paranoid by black sabbath and led zeppelin 's fourth album.this contains my favourite songs like ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL and COMFORTABLY NUMB.hugely recommended .	1
My favorite line in the whole album . So the Wall , many consider it Pink Floyd 's magnum opus but just as many consider it their worst album . I 'll admit that for two years I was one of the ones that believed the Wall to be a bad album . My brother praised it but I did not get it.Two years after first hearing it I am shocked by how good it is . I think I just needed to mature musically in order to understand it . The second half is pretty much perfect while the first is a little slow . Ca n't recommend this album enough , do yourself a favor and hear it now .	1
Although it lacks the vision behind Beatle 's White or the dexterity of Lamb Lies from Genesis , The Wall can take its place amongst rock 's finer double album 's ; if not accentuating production subtlety certainly producing a virtual hit factory which could joyously be disassembled piece by piece .	1
I work in radio , and I get paid to listen to music ( God BLESS America ! ) and I have always found pleasure in being able to enjoy music by Pink Floyd ... and 'The Wall ' ranks up there in MY opinion as easily one of the top-10 best albums in rock music . While the debate rages over their inclusion into the pantheon of 'all-time best ' I firmly believe that even after listening to 'The Wall ' for the trillionth time , that Roger Waters has written a true modern audio masterpiece . And like most albums you buy and have to skip the 'lesser known ' tracks that do n't achieve the greatness of some of the songs , with 'The Wall ' you just slip the CD in , hit play and enjoy all-the-way-through.Like many fans of Pink Floyd , my first REAL introduction to their music came from the repetitious airplay of 'Another Brick In The Wall Part II ' and I 'd apologize for the over-play of that tune , but I NEVER got tired of hearing it . But there was so much MORE to this incredible album . 'Run Like Hell ' & amp ; 'Hey You ' are just two examples of songs that compel you to listen . And of course 'Comfortably Numb ' , without a doubt one of 'Floyds ' greatest musical pieces . If you are a fan of this band , and you DO N'T have 'The Wall ' in your collection , it is high time you forked over the $ and sit back and enjoy some really great stuff . Trust me , this is rock music that WILL endure .	1
I do recall that when this album was released ( 1979 ) it sold like hotcakes . I also recall getting pretty sick of hearing the line `` we do n't need no education '' ( from Another Brick in the Wall Pt . II ) on the radio , not to mention seeing the anthem scribbled on walls and schoolbook covers . At any rate , this was a huge album for the group and showed them adopting aspects of the ( then ) popular stadium rock styles . This was also the last album that featured the classic lineup . Indeed , this was very much Roger 's album and while conceptually dense , I like the concepts presented on Dark Side of the Moon ( 1973 ) better.The lineup includes Roger Waters ( vocals , bass guitar ) , David Gilmour ( electric and acoustic guitars , vocals , fretted and fretless bass guitar ) , Nick Mason ( drums and percussion ) and the late Rick Wright ( organ piano , synthesizers ) . While the musicianship is still pretty good , this was not much of a group effort , and the atmospherics that characterized some of their best pieces were pretty much out the door.The music was very much influenced by Roger and the melodies suffered because of it . Indeed , the music could be harsh at times and lyrically ugly - this was a very depressing album that principally served as a vehicle for Roger to explore issues of a personal nature e.g. , the death of his father during the war and an overbearing mother ( see Nicholas Schaffner 's book `` A Saucerful of Secrets '' for more details ) . Even more depressing is the fact that the concept is cyclical . Some of my favorite tunes on the album ( including Comfortably Numb ) were written by Dave , who also played a few of the most interesting bass lines on the album - including parts on a fretless ( introduction to Hey You ) . Unfortunately , Rick Wright was barely present on the album and the lack of his contributions on keyboards is noticeable . As a side note , the relationship between Roger and Rick was extremely strained at this point and Roger went so far to take stabs at Rick in the lyrics - e.g. , `` I have a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains '' . In the box set compilation of live performances of The Wall from 1980 , you can hear Rick pound out the piano parts when Roger sings this line . The departure of Rick from the group was announced later in 1982.Although not as cool as my old LP , this remastered version is pretty good and features the lyrics and good sound quality.All in all , while not my favorite Pink Floyd album , The Wall certainly has its moments and served to bail the band out financially - at the time , they suffered massive financial loss following some bad investments . Come to think of it , I even went so far as to see the film version of The Wall in the theater , although I found it to be just as depressing as the album . For those folks that enjoyed The Wall , yet may be new to group , you might want to check out Meddle ( 1971 ) , Dark Side of the Moon ( 1973 ) , the excellent Wish You Were Here ( 1975 ) , and Animals ( 1977 ) . The Final Cut ( 1983 ) was the last gasp for Roger and continues in the vein of The Wall .	1
To me & quot ; The Wall & quot ; is the second best album of all time ( with Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness ahead by a tiny bit . ) The is n't really just an album , it 's one large song , you ca n't listen to this to this album without listening to the whole album ! It 's that great ! When I first got this album , I knew of Pink Floyd but was n't really a big fan of them , my sister had Pink Floyd 's & quot ; Relics & quot ; and I thought that it was pretty good , and so I bought this album . I started listening to it and I could n't stop listening , like how you ca n't put down a book . On the first day I got it I listened to this album three times in a row ! I 've listened to it at least one time through every day since then , it 's that great ! The lyrics are some of the best I 've ever heard , the music go on in the background is wonderful ! I 'm not a huge fan of guitar solos ( although occasionally I can enjoy them ) but all the solos in this album really speak to you and actually improve the song . If you do n't have this album , I advise you to go out and buy it today , you really wo n't regreat it !	1
I have this on album , have the live release on cd as well as the release of `` The Wall in Berlin '' . This is a must have , period . As with most Pink Floyd recordings , important to listen to this from start to finish . See the movie release , also . Worth it .	1
... This is the best if not best , rock albums of all time . I own thousandsof albums and this is simply the best written and performed of them all , and Pinkfloyd is not even my favorite band . This album has it all . There is not one single bad song in the lot , sure some are better than others , but as an entire package this is AWESOME . I could get into things about each track , but the unique thing about it is each person who listens will experience the music differently , so without further explanation ... ... ..GO GET IT NOW !	1
I had this on 8 track when I was in the sixth grade . The vinyl is awesome with great space . It sounds like the helicopter is landing on your head .	1
The Wall , inspired by the experiences of Roger Waters is truly a dark masterpiece of Rock music.This album 's storyline : about a troubled rock star whos scarred psyche finally gets the best of him . The death of his father , overbearing mother , opressive schoolteachers , fractured marriage , alienation from his music and his fans combined with drug usage leads him into a dark journey through his isolation and the numerous demons that continue to haunt him.The Wall is truly a musical masterpiece , filled with explosive and subtle songs that tell the story of & quot ; Pink Floyd & quot ; and his descent into a madness that only he can climb out from . Roger Waters who developed the story which stemmed from his alienated experience of Floyd 's overwhelming stadium tour of 1977.Waters , with David Gilmour and producer Bob Ezrin create a unforgettable musical journey that is searingly dark yet filled with universal human emotions . Another Brick In The Wall pt 2 , Mother , Goodbye Blue Sky , Young Lust , Hey You , Comfortably Numb , Run Like Hell and The Trial are the standout songs that make up the ambitious story.The accompanying film does a excellenct job in capturing the nightmarish journey that & quot ; Pink Floyd & quot ; puts himself through . However bleak and depressing the story may be , there is powerful message of fighting through one 's pain and not giving in to the demons that will lead one on to better days ahead .	1
I got the cd today and its truly moving and a masterpiece at least . It deseves 7 stars . It has flaws , but i do not skip a single track ever . Pink Floyd at its best .	1
The biting sarcasm and streamlined music , the emotion poured into every line . It is exceptionally rare that I have ever heard something so effectively human in nature . Our inability to save ourselves from our own passions unless we are willing to reflect upon our actions , demonstrated in the Trial . Most importantly it made me look at myself and change.I thank Roger for the ideas , and Gilmore for his contributions to the music .	1
In the Flesh is the best song here , it always get to me , the hairs on the back of my neck just stand up when that intro comes in loud . But It 's pointless to name the strengths here , it must be played in it 's entirety and LOUD !	1
When I was in high school this was my favorite album . I grew up in a really backwater town , and it was n't until I went to college that I started to meet people who were familiar with it . The overwhelming popularity of it that I encountered diluted its power . Some albums work better as universal statements that everyone connects with . Some work best as obscure , isolated records . Because of the nature of this album , having everybody like it undermines Pink 's & quot ; i 'm alone in the world & quot ; viewpoint . Also seriously disappointing is that so many people have no idea what exactly it 's about . ( It 's a combination on three issues : Roger Water 's struggle with the & quot ; wall & quot ; of understanding between him and the audience , Syd Barrett 's fall into drugs and insanity , and Roger Waters father dying in World War II . ) In hindsight there 's too much & quot ; filler & quot ; or & quot ; transition & quot ; songs , especially in the middle , and not enough & quot ; major & quot ; songs . It 's too bad that the Final Cut did n't get more recognition . It covers much of the same territory but with much more maturity and intensity .	1
This is my second-favorite Floyd album ( after & quot ; Wish You Were Here & quot ; ) , so I do n't think I can disagree with any positive remark made about & quot ; The Wall. & quot ; For a five-star rating , you 're dang straight I think it 's a masterpiece ! What I 'd like to do first is caution the casual browser who heard & quot ; Another Brick Part 2 & quot ; on the radio , or thinks that all Pink Floyd is like & quot ; Dark Side of the Moon. & quot ; & quot ; The Wall & quot ; is quite simply one of the most depressing works ever put together in a recording studio.I made the mistake of seeing the movie before listening to the entire album . For those who have never seen the movie , I 'm just going to say that it 's a truly nightmarish experience . There is imagery in there that one would never think to incorporate into the darkest recesses of their dreamscapes ... In Alan Parker 's own words , & quot ; It just hits you over the head & quot ; and does n't let up . So after seeing the movie , for a very long time , I could not dissociate the brilliant music and writing from the overly effective horror show of the film . It took me four months to come back to the album and LISTEN to it.The music and lyrics also hit the listener over the head , but in a much more subtle , psychological manner . ( That seems like an oxymoron , but it 's not . ) To really appreciate the nuances included with this album , it 's necessary to go through it repeatedly . By & quot ; repeatedly , & quot ; I mean ... um ... many more times than is probably healthy . But there is a lot there . And it 's all uniformly pessimistic and dark . Unadulterated Waters . The movie is an onslaught , the album is an infiltration . The worms eat into your brain , they do n't feast on your carnal impulses as the movie does . ( If you listen to the album , that last sentence will also make more sense . ) The titular Wall is a metaphor for the separation from humanity . In the album it is built and experienced by a rock star named & quot ; Pink , & quot ; but the themes are universal , and Roger Waters includes plenty of his trademark political commentary . I think everyone at least once in their life has found themself inside a little bunker where they 've retreated from the pressures of life . But as this saga makes terrifically clear , the separation from humanity is much more dangerous than dealing with it ... Stylistically , & quot ; The Wall & quot ; is almost completely hard rock , a far cry from the psychadelic R & amp ; B that Pink Floyd perfected with & quot ; Dark Side of the Moon. & quot ; Like & quot ; DSOTM , & quot ; it is also a single work much more than a collection of songs . The use of sound effects and dialogue is much more important and prevalent here than any other Pink Floyd album , but it does not detract from the quality of the songs . Plenty of songs from this album get radio play . & quot ; Happiest Years/Another Brick & quot ; is on classic rock stations a couple times weekly , and & quot ; Empty Spaces/Young Lust , & quot ; & quot ; Hey You , & quot ; and & quot ; Mother & quot ; are crowd pleasers that surface with frequency . & quot ; Comfortably Numb & quot ; is a showstopping anthem that , despite largely context-dependent lyrics , a lot of people have told me is their favorite Pink Floyd song of all time . A lot of music fans may take an album and say they love every song on it , but for me , this is especially true . I have even gotten into the melody-defficient & quot ; Do n't Leave Me Now. & quot ; Sometimes & quot ; The Wall & quot ; comes across like a twisted Hollywood musical on acid , and perhaps that 's an apt description , but it does serious disservice to the depth and complexity of it . Roger Waters poured his shredded soul into this magnum opus , and his blood , sweat , and tears ( I mean those to be taken literally ) show in the grit and guts that propel this epic . But Waters fan though I am , I also give due credit to David Gilmour , who claimed his contributions to this piece went unacknowledged ( most Floyd fans know & quot ; Comfortably Numb & quot ; was his last real collaboration with Waters ) , and to Bob Ezrin whose orchestrations are especially appreciated in the climatic & quot ; Trial. & quot ; All in all , there 's a lot to be found in & quot ; The Wall. & quot ; It is a must buy for any rock - or even casual music - fan . But I deem it absolutely necessary to check out other , earlier Floyd music first . I was almost turned off to Floyd when my over-eager friend badgered me into watching & quot ; The Wall & quot ; before I was really ready for it . The album is also not very easily accessible . Sure , some of the songs sound great , but until you 're accustomed to the full-concept-album ordeal , it might be best to put this near the top of your wish list , and purchase after you 're prepared for a journey far beyond the darkest side of the moon ...	1
Some music has filtered its way into our consciousness and has recceived so much exposure that we often forget just how good it is . Pink Floyd 's `` The Wall '' is one of these -- after spending most of high school listening to it endlessly and hearing material from it on the radio through college , I found myself burnt out on it . Several years later , having pretty much abandoned commercial radio , I 'm listening to `` The Wall '' today for the first time in at least a couple years.What I 'm amazed about is just how good it is . All the criticisms about it are largely true -- Roger Waters went off the deep end , took the reins of the band totally and restructured their sound , its self-indulgent , the vocals are whiny , you can go on . But one other thing is certainly true -- this is without a doubt the best work Waters did as a composer , and with the musical sensibilities of guitarist David Gilmour to keep him somewhat in check , its nothing short of brilliant.The albums story is pretty well known , but for any new to it , I 'll provide a brief summary . Waters grew disgusted during a performance with a fan in the front row , focused a performance filled with anger on that fan , and eventually spat on him . After the show , he declared the next time the band performed , it 'd be behind a wall , and this story of isolation madness somehow came to him . A boy ( named `` Pink '' ) is born to a woman whose husband is away at war . The father dies ( `` Another Brick in the Wall Part 1 '' ) , the boy ends up being raised by an overprotective mother ( `` Mother '' ) and finds his creativity mocked and stifled in school ( `` The Happiest Days of Our Lives '' , `` Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 '' ) . This early section is somewhat autobiographical of Waters ' childhood . The boy becomes a rock star but finds no happiness and indulges in the rock star life ( `` Empty Spaces '' ) , fueled primarily by copious amounts of drugs and women ( `` Young Lust '' ) , and has a nervous breakdown ( also biographical , this time of band founder Syd Barrett ) . After a bit of time meditating on his life ( `` Goodbye Cruel World '' ) , loneliness ( `` Is There Anybody Out There ? `` ) , an old pop singer ( `` Vera '' ) and war ( `` Bring the Boys Back Home '' ) , he gets drugged back to consciousness ( `` Comfortably Numb '' ) , decides to inspire a riot ( `` In the Flesh '' , `` Run Like Hell '' ) and completely loses his mind ( `` The Trial '' ) .Ok , so its not exactly cheerly material , but its powerful -- from delicate beauty ( `` The Thin Ice '' , `` Is There Anybody Out There ? `` , `` The Show Must Go On '' ) to slabs of raw rage ( `` Another Brick in the Wall Part 3 '' , `` In the Flesh '' ) to passionate ( `` Hey You '' ) , delicate and sad ( `` Goodbye Cruel World '' , `` Nobody Home '' ) and totally indescribable ( `` The Trial '' ) . My suggestion -- do n't start at the beginning , start on the second disc -- the first six songs are absolutely magical.Is this for everyone ? Probably not , but its a stunningly universal album , given how bizarre its story is . We 've all felt isolated at times , we 've all felt numb to the world , we 've all thought we were losing our minds at one point , and we all wanted to lash out . This expresses those feelings as perfectly as aything I 've ever heard . Highly recommended .	1
I love Pink floyd.They are my favourite band and this is one heck of a great album.This is a work of art which you should possess .	1
All I can say is that this is , while not as good as DARK SIDE OF THE MOON , is still a very awesome album . I own this and all I can say is that every song here is amazing . Hell you should buy this just because 'Another Brick in the Wall , part 2 ' is on this , which is probably Pink Floyds most famous song . That loser Sunburnt Albino ( aka Henry McPruter ) will burn in hell for insulting Pink Floyd ! Unless he 's joking then he does n't deserve to live , well maybe not that bad , but he is still a retard . Pink Floyd is the best band that uses a keyboard and thats still around . Other bands like Metallica and AC\DC have died in the past few years but Pink Floyd still has it !	1
By this time Pink Floyd were starting too reach the breakup and this was pretty much there last great album ( The Final Cut was really just a Roger Waters solo album ) Rick Wright was already out of the band at this time but they still mannaged too make a rock opera . The Wall is a story of about a rockstar named Pink the first disc shows his humble begginings but by track 9 he 's grown into the Pink we know . By disc two he 's pretty much gone insane and in the movie his sink is filled with blood and he cuts himself but the main song out of this album is , `` Comftarbly Numb '' , about when he overdoses on drugs . All in all this album is timeless and is for every pink floyd fan alive new or old , buy today	1
I would rate the wall as the best of my cd collection which crosses 500 to date.This brilliant album has sold more than 23 million copies worldwide and is a strong seller even today even though it is a double album.I would strongly urge you to have this to know the greatness of this british band who are the masters of psychedelic rock .	1
This is Floyds GREATEST ! Just for comfortably numb and Another Brick in the Wall , this album is worth buying . They are both classic Floyd and Gilmours guitar solo 's are wonderful . BUY THIS ONE NOW !	1
Pink Floyd 's & quot ; The Wall & quot ; is one of those landmark albums that comes around every ten to twenty years or so and catches the ear of all who experience it . Drasticly different from the band 's previous work , most notably because only two of it 's four members contribute to the writing , and also due to it 's being their to date most stripped down , strait out rock album . One could argue that it does have it 's flaws , which indeed it does . Much of the songs are short , seemingly added simply to tell & quot ; The Wall 's & quot ; complex story of mental anguish and psychological breakdown . Obviously , shorter songs like & quot ; Vera & quot ; , & quot ; The Show Must Go On & quot ; and & quot ; Do n't Leave me Now & quot ; could have benifitted from the musical direction of either keyboardist Richard Wright or not the least a bit more flow from Guitarist David Gilmour . But as it is , & quot ; The Wall & quot ; is masterminded by it 's innitial visionary , bassplayer Roger Waters . Significantly , this album would be his last truely great piece of work , including his post-Pink Floyd albums . Waters was inspired to write & quot ; The Wall & quot ; shortly after Pink Floyd 's & quot ; Animals & quot ; world tour , during wich he nursed a hatred for playing vast sports stadiums due to ( according to him ) the souless connection between band and audience . But as with any Pink Floyd album , the pros drastically outnumber the cons ( if indeed there are any ) . & quot ; The Wall & quot ; ultimately boasts some of Pink Floyd 's most popular and best loved songs . The ridiculously overplayed & quot ; Another Brick in the Wall pt . 2 & quot ; , the familiar acoustics of & quot ; Mother & quot ; and some of Nick Mason 's best drumming on & quot ; In the Flesh & quot ; . David Gilmour 's lone contributions give the album it 's best tracks in & quot ; Run Like Hell & quot ; , & quot ; Young Lust & quot ; , & quot ; Hey You & quot ; and the ultimate Pink Floyd song , & quot ; Comfortably Numb & quot ; derived from an unused demo off of his previous year 's solo album . The duet vocals of Waters on verses and Gilmour on chorus to the latter song is absolutley breathtaking . 'The Wall & quot ; indeed is a wonderous exploration of what a concept album can be , and I just try and imagine what an even better work it could have become had it been a full band effort .	1
It has been said that anger and rage are often rooted in fear and hurt . If so , Roger Waters has experienced several lifetimes ' worth of terror and pain , as evidenced by his searing lyrics and vocals on THE WALL . In every regard , this is an epic , serious work of operatic or Shakespearian proportions.Yet , it is also strangely cathartic and healing , and contains many moments of mysterious beauty and melody . The alternating fury and reverie certainly set the template for things to come later with bands such as Radiohead and Coldplay.A deeply personal work , THE WALL tells us a lot about the boyhood life of Roger Waters and millions of others like him growing up fatherless after the tragedy of WWII . Such an experience shaped the UK and Europe in far greater ways than we can imagine . `` The Happiest Days of Our Lives '' and the `` Another Brick in the Wall '' paint a picture of horror for British schoolboys , while the stifling `` Mother '' and `` Empty Spaces '' range between saccharine and menace . `` Run Like Hell '' packs a mighty wallop ... it 's almost like a mob hit song set to a dance beat . And , there 's the dreamy/nightmarish `` Comfortably Numb '' with its peerless guitar solo from David Gilmour , which ranks near the top of the greatest FM songs of all time . Another classic is `` Hey You , '' which is a painfully raw and honest plea for help , set amidst lush harmonies and acoustic guitar washes.Producer Bob Ezrin pulls out all of the stops here , with strings , choirs , sound effects , and all manner of instrumentation held in delicate tension ... thundering one moment , whispering the next . The band plays , yet there is a sense of isolation amongst the players . This was both purposeful and , ultimately , devastating to the band itself . But that 's another story.In the meantime , it seems that half the free world owns a copy of THE WALL in some form or fashion . It 's a telling and often brutal look at the human condition and human nature , set to some of the most powerful music made in the Classic Rock era .	1
I 'm amazed that this album has actually received bad reviews.Has our culture become so banal that Spears/Jackson pop music is the base line ? This is art folks . If you have any self awareness , this album will affect you . Damn it , it should make you , at the very least , teary eyed.I admit that I blur the album and the film into one experience . The whole project is amazing - that includes the live DVD performance in Berlin.War , insanity , drug use , fame , authority figures who do n't give a damn , ( that includes your precious , little mommy ) , self-absorption , and the desperate need for longing - come on folks , you got to be kidding when you trash this album.How can one not feel when Pink calls home and his wife 's lover answers the damn phone ? Then again , maybe you 've never been completely betrayed during a moment of adulterated innocence and weakness.Sure , I have every Pink Floyd album and then some . The Wall is n't the typical psychadelic , experimental mastery that one might typically equate with this band . But , the apparent simplicity is the genius.This is Pink Floyd . This is a masterpiece.Centuries from now adolescents , and adults who can empathize with that angst of just being , will embrace this album.Buy it ...	1
This is hands- down the best album ever . The story , the vocals , and most importantly the music is wonderful . The price is steep , but it is so well worth it . Listen to this in track order otherwise you wo n't get it . THANK GOD FOR PINK FLOYD .	1
What is there to say that has n't been said . A masterpiece in ever sense of the word . I made my children listen to this and when/if I have grandchildren I 'll make them listen to it as well .	1
THIS WAS WITHOUT ANY DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST PINK FLOYD ALBUMS FEATURING THE GREAT COMFORTABLY NUMB.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL ROCK MUSIC FANS .	1
This is undoubtedly a classic from Pink Floyd but it 's not an easy listening . Dark Side is an easy listening and is easy to digest . It 's just that The Wall is so intense for a 1st listener of PF that he/she may be turned off of The Wall and Pink Floyd in general . I suggest starting with Dark Side , Wish , or animals when 1st getting into Floyd . Anyway , about the album . It 's a great album and there 's a great concept to it , you can listen to most of the songs in general without once thinking about the plot . May I suggest Mother , ABITW pt2 , Waiting For The Worms , The Trial , Run Like Hell , Comfortably Numb , Bring The Boys Back Home , Goodbye Blue Sky , Hey You , and Young Lust ( No particular order ) .The only things I do n't like about this album is that the keyboard playing from Rick does n't really stand out ( Like On Wish You Were Here ) , and half of the drumming on The Wall , for whatever reason , is n't done by Nick ( like the chilling drums on Bring The Boys Back Home ) . Nonetheless , it 's a great album for Pink Floyd fans , and like I said , new Pink Floyd fans should start out with Dark Side . The album is pretty expensive ( My copy was $ 40 ) but it 's totally worth it .	1
Pink Floyd 's theatrical rock opera The Wall still sounds outstanding nearly 30 years after it was released.The album takes you into the mind of a rock star who loses every inch of whatever is left of his sanity , secludes himself from all the troubles of his own troubled little world , builds an imaginary wall in his mind made of all the people ( his abusive schoolteachers , mother , and girlfriend ) and events in his life ( his dad dying in the war ) that have seriously screwed him up , and dives head first into a dark world of TV , drugs , temptation , and utter craziness.The music on The Wall is brilliant . From the opening track In The Flesh ? passing through the commerically successful Another Brick In The Wall , the silent primal screams of Mother and Goodbye Blue Sky , the elusive Nobody Home and Comfortably Numb , and the chaotic Run Like Hell all the way to the finale , the album sways and streaks to true rock perfection.The supplementary movie version of the album , Pink Floyd 's The Wall , is a must see to truly appreciate and understand the storyline of one of the most remarkable rock albums of recent history.RecommendedA+	1
For this time , I think the Amazon reviewer is absolutely right . The Wall is grandiose in concept and in most of the music , but this same concept led to a sometimes 'scisors-esque ' execution . I mean that there are great killer songs , but there is also some filler and meandering that makes the album a little tiresome . Listening it from beggining to end is quite an experience ! The killer songs are : The first CD until 'Empty Spaces ' , is masterful ; then we have 'Hey You ' , 'Nobody Home ' , 'Is there Anybody Out There ? ' , 'Confortably Numb ' ( the greatest of the greatests ) , 'Run Like Hell ' , 'Waiting For the Worms ' and the unusual 'The Trial ' . Apart from these , there is not one bad song , but they fail to get to the excellence that Pink Floyd have us used to.All these said and making justice , the 'filler ' songs are a light year or a parsec better than a lot of crap that is out there today and they sometimes flash Floyd 's greatness , but only sometimes . Maybe if it would have been a single album it would be a masterpiece , or maybe if all the songs were Absolute Floyd .	1
`` The Wall '' should have been a better album.Before you click angrily on the `` Disagree '' button , let me explain my logic . Despite `` The Wall '' 's depth , unity of vision and interesting plot and Freudian subtext , there is something missing in the majority of the songs . That something is musicality.Much of Disc 1 ( Side 1 and 2 for the original record ) is tough to listen to . The melodies are sparse , the atmosphere thick , and much of it frequently grating . Try listening to `` Do n't Leave Me Now '' more than once in a row without going ballistic . It 's as if , when the teacher in `` Another Brick in the Wall Pt . 2 '' is shouting `` How can you have your pudding if you do n't eat your meat ? ! '' Roger Waters is yelling at us to choke down the meat of these tough songs to get to the pudding later to be had . Waters even had something of a captive audience when the album was originally released , as there was no 'Skip ' button on record players . Listeners were forced to wade through the discordance to find the melodies.Those melodies have a tendency to show up much more frequently in the second disc , when we get songs like `` Comfortably Numb '' , with its soaring guitar solos and vibrant chorus . The album becomes much more interesting in general after Pink 's Wall has been built , if not because of the greater musicality shown in the song I just mentioned , as well as `` Hey You '' , `` Nobody Home '' , and `` Run Like Hell '' , then in terms of story.It is worthwhile to note here that `` The Wall '' is an extraordinarily depressing and pessimistic work . Even on songs that sound somewhat upbeat ( `` Comfortably Numb '' , `` Mother '' ) , the schizophrenia of the lyrics ensures that this is not the case . The `` Pink Floyd '' that is the main character of this rock opera suffers long and hard at the hands of - well , everyone in his life , especially himself . The paranoia , anger and insanity that makes up this album 's core is strong and pronounced in every piece of the album , which accounts for another reason it is so difficult to listen to.The last reason is the sheer cheesiness of some of the songs . There 's pretentiousness bleeding out of the album 's climax , `` The Trial '' , which is n't helped by the fact that it has the pomposity of real ( not rock ) opera . Some of this music is some of the most pretentious this side of heavy metal , and you can practically hear `` Spinal Tap '' knocking.What saves this is the story , the same story that I previously mentioned as being depressing and pessimistic . It is , but it 's also well-thought out and very interesting , albeit unclear without additional information ( such as liner notes , or the movie adaptation ) .Overall , the `` Wall '' is a stunning work , but not quite the magnum opus `` Dark Side of the Moon '' was . It 's still worth listening to for those with patience and an ability to see past musical shortcomings to the lyrics and meaning underneath .	1
The wall is my favourite album from the great Pink Floyd after the dark side of the moon and Wish you were here.this double album contains Comfortably numb which certainly has to figure in the top ten rock songs of all time.So take my advice and get all their albums till Meddle.Very highly recommended .	1
I 'm glad to see today 's generation getting into The Wall.I was a teenager in 1980 when this album came out . It blew me away . After listening to Wish You Were Here , Animals , Dark Side of the Moon , Echoes , and their earlier music , I was amazed that the Floyd could top themselves again.The only thing that disappointed me was the story . At first blush , I thought the story of epic alienation was about an ordinary guy . I thought it should n't apply to a rock star . Since when has a rock star ever elicited sympathy anyway ? How much of the population has ever been lonely at the top ? Most of us scurry at the bottom , enduring the kind of alienation that comes from being `` nobodies . '' It 's this kind of pain I can relate to , not the pain of isolation that comes from being more successful and famous than anyone else.Anyway , the music is constantly gripping , even if it reeks of self-pity at times . The movie is psychedelic and wonderfully animated . This album is an undeniable classic , even if it is ocassionally overwrought . I 've listened to it hundreds of times , and I 'm sure I 'll listen to it hundreds of times more.Enjoy !	1
Even though I find it to be quite a bummer , I agree that The Wall is easily one of the most compelling rock albums ever produced . I first heard it when I was 17 , and did n't have a clue what it was all about . Still , I was blown away by just the sheer awesome SOUND of it . There was nothing else like it in 1979 , and also , at that time I was not familiar with Pink Floyd 's music , so it was completely new to me . Depressing as it may be , it is impossible to rate it any lower . It is an all time classic rock album .	1
People are obvioulsy entitled to judge ... its on us to not get misleaded ... n any review below 4 stars for this album will serve the same ... misleading ppl from great music.Well i think ppl who own this know that this is one priceless n timesless album ... .listen to this and come to know what kind of things matter in this world.I know ... ull come to know .	1
The wall is one of the greatest rock albums to be ever made.This great album has sold over 22 million copies to date and is popular in all the continents in the world solely due to songs like Run like hell , another brick in the wall and Comfortably numb.I urge you to add this beauty to your collection today .	1
Transcending time and musical revision , Pink Floyd 's & quot ; The Wall & quot ; stands as an epoch work that makes one wonder if this type of music/message could be accomplished today . This classic epitomized the height of & quot ; Art Rock & quot ; and really changed music ( and the band for that matter ) forever.Roger Water 's ode to the slow descent into abhorrent pychosis has a uniqueness and novelty even today that grabs the listener and drags him along for a truly one-of-a -kind musical experinece . Pink Floyd 's combination of tight musical discipline and the slightly off-key musings of Waters create a rock classic that serves as an alternative to this and any period 's music . & quot ; They just do n't make music like this anymore ... & quot ; Songs such as & quot ; Comfortably Numb & quot ; , & quot ; Mother & quot ; , & quot ; Young Lust & quot ; , & quot ; Vera & quot ; , & quot ; Waiting For the Worms & quot ; and & quot ; Outside the Wall & quot ; speak not only to past generations ... they reach the introspective side of any thoughtful music listener past or present.As with any & quot ; concept & quot ; album from the 70 's ( the Stones , Led Zeppelin , even Earth , Wind and Fire and the Ohio Players ) this should be listened to in it 's entirety many times to capture it 's true artistic genius . These songs flow so easily one into another , they epitomize the late 70 's & quot ; monster & quot ; album production techniques . This truely is the height of Pink Floyd 's career and , by virtue of it 's evident popularity , still presents a freshness and immediacy that makes other comtemporary works pale by comparison.Sadly , this work marked the beginning of the end of this great combination . The 1982 issue & quot ; The Final Cut & quot ; was largely a continuation of the separation of Roger Waters from the group and even though some great music eminated from this breakup , rock music never has approached this type of soaring , intellectual musicality ever again . Strong lyrical voice along with exemplary musical backing , Pink Floyd enjoys a place in contemporary music that few others have attained . This album epitomizes that standing and should be essential listening for all contemporary and future generations to really understand how to formulate monlithic concept albums . Highest recommendation .	1
Pink Floyd 's & quot ; The Wall & quot ; is a classic , the band 's most ambitious masterwork . Later used as the soundtrack from the hit 1983 film , & quot ; The Wall & quot ; is a mix of songs that is among P.F . 's very best . This time around , instead of going for psychedelic rock ( as in & quot ; Dark Side of the Moon & quot ; ) , P.F . goes more for odd , eerie , wacky pieces - and yet , these songs tell a story like no others.The album 's grand opening piece is & quot ; In the Flesh ? & quot ; , which compares the album to a wall that the following songs alone can break . The second song begins the story of a man 's life , & quot ; The Thin Ice & quot ; , about the simplicity of young childhood . Then we seep into the first part of one of Pink Floyd 's most popular songs , & quot ; Another Brick in the Wall & quot ; , which eventually became one of the most played radio hits of the 80 's . & quot ; The Happiest Days of Our Lives & quot ; moves us on to the man 's childhood , where he was placed in a school full of abusive teachers - which then seeps into the best part of & quot ; Another Brick in the Wall & quot ; ( Part 2 ) . & quot ; Mother & quot ; tells us about the young man 's worries , which he speaks to his mother ; & quot ; Goodbye Blue Sky & quot ; is something of an obituary for childhood ; & quot ; Empty Spaces & quot ; finds the man trying to conceal his horrible memories , but he ca n't ; and therefor we find ourselves hearing about his & quot ; Young Lust & quot ; . Then we learn about Pink 's temper towards his wife in & quot ; One of My Turns & quot ; , which leads to his wife leaving in & quot ; Do n't Leave me Now & quot ; . & quot ; Another Brick in the Wall & quot ; then finishes with & quot ; Part 3 & quot ; ; and the first disc closes with & quot ; Goodbye Cruel World & quot ; .The second disc is considerably different from the first ; it focuses on life behind the Berlin Wall . It opens with & quot ; Hey You & quot ; , then moves on to & quot ; Is There Anybody Out There ? & quot ; and & quot ; Nobody Home & quot ; ( in which a man tries to hide from the authorities in charge of the Wall ) . & quot ; Vera & quot ; talks about Pink 's seperation from his lover on the opposite side of the Wall ; & quot ; Bring the Boys Back Home & quot ; is about Pink 's desire to have his old friends back ; and then comes & quot ; Comfortably Numb & quot ; , one of Pink Floyd 's greatest pieces . Pink has become numb to anything going outside the Wall ( contrary to popular belief , the song is not a druggie song ) . Then there 's & quot ; The Show Must Go On & quot ; , and two live pieces - & quot ; In the Flesh & quot ; and a good version of & quot ; Run Like Hell & quot ; . The ending of the second disc sounds as though it was inspired by Queen , not at all like P.F . 's traditional compositions . Finally , the album closes softly with & quot ; Outside the Wall & quot ; . & quot ; The Wall & quot ; can be taken in a few different directions ; is it about drugs ? Is it about the Berlin Wall ? Or is about a troubled , drug-addict 's horrid memories ? The lyrics are excellent , making some terrific songs ; unfortunately , the songs just do n't flow as on P.F . 's earlier albums.All in all , you may like & quot ; The Wall & quot ; , or you may not . In my opinion , & quot ; The Wall & quot ; is one of the greatest albums of all time and among Pink Floyd 's best . To sum it all up : & quot ; The Wall & quot ; is flawed brilliance .	1
The Wall has to be one of the best albums of all time . The concept is just completely genius and makes you think about what each song actually means . The music has a very sonic , spacey atmosphere and is a pleasure to listen to ( especially David Gilmour 's brilliant guitar work ) , and best of all it is filled with classic , timeless songs . Sure the introludes do get anoying , but because of the albums concept even they mean something in the story , best song is `` Young Lust '' , great song for driving around in the city at night . I recommend this album to any rock fan .	1
The Wall was the first Floyd album where the lyrical concept overshadowed the music , and for that reason , it pales in comparison to Dark Side and Animals ( both of which are a perfect balance of lyrical and musical genius ) . Nonetheless , this is still an incredible album . A rock opera in the truest sense of the word , this is an album that has been both helped and hurt by its popularity . The incessant airplay of songs like Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 , Comfortably Numb , Run Like Hell , Hey You , and Young Lust can make the listener unfamiliar to the entire album believe that this album is about the songs instead of the story . That is why there are so many people who finally go out and buy the album and are dissapointed in the fact that it is n't 26 Comfortably Numbs that make up the album . Some call the shorter , less popular songs & quot ; filler & quot ; . Those who do are missing the point of the album as a whole . This is not your average CD that you throw in your car to listen to on the way down to the grocery store . The Wall needs to be heard , felt , and absorbed as a whole . It is more like a book on CD with backing music . Although the soundscapes that back the main theme are a perfect fit , and the music is melodic , complicated , emotional , and energetic , it is there mainly to help convey the emotion that is stated in the lyrics . The short & quot ; filler & quot ; is neccesary to bridge the different subject matters together and move the album from one theme to the other . Lets put it this way , this album is actually built like a brick wall . The bricks make up the most important part , but the wall would collapse without the cement & quot ; filler & quot ; that binds it together.If you are n't willing to sit down and listen to the whole album , it will probably go right over your head . But if you do take the time to sit and get emotionally involved , it can be a rewarding , albeit a bit depressing , experience . This is n't Floyd 's best music ( not that its bad , they just have done better ) , but it is one of the best lyrical concepts ever written , and well worth the while for that alone .	1
Unlike any other rock production , 'The Wall ' stands alone at the pinnacle of genius songwriting . A little heavy perhaps for those not familiar with the story or PF , but once understood , there is no substitute . Even PF themselves could not top this work , so do n't expect anyone else to . For variations on some of this material , also watch the film and taken in 'live ' performances available . All in all , a fine piece of music .	1
The book is OK . It gives some insights to the inspiration for some for his songs . Gives anecdotes of meeting other stars . Gives stories of growing up and starting out.It basically whetted my appetite for a more in depth history of one of my all-time favorite singer/songwriters.However , the CD that comes with the book is worth the price of the book !	1
This album has a choral sound to it - it 's a lovely , well-trained chorus of women singers chanting and singing prayers with often a minimal amount of instrumental accompaniment , though the flutes and drums etc , which do make an appearance are lovely.A lot of the songs are traditional ones that you 'll hear on a lot of other Goddess-centered albums , but these are the most elegant , choral versions of them that you 'll hear . Also , this album is packed full of tracks , so it 's a good buy.If you like pretty , choral music and you like Goddess songs and chants , I think you 'll enjoy this simple album .	1

I bought over a dozen CD 's from Amazon and immediately loaded them on my iPod and have been playing them often . Excellent musician and the recordings are clear and precise .	1
This was Patrick O ' Hearns very first album . It came out in 1985 , I was n't even born then but my dad bought the album later in 1993 and I listen to it all the time . I loved every CD by Patrick O ' Hearn the sounds he uses are so great that I could never listen to any of his songs just once. & quot ; At First Light & quot ; is a soft song and gets louder towards the end. & quot ; Beauty in Darkness & quot ; has a great beat to it and it mostly stays the same except for some other small sounds around it. & quot ; Unusual Climate & quot ; and & quot ; Ancient Dreams & quot ; are also excellent songs and are probably my two favorites on the album . Most of Patrick O ' Hearns albums are all dark ones except El Dorado and Rivers Gon na Rise are more of daytime albums and I would recommend them because they are different . The only problem is that Rivers Gon na Rise is very hard to find in most places . I am still trying to find a place to get a new copy of it but it is available used at half.com.Buy all of Patrick O ' Hearns music today he is an excellent musician !	1
I am astonished to just realize this was his first album . When you first get a Patrick album , the songs sound nice , but you do n't love them immediately . You have to listen to each album every day for 2 weeks to fall in love with a few of the songs . I would call the style & quot ; Experimental Jazz-based New Age. & quot ; Similar to Tangerine Dream , but the sounds here are not so exotic . The whole album is good ; the title track is a masterpiece -- it contains every facet that makes Patrick 's music great : A very clever experiment actually using a piano as a percussion instrument ( I 've never heard ANYONE else do it ! ) , the little heartbroken trumpets , and his unique genius at playing the melodic line of a song super-slow . ( Each note lasting many measures . ) The album would be worth it just for this song , but the rest is good ! Metaphor , Indigo , and Eldorado are my favorite albums of his ( in order ) .	1
I remember first hearing `` At First Light '' literally at dawn as one well known New York jazz DJ had taken to start his morning program with this ethereal , powerful , provocative , darkly beautiful piece . I ... was ... . mesmerized . I promptly rushed to the record outlet and picked it up . I soon discovered that there was no let down throughout this recording . What that one piece promised that , and the remaining pieces delivered . Patrick O'Hearn is one of the great undiscovered . For this type of music , he is one of the very best . `` At First Light '' , `` Unusual Climate '' , `` Live Along the River Baal '' and `` Malevolent Landscape '' are true highpoints . This is one to listen to from beginning to end . The pieces are different but flow together seamlessly . This was strong and brilliant debut .	1
Between Two Worlds is another great CD from Patrick O ' Hearn . I noticed when I listened to the album that he uses many of the same sounds that he did in Ancient Dreams . I purchased the album off of amazon a while before knowing only the the song `` between two worlds '' and I loved listening to it . The very first time I heard Patrick O ' Hearns music was on Indigo and I knew right then that I had to get more albums by him . I thought this was one of his best but probably Indigo is my favorite . Between Two Worlds would be an okay album to start off with but in my opinion Indigo or Ancient Dreams would be better . `` Rain Maker '' is an excellent one he plays one tune and than adds other dark sounds around it . `` Gentle was the Night '' is a soft and soothing song with great keyboard sounds . In `` Fire Ritual '' he uses a variety of voices along with more sounds . `` 87 dreams of a lifetime '' starts out soft and than comes in with drums . Then that takes us to the title track witch mostly has the same tune with some other little small instruments around it.All in all , between two worlds is excellent . I hope my review was helpful to any of you who would like to buy this album and I hope you all enjoy Patrick O ' Hearns music .	1
Listeners who enjoy this album should try & quot ; The Private Music of Tangerine Dream. & quot ; I would call Patrick O'Hearns style & quot ; Experimental Jazz-based New Age. & quot ; Similar to Tangerine Dream , but the sounds here are not so exotic . The whole album is good ; the track & quot ; Sky Juice & quot ; is great , also & quot ; Forever the Optimist , & quot ; and & quot ; Journey to Yoruba. & quot ;	1
Among some of my favorite CD 's of Yanni . I do own all of them . I probably listen to this one the most . Hope I do n't wear it out ! A great purchase .	1
I am a Yanni fan , I have several of his cds and so when I read the reviews people had said about this cd I bought it and it is great .	1
This is what music should be . This is my favorite Yanni album . I have gotten more people introduced to Yanni with this album . The tracks are Yanni and Charlie { the drummer } at their best . I liked this album so much , I named one of my Arabian horses after track five ... .Within Attraction . It is get up and go music like no other . The album is higher than 5 stars but since thats as high as the rating goes ... ... well you know . This album makes Yanni in concert also . When I saw him in concert { in the front row } he played 7 of the 10 songs on this album and the crowd loved it . I can not single out one song over another , but to just say this , you will want to know where the repeat button is on your CD player . Enjoy ! !	1
Never disappointing ! Over the decades he continues to sooth with his unique style of music , highly recommend all his albums .	1
I had given my copy of this album to a friend a few years back . I recently purchased it again and am glad I did.Music only improves over time . This album by O'Hearn is no exception . You can never tire listening to this one .	1
When I heard this i always thought this had to be a soundtrack to an adventure film . it had all the earmarks from start to finish . The adventure begins has a few sidetrips to various places around the globe and ends where the adventurer finds himself and what it was all about and that the adventure was better than it end result . Listen to each song , again , as i did and you to will see what i mean .	1
There are different kinds of fans of Tangerine Dream music , so to understand my reviews , you must understand my tastes . I prefer their later works , with songs that are harmonious , rhythmic , lyrical , and & quot ; pretty. & quot ; Their first excellent album for me was Underwater Sunlight . You might find ( by reading lots of reviews ) that the people who love TDream 's early work dislike the later albums ; people who like the later albums do n't like the early stuff . I am the 2nd type . Of my 22 or so TDream albums so far , the greatest ones ( in approximate order ) are : Le Parc , Underwater Sunlight , Architecture in Motion , Private Music , Goblins ' Club , Optical Race , Melrose , Lily on the Beach . OK albums are : Tang-go , Force Majeure , Exit . Unpleasant albums are : Turn of the Tides , Rockoon , Stratosfear , Phaedra , Atem , Alpha Centauri , Elect . Meditation , or anything else pre '83 . I love track 3 , & quot ; Alaskan Summer. & quot ; & quot ; Blue Mango Cafe & quot ; ( # 11 ) is lots of fun ! Track 5 constantly leaves me hanging -- very upsetting . The rest of the album is quite good ! TDream fans who share my tastes MUST try out Patrick O'Hearn .	1
I have to categorically disagree with the naysayers -- Lily on the Beach is an important , well-executed recording that brought to the fore the band 's evolution from drifting , hypnotic , if not ambling , `` sonic tapestries '' toward a more refined , sophisticated sound . In LOTB , Haslinger and Froese expand on the their previous two progressions -- Underwater Sunlight and Optical Race -- to create an album of tighter , well-thought out compositions . While still very much a synthesizer-oriented group ( no slight there -- I was a keyboardist myself ) , TD has freely incorporated `` the rest of the band '' through the inclusion of more complex rhythms and percussion , an occasional sax , greater use of sampling technology , and most striking , raw , almost heavy metal , guitar solos on a few tracks ( played by Edgar 's son , Jerome -- now a full-time member of the band ) , which provide a welcome punch the mood where needed.The tracks run the gambit of styles from the light , whimsical `` Gecko '' to the driving , aggressive rock of `` Radio City '' to longing , romantic , saxophone-tinged strains of `` Long Island Sunset . '' All in all , the band 's improved compositional skills now highlight quality over quantity and have oriented the compositions toward a more progressive rock sound without losing the etheral spirit that made TD so good.This in an essential part of any progressive-oriented music library .	1
Heartbeats Accelerating ( or , considering the content of most of these songs , Heartbreaks Accelerating ) dates to Kate and Anna McGarrigle 's best years . Their writing draws from memories of youth , experiences as adults and parents , and collisions with mortality . Their harmonies are complex , buoyant or delicate , and backed with quirky arrangements , often featuring strings or liberal use of the accordion , not exactly a front line pop music instrument north of the Rio Grande . The best songs here are Heartbeats ( more prominently recorded by Linda Ronstadt ) , Love Is ( covered by Emmylou Harris ) , I Eat Dinner , and , my personal favorite since our last child just moved out of the house , I 'm Losing You . I listen to this CD and the later Matapedia and think it is too bad the sisters have over the last years faded somewhat into the background in their performances , ceding space to their ( to my mind ) less interesting children .	1
This album represents a maturing on the part of this team from their original folk roots . This album is tightly conceived , and if it lakes the brightness of their first album , it has gained a great deal of depth and musicality . Also notable is their continued use of material from Phillippe Tatarchef ( Rainbow Ride and D.J . Serenade ) , whose lyrics always surprise and intrigue . There is an intelligence in their musical choices that belies the apparent simplicity of their songs.In a way Heartbeats Accelerating is about the exquisite contrast between the excitement of the title cut and the anguish of I Eat Dinner - both songs that are , at the core about love that is somewhere else , but one talks about anticipation and other about loss and regret . The McGarrigle 's use this tension brilliantly right through to the final chorus of St. James Hospital . Love blooms and proceeds inevitably to some final injury.The arrangements are often quite subtle and varied . The two voices , with their nature slightly edgy twang , can move from French chanson styling to pure country without missing a beat . Always though , they are two gentle voices that stand out , even in a storm . This is a sensitive , if somewhat sad album that stand up well to repeated listening .	1
Not as expected ; it 's all piano compositions and dull . I 'll keep it and go back to it periodically . It may become better .	1
Working with Shankar in the 60 's is what inspired Glass to move in the musical direction for which he became famous . On this recording Glass arranges 3 Shankar compositions and Shankar arranges 3 Glass compositions . Some pieces use the conventional orchestra , others have tablas , sitars , and vocals . It 's all good .	1
I love Phillip [ Glass . He is able to work with anybody who really cares about music and Ravi Shankar cares . Nice cd .	1
As a great admirer of Ravi Shankar , I was totally unprepared for the effect of this collaboration . It is indeed exquisite.It starts out quietly with & quot ; Offering & quot ; , then builds with & quot ; Sadhanipa & quot ; . But & quot ; Channels and Winds & quot ; is , to me , the ultimate , with the voices added to the instruments . This cut is haunting and other-worldly , going beyond the sound of the East or of the western classical tradition into a world or maybe a plane of existence beyond ours.The pieces nicely blend and combine almost seamlessly , and from that ethereal passage , the & quot ; Ragas in Minor Scale & quot ; take us back to the Eastern tradition . It may be just me , but I felt a kinship with Celtic music during the ragas . The intensity , sometimes a quiet intensity and sometimes an exciting and driving intensity , characterizes the entire CD.This CD should satisfy and possibly enthrall the lover of Shankar 's music , but the Philip Glass classicism shapes the Indian sound , and thus we have a music that is all its own.Words certainly can not describe music , and so I urge you to listen to the song samples . Even then , you will have only a hint of the music , because this is music that becomes even more powerful the more often you listen and allow it to envelope you .	1
Philip Glass was introduced to Ravi Shankar during a recording session , in Paris , in the year of 1965 . The two were collaborating on a soundtrack for Conrad Rook 's film `` Chappaqua '' , Glass as a conductor of the music and Shankar as the composer for the project . During the sessions , each musician had formed a favorable impression of the other , with Ravi the elder , passing on much musical knowledge to the then rather young Glass . After the session was over , the two went their separate ways , not often meeting again.Moving forward into the summer of 1989 , Peter Baumann [ founder of Private Music and one time member of the German electronic ensemble Tangerine Dream ] was enthusiastic about a suggestion for reuniting these two composers for a new collaboration to be released on his Private Music label.Philip Glass has long acknowledged an influence of the Tibetan Buddhist musical practices . Buddhism itself is an offshoot of Shankar 's native Hindu background , so in very real sense , there is a natural compatibility of spiritual esthetic between these two composers different musical sensibilities , as was also found in that work of 1965.We can hear these mutual musical sympathies on this CD , which contains six new pieces . Two Glass works on musical themes presented by Shankar . Two Shankar works on musical themes presented by Glass and one work by each composer that relies solely on their own respective compositional strategies.The music found on `` Passages '' offers us a beautiful realization of an ongoing present moment . A place where both tradition and innovation meet to carry us forward towards a new sense of rhythm and musical tranquility . May you find , in the invisible thread which connects the 40+ musicians on this recording , a sense of your own place within the compositions as an audience member at one with the music .	1
Everyone knows what a talented guitarist Kottke is . This album features his gifts with his second instrument -- his voice . Sure , his trademark guitar sound is there on every track , but these are all vocal tracks and his voice is used to wonderful effect . Some fans may feel this was a wrong-headed turn for Kottke , but it should n't have come as a surprise . Go back to Kottke 's 1974 Ice Water and listen to & quot ; Tilt Billings and the Student Prince & quot ; and you hear the genesis for this album . I 've always loved Kottke 's voice as well as his guitar playing . As such , this is one of my favorite albums . RECOMMENDED	1
Okay , I ca n't say for certain what it is about this CD that draws me back to listen to it over again ; I just know that when I got my MP3 player it was one of the first discs I reached for to download . I think it 's the quiet of it and the charm of some of the cuts . Warnes voice is so clear and haunting in its ability . When I need to feel quiet and calm this is the one I go to . `` Lights of Lousianne '' is as close to an adult lullaby as one could hope to hear , and it often brings tears to my eyes . So , if you 're looking for music that is good to listen to as you drift to sleep , or you just need to take a break from the tumult of the day , I 'd recommend this one to you . It might not be the most earth moving music you 've heard , but it sure does calm you down . Always a good thing for most of us !	1
This is by far Patrick O ' Hearns best album . He uses great keyboards on all of his songs . Indigo is another dark album just like Ancient Dreams but this one is different in some ways.Anyway , all of the songs are good but here are my favorites : Devils lake , Coba , Upon The Wings Of Night [ great trumpet work by Mark Isham ! ] and The Ringmasters Dream . I notice that Patrick O ' Hearn does not use a lot of soft songs , he mostly uses new age music with a real beat to it . The album also features work by Warren Cuccurullo with guitat ambience and aesthetic atmosphere . That 's really all I can say about the album . I hope you all enjoy listening to new age music !	1
When you first get a Patrick album , the songs sound nice , but you do n't love them immediately . You have to listen to each album every day for 2 weeks to fall in love with a few of the songs . I would call the style & quot ; Experimental Jazz-based New Age. & quot ; Similar to Tangerine Dream , but the sounds here are not so exotic . Almost the whole album is good -- but this album contains the one and only Patrick song I really do n't like , & quot ; Ringmaster 's Dream. & quot ; It has a circus-y pounding hurdy-gurdy organ sound to it that gives me a headache . HOWEVER , & quot ; Sacred Heart & quot ; is superb , & quot ; Desire & quot ; and & quot ; Sacrifice & quot ; are excellent , & quot ; Coba & quot ; boogies , and & quot ; Espana & quot ; is lovely . The best 2 other Patrick albums are Metaphor and Eldorado . If you love this album , try some Tangerine Dream !	1
... this is by far O'Hearn 's best . Apparently he re-released all of his early recordings on May 9 , 2000 but Ancient Dreams , Between Two Worlds and the like are from a much earlier time in O'Hearn 's career . And the very best of his work & quot ; River 's Gon na Rise & quot ; is not even available at Amazon for some reason . It would be a shame if it 's out of print because it was an excellent collection of music . I 've been listening to O'Hearn for the better part of 10 years , along with Tangerine Dream and others.If I had to recommend three CD 's of Patrick 's to buy they would be:1 . River 's Gon na Rise ( have to get it somewhere else I guess ) 2 . Indigo 3 . Trust	1
I enjoy the moodiness of this cd by O'hearn , which is the 3rd of his I owned . It is a real lush experience for all you fans of multi-keyboard spacey synth rock . I can not go ibto detail , but that is a general description . He is the former key player from Missing Persons , so this is a good mix of 80s pop and New Age .	1
This is the last collaboration of Peter Baumann with O'Hearn and he gave it all in full blast . This is like Tangerine Dream 's Desert Dream on the Encore album only with O'Hearn 's input . This album had become darker , moodier and much more melacholic , it is not a depressing album but is a fitting sountrack for a mystery movie set in the Carpathian mountains . Much of the material here can be heard on his sountrack for the movie `` White Sounds '' . The album cover of a an archetypical wing and portrait of baroque era Meditarranean couple heightens the sinister content this record .	1
Her renditions of `` famous blue raincoat '' and `` joan of arc '' are the best two covers of Leonard ever done ... ... in my opinion .	1
The apt last cut on this 15 year old CD is Came So Far for Beauty . Apt because in it and every one of the other eight songs here Warnes 's vocals capture the almost too lush beauty in Cohen 's words that his guttural voice often obscures in his own recordings . The classic Joan of Arc is a particular high point , with Cohen contributing duet vocals . Ai n't No Cure for Love and Coming Back to You are nearly as good . The piano and strings arrangements on Song of Bernadette make that simple and strange story still more poignant . The clean and hushed recording enhances the intensity and timelessness in each of the songs . Cohen has always worked with the eternal themes -- love , religion , loneliness , and sacrifice -- and with & quot ; Jenny Sings Lenny & quot ; ( as Cohen 's graffiti-like artwork says ) he gets the meditative presentation that his songs deserve . This CD is a must for any collector of Cohen work -- his own or by others . If only there had been two or three more songs included , for the CD is over long before I am ready for it to end .	1
Not a huge Jennifer Warren fan but this record is so good I had to get it . I am somewhat of an audiophile but the & # 34 ; gold disk & # 34 ; is more marketing than sound	1
This album was released at a time when Cohen was almost forgotten , about seven years before the tribute albums I 'm Your Fan and Tower Of Song would spur renewed interest in his work . Warnes ' interpretations are always graceful and moving.She understands Cohen 's music well , having done backing vocals on some of his albums like Various Positions , and she covers his songs with loving dedication . My favorites include Aint No Cure For Love ( from Cohen 's I 'm Your Man ) , Coming Back To You ( from Various Positions ) , Came So Far For Beauty ( from Recent Songs ) and of course the formidable Joan Of Arc where Cohen himself sings some of the verses.Warnes ' voice is the perfect vehicle for his poetic lyrics of romantic longing and despair , and my only complaint is that I would have loved to hear her interpretations of Suzanne and Sisters Of Mercy too . Another great Cohen tribute album is Democracy by Judy Collins , the very first artist who covered his songs .	1
I have been a Leonard Cohen fan since discovering as teen THE SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN . Except for Bob Dylan , I had never found another songwriter who could match these songs for complete lyrical brilliance , and here , many years later , still have not . Many singer-songwriters write songs that are crafted for their own particular styles , and the songs do not travel well to other performers . But Dylan and Cohen 's songs as good or better when performed by others , proving that these two are not just great performers , but writers of truly great songs . The true mark of being a great songwriter is that the songs travel well into new contexts and into the performances of other singers and groups.When Jennifer Warnes released this collection of Cohen songs , she was preeminently qualified to do so , having performed with Cohen both in concert and on recordings as a back up singer . Here she put together a wonderful selection of Cohen 's finest songs and reinterpreted them from a female perspective . On some songs this took minimal efforts , such as `` Joan of Arc . '' In concert Cohen had often had either Warnes of Julie Christensen to sing the part of Joan , while taking the part of fire himself . This is , however , the one studio recording that presents how Cohen performs the song life , Warnes becoming a tragic Joan and Cohen joining on her the album to be her fire . Cohen also gave Warnes one of his best songs to debut , `` First We Take Manhattan . '' It is a glorious , bizarre , fierce attack on eighties cultural pretensions , provocatively bathing it in fascist imagery , a song that proved that Cohen , who was at the time this album was released was considered past his prime , could still pen a magnificent song . `` Song of Bernadette '' is another highlight on the album , but my favorite number on the album is Warnes 's extraordinary cover of the album 's title cut , `` Famous Blue Raincoat . '' Cohen sang it originally as a 4 a.m. letter to his wife 's seducer , who has left NYC to live elsewhere . The calm and cool exterior of the words belies the hidden pain and passion that have caused him to write . As Warnes sings it , she becomes not the offended party , but a concerned , saddened friend of all . The shift in viewpoint alters the song entirely . And Warnes sings it with all the power of a great chanteuse.Though Warnes had long been known as a gifted singer , this was her break out album . She emerged from the back ranks of American singers to become known as one of the premiere interpreters of song in America . And the album did more than merely establish Warnes as an important artist . Leonard Cohen , after great initial success in the late sixties and decreasing but definite success in the seventies , was in the eighties in a period of decline . More and more , his albums tended to contain a few amazing songs with some astonishing bland ones . Too often the gems were ignored in favor of the weak cuts . There had been a decided drop in quality of his albums for some time . But FAMOUS BLUE RAINCOAT created a new interest in Cohen , and only a year later , Cohen capitalized on the success of Warnes 's album in general and her cover of `` First We Take Manhattan '' to put it on a new album of songs , his best album sing his SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN debut . I 'M YOUR MAN started off with `` First We Take Manhattan '' ( which was made into an MTV video ) but progressed to a very strong set of songs , including not just `` I 'm Your Man , '' `` Ai n't No Cure '' ( another song Warnes had covered on her album ) , and `` Tower of Song , '' to what might be his greatest song of the past twenty years , `` Everybody Know , '' a scathing dissection of sexual mores in the post-sexual revolution generation . Not just this , the success of FAMOUS BLUE RAINCOAT and I 'M YOUR MAN led to a reexamination of Cohen 's more recent albums , and from them a number of masterpieces were rediscovered , most prominently `` Hallelujah '' from 1985 's VARIOUS POSITIONS.Might Cohen 's reascendance have taken place without Warnes 's cover album ? Perhaps . Probably . But there is no doubt that this was the right album at the right time , not only elevating her as an artist but properly honoring the man whose songs she so brilliantly covers .	1
Wonderful arrangements of some of Leonard Cohen 's best . As a former backup singer for Cohen , Warnes ' interpretations are spot on . Excellent for introducing Cohen to friends .	1
Ringo 's recording career lay fallow for a decade as drink and drugs dragged him down to the depths . Until he pulled himself out of his swoon as the 1980s closed . De-tox , wife Barbara , touring an oldies band and perhaps a little ole-time religion seemed to turn things around . Permanently . Of course , during the interval his following dwindled to some tens of thousands from the tens of millions of his Beatles and early post-Beatles years . No matter . It 's not like he was desperate for cash . What he WAS desperate for , rather , was some song-writing partners who could help him generate new Ringo Starr material to anchor new Ringo Starr records . And indeed , that 's what happened . Starr fans who tuned him out by the mid-1970s might want to consider retrospectively tuning him in again as of the 1990s . He made a heck-of-a-lot of terrific music in his 50s and 60s . It 's a new Ringo sound , but being Ringo , it 's still a hoot.In fact , each Beatle had immediate post-Beatles success , faded out at some point and then made a come-back . John was out-of-it for the second half of the 1970s . Paul kept producing during his slump but might as well have ( and should have ) taken the mid-1980s off . George DID take the mid-1980s off from recording and switched his focus to film . Not only did each former-Beatle experience fading out and coming back , each turned his back on Beatlesque/Beatlesworthy fare at some point , but later returned to it.On this album we find the first few nuggets that Ringo would hatch by way of the kind of Beatlesworthy contributions he would make to any CD-R/iPod collection that assembles the best of the Beatles ' solo output into bona fide 1970-2010 Beatles album-sets . ` Do n't Go Where the Road Do n't Go ' and ` After All These Years ' make the grade . Onto Ringo bonus CD-Rs go ` Weight of the World ' , ` Golden Blunders ' and ` What Goes Around ' -- all delightful but serving a secondary Ringo persona that was n't a Beatle . The cover of ` Do n't Be Cruel ' goes onto a post-1960s Beatles covers set.And there would be much more , and better , coming down the pipe once Ringo truly hit his stride in the late 1990s .	1
This surprising 1992 release from Ringo is easily one of the strongest albums of his solo career . The often maligned former Beatles drummer sounds much more comfortable singing than on previous releases , and his all-star band plays great behind him.None of the songs here would probably be considered 'hits ' , but there are several tracks worthy of praise . The opening song & quot ; Weight of the World & quot ; is just great , as are the love songs & quot ; In a Heartbeat & quot ; and & quot ; All in the Name of Love & quot ; . Other standouts include & quot ; Do n't Know a Thing & quot ; , & quot ; What Goes Around & quot ; , and the reflective & quot ; Golden Blunders & quot ; ( yes , pun probably intended ) .This is not a landmark or otherwise classic album , but it is a lot of fun to listen to and fans of the Beatles will find plenty here to enjoy . Ringo is an often underrated contributor to the fab four that changed popular music forever , and on & quot ; Time Takes Time & quot ; he shows that he 's more than capable of carrying an entire album and making it sound pretty darned good .	1
I had been looking for this particular disc and had a hard time finding it and boy I am glad I kept looking for it , it was worth it . It 's a good overview of his library of work . Keep up the good work . Highly recommend this title top to bottom .	1
Tangerine Dream has a wealth of repackaging of releases that it can be puzzling and oftentimes quite puzzling to fans or those wanting to hear the group for the first time . This collection , though , actually makes sense.The album focuses on 1988-1990 , when the group found a home on Peter Baumann 's Private Music label , which was located on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles . Though it leans heavily on the album entitled Melrose , there is a flow to the numbers that brings a new focus to this period of the band 's lengthy career.This is a great walk down Melrose Avenue , as a former band member gave the group the flexibility to focus on the art of creating music .	1
If you 're wanting something to calm your nerves after a long day 's work , this is definitely a good CD to listen to . Excellent background music .	1
This is by far my favorite Yanni album . I love all of his music , but this album is just so heartfelt and original . You can really hear how Yanni compares to some of the other modern composers , like Suzanne Ciani or John Tesh , in this album . Yanni looks to himself for his inspiration . This is a collection of the most original piano pieces I 've ever heard ; tracks like & quot ; Until the Last Moment & quot ; and & quot ; One Man 's Dream & quot ; are brilliantly complex in their emotion . You 'll love how Yanni manages to almost tell stories with just the piano : the left hand sets the tone while the right tells the tale . This album is absolutely a must-have .	1
I was amazed that such a CD existed featuring what is basically piano solos of the same songs performed in live concerts and in studio versions featuring much more background instrumentation.On this CD , the only background instrumentation I heard noticeably was a synthesizer ( used to simulate the sounds of violins ) . I think from time to time other instruments are used ( cello ? , violin ? ) , but what is heard most is the sound of the piano , which Yanni uses to plunk out the melodies of songs that we Yanni fans love.This is not a CD for music lovers and/or Yanni fans who prefer upbeat music with driving percussion and a full studio sound of orchestra instruments as heard in his great live concert recordings.The music on this CD is of a mood to relax to and be enveloped in.In a superficial sense , one could say this music is borderline `` Muzak , '' or `` candy . '' A closer listen will reveal melodies with passages that may resemble `` muzak , '' ( sounds to numb out to or be pacified with ) , but that also contain connections to Greek musical sensibilities ( check out some of the phrasings in `` Enchantment '' ) and an ability to connect the listener to a deep place of peace and spiritual connection.Some of the piano styling reminded me of some of the piano solo recordings of artists like Danny Wright and Lorie Line ( her `` Music from the Heart '' and `` Threads of Love '' CDs would appeal to those who enjoy the simpler versions of romantic songs performed by Yanni as featured on this CD ) .There was n't one song on the CD that I did not enjoy . Of course there were a few that I loved , but as a whole , the entire CD was very enjoyable from start to finish.My reason for buying this CD was to get `` In the Morning Light , '' a song that is seldom played in the larger Yanni concerts that have been recorded . I also thought it would be interesting to hear the great songs he has done without the background instrumentation . I remember enjoying the fuller sound of the songs featured in the live concerts , but also noticed that when he did his solo piano portions within those performances of the songs , that the solos were beautiful by themselves.This CD offers the listener a rare opportunity to hear Yanni perform some of his memorable slower songs with only minor accompaniment by other instruments.A strong recommendation for Yanni fans who can enjoy a CD of 11 tracks of slow , romantic and quietly performed beautiful melodies played with the Yanni flair . ( The enclosed booklet , unlike what sometimes accompanies the music of other artists , like Secret Garden , contained minimal information - just a listing of songs , the names of the musicians and the instruments played , and a brief thank you . This is my first Yanni CD . Maybe the booklets that accompany his other CDs contain more information . )	1
This works good when I 'm driving or working at my desk . It 's background music . A few of the pieces area really great , a few are mediocre , but mostly , it 's a pleasant collection .	1
Dare to Dream and In My Time are Yanni 's best instrumental albums and make my favorites list . Voces combines Yanni 's genius with a variety of talented singers and also makes my list .	1
This album is a great album to listen to with family members and will touch your heart and you 'll love it .	1
To be honest you must listen to live at acropolis before touching this album.I highly recommend the Acropolis beforepurchasing this.I listen to In My Time from yanni my parentslisten to Live at Acropolis personally my opinion one is todramatical thats why I can not listen to that.But I have tosay the # 1 album that puts me to sleep or taking a bath isIn my time you can not judge that album it is to good to listento.By the way it sounds a bit of your time to be honest like I said if your in my days you will do as I say as an advice .	1
Mood elevating Piano Solos from the greatest composer of the world . Must listen tracks on this CD - `` One mans dream '' , `` In the mirror '' , `` Felitsa '' and `` Until the last moment '' . Buy it and own it then you will never regret .	1
This is a fantastic collection of well-chosen cover tunes as well as originals . They range from the energetic workout , & quot ; Hoochi Coochi Coo & quot ; to slow blues such as & quot ; That 's How Strong My Love Is & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; Going to the River & quot ; . The presence of the Texacali Horns throughout the album give it a distinct 50 's feel . Etta James joins Taj for a great version of & quot ; Mockingbird & quot ; . There 's not a weak track here . Great blues , lots of fun !	1
Taj Mahal recorded this in 1993 - I bought the CD in 2001 and am still listening to it . Here Taj Mahal takes on pre 1970 rhythm and blues . He does a wonderful duet of Mockingbird with Etta James . Fantastic CD .	1
Etta James is as good a blues singer as there is . I would recommend this CD to friends with the same feelings about the Blues .	1
This is a wonderful CD , one of Etta 's very best . But do NOT buy `` At Last ( The Best of Etta James '' ) , produced in 2011 . That CD is terrible ... The difference between the two CDs is unbelievable !	1
Etta james finally wona Grammy for this album which is shocking cause hello she 's etta james what in the world took the grammy 's so long ... this is a great cd ..that has a living legend pay tribute to another departed legend of jazz Billy holiday..her range is incredible ... considering she is a true barritone ... amazing ... one of her best albums..	1
I went to see Yanni in Houston LIVE ! ! ! His music is mellow and bittersweet and I just like the many instruments that make up his band !	1
This man and his music will openthe dark spaces in your heart andlet the light heal your soul.Beautiful and awe inspiring.Highly recommended .	1
This is a very high Quality sounding cd . If you are a true Audiophile then this is the & # 34 ; Live at The Acropolis & # 34 ; cd version that you want ! Just Superb ! ! I have two other versions of this cd , just pure garbage , as compared to this version by Sony . This is the & # 34 ; best & # 34 ; . This cd is the way & # 34 ; Yanni & # 34 ; should sound ! ! I highly recommend this cd for its superb & # 34 ; Sound & # 34 ; quality .	1
This is a breathtakingly good album . It features many of Yanni 's most loved compositions perfomed in the dramatic live setting of the Acropolis in his native Greece.What a treat listeners are in for with the wonderful Royal Philharmonic Orchestra accompanying Yanni , and giving his music a magical touch . They really do help showcase Yanni 's fantastic material . The whole concert is masterfully conducted by Shardad Rohani.I love all the tracks , and the fact it is live , helps bring this album to life . I also recommend the Video/DVD that was made of this historic and extremely ambitious concert.If you can get the UK version of this album from Amazon.com 's sister site , Amazon.co.uk , it contains the added bonus of Aria as the last track which is beautiully sung and is one of my favourite pieces.Written when , for me , Yanni was at his peak , this CD is excellent from start to finish and I give this album my highest recommendation .	1
If I had to pick 10 CD 's that were the very essence of passion this would be one of the top picks ! I saw Yanni first playing live on TV as I was & quot ; channel surfing & quot ; and I was frozen in my seat , completely entralled by his passion and originality . I went straight out the next day and bought this CD . Rarely does any music reach out and Grab my heart the way Yanni does ; oh if everything were as romantic and passionate as his music ! My personal favorites are : 1 ONE MAN 'S DREAM 2 REFLECTIONS OF PASSION 3 UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT 4 NOSTALGIA and 5 THE RAIN MUST FALL.Whether you are a hopeless romantic , or a firey aggressive person this is the music for you ! I whole-heartedly recommend Yanni 's music for the entire world ! There is so much beauty . No words are needed .	1
Kenny Rankin sings the jazz of rainy Sundays by an open fire.His intimate and highly personal style is no better exemplified than on this set , `` Professional Dreamer '' .In many ways it 's a departure from his usual repertoire as it consists entirely of classics from the 1940s and 50s.These offerings reflect the musical values of another era - elegant and genteel songs from a time when melody lines were strong and lyrics dripped with intelligent emotion.These compositions lend themselves perfectly to Rankinesque interpretationThe standout cut `` But Not for Me '' ripples with a soft Latin undercurrent.Rankin 's vocal improvisations are gentle and deliberate as they paint a soul-sad portrait of someone love has overlooked.Gershwin 's beautiful `` Our Love is Here to Stay '' is another highlight of this very classy set.So too is the cheeky and whimsical `` I 've Got a Crush on You '' and the ultra-evocative `` The Very Thought of You '' .It 's all exquisite grist for a very tender mill.An album for the ages - FIVE STARS for Kenny and the jazz of rainy Sundays .	1
Although this was released in 1994 , it was actually recorded in March 1981 . Etta and friends financed the recording but were unable to release it . Thankfully , this was pulled out of the vault . Obviously , this recording was a labor of love and it shows.I have to admit , I was not entirely ready for the growling vocals , and even at times it sounds like Etta is gargling water ! But it 's apparent she 's just having fun and doing it on purpose . When she launches into a devastating cover of Take It To The Limit ( my favorite track ) , you know you 're in the hands of a pro.The backing band is tight and stripped down . One guitar , bass , drums , keyboards , and a minimum of horns . The audience obviously LOVES Etta and their enthusiasm drives the performance . Etta delivers a great set of blues , soul and R & B ; that is guaranteed to satisfy . Signature songs Tell Mama , Sugar On The Floor , and I 'd Rather Go Blind are followed by a three song Otis Redding medley . Etta wraps it up with an exquisite song titled Born Blue .	1
In keeping with the & quot ; spirit of JUST reviewing what is representedon the particular cd in question ; I shall diligently strive to do so.But since Ms. James has been a consistent , and pervasive , influence on my life thus far ; it IS kind of hard to do it . But I certainly will give it my best shot . Fortunately , it wo n't be at all difficult with THIS particular cd . The & quot ; old Etta & quot ; is back up to & quot ; rare form & quot ; once again ! & quot ; Cry Like A Rainy Day & quot ; , & quot ; The Rock & quot ; , & quot ; Love & quot ; s Been Rough on Me & quot ; , & quot ; If I Had Any Pride Left At All & quot ; , all can and do stand up very well indeed ; to her & quot ; older , more well-known contributions to her more traditional & quot ; gutsey , & quot ; torchy & quot ; blues standards . In fact , almost all of this cds offerings do well . I even like the the country-influenced renderings , they do not detract from this blues matriarch 's & quot ; bluesy torch & quot ; at all.Actually , they evenly , calmly , bolster her renditions.This cd also proves that the Etta James I have so lovingly followedfor so many numerous years ; can still & quot ; belt it out in true blues-mamma form & quot ; , and CAN still do it ; and do it auspciously as well.No doubt , & quot ; love AND life itself has & quot ; been rough on Etta & quot ; .And she plainly does n't care if you know that fact . But , even IF she does talk about & quot ; pity & quot ; in a few of these offerings , ( hey , after all , it IS a Blues cd ) ; make no mistake , THIS lady is n't REALLY & quot ; asking for that & quot ; . She 's got way too much & quot ; moxie & quot ; for that ; she always did , and I do heartily recommend THIS cd , cause if you 're really listening , she still ISN'Tasking for it . Whyndam Hill , huh ? Well , I certainly hope that they know how to treat a real blues legend , in her OWN time . Cetainly with this cd , it sounds like they may . Thank you both for this & quot ; fresh reminder & quot ; .	1
Ms. James 's acknowledgements in the booklet of this 1997 release are gracious in standard liner-note fashion ; she thanks her collaborators and significant others and concludes , `` You can call it country , you can call it country blues , you can call it country soul -- call it whatever you like . It is just me . Another one of my dreams fulfilled . I 've always wanted to do a country record and here it is . '' Perhaps she was diplomatically holding back , or perhaps she truly felt this way but soured on the record within the next year , but in a 1998 ROLLING STONE interview , she bitterly disowned this recording . She criticized everything from the production to the photo on the cover ( to my nearly ten-years-past recollection , her descriptive phrase was something like `` a picture of me with a shawl around my neck , looking like some sad old woman who 's about to go make spaghetti '' ) . She seemed disappointed and resentful that the label initially had supported her in her desire to make a country record , but then backed away from that concept in the event ( more below on the specifics of this ) .So , be aware that by recommending this so strongly , I am putting myself in opposition to the artist herself . But artists are not always the best judge of their own work ; sometimes one can get a clearer view from not standing so close . I wonder if Ms. James 's opinion of LOVE 'S BEEN ROUGH ON ME would be more generous today , if she were able to hear it as the record it is , rather than the one that fell short of what she had in mind . I have a feeling that what she envisioned ( or whatever the aural equivalent of `` envisioned '' would be ) was more along the lines of what Solomon Burke was allowed to do on his 2006 masterpiece NASHVILLE -- an aged but still potent R & B ; voice that exudes hard-won wisdom , confronting music of an unabashedly rustic character in both composition and execution . It is true that the country influence on Ms. James 's album , when not absent entirely ( vigorous rock-and-soul jams like `` Love It Or Leave It Alone '' and `` I Can Give You Everything '' ; a heartfelt cover of Otis Redding 's `` I 've Been Lovin ' You Too Long '' ) , is subtle at best . There are a few song structures so purely Nashville as to be identifiable as such no matter how they 're decked out ( `` Done In The Dark , '' which she and one of her sons cowrote ; `` If I Had Any Pride Left At All '' ) , and a fleeting guitar twang or underpinning of steel ( `` The Rock '' ; the title song ) , but the greater portion of the album is a slick and soulful affair . The inclusion of a horn section , over the singer 's objection , seems to have been a particularly sore spot . If it 's `` Etta goes country , '' it 's decidedly heavier on the `` Etta '' than the `` country . `` And yet , ten years on , this sounds not only better than ever , but ( to me ) like the jewel of what could be called the third phase of Ms. James 's recording career , the one that began in 1994 with her first release on Private Music , and continues in her present association with RCA . In this period she has benefited from a kind of support that is no doubt the envy of many less fortunate contemporaries . She has been staggeringly prolific , recording Tin Pan Alley standards ( four discs ! ) , rock , blues , the inevitable holiday album , even easy-listening pop . But for all the first-class production values and the admirably broad artistic palette of her many releases , few of them have really `` scored . '' There is no doubting Ms. James 's sincere affection for the music of Gershwin , Berlin , Porter , and their like , but three albums of standards with pianist Cedar Walton 's jazz combo ( '94 's MYSTERY LADY , '95 's TIME AFTER TIME , and '01 's BLUE GARDENIA ) demonstrate conclusively that such music does not play to her strengths as an improviser or interpreter ( she has more in common as a song stylist with Aretha Franklin and Dinah Washington , both of whom could also sound out of place on Tin Pan Alley , than with Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday , who thrived there ) . An attempt at still more of the same , this time in heavily synthesized , `` modern '' clothing , '99 's HEART OF A WOMAN , is not only the worst of her Private albums but one of the worst things I have ever heard from any major artist : unlistenable . LIFE , LOVE AND THE BLUES ( '98 ) and MATRIARCH OF THE BLUES ( '00 ) are more pertinent , but still leave an aftertaste of the generic . They 're agreeable yet stubbornly unmemorable attempts at recapturing a classic Etta James formula.Not so with LOVE 'S BEEN ROUGH ON ME . For once , whatever her misgivings about what was done with her original concept , she seems to this listener to have everything going for her : songwriting that is consistently strong ; a unified theme and atmosphere that pervades the entire set ( I can only describe this as a sort of `` nocturnal '' quality -- everything here , whether a ballad or an uptempo number , has the feel of a late-night rumination from someone who has accepted her insomnia ) ; a style of music that is right in her comfort zone as an interpreter ; and instrumental support that 's not only alert and responsive but assertive enough to challenge her , to good effect . She gets into a hell-for-leather duel with whichever of her electric guitarists features on `` Love It Or Leave It Alone '' ; and the way the ensemble coalesces and swells behind her whenever the `` b '' section of `` Cry Like A Rainy Day '' comes around ( `` I 've made some wrong moves ... '' `` Remember these arms ... '' et cetera ) is genuinely thrilling . Finally , do not be surprised if , like me , you come to consider her performance of the standout track , `` If I Had Any Pride Left At All , '' as affecting a ballad performance as she has ever given on record . No small compliment when one 's discography includes `` At Last '' ( well , yes , but try to remember how you felt about it before it was flogged to death in every TV show or movie that has a slow dance ) and `` Lovin ' Arms . '' For all that the voice has darkened and wizened ( which she uses to exquisite effect in the rueful I'm-leaving-you opener , `` The Rock '' ) , her singing here is far more remarkable for the power it retains than for anything it 's given up .	1
I 've been listening to Kottke for years and have all his recordings I can find , but have been mildly disappointed with his recent releases thru the late '80s and early '90s , but this new release goes back to his roots with likes of his & quot ; Greenhouse & quot ; and & quot ; Ice Water & quot ; releases . Some great guitar numbers and vocals ( his voice grows on you like a fungus ... ca n't get enough of it ! ) , plus Chet Atkins helping out on one number ! Leo has been blessed by the guitar god , and it shows on this new release !	1
Man , Leo Kottke is so darn good -- - great in fact -- - and it saddens me that he 's not better known or more revered among guitar players and fans of the instrument . Blisters on your fingers , baby , this guy is tops ! Okay , so maybe this is n't his best album , nor the place to start if you have n't heard Mr. Kottke before , but honestly , I did n't think the & # 34 ; contemporary & # 34 ; production touches , drum machines and all , on this album ( keeping in mind that this was released in 1997 ) detract from the music at all . It ai n't acoustic blues , but it 's still a far cry from hip-hop . Sheesh , that 's ridiculous ! This is Leo Kottke and it still sounds like Leo Kottke.As others have noted , Kottke re-visits a few of older compositions and throws in some new stuff , but the track that really stands out for me is his cover of Fleetwood Mac 's & # 34 ; World Turning. & # 34 ; A brilliant instrumental interpretation , showcasing some of Kottke 's amazing slide guitar prowess . That may be the highlight , but the rest of the album did n't let me know either . My only gripe is that it was all just too short . More , Leo , more ! 1 .

This is one of those rare CDs , the kind you listen to over and over . I was n't a Kenny Rankin fan , but was led to his music through my love of Brazilian jazz , Ivan Lins , Rosa Passos , and many of the Brazilian musicians Kenny used on this CD . This is a very fine CD , one of my all time favorites . I have owned this album since it came out .	1
I first heard Kenny on a song on another artist 's CD , and I knew I was going to want more , so here is the 1st of many I plan to buy . Thank you .	1
I 've loved this artist for years , and this one is his best ! Puzzle of Hearts is one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs I 've ever heard . The Brazilian influences are just right . Love this CD -- absolutely LOVE it !	1
You take some soul , some old r & amp ; b , some jazz , some blues ( of course ) , some country and some original songs and put them together with feeling , rhythm and skillful musical performances and you have a Taj Mahal cd . Taj never lets you down . He has an extensive interest in music of all kinds and expresses his love of it through his singing and playing.It is always interesting to look at the songs he puts together on his cd . On this one Steve Cropper , Otis Redding , Horace Silver , Marvin Gaye , Washboard Sam , Delbert McClinton , Hank Williams ( sr. ) and of course the man himself Taj Mahal are represented songwriters . And amazingly it works , they all go together to form a cohesive cd . One of his originals 21st Century Gypsy Singin ' Lover Man is a compelling new blues song.I always have to discipline myself and not over play Taj Mahal , this CD included .	1
I had heard of Taj Mahal but had never sampled his work until very recently , and I picked his 1997 album `` Senor Blues '' pretty much at random . My experiences with Van Morrison and Dr John had got me interested in what I guess is a second or third generation of blues ( the first being Leadbelly and Robert Johnson , I guess ) and what we have with these musicians who are now around 60 years of age is something a bit more polished or finished than what I imagine the original blues shouters to have produced . But there 's still plenty of energy as well as polish on `` Senor Blues '' with a range of material running from the late 1990 's back to around 1930 ( `` I 'll be glad when you 're dead '' ) and taking in work by Hank Williams ( `` Mind your own Business '' ) , Delbert McClintock , Marvin Gaye , and Sam Cooke . It 's all great . The title track is a beauty , as is `` I must have had a bad day '' and everything else on the album . The backup band is right on point ( nice brass work ) , and there 's a lot of variety to the material . Vocally , Taj can go rough or smooth as the song demands . The whole thing is a delight . The transformation of pain into pleasure is one of the great mysteries of art -- why do we leave `` King Lear '' feeling uplifted ? -- and on a very fundamental level , the blues has a similar effect . Highly recommended .	1
This music sooths , when most of the world is loud . It heals when much of our environment is harmful . Creative music , very inventive ! Another five star CD from our friend Yanni ! !	1
You can never go wrong listening to Yanni . This is another great , solid , variation of music that you can enjoy .	1
I was very impressed by this CD . I have been a Yanni fan ever since I saw & quot ; Live at the Acropolis & quot ; in 1994 . This is real music . Music that you feel in your soul .	1
I 'm Young Jun Kim from South KOREA republic.Your kindness came from through the album.Revolution theory made man men.Creative theory made woman keep.Serpent madness made people ghosts ! Rain Run & Run made human nude ! Calming proposed ! Good bye ! Sincerely ,	1
This is another great offering from Paul Winter , and is a good journey through places with differing musical styles . If you like Paul Winter , it is a good addition to the collection	1
Well another solid hip hop album from start to end . Here is another one where it is hard as hell to pick something that I dont like on here . I have to say this is one album that I can still play today in 2007 and it sounds good . These two rappers from New Jersey sound good as they go back and forth . It is sad that they broke up and only had 2 albums out . They are doing there thing on the Independant scene and makeing good stuff . I am biased and have to say that I like El Da Sensei more than Tame One but dont get it wrong Tame One is still nice . This is 2 guys that I would like to see get back toghether and make another album for the sake of real hip hop fans .	1
When this cd came out Lil Kim made sure we all knew it . A lof of people critize the Queen because she talks about sex too much and doesnt wear enough clothing . And I say more power to her . I think that she does it for entertainment . I mean c'mon , if u cant handle her then dont listen to her music . .. anyways great debut album , she has some crazy lyrics and dope beats.. Thank you	1
Junior Mafia member Lil ' Kim goes solo on `` Hardcore '' . This album is better than you think . Although she definitely sold out completely on her following releases , she does have some street credibility on her debut album . She will never be known as a strong lyricist but has a good beat selection . For those nostalgic of 90s hip hop and female hip hop before it became overly cliched and saturated this along with Foxy Browns `` Ill Na Na '' would be good albums to pick up .	1
Lil'Kim has a great rapping voice and at the same time can do a slow ballid . I really enjoyed her album and I would n't trade it for any other . Kim knows how to throw it down . All the best to you Queen Bee !	1
This was the first cd i picked up from her when it came out . It was jamin , the music , and production are tight . Yea she was very nasty and raw , but you have to admit the beats are on point . Most of the music is from James brown , check out James brown funky people CD 's you will know where the music was sampled from	1
Lil ' Kim gets a lot of heat for not being afraid to do what it is that she wants to do , and that definetly holds true here . `` Hardcore '' is the first album in the Lil ' Kim Legacy , and my favortie . She tells it like it is , and that 's how it 's supposed to be told ! Get this CD if you are really into rap , and like an artist whose different from the game . All the other rap females say that Lil ' Kim is trying to take their style , but she 's been around before them ( i.e. , Foxy Brown ) . There is really one other rapper whom I feel is equal to Lil ' Kim , and that 's Gangsta Boo . Do your thing , Kim !	1
After being part of Jr. Mafia , Biggie Smalls introduced the world of Hip-Hop to one of his most talented artists -- Lil Kim . I knew Lil Kim could rap from Player 's Anthem and Get Money . However when her debuted single hit 'No Time ' hit the airwaves and video launched I knew this album would make Lil Kim a star . Biggie gave Kim the right producers and writers , and allowed Kim to pen her own material as well . The album is now 15 years old and is double platinum ( the first female rapper to do this and then Missy thereafter ) . The lyrical content was viewed as taboo for a female rapper at the time , but Kim was able to have the confidence and drive to not be ashamed of what she was rapping about . Without her putting the blueprint to these daring songs I do n't think a female rapper would be as ballsy to do it now . I will say if you never heard this album please cope this . The beats are sicks and I do n't think you will find one song you ca n't vibe with .	1
I never was hating on her bacc in the day but a'lot of people thought Big was writing her rhymes ... I think he did more then she admit 'd to , that 's why I never consider this the best Female Rap Album ... { Rah Digga Dirty Harriet gets that title } .	1
This album is hot as hell . If you did n't get the album yet , what in the hell were you doing for 4 years . Get the album . While you at it get the new one Notorious K I M .	1
DJ Pooh gets some LA and Long Beach rappers together and spins some cuts and drops some beats for them to rap over in 1997 . For the most part , the beats are phat , and many are unlike any I have heard before . I do not like every beat , but some are simply irresistible . The rappers are cool , but Pooh steals the show . His style is deep groove G-Funk with his own individual style . My fav here is `` Bump Yo Speakers ; '' the beat slaps with that LA lowrider funk with Threat 's verses gettin you in the mood to sit sideways in a lac I love Charlie Wilson ( of Gap Band fame ) steppin in to deliver a brief but crazy hook vocal simply stating `` bump bump bump bump '' with his throaty voice . Kam busts on mark MC 's in `` Whoop Whoop '' with an old school sample ; his flows kill . T-Lee busts some flows on the title track where Pooh drops some straight syrupy and twangy sauce . This cat can scratch ! Many joints have cuts scratched with absolute precision . My favorite thing , you can see , is the beats on the album . Mista Grimm also takes his turn buckin ' down bustas in the whippy funk of `` MC 's Must Come Down '' with some dope background horns . Pooh creates a more laidback atmosphere while Kam drops some more knowledge on `` Who Cares '' with an Marvin Gaye interpolation in the hook . A scorcher oldschool meets G-Funk era joint is Threat 's 4th outta 5 appearances on the bouncy Nowhere 2 Hide . The beat is crazy awesome . I am not too crazy about the beat and lyrics on `` No Idea , '' but Roger Troutman 's talkbox and Shirley Murdock 's lovely hook vocals are redeeming qualities here ! Overall , Pooh and his guests drop a nice G-Funk party jam while droppin some knowledge here and there . Riders , get ya whips juiced , and blast this one on 3 wheel motion !	1
There isnt a bigger compliment i can pay other than to say it was a damn shame these 2 cats didnt get what their talent clearly deserves ... ... .multi platinum status+globel recognition.From start to finish this is nothing short of a masterpiece . The beats and rhymes at a level most artists in hiphop today or previous will never reach . The 2 mc 's flows are fast , witty , honest , hard edged , skilled and basically perfect . The beats are absolutely rockin ' . The dj ( KAOS ) is off the meat-rack , his cuts and slices are awesome , and they bless EVERY track . Its basically `` 2 turntables and a microphone '' time baby ! ! ! ! All the tracks are excellent but my stand out joints are `` art of facts '' , `` 31 bumrush '' , `` to ya chest '' , `` the ultimate '' , `` its gettin'hot '' , `` the interview '' , `` this is the way '' , `` who 's this ? '' and the showbiz remix of `` the ultimate '' at the end . Off the hook .	1
I truly wish Tame and El were still together , but that 's what happens when money messes up the chemistry ( Pete Rock & CL Smooth ) . This album was one of the most slept-on albums of 96-97 , and one of the most hottest . While most rap acts of that time were buying into the dawn of the `` Jiggy '' and `` Shiny Suit '' era , Tame and El stayed to their name being true `` Artifacts '' of hiphop with this album . Enlisting underground sensations like : Shawn J . Period , Lord Jamar , Showbiz , Mr. Walt , and Baby Paul , and matched with ill lyrics this album was and still is proof of what a `` HipHop '' album is supposed to sound like . I any and all true hiphop heads to cop this album .	1
for me , this has about the same feel as the first one . i hate that they broke up though . i would 've liked to see what they would 've done as time progressed in hip hop . i agree with one of the viewers though when the person said it is hip hop as it should be . as i said before , the beats could be fatter .	1
Let me begin by saying that I am not a huge fan of rap . However , Twista is BY FAR my favorite rapper . When I first heard the song & quot ; Emotions & quot ; in my friends car , I said & quot ; Holy Sh ! t that guy can rap. & quot ; I immediately bought the cd , and was not disappointed in the least . Every , that is EVERY song is excellent . My favorites include & quot ; Death Before Dishonor & quot ; , & quot ; Unsolved Mysteries & quot ; , and the & quot ; Emotions & quot ; remix . Not only are these some of the tightest tracks musically , but Twista is without comparison the best rapper I 've ever heard . He can sing , talk , rap , and yell faster than anyone else , and still enunciate clearly . And he varies his vocals . If you like rap at all , you must own this album .	1
Formally Tung Twista on debut album now simply goes by Twista for his sophomore release Adrenaline Rush with the signature rapid flow . `` Intro '' is almost conjure of the feelings and intensity put into this album . The title track featuring Young Buck of Psycho Drama is a good opposition of flows between the two as they share verses as stated in the beginning `` ... what happens when you combine the darkness with the light.. ? '' This album was entirely produced by The Legendary Traxter and enhanced Twista 's flow over songs such as `` Death Before Dishonor '' with lyrics such as `` ... with a paint brush / that a nigga ca n't trust ... '' The highlight of this album is hearing his flow over the slow , R & B tracks such as `` It Feels So Good '' and both versions of `` Emotions '' . `` Overdose '' is actually the overall highlight of this LP as Twista had to be cut off with his overdub vocals with the same rapid fire flow . `` Mobster 's Anthem '' featuring Speedknot Mobstaz is good crew song with the sample of Dr. Dre 's `` It 's A G Thang '' . The thriller track on `` Unsolved Mystery '' is a song of fury where Twista took it to the street with murder and the opposite as he speaks on survival on `` Korrupt World '' featuring Side Effects of Psycho Drama . `` Get It Wet '' featuring Miss Kane is another mainstream song as he talks of getting close to the ladies . Hearing a variety of flows instead of the constant flow `` No Remorse '' featuring Speedknot Mobstaz , Link & Turtle ended this album with a high note . Twista 's flow , lyrics and overall performance here is underestimated and is stronger than the later commercial / mainstream albums that recently had been released . Adrenaline Rush contains all the ingredients to make an album successful commercial hits , underground appeal , street songs , production and flow . All that is necessary for a good classic hip-hop / rap album is found here .	1
Twista is one of the fastest most talented rapper anybody could ever hear . ANybody that dont like him is strictly hatin . Number 2 is probably the best song on this . He comes from the Chi . Chi love to the fullest	1
Im from Chi but love all coasts . This cd is amazing . Twista has perfected his flow and delivers each line on point like he calculated each syllable one by one . But its his natural talent that makes the flow sound smooth not choppy . The other asset is his lyrical wizardry . He has one liners here and there but sticks to consistent subject matter . He has the ability to tell stories at a blazing speeds so listen up.Picture This by Do or Die is # 1 on my midwest list . Adrenaline Rush is a close second .	1
After about 15 recommendations , I finally go this disc . And I can tell you that Twist put some thought in this . But why was a CD from this guy so much better than that of `` big names '' Here 's three reasons why this CD was a success ( other artists take note ) 1 . Twista uses his guest artist wisely- Yes , he has skills to burn , but listening to a fast rapper the whole disc would get tiring . However , the guests here do n't try to sound like Twista , and keep their own identity while not disrupting the tone of the album . They contribute , rather than filling up space2 . He knows when to quit-Instead of slamming 20+ songs on a disc like some rappers , he gives us 11 good tracks . We not tired of him by the 12th song . This way , we get just enough to make us wan na go get the next CD.3 . He keeps it real-He 's not trying to be the next one hit wonder . ( Nelly ) He puts equal effort into all songs , so theirs never a let down , and no filler . ( Nelly again ) Twista bring us the sound of Chicago , and uses it to create songs that all have a unique identity.If Twista ever got signed to a major label , he would be big . Unfortunately , I think people will always just see him as a fast rapper , and never look past his style , which is too bad . Cause the guy has skills .	1

I bought this album for one specific mix , the instrumental version of `` Drugs '' , even if I do n't like the title , since I 've heard it on Pandora , I felt in love with it . Good album , the traditional rap , good product , came in great condition .	1
The hits on the this cd established Lil ' Kim as the hottest and the boldest female rapper of the decade . This version of Not tonight ( ladies night ) is the first record in a number of years which had allfemale rappers . Lil ' Kim , Angie Martinez , Left Eye , Da Brat and Missy make this record sound as good as The original Kool and the Gang version . The crush on you still reflects the late Notorious B.I.G . and Lil ' Cease , however Kim 's raps make this version tight . Drugs belongs to Kim .	1
Budgie 's third album , ` Never Turn Your Back on a Friend ' contains their most famous and arguably best song in lead track , `` Breadfan '' . This track , the album opener , is an amazing proto-thrash metal classic that is incredibly heavy for 1973 ! However if listeners were aware of the bands first two albums then they would be as surprised at the aural violence wreaked by `` Breadfan '' . ` Never ' also contains other notable tracks which curiously feature two other heavy long songs , two short acoustic ditties and a ten minute `` power ballad '' that closes the record , `` Parents '' . The latter song is probably the LP 's other key track as it has appeared on several compilations of the band 's finest works . `` Powdered Milk '' and `` Tyrefitter 's Hand '' are exceptional tunes , complex and both feature the Budgie trademark of an absurd title . `` Powdered Milk '' actually changes course about halfway through its eight minute running time where Tony Bourge ( ? ) takes over as lead vocalist and sings what seems like an almost completely different song ! A cover of `` Baby Please Do n't Go '' also graces the third record and although this songs has been covered by many a hard rock band , Budgie 's version seems a little more distinctive . ` Never Turn Your Back on a Friend ' ensured the band modest success in Europe as a headline act but still did n't make much more of a cult dent in the States but Budgie would plow on . With a number like `` Breadfan '' to open their shows , fans in the USA would have to wait another three years before Wales ' unique power trio would come to apply the bludgeon to their skulls .	1
'The Chantays ' represent the mid-point between the early 60 's 'Surf-sound ' & the mid-60 's attempt at 'mod-psychedelic music ' . Some of the best song 's on this double-album are : `` Move it '' , `` Love Can Be Cruel '' ( Good ) , '' Only If You Care '' ( kinda ' korny , but cool ) , `` Beyond '' ( reverb surf sound ) , `` Greenz '' ( early mod-psychedelic ) , `` Space Probe '' ( ok ) , `` Continental Missle '' ( kinda ' cool ) , `` Retaliation '' ( very cool , early mod-psychedlic sound ) , `` Pipeline '' ( classic surf-reverb ! ) , `` Runaway '' ( surf-reverb version of classic hit ) , `` Blunderbus '' ( surf-mod sound ) , `` Banzai '' ( surf ) , & `` Last Night '' ( surf-reverb shuffle ) .	1
Sorry for not being polite , but there is no `` Uriah Heep '' without Byron and Hensley ( as there is no Sabbath without Osbourne ) . All right , there is , but it 's a different band - the magic was gone . And this is a solo album of Ken Hensley from the golden age of rock - equal to the best of `` Uriah Heep '' , or even better , featuring his bandmates - Lee Kerslake and Gary Thain . If you have n't heard this album , I feel pity about you . If you 've heard , but did n't like - something is wrong . But if you had a chance ( like now ) to buy , and you did n't - you 're an arse . It was n't available for long time , and I paid dearly to get it . For this price - it 's a gift . It goes well with `` Eager to Please '' ( Eager to Please , but I would strongly advise to pay an attention to Hensley & Wetton -More Than Conquerors ) , and , especially , to a particular side project - where Hensley fronts for German rockers -Weed ... ! . As for the early years ( pre-Uriah Heep ) , do n't missGenesisandToe Fat . And , on top of it , a superb album from 1969 -Orgasm- it is considered as a merely side project , but is as good and powerful as `` Heep '' ( featuring both Hensley and Kerslake ) .	1
Some of this stuff has become dated and some sounds a little too Disco , but once the sax starts to wail ( on fast songs ) or sound lyrical ( on slow songs ) on some of the songs , it 's great stuff . I 'd say that the five songs that do work for me from start to finish make this collection worth the expense . And `` Do n't Start Me Talking '' is a classic blues track that IS great from start to finish , including great vocals , lyrics , and mixing . This is award-winning-worthy mixing .	1
Very pleased with this collection . Now , I do n't have to wait until some DJ gets around to playing the songs .	1
Brings back many happy memories of songs that my uncles used to listen to and i was therefore forced to happily listen too !	1
In 1975 I was at a friend 's house when he played an import album on the Harvest label called Climax Chicago/Tightly Knit . I was immediately hooked and that album remains one of the top five of my all time fav 's . That album and the follow up F.M Live showcase on of the best muti-instrumentalist Blues bands of all time period ! Listen to Derick Holt 's slide solo piece `` County hat '' on the Live album and it 's clear your hearing one of the best ( and definitely the most overlooked ) slide guitarist to ever wear the bottle . When I read reviews where people base their opinion of this band on the throw away `` money grab '' song I Love You it makes me want to stick my head in an oven ! This song is Air Supply-ish gooey crapola that does n't deserve to be mentioned in a serious discussion of this band and was probably written to pay off some lawyer or something ! There 's a reason you do n't hear Paul McCartney playing Yesterday live anymore people ! File that stuff under Mr.Phyliss 's Chic Flick compilations and let 's move on ! Disco and apparently corporate greed killed this band with Gold Plated being their true swan song . Buy Tightly Knit , A lot of Bottle , F.M Live and this collection IN THAT ORDER ! I promise you will be a better educated and much happier consumer ( and fan ! )	1

What can be said about Budgie that has n't been said of any other late 60s/early 70s heavy-rock power trio : universally hated by critics , musically incompetent-until , of course , they `` mellowed '' out in the middle period of their career and learned how to play , and toughened their sound again later on , when demand for heavy metal came back in the early 80s . Budgie leader , Burke Shelley , himself , is your `` proto-typical '' singing bass player in a power trio . Combine Rush 's Geddy Lee , and his lanky , girlish figure , together with Blue Cheer 's Dickie Petersen , and his `` evil munchkin '' squeaks and squawks for vocals , and you have Burke Shelley . And throughout the years , Burke Shelley HAS BEEN Budgie . Not exactly sure why he could never keep a supporting cast of guitarist and drummer all those years to play with him . From what I 've read about him , he seems a nice enough fellow -- certainly , not the kind of chap who would be difficult work with -- like Ian Anderson from Jethro Tull.When looking for a `` best of '' compilation on Budgie , do n't go for the most obvious one at the top -- called `` the very best of Budgie '' , but choose this one , not-so obvious from the title ( which could have been better titled -- '' Ecstasy of Fumbling '' not guaranteed to sell a lot of discs . But then , neither was a name like `` Budgie '' ! ) It 's easy to miss , because of this title . But trust me , it 's better than the `` very best of Budgie '' . For one thing , `` The Very Best of Budgie '' includes no songs from one of the better Budgie albums , `` Squawk '' , but this one has two of the best songs from `` Squawk '' -- '' Whiskey River '' , and `` Hot As A Docker 's Armpit '' . Plus , this is a 2-disc set , covering most of Budgie 's career -- including their down moments.Disc one kicks off with a `` bang ! '' -- the first 6 songs , in particular , featuring some of Budgie 's most hard-rocking moments . From `` Homicidal/Suicidal '' through `` Breadfan '' , with the band 's trademark tempo-changes and rave-ups , it 's easy to see why Budgie were so influential on many of today 's heavy metal bands ( although , I think some of those same bands , like Metallica and Soundgarden , could just as easily been influenced by Blue Cheer , had they bothered to give them a listen ! ) Tony Bourge was the guitar player on much of those early numbers -- with a similar , fat , baritone , Gibson guitar sound to another `` Tony '' from over the Welsh border -- Tony Iommi . Although , Bourge seems a little more nimble on the frets than Iommi ( he did n't have a missing `` finger tip '' either ! ) , his soloing reminds me a little more like Lee Pickens from a Texas heavy-rock band of the same period -- Bloodrock -- especially on the first two tracks of disc one . `` Big '' John Thomas kept up the Gibson guitar tradition in the band when he took over after Bourge left in the late 70s , and you 'll hear his contributions primarily on disc two . But it was Tony Bourge who was a big part of what made the `` Budgie sound '' what it is today . And I liked how well Burke Shelley kept up with , and often `` shadowed '' , Tony Bourge 's playing on his bass , playing some nice rhythm -- although , Shelley himself confesses that he did n't really know how to play bass until later on.All the drummers the band had throughout their history have been pretty decent -- again , I 'm not sure why they could n't work with Mr. Shelley.The first four tracks of `` disc two '' pretty much go through the band 's `` mellow '' , or `` experimental '' , period ( shades of Led Zeppelin and Bad Company from the same time period of 1975-76 . `` Presence '' and `` Physical Graffiti '' -type `` filler '' music `` mellow '' ) Then , in 1980 , with the popularity of bands like Judas Priest and Motorhead on the rise , Budgie follows suit in the same musical vein , with new guitarist , `` Big '' John Thomas on board , for the rest of the disc covering the years 1980 through 1982.Lyrically speaking , Budgie 's song titles seem to be at times more interesting than the songs themselves . Do n't get me wrong -- the Welsh are a sweet folk , but they seem to live in such a remote , primitive , almost-sheltered society , that Welsh bands like Budgie and The Alarm come across in their lyrics as having such a wide-eyed , overly-idealistic , but extremely-naive view of the world . Kind of like , `` innocence first discovery of sin '' , almost ? However , music covers most lyrical blunders for me , and Budgie has enough hooks-and-grooves in much of their music to make me easily forget how bad their lyrics can be.But again , this compilation follows chronological order like a `` musical history book '' , showcasing `` the good , bad , and the ugly '' through Budgie 's career -- much like other compilations , such as `` The History Of Blue Cheer '' or `` Bachman-Turner Overdrive-Gold '' . But if you truly want the `` very '' very best of Budgie , this is the one to buy .	1
1974 's `` Turn Of The Cards '' was the fifth Renaissance album , and once again , it 's a masterpiece of classical/prog rock . Once more , the band 's music is magically lush , sweeping and magnificent , with Annie Haslam 's goddess-like voice leading the way . All six songs , `` Running Hard , '' `` I Think Of You , '' `` Things I Do n't Understand , '' `` Black Flame , '' `` Cold Is Being , '' and `` Mother Russia '' are outstanding , played and sung to perfection by Haslam , guitarist Michael Dunford , keyboardist John Tout , bassist Jon Camp , and drummer Terry Sullivan . I 'll say it again : Renaissance were -- -and are -- -a phenomenal band who deserved a much bigger worldwide audience then what they had . Their music is that good . `` Turn Of The Cards '' is another brilliant album from Renaissance .	1
If you have had any interest in the early Moody Blues album & quot ; Days of Futures Past & quot ; check this album out . Unbelievable vocals by Annie Haslam here . Very strong lush melodic tracks with a rich classical style . One of my all time favorites !	1
This 1974 release opens with the 9'34 '' Running Hard , which is ushered in with a classical flourish on the acoustic piano courtesy of excellent player John Tout . John Camps superb , trebly Rickenbacker bass provides some nice counterpoint and then the rest of the band gradually joins in , with the delicate soprano of Annie Haslam soaring above . The music of Renaissance is extremely disciplined and the instrumentation and playing style is more in keeping with a symphony orchestra than a rock band . Keyboardist John Tout uses the acoustic piano exclusively with some minor organ and harpsichord work , and does not use synthesizers at all on this recording ( if they are used , they are buried deep in the mix ) . Electric guitars are also absent , which further emphasizes the classical approach . Perhaps the only thing missing from this recording is the `` tap-tap-tap '' of an impatient conductor tapping his baton on the stand ! It is only John Camps bass work and to a much lesser extent , Terence Sullivans drumming that lend the rock aspect to the compositions . I might add that Terence Sullivan is a very sensitive drummer ( he is more of a symphony percussionist ) and engages in a dialogue with the acoustic piano rather than bulldozing over it . This is largely attributable to his emphasis on cymbal/high-hat/snare work rather than heavy beats on the bass drum/floor toms . The pieces on Turn of the Cards include three short pieces that range from 3'01 '' to 6'25 '' ( I think of You , Black Flame , Cold is Being ) and three longish pieces in the 9'00 - 9'30 '' range ( Running Hard , Things I do n't Understand , Mother Russia ) . There are some absolutely beautiful and haunting moments on this CD including Cold is Being , which is based on Albinoni 's excessively melodramatic Adagio for Organ and Strings in G minor . Although Albinoni is not credited on the piece , there is a `` thanks to '' Albinoni cited in the liner notes , in addition to a `` thanks to '' composer Jehain Alain ( 1911-1940 ) for the introduction to Running Hard . Alain was not credited on the composition either . In summation , this is a wonderful recording made during the period of peak creativity for this band ( 1973-1977 ) and is recommended to prog fans that also appreciate classical music . If you like this recording , also check out Ashes are Burning ( 1973 ) ; Scheherezade and other Stories ( 1975 ) ; and Novella ( 1977 ) .	1
It would be really hard to pick a best or favorite Renaissance CD as this one , Ashes Are Burning , Scheherazade , Prologue , and Novella are all so good . This one has `` I Think of You '' `` Black Flame '' `` Things I do n't Understand '' `` Mother Russia '' `` Running Hard '' and `` Cold is Being '' all on the same CD . This is how the original LP was released back in the 1970's- there 's no bonus tracks but it 's just perfect as it is .	1
`` Turn of the Cards '' is my favorite Renaissance album , although as I listen to them all in order I am struck by how it also perhaps the most atypical example of their progressive ( nee classical ) rock . Taken as a whole these songs are relatively unadorned . `` I Think of You '' is a relatively simple piece , ending with one of those wonderful high notes by Annie Haslam followed by some nice harpsicord work by John Tout . Likewise `` Black Flame '' begins with the simple elegance of an acoustic guitar ( a reminder that the forthcoming `` Unplugged '' Renaissance album is not really breaking new ground for the group ) .Of the two set pieces , `` Running Hard '' is most decidedly in this simpler vain , which has the overall effect of better showcasing Haslam 's glorious voice . The other showpiece , `` Mother Russia , '' shows that the group was paying attention to Russian dissidents ( the song is dedicated to Alexander Solzhenitsyn ) as much as they were Russian classical musicians and offers an emphasis on percussion quite usual for a Renaissance song in the driving conclusion . Again , Haslam 's voice soars over and above , as well as through , the rhythmic progression of the music as proves that she does not need to be singing actual words to contribute to the beauty of a song.Perhaps it is insightful to recall that in terms of Michael Dunsford 's music , `` Turn of the Cards '' is the album that proceeds his most ambitious project , the Scheherazade cantanta . Whatever the reason , this is the Renaissance album that best showcases the vocal talents of singer Annie Haslam .	1
My collection of Renaissance CDs for some reason has never included Turn of the Cards . It was a bad omission . Not instantly appealing , Turn of the Cards needs a few plays to show its true quality . Then it becomes quite rivetting , with Annie Haslam 's control over some very difficult melodies really amazing . The tracks are cleverly arranged with a big intro and a huge finale . Not quite my favorite Renaissance CD , but certainly a must have - even if I am 35 years late.I bought this from an Amazion recommended supplier who did a great job .	1
Probably the best album Renaissance ever released . It contains such classics as 'Black Flame ' , 'Mother Russia ' . 'Things I do n't understand ' , 'Running hard ' . These tracks are essential Renaissance . Good sound quality/packaging .	1
This is , without any doubt , the best album Renaissance ever did . Besides the classics & quot ; Running Hard , & quot ; & quot ; Mother Russia & quot ; , and & quot ; Black Flame , & quot ; the other three cuts are so perfect its amazing they did not receive the attention the other songs did . & quot ; Things I Do n't Understand & quot ; is the most underrated song this band ever did . & quot ; Cold is Being & quot ; -- ALRIGHT ! ! Let 's end it all right now !	1
And to call it that is quite a statement for a group that never let up and always went their own way ( albeit with help from some great classical composers ) .Once upon a time , I woke up in the morning to the sounds of WNEW radio in New York . At about 6 on a morning in 1975 , out of my ( large ) speakers came the sound of `` Black Flame '' . I 've been listening to and studying music since we lived in caves , but that song absolutely blew me away . I 'd never heard anything that so brilliantly blended classical and rock genres . And Annie Haslam 's vocals were completely impossible.That morning marked my introduction to Turn of the Cards . I promptly bought the album and sat in the dark one night just to listen . I was not disappointed . It took my breath away . From beginning to end , it remains one of the finest albums I 've ever heard . The complexity of the music , the darkness of the trilogy of `` Black Flame '' , `` Cold Is Being '' , and `` Mother Russia '' still echo nearly 40 years later . One of the other reviewers remarked at how well the album has aged when better known entries have n't fared as well . I agree . The artistry , energy , and intensity have lost none of their appeal , transcending the years without effort . Renaissance has occupied an honored place in my music collection ever since . And this is indeed the pinnacle of their musical achievement.An extraordinary addition to anyone 's collection . Or perhaps a CD to replace worn-out 40-year-old vinyl .	1
This is the penultimate album from this ever-changing group of British musicians . Probably the most successful ensemble responsible for what I would consider as the best of the groups recording output in their brief history . This particular albums ' ( it was originally produced on vinyl ) release was timed to be synced with their US Tour in 1974 . Synonymous with the confusing musical direction of the times , their tour was the platform by which the launch of two notable seventies groups occurred ; Kiss and 10cc . If there was ever a more divergent touring group , this was probably it . Interwoven strains of classically influenced music , tempered by harmonies and balance arranged by a carefully orchestrated rock ensemble which included traditional piano and contemporary synthesizer among others . All of this classical influence punctuated by lyrics that represent the very essence of the self-discovery of the times all done with a trace of nostalgic longing . This can be best heard in such tunes as `` Running Hard , '' I Think of You , '' `` Black Flame , '' and `` Mother Russia . '' A delicate and intricate overlaying of vocal harmonies is also noteworthy in a number of compositions such as `` Running Hard , '' and `` Black Flame . '' I would consider this the one `` must-have '' recording to obtain out of their complete discography . Although , highly touted as another milestone recording from the group the album ; `` Sheherazade , '' was a dismal disappointment to me . If you only want to get one Renaissance recording to sample the best of their work , `` Turn of The Cards , '' would be the obvious choice .	1
this thing was a SCORCHER WHEN IT arrived AND IT was a KEEPER , BIG TIME , EVEN YOU WOULD SAY THIS IS surely a STINKER , many times I would go back to retrieve it from the garbage , ITS a love or hate KINDA an affair with IRON BUTTERFLY , ITS NOT REALLY , its a sham or IS it a , DAMAGED GOODS , [ big time ] ; ITS ERIC BRANNS l ; solo album he never could make with RON BUSHY guesTing BEHIND drums , WITH TWO ANNOMONOUS guys , ONE TO BE FIRED , matter of fact QUITE QUICK AFTERR THE FACT , after the creation , i assume in the studio , cause they never got the equation sucess to play it alive , cause its like some FOULING OFFspring WITHOUT INGLE THERE IS NO AUTHENTICITY , JUST SOME KINDA ONSLAUGHT OF branns MANERISMS , OFTEN BRILLIANCE maskinking in the misalligned plain dumb wierdly , unigue that makes this SURELY , its deserves some kinds FOOTNOTE WORTH in the rock n roll lexicon , BESIDES ITS ROCK N ROLL , AND THIS ONE packs a punch , JOURNEY EIGHTIES GUYS kinda hairy would rob from and lift .	1
No matter how you review this Cd you have to say that Eric was and will always be a pioneer of guitar . Maybe some of the songs here are different than what Butterfly fans are used to but one thing is for sure , its Eric back at the axe . Man give this guy credit , he came into music when people were n't even taking the chances that he took on guitar . He set a alot of standards for players coming up and it is such a shame that he is already gone from us . Wherever your at Eric I know you are playing your a -- off , God Bless you for your contributions to Rock N Roll .	1
THIS BAND IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF DELICATE SOUND OF PROG ROCK . INTEMPORAL MELODIES , SWEET ORCHESTRATION AND FINE WORKS OF THE MUSICIANS . ONLY GOURMETS , PLEASE .	1
I agree with the previous reviewer - this is a great compilation of Renaissance throughout their history from 1969-1983 . Wonderful songs and production . If you 've never heard of the group this would be a great place to start . It contains some of their best material . Annie 's voice is worth the price alone . ( Note : The REP label is in Germany , however I believe they also sell a US version of Da Capo which may save you some bucks . ) I never paid much attention to this group in the 70 's , but I 'm certainly a big fan now !	1
Blending elements of sly English music-hall badinage , Noel Coward wit and wordplay , warm jazz , and disco rhythms into a genre entirely and irresistibly his own , veteran 1970s pub-rocker Ian Dury was the most endearing musician to ever charm his way straight through your funny bone - and into your heart . Whether singing of the public embarrassment resulting from his youthful theft of a men 's stroke magazine from a newsagent ( & quot ; Razzle in My Pocket [ A True Story ] & quot ; ) , the demands of a morning hard-on ( & quot ; Wake Up and Make Love With Me & quot ; ) , and the comic possibilities lurking just beneath the surface of history 's creative geniuses ( & quot ; There Ai n't Half Been Some Clever Bastards & quot ; ) , or rapping his way through the infectious dance beats of & quot ; Reasons to Be Cheerful , Pt . 3 , & quot ; Dury had an unerring sense that not only could being naughty be great good fun , as well as an opportunity for verbal ingenuity - it could also get you on your feet and moving when enlisted with just the right dash of insouciant style . Favorite lyrics ( from & quot ; Reasons to Be Cheerful , Pt . 3 & quot ; ) : & quot ; ` Einshtein ' ca n't be classed as witless/He said atoms are the littlest/When you do the bit o ' split'liss/You frighten everybody shitless ... There ai n't half been some clever bastards ( Chorus : & quot ; Lucky Peters , Lucky Peters & quot ; ) /There ai n't half been some clever bas-tards ... ` Van Goff ' did some eyeball pleazahs/He musta bean a pencil squeezah/He did n't do the Mona Leezhah/That was an Italian geezah ! ... There ai n't half been some clever bastards ... & quot ; I envy the uninitiated - you 're about to wonder where Ian and his Blockheads have been all your life , while discovering your own latest & quot ; Reason to Be Cheerful ( Pt . 3 ) . & quot ; & quot ; Clever bastards , & quot ; indeed !	1
Opinions seem pretty wide-ranging on this album , so here 's my viewpoint : I was a kid when the 80s synthpop style was in its heyday , but I drifted into more `` serious '' music as I got older , including becoming a big prog-rock fan in the 2000s ( I have the complete studio works of Tull , Yes , Van der Graaf , Strawbs , etc . ) , which is more my taste now , but I still have a soft spot for the better 80s pop bands ( e.g . Men W/out Hats , Duran Duran ) . I 'm just starting to get into the group Renaissance and , after picking up 3 of their classic 70s albums , decided to give this album a try for a bit of variety.Now , I 'm knowlegeable enough about the genre to know that virtually every 70s prog band started to simplify and streamline their sound at the end of the 70s and rarely had more than the slightest hint of prog by the 80s ( the one exception I know of is King Crimson , who had a very different , but still quite avant-garde , sound in the 80s ) . Some bands ( e.g . Tull ) were still recognizably the same band as in the 70s , others ( e.g . Genesis ) were unrecognizeable . This said , I listened to some samples of `` Camera , Camera '' and kind of liked them , so I decided to give the CD a shot . I 'm happy I did ! I can understand why some fans of the 70s era would be turned off - Renaissance 's classic sound is a mix of 60s folk , classical , rock , and a bit of jazz in a rock setting , and most of that sound is gone here . This album is no longer acoustic-oriented - there 's plenty of synths and some electric guitar - but , it 's still pretty musical . There 's some nice musicianship and instrumental bits ; this album reminds me more of late 70s Genesis and mid 80s Marillion as far as `` proggishness '' , which is a lot better than most 80s albums by ( former ) prog bands ! It also reminds me a bit of the 80s albums by 70s folk-rockers Steeleye Span ( probably due to the mix of 80s pop influences with older styles and female vocals ) . It 's still pretty artistic/musical - it 's not just beat-based pop music ; `` Okichi-san '' has a Japanese lyrical and musical theme ( oddly enough , with a touch of blues ) which is nice and rather interesting . And , as far as `` shorter songs '' - four of the songs are in the 6 min.+ range , and the songs in general still have more musical substance than ( say ) your longer 80s Genesis songs . And , more 's the point , the music is quite good ( and pretty energetic ) - maybe not as brilliant as the best prog , but better than most 80s pop or the more mediocre 70s prog for that matter ! As well as nice keyboard playing and overall musicianship , Annie Haslam 's vocals are excellent , and she adds substance to the songs.Overall - NOT 70s Renaissance , but a good selection of well-performed , well-written songs falling somewhere in between prog and pop . I kind of like hearing 80s synth sounds played in prog-influenced style , and enjoy this album along with early Marillion , Jethro Tull 's `` A '' , Yes 's `` Drama '' , etc . as a nice combination of 70s and 80s styles .	1
I have always been a big Who fan.Too late the hero has always been a favorite of mine among John 's cannon of music . The album has it 's fair share of classic John Entwistle humourous lyrics and topics.I consider it one of John 's best solo ventures.I am also a big fan of Mr Joe Walsh and Joe 's playing is all over the album . It would have been great to have seen them collaborate even further.John 's awesome bass work is well displayed throughout especially on `` Dancing Master '' .Favorite tracks are `` Try me '' which starts off the album in stellar fashion , `` Sleeping Man '' , `` Fallen Angel '' , and the epic `` Too late the hero '' title track . This song should have been a hit back in the day.Probably Entwistle 's best chance at a commercial solo hit.The album has it 's small spots of cliched rock tendancies , but you can tell the guys were having a great time making this album . It 's still played in the car and house after all these years with enthusiasm.If your a Who nut or ardent admirer , I would highly recommend this album.Rest in peace John .	1
OK his albums are not as good as Townshend 's ... but at least they are better than Daltre'y or Moon 's ... This record was done very much in a hard-rock vein and is not bad at all even if it lacks the punch of the Who .	1
( 4.5 stars ) I was really surprised at how much I ended up liking this album , since Roger 's solo career seems to be rather hit and miss . I thought I had already heard his two greatest albums , 'McVicar ' and 'Under a Raging Moon , ' really loved his 1987 album 'Ca n't Wait to See the Movie , ' and have heard positive things about the 1992 album 'Rocks in the Head , ' but did n't think there were any other of his solo albums that were really all that great . It just goes to show that one should n't take too much stock by what other people have said if one has n't directly experienced that thing yet . Everyone 's mileage varies , after all . I had never gotten the impression that this was considered one of his better solo albums , but I 've been really impressed with just how strong and Who-like it is . Among my favorite songs are `` Say It Ai n't So , Joe , '' `` The Prisoner , '' `` Doing It All Again , '' `` Avenging Annie , '' and the title track.I think that part of the problem with his less-than-great solo albums has been the type of people he chose to work with . Here he 's working with writers and musicians who are stronger than usual , and since Roger is almost entirely a singer and not a songwriter or musician , he 's really only as good as the people he works with . They can make or break him , and they really made him in this album . This album , made in 1977 , also marked the first time since `` Here for More '' in 1970 that he tried his hand at writing songs again . He co-wrote three of them , `` The Prisoner , '' `` Satin and Lace , '' and `` Doing It All Again . '' Another issue with his lesser solo albums , I think , is that he can sound sort of conflicted and out of character , like trying to make an independent musical voice for himself yet at the same time stay with his safety blanket of Who-like songs . There 's no real hint of such musical schizophrenia on this album , and there are even quite a few Who-like songs . The variety of musical styles also helps , and it just does n't seem really dated like some of his other albums , like his self-titled debut or 'Ride a Rock Horse . ' It still has a fresh modern sound to it.When one listens to an album like 'Ride a Rock Horse ' or ( so I 've heard ) 'Parting Should Be Painless , ' one can wonder just why Roger wanted a solo career in the first place . He just does n't fit the profile of a bandmember who wants or needs a solo career , since he did n't have a unique musical message and was n't having his contributions routinely ignored by the more prominent bandmembers . But when one listens to a nice album like this , it becomes obvious that under the right circumstances , Roger could be quite effective as a solo artist .	1
People ... . I am back after a long hiatus with sordid tales to tell . Seems your Metamorpho received a special invitation to speak at a Metaphysical conference in Chicago . I decided that my talk would be about Procol Harum 's Home album . However , at the airport an interviewer misconstrued my statements and they came across as controversial political barbs . As if this was n't upsetting enough , when I got to Chicago and checked into my hotel I could see hoards of people gathering outside the lobby . From my room on the 12th floor ( there is no 13th floor ) I could look from my window and see swarms of people with picket signs that read `` Seer Go Home ! `` , `` Boycott Metamorpho '' `` Down with Reflection '' and , well , you get the picture . I called on my guides for help , but to no avail . Marshy , my female guide , was the only one around and I caught her at a bad time . Her bags were packed and she was leaving for a vacation in the Bahamas . So again , your Metamorpho was left to fend for himself.I decided to cancel the talk and leave the hotel through the kitchen exit . Since I had notes on this excellent album already , I might as well relate it to my faithful audience.To my mind , Procol Harum is a band that resides in the upper echelon of popular music from the late 60 's through the 70 's . They always had a symphonic classical air that permeated through their music although they were equally capable of gentle folk embellishments as well of rock . Incredibly unique and amazingly talented , each album offered more and more incredible lyrics married to scenic moods of composition . We owe this mainly to Gary Brooker ( the primary vocalist , piano player , composer ) and Keith Reid ( lyricist extraordinaire ) . Secure within their own genre , they are just as formidable as any other famous pop-rock team from this era.With `` Home '' they courageously take on the topics of death and depression . Ironically , these topics , as unpleasant as they are , are still necessary because , after all , they are a part of life.Keith Reids lyrics are haunting and sometimes nightmarish and although he touched on these themes in previous albums ( `` Something Following Me '' from the first album ; `` In Held 'T was I '' from Shine On Brightly ) he decides to totally devote a whole album to distressing themes.We begin with `` Whiskey Train '' a Trower composition and despite his jaunty guitar pyro-techics , Keith 's topic is about a confirmed alcoholic swearing he 'll give up the addiction . We move on to `` The Dead Man 's Dream '' which relates a somber dream before the man 's demise . The one thing it does remind one of is Scrooge meeting the Ghost of Christmas Future in `` A Christmas Carol '' . Brooker 's slow , dissonant piano chords perfectly match the mood . Keith 's lyrics on this ( and many other songs ) has the ability to convey so much by juxtaposing words and images in opposites ( i'e , `` The houses were open , and the streets empty '' , `` I cried out in fear , but my voice had left me ) . You know what he means even if it is illogical . `` Still There 'll Be More '' is about the devil taking his due . He is n't content being an annoyance , he must torture you as well . Besides , only something dire can `` blacken your Christmas '' . `` Nothing That I did n't Know '' is about the death of a young lady , Jenny Droe . The singer morns and wishes that he was in her place in order to be set free . `` About to Die '' reminds me of someone on top of a tall building ready to jump with the cheer of the crowd below . Keith 's words are puzzling here , but he throws in biblical references such as Kingdome Come , being resurrected from death and the savior 's son . An all around interesting tune.On `` Barnyard Story '' Brooker again matches Keith 's lyrics with slow , moaning piano . Keith again relates human preparation for death and recalls former glorys with mythology . A depressing view of the mortal condition . `` Piggy Pig Pig '' has more sprightly music to recommend it , but the cry to clense one 's self is not enough , least we forget that `` God 's aloft , the winds are cold '' . To Keith Reid , salvation is a treacherous road . `` Whaling Stories '' , I believe , is the classic track on the album.It is about the apocalypse , the destruction of the world and the calm aftermath . Also it is about judgement day and the fate of all . Brooker 's tonal changes in this piece make it particularly effective . And I like Keith 's lyric `` God 's alive inside a movie ! Watch the silver screen ! '' . Which leads one to ask if movies reflect reality or vice-versa ? In any event , these songs will not let you rest and ignore it 's themes . They make you recognize your own limitations in this life.Finally the wrap up `` Your Own Choice '' is a fitting conclusion or `` end '' to the album . In this song Keith conveys that there is so much potential with so little result . He loses faith in the human race and lets them die in his mind . In this way he can have his own resurrection and rest in peace.In closing , Metamorpho believes that this album was home grown to fit into considerable reflection . Please , if you have a rowdy party it will certainly be out of place . It is an album to be listened to with courage and fortitude . But in it , I guarantee you will be awed by it 's tonal moods and expert musicianship . Also lyrics that are way beyond the norm.Metamorpho thanks you for reading and wishes you many good dreams and very few nightmares within your lives . Now - if only this controversy will subside . I asked the newspapers for a retraction and all they did was laugh . I suppose selling newspapers takes precedence over my considerable reflections . Ah so - such is life . Be well people . Do n't believe all that you read . Your own- Metamorpho ( Morphy )	1
Trower gives us a hint in the opener & quot ; Whiskey Train & quot ; of what he was later to offer us as a soloist . I think leader Gary Brooker 's vocals in this number influenced Trower as to what sort of voice he wanted singing his material -- that husky blues voice also made famous by David Clayton Thomas and the late Terry Kath . As a result , the next voice we were to hear a Trower number in was that of James Dewar . Also notable here is & quot ; Whaling Stories & quot ; , a lengthy ( for its day ) prequel to the classic & quot ; Salty Dog & quot ; -- plus , the sardonic , driving Elton John-ish & quot ; Still There 'll Be More & quot ; . I think & quot ; Whiskey Train & quot ; is one reason this album is rather undrrated and -- at the moment -- unavailable in a US issue . It just does n't sound like a Procol Harum song . What it sounds like is a prelude to the the brilliant Hendrix-esque/ Claptonesque blues-metal career Trower was to have .	1
Home is Procol 's fourth album ; it found them at something of a crossroads , having seen the resignations of Matthew Fisher and David Knights ( bass player ) following A Salty Dog , widely acknowledged as PH 's masterpiece . They took a page from the Doors ' book , hiring Chris Copping to double on keyboards and bass ( a la Ray Manzarek , who often added keyboard bass on stage and , on the first 2 LPs at least , in the studio - they did use actual bassists from Waiting for the Sun onward in the studio , such as Doug Lubahn ) ; whenever a song could do without guitar , Robin Trower took up the bass and Copping focused on the keys . The quarter formula seems to have worked out well for them.That being said , the material is strong , although a bit different from the prior 3 LPs and thus requiring some getting used to . `` Whiskey Train '' is an absolutely storming opener , and has long been one of my favourite Procol tracks ; Trower positively smokes on guitar ( I believe it was around this time that he switched from a Les Paul to a Stratocaster , inspired by Martin Barre of Jethro Tull , with whom Procol had recently toured ) , and the late and much-missed B.J . Wilson drives the proceedings with the most engaging bit of cowbell-tapping I 've ever heard on record . `` The Dead Man 's Dream '' comes across like a scene from `` Night of the Living Dead '' -- rather disturbing -- and `` Still There 'll Be More '' is a rather detailed revenge song , although it has a great beat and you can dance to it ( and will put a smile on your face if the lyrics relate at all to any recent situations in your life ! ) . `` Whaling Stories '' could almost be a leftover from A Salty Dog . Most of the rest may need repeated listening to stick with you , but it 's worth the effort if you like Procol - I do , obviously.As always , start at the beginning and work your way forward to this one . I have to say , I like the cover art ; you can see the humourous take on the board game Chutes & Ladders in the art , and this may be the first Procol album where Keith Reid ( lyricist ) was actually photographed with the rest of the band !	1
This performance of 'Spoonful ' is the '9th Symphony'* of Rock , combined with 'The Rite Of Spring ' . Jack Bruce is the human race individualised . He is the first and last man on earth . He is Job , Prometheus , Mani and Zarathustra . His song is a great Humanist Assertion or a great song of Gnostic defiance or both . You say it 's just a blues with two chords ? No , it 's the blues transcended . It 's the apotheosis of the blues - and it could only be achieved with Bruce 's heroic jouissance as a singer , and simultaneously playing bass which is partly where the incredible tension comes from : i.e doing both : Robert Johnson achieved a similar contrapuntal tension singing and playing the guitar at the same time but only connoiseurs seem to be able to hear it.No one else could have achieved this , and the performance of course also depends and benefits from the tensions contributed by the other two as well . These tensions , need I say , are mainly rhythmic and contrapuntal ( rhythmic contradictions and ambiguities are also what this neo-contrapuntalism is all about ) . And that 's all there even before you get to the improvisation which is sustained three part contrapuntal concentration but with plenty of light and shade and variation of dynamics . The most powerful example in music of the neo-contrapuntal style apart from this is Stravinsky 's 'Rite Of Spring ' . There are n't really any other examples worth mentioning of it being the sustained principle of the work , or the piece , outside of a handfull of other live Cream performances . Otherwise there are only a few examples , usually much shorter and less rigorous , of live rock music by such groups as Led Zeppelin.Cream did occasionally play straight blues but in their best work they achieved a Beethovenian affirmation of life in the face of everything that ALL human beings are confronted with . In these performances the blues has come a long way from social marginalisation and right to the existential centre . In other words there is no longer any sense of this being the music of the powerless underdog or self-conscious social deviant.Many other people have said a lot about Crossroads and given it very high praise which is fine by me except inasmuch as they neglect Spoonful ( and 'I 'm So Glad ' , 'Politician ' , and 'Sitting On Top Of The World ' in the live versions found on 'Goodbye Cream ' ) .The studio disc here is disappointing , as ever with Cream , but at least this time the stereo sound stage is normal and the sound and placing of the drums is convincing . The problem is with the overdubbing of guitars and the usual studio frigidity of the whole thing . Another problem is the thin , brittle sound of Clapton 's guitars . The remastered versions on the 4disc set 'Those Were The Days ' are better in this respect with a warmer guitar sound . *Beethoven 's obviously .	1
While most blues/Clapton enthusiasts are sure to give this double CD a 5-star rating , I refrain from doing so only because Cream is n't amongst my absolute favourite bands . Sure , I recognise this album 's musical worth , as ground-breaking and influential as it was for its time , and I enjoy the material contained within , but as for being a classic , it just does n't make the grade for me.Cream were renowned for their punchy blues-rock anthems , and this their third offering contains the excellent 'White Room ' , their interpretation of 'Born Under A Bad Sign ' as well as their signature blues tune 'Politician ' . The first CD , where the aforementioned tracks appear , was recorded in the studio , while the second CD contains lengthy blues jams recorded live at the Fillmore East . Depending on your preference , either one or both CDs may tickle your fancy . Many musicians revere the Live recording , as it gives full scope to each of the threesome 's awesome musical prowess , as they ! stretch improvisations to the outer limits . This may prove too long and 'boring ' for some , who may indeed prefer the shorter , more accessible tunes found on the first CD . As a whole , the album showcases the powertrio at the height of their powers . For those wishing to obtain a more concise overview of Cream 's music , any one of their & quot ; Best of & quot ; ... collections is recommended . Those in a more adventurous mood will love & quot ; Wheels Of Fire & quot ; .	1
I love Cream . I saw them at the Filmore East . This CD brought back some awesome memories of a great band .	1
Cream 's third album proved to be equally as good as their 1967 smash hit Disraeli Gears . Released in August of 1968 `` Wheels Of Fire '' was in some ways was Cream final finest hour . After this album the band basically went their seperate ways and issued out the disappointing `` Goodbye '' as a swan song album.None the less Wheels Of Fire is considered by many as Cream 's final album and maybe their finest . Like the previous Cream albums it contains several smash hits including WHITE ROOM , THOSE WERE THE DAYS and POLITICIAN three of my favourite Cream tracks ever . As well as the blues rock brilliance of SITTING ON TOP OF THE WORLD and BORN UNDER A BAD SIGN . Apart from the hits the other tracks are awesome on their own , AS YOU SAID and DESERTED CITIES OF THE HEART are both essential Cream tracks . PASSING THE TIME is a beautiful song and PRESSED RAT AND WARTHOG is a fun novelty tune.The band was also kind enough to add an extra disc to make this a awesome double record . As disc 2 is live at the Fillmore featuring some great live tracks . CROSSROADS is essential and the 16 minute version of SPOONFUL is amazing . As for the other two tracks TRAINTIME is okay and TOAD is way too long however it proves that Baker is a brilliant drummer.In conclusion Wheels Of Fire is essential Cream . The studio album is great on it 's own but the live teacks are a bitof a bonus . The album is one of their best and I 'm sure you will agree ! Highly recommended !	1
Yes . I am still at this farm in Michigan . Why ? Becaue I have promised myself to stay here for peace and quiet while I review the Cream albums . But , tragedy struck again . Seems Bossy ( the cow ) somehow ate up all of Metamorpho 's food supply and I had to walk 30 miles to the nearest food store . ( Magic Seer 's carpet was in for repair ) , So I set out and realized that I had left my fur-lined Seer 's cape at home when a snow storm surprised me on the way . Luckily , a man in an old Dodge pick-up truck picked me up and gave me a ride . Amazingly , he recognized me and , for the price of an autographed picture , gave me a return trip ! What luck ! But , I suppose for being spiritual ( and a friend of the Universe ) , one is entitled to such perks . Nevermind all that . Cream 's EXCELLENT `` Wheels of Fire '' awaits us all.I must elucidate on these reviews . They are done , not only because the band is so reknown , but to explain why they are so . Positively , in the psychedelic sense , they progressed and moved the music into more formidable areas . What is so amazing is that they made this double c.d . set to show you what they are capable of in the studio- and live ! And this shows you the real talent behind this band . Not only could they construct inticate landscapes and unknown terrain in the studio-but also be mega as far as live recording . This was confidence of the highest order . And it shines through miraculously.What do we have here exactly ? We have Cream adhering to their `` traditional '' blues roots . On the first part they tackle Howlin ' Wolf 's excellent `` Sitting On Top of the World '' as well as `` Politician '' which is the best Howlin ' Wolf song not written by Howlin ' Wolf ( accolades to Jack Bruce on this one ) . `` Born Under a Bad Sign '' also reflects the blues-but in a more controlled and upbeat fashion . Definitely superb ! The second part-needless to say , extends blues in live fashion and never lets up . The jams , the leads , are to die for ( I hate to be banal but even Metamorpho has laspes sometime ) .I can not say enough about Jack Bruce on the first part . Superb songwriting and construction . He extends himself to bleak areas . `` White Room '' , although pristine , gets soiled by disappointment . The lively riff is juxtaposed against feelings ; and especially lines like `` where the shadows run from themselves '' are as vivid and unique and understood as being exemplary . `` As You Said '' employs his wonderful acoustic guitar ( with cellos ! ) and interesting construction insofar as chords and keys . What are they Jack ? Sharps and flats I am sure , but maybe 5ths , 9ths , and sustained ? This is his songwriting . Other-worldy and quite a marvel . `` Deserted Cities of the Heart '' has a little of this added as well . Ginger Baker adds his unusual `` Pressed Rat and Warthog '' ( a talky piece with horns even alternately between two chords ! ) . But , recovers and proves himself with `` Those Were the Days '' . The best Jack Bruce tune not written by Jack Bruce.On part two we have his blues jam `` Traintime '' . Can almost imagine the train click-clacking along with this harmonica inspired number . We also have Ginger Baker 's wonderous drum solo again in `` Toad '' . Much better than the original studio recording , if you ask Metamorpho . `` Spoonful '' is much more precise and measured . A true joy . But , then we get to the `` core '' of exhileration . `` Crossroads '' , in itself , is worth the purchase of this classic c.d . Clapton 's lead transcends human boundaries ( and , when listened to loud , will bounce you off the walls ! Just as it has done to your beloved Seer since he listened to it many Seer moons ago ! ) . This , I feel , was the peak of Clapton 's power . Yes . He certainly has done many other excellent things ( `` Wonderful Tonight '' just does n't even compare to this ) . But , as raw live power- nothing rivals this , except Jimi at his finest . Take my word.In short ( ! ) a classic double album by one of the very best . And do remember that the cover ( which your Metamorpho has tried to embed himself in and has gotten bounced out each and every time ) reflected like sheer aluminum . How sad the times have compromised true value . But , you always have imagination . So says Metamorpho.Like to thank T and Johnny L for their support . After all , they are better than absent guides in the long run.So . That 's it . One more review and I 'm out of this Michigan farm . For Cream reviews , farm living is the place to stay- but I get allergic smelling hay . Ah . So it goes.To all who support Metamorpho-your check is in the mail.To those who don't-a check to the homeless shelter.Have fun ! Bossy packs a mean hoove lead ! -- -- -- -- -- Metamorpho	1
a must have for the Clapton collector.. this is Cream 's best , hard core 60-70s rock..	1
I remember when this one came out . A two record set . Wow ! Unheard of at the time . The funny thing is it would almost fit on one CD today.I 'm not a fan of the live stuff here . Drum solos are n't my thing , and 20 minutes of `` Spoonful '' is about 14 minutes too long . The studio cuts are top notch and remain ahead of their time . `` Passing The Time '' sounds like it could have been recorded in the 1700 's . `` White Room '' remains an all time classic , but what does it really mean ? All in all , an ambitious album filled with great songs .	1
cream is touring again , and doing many of these tunes , as in example at albert hall , , , , , , , in fact they are playing them better than the original riffs , and almost to a noteclapton has progressed so far since 66 , but many of his roots , and of such as muddy waters and willie dixon are shown in his jamming , , , jack bruce plays harp very well , , , , it will be interesting where they go after the current touring , in final notes , too bad felix pappalardi is not around to share in the fun times	1
This is a historic recording at a time when Clapton was smokin ' on that Stratocaster , this is a joy to listen to and if you are a drummer then & # 34 ; Toad & # 34 ; is worth the price alone . If you like power trio 's , you will want to hear Wheels of Fire many times over and over .	1
This is a seminal album in rock 'n ' roll , and while it is perhaps less original than either Disraeli Gears or Wheels of Fire , it is absolutely stunning in terms of sound and musicianship . For those who do not think Clapton is god , or even a particularly interesting musicians ( and less so with each album ) , the Cream albums stand as a display of once-in-a-lifetime inspiration , and this one is possibly the most striking : the guitar lines are melodious and beautiful , mixing a quiet blues dignity of `` Sleepy Time Time '' with the virtuosity of the `` Rollin ' and Tumblin ' '' rave-up , and the highly idiosyncratic transformation of `` I 'm So Glad '' into psychedelic rock . Where did Eric get that fat , smooth sound ? According to an interview I 've read , he was too stoned at the time to remember , but he believes he just turned all his gear to 11 and let the chips fall where they may . That still leaves the question of mastering so much amp power so elegantly unanswered . Jack Bruce was the first bassist I saw who played a six-string bass , and it was n't just for show : he used those two extra strings like no one else . Ginger Baker was also a first for me , insofar as he made me realize that drummers could be front-liners , not just non-star hired hands somewhere in the background ; drummers this extraordinary were superstars in their own right - there just were n't that many of them ... One caveat as concerns the mix : this is the strangest mixing I 've ever heard , bar none . As long as you listen to the CD through your speakers , you 'll get the most out of it . But put your headphones on , and surprise ! Suddenly you 're immersed in a completely different universe , where no mixing really took place at all . That fabulous bass is barely audible , that fabulous double-kit sounds like a kid 's first cymbal . The vocals are way up front , as if the lads were the finest voices ever and needed to be miked super close for posterity , at the expense of all the instruments . The instruments dance , now left , now a little bit right , and the guitar is so blatantly switched forward for solos , then recessed into overall mush , that you 're left with the feeling that the final tape was made of disparate takes , recorded at different volume levels . Clearly , the mastering was done through speakers only ; no one bothered to put the headphones on for a second and hear what that was like . Very strange . It 's absolutely no better on the remaster than on the original .	1
Cream was a blues band first , and a pretty durned good one at that . I Feel Free and N.S.U do n't really demonstrate the band 's blues side , but they are rightful psychadelic Cream classics . The blues kicks in with Sleepy Time Time , a pretty good original that pales in comparison to some blues covers ( more on those later ) . Dreaming never ceases to annoy me , so I skip it all the time . But Sweet Wine is n't only Ginger Baker 's finest Cream composition by a mile , but also one of Cream 's better tracks.Spoonful ... All I can say about this one is , `` Whoa . '' A six-and-a-half minute voodoo blues -- Jack Bruce sounds positively creepy , even laughing evily at one point -- with some great harpwork and firey guitar playing in the midsection . If this is n't Cream 's best tune , I do n't know what is . Rollin ' And Tumblin ' has excellent harp playing but annoying singing , Cat 's Squirrel is dull , and Four Till Late is forgettable . These are the other three bad tracks.I 'm So Glad is totally mindless , but benefits from Ginger Baker 's madman drumming . Closing the album out would be Toad , a favorite of mine . It 's pretty much a drum showcase , with Baker pounding on his drums like he 's a caveman or something.Necassary for all Cream fans , or blues fans in general .	1
In about 1968 I read an article in Time about Cream and got together with a friend and took the train to NYC and went to Hunter College to see the group live on their first USA tour . They were great . I ran out and bought Disraeli Gears ( spelling ? ) , the recent release . We later went and bought Fresh Cream which had been out but nowhere near as big a hit . Sunshine of Your Love was on FM and there was no going back to I feel Free from album number 1 . Anyway , this album is great . I Feel Free is a great tune , jazzy and all . More bluesy than the psychodelic second album . Great sound on the remaster . Nice booklet . What 's not to like ?	1
This is a finest recording . The Yardbirds gave up a Great guitar player to something that may be the Finest events in Rock . This portion is very full . How Fine It 's Quality .	1
Cream was one of the first bands I saw live when they were playing on the Murray the K show ( two songs , five times a day ) with The Who , The Blues Project , Mitch Ryder , Wilson Pickett , and special guest stars The Blues Magoos . I do n't have to tell you which two bands shook the roof , but Cream was one of them . The band came out and played NSU and I 'm So Glad with Eric taking his solos with his back to the audience.The recording is not clean -- does n't matter that there 's a claim of remastering -- but that 's what made it work . Sure there is some primitive overdubbing , but even with that , it captures pretty well the excitement of the power trio -- something that was new in '67 . Cream was a perfect equalaterial triangle : each member weighed in equally as they competed for attention . What a band , and this is probably their best studio recording . If you have n't lisened to it in 40 years , give it a try . I bet you 'll have to admit that it 's damn good .	1
If you want the biggest `` pop '' hits of Cream , do n't buy this album . However , for me , I 've heard `` Strange Brew '' and `` White Room '' too many times on classic rock stations , and frankly , those tunes are a bit dated in terms of sounding like '60s psychedelia . BUT- where Cream rises to the top in my mind are their blues covers , which dominate this album more than on the others . This is how I , a white suburban kid , learned about Robert Johnson ( Four Until Late ) and Muddy Waters ( Rolling and Tumbling ) ( took me until recently to realize the brilliance of Skip James- `` I 'm So Glad '' ) . These covers retain their vitality and sounds as good as they ever did . And the pop tunes on the album are good too- `` I Feel Free '' is great .	1
Well , I still have n't found this person named Jack ( if that 's who it really is ) who is lecturing under my name in the South . I have heard no mountainside rumblings , no manic mummerings , no foistered fanfare . So , I can only assume all is well and that it is safe again in Metamorpho Land.Now if only someone could tame that dragon in the west quarter of my castle , then I would be a most happy Seer . But , hey , can we ever have everything go perfectly right in our lives ? You answer no ? How negative . Let 's move on.Ahhh ... . here comes Fresh Cream to relax your inner inhabitions . Yes - the beginning of the power trio . And what a fine beginning it is ! Eric Clapton ( you know him ? ) , Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker . Three extraordinary musicians . And this album only portends greater things yet to come.Alot of this album is a hybrid of traditional American blues interpreted by quality British musicians . It is amazing , when you look back , that so many English artists of this era were so taken with the blues . But we are so much better for them putting their own spin , their own staple on this genre.Jack Bruce , in the compostional sense , took the edge off a little with his original songs . But they somehow always had a sort of `` bluesy '' aura about them and some mystical rock thrown in . Listen to `` I Feel Free '' and you 'll know what I mean . In fact , throughout this amazing debut , they expound that freedom and stretch the lines further than many conceived of at that time . Clapton ( who was shy , I suppose , initially ) did not contribute any songs and only arranged a Robert Johnson tune ( Four Until Late ) . This left Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker to fill in the writing chores while relying on standards by the likes of Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon . Quite a combination I would say.The album moves from an uplifting vibration , to slower blues , to sweet harmonic grooves , to harmonica rough realizion . Such a mix . Listen to Jack Bruce 's dreamy `` Dreaming '' and then the bluesy harmonica rave of `` Rollin ' and Tumblin ' '' and you get a firm idea of the diversity of this band . Clapton 's leads are succint but essential . He grows from this point to masterful leads in later albums . Jack Bruce also uses the bass as an essential ingredient in the music . Matches Clapton note for note . And the undeniable talent of Ginger Baker can not be questioned . Just listen to `` Toad '' . Remarkable.To conclude - this is a very respectable first album by giants of the trade . Surely to hear it , you too will be singing `` I 'm So Glad '' as well.I have really given it a 4 and a half rating . I am not exactly thrilled over the clarity - but it is a minor complaint when compared to the accomplishment.Now I must go . You know that you 're all invited over to have some coffee with Metamorpho . Just do n't forget to bring some cream ... ..From where the cows graze -- -- -- -- - Metamorpho	1
When you set out to be `` the best '' , as Cream did , you 'd better be sure you deliver . And , after a very odd start with their first single `` Wrapping Paper '' - that left those who had n't seen them live wondering what all the fuss was about - deliver they did with an album that remains one of the most inventive and powerful debuts of all time . Still exciting forty years on ( and helped by the inclusion of `` I Feel Free '' which inexplicably was only released as a single in the UK despite being recorded in the same sessions ) its combination of driving blues and Eric Clapton 's incredible `` barrier bending '' guitar playing - evidenced to perfection in their stunning interpretation of Skip James ' `` I 'm So Glad '' - took the British R & B ; scene by storm and set a precedent that raised expectations of what was to come beyond all reasonable levels.There was indeed more to come , but while much of `` Disraeli Gears '' and parts of `` Wheels of Fire '' were as good , if not better , `` Fresh Cream '' is infused with the sheer enthusiasm of a group getting it right for the first time . And , like all similarly brilliant debut albums , that 's what shines through and makes it timeless .	1
This is n't just one of Cream 's best albums- this and Wheels of Fire are their best studio albums- this is one of the best albums of all time . One of Clapton 's best bands , there is an unbelievably diverse array of types of music and way those types can be played . This is music at its best .	1
I 'm addressing myself to some imaginary non-boomer who is not so familiar with Cream . This is the album that introduced Eric Clapton to the US public . The Beano Album ( Blues Breakers with John Mayall ) has become the classic early Clapton showcase but was not as widely distributed at the time of its release . While all the members of Cream play terrifically here , I want to opine that it contains Clapton 's best set of solos , at least among the studio albums . His tone is still thick and bluesy unlike the more brittle tone and wah-wah effects adopted on Disraeli Gears . The solo on Sweet Wine ( which is overdubbed ) is really a hurricane and nothing like it had ever been recorded before . It combines blues and eerie psychedelic sounds into a really menacing gestalt . Nowadays nobody bats an eyelash at outrageous noises coming from guitars but in 1966 it was pretty overwhelming ! It is also marked by Clapton 's economy and logicality : everything flows together and nothing is wasted . The solo on I 'm Glad is a little jewel in which not a single note could be changed to advantage . It might be Clapton 's most perfect solo , all played on one string ( the G string ) or so it is claimed . The break on Cat 's Squirrel is also astounding , and the solo on Sleepy Time Time is classic too . I would put this album alongside the expanded Beano as Clapton 's best work as a guitarist , as opposed to his best work as composer , singer , or bandleader.PS ! I notice that this album is selling for an oddly low price . The song selection matches the original US vinyl release . It 's certainly a bargain , but there is an older CD version that contains Spoonful ( same studio version as on Goodbye ) , the Coffee Song , and Wrapping Paper . While I can live without Wrapping Paper I think Coffee Song is a great little track and you would want to have it . Spoonful also contains another finely constructed and dramatic solo , so it fits in well .	1
How can you miss with the tunes `` I Feel Free '' , `` NSU '' , and `` I 'm So glad '' .These three songs are among the finest , fastest , most whimsical , and breathtaking recordings of all time ! Playing `` I Feel Free '' recently , a `` Greatest Generation Vet '' friend at first thought it was some super high spirited jazz , and the sound is a fine mix of high- octane jazz , and jet age rock ! `` I 'm So Glad '' just about the same . Most of these cuts are ( were , in my case , about 39 years ago ! ) also great guitar intro courses , with some rifts that practically jolt you through the ceiling ! But even better , these guys could actually sing as well , with some really nifty harmonies ! So for some real supercharged fun , this is a tough album to beat , and it does stand the test of almost 40 years ! A few simplistic rockers , mainly filler , make this album a high 4-stars , instead of five , but definitely among the best of its type ever !	1
On & quot ; Fresh Cream & quot ; Clapton makes his prior work with the Yardbirds sound almost infant-like in sound compared to this album . Did he buy a new amp ? Anyway , this is THE defining blues-rock album of all time . & quot ; Cat Squirrel & quot ; is a wicked old blues tune . Jive on ole ' Robert Johnson 's & quot ; Four Until Late & quot ; for a while . Willie Dixon 's & quot ; Spoonful & quot ; is done immaculately here . Almost better than The Wolf 's version . This is Cream at their bluesiest . I like that .	1
I do n't usually like classic rock . I 'm into Punk , some metal , a bit of Grunge , and Hard Rock . This album is groundbreaking , I think it lead to the reballious Punk rock acts of the late seventies ( the Ramones , The Clash , and of course the Sex Pistols ) this is classic rock at it 's best . buy buy buy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
The brilliance of the Doors ' 1967 self-titled debut pretty much speaks for itself . Right out of the gate , this band were a rock force to be reckoned with . The towering voice , charisma , and sex appeal of singer Jim Morrison , the electrifying keyboard work of Ray Manzarek , the powerful guitar chords from Robby Krieger , and the incredible ace drumming from John Densmore all combined to make the Doors a truly unique band in the history of rock . Note for note , song for song , & quot ; The Doors & quot ; is a perfect debut album , with every single tune on the disc a Doors classic . Where to begin ? & quot ; Break On Through , & quot ; & quot ; Soul Kitchen , & quot ; & quot ; The Crystal Ship , & quot ; & quot ; Twentieth Century Fox , & quot ; & quot ; Light My Fire , & quot ; & quot ; Back Door Man , & quot ; & quot ; End Of The Night , & quot ; and the 11 1/2 minute epic , & quot ; The End & quot ; ... .heck , ALL the songs , simply outstanding . Morrison & company were , and ARE one of rock 's greatest groups . & quot ; The Doors & quot ; is a total keeper .	1
The sad truth is that the Doors hit their peak right out of the gate . Despite some high marks to come ( notably the follow-up , ` Strange Days ' , and the swansong , ` LA Woman ' ) , they never approached the power and majesty of this , one of the finest debut albums of all time . Correction - one of the finest records PERIOD.The contribution of all band members , producer , and engineer to this amazing , living , breathing musical masterpiece is truly remarkable . The musicianship is tight throughout , and the band switches from blues jams to operatic splendor to mystic ragas with consummate ease . Some of Morrison 's best couplets , intriguing wordplay , and theatrical presentation is brought to the fore , but the band contributes their passion to all forms of music to support and propel him thoughout.Kicking off with ` Break on Through ' gives every indication that this band was n't sucked into the `` Shine on Your Brother '' ethos so prevalent as America was tripping headlong towards the `` Summer of Love . '' Its darkness is palpable , driving along on Manzarek 's propulsive bass riff . Here we find Morrison chasing and being chased by the same demons that brought on his own destruction , as he dances with his own demise , and the question of what might come after. ` Soul Kitchen ' and ` Crystal Ship ' are truly haunting . The former , a bluesy/jazzy number stuffed with soul food , giving arguably Morrison 's best poetry room to shine : `` Your fingers weave quick minarets/speak in secret alphabets '' is an incredibly evocative snippet . The breathtaking ` Crystal Ship ' has become one of my very favorite Doors ' songs - Krieger 's light , deft fingerings create a shimmering web around perhaps Morrison 's best-ever vocal delivery . This song gives me chills with every listen. ` Twentieth Century Fox ' is a sultry , bouncy pop tune . Even the more lightweight material on this record is still powerful and very memorable . This is a timeless piece of pop that still sounds as though it could be a hit single today , though it lacks the expression and experimentation of much of the rest of the material.As for experimentation , it does n't get much weirder than the inclusion of ` Alabama Song . ' To display a segment of a German opera in a rock setting was unprecedented - the fact that they carried it off with style and panache is incredible , the likes of which would n't be heard again until Queen drenched the airwaves in Bohemian Rhapsodies ... . ` Light My Fire . ' There are few songs that can stand not only the test of time , but also the complete and total saturation of radio waves , year after year . The Stones ' ` Satisfaction ' is one such tune , and the timeless tunesmiths , the Beatles , have quite a few gems that fit this description . The Doors produced ` Light My Fire , ' and ten thousand listenings later , give or take a few thousand , it still sounds remarkably vibrant and fresh . From the opening rimshot and carnivalesque organ intro , through Morrison 's soulful and tender delivery , over the interplay of Manzarek 's and Krieger 's solos and fills , and quite possibly Densmore 's most inspired and inventive percussion , this song has rightly earned its place as one of the all-time great songs the rock era. ` Back Door Man ' was the start of the second side back when vinyl was the order of the day , and it gave Morrison plenty of space to strut and display his passion for the blues , as well as showing the world that the Lizard King was in town - little ladies , beware . It stands up well against some of his later blues numbers , even LA Woman 's excellent ` Crawling King Snake ' ( when his whiskey-ravaged voice was , arguably , far more suitable for this material ) .The next three cuts , ` I Looked at You ' , ` End of the Night ' , and ` Take It As It Comes ' are probably the closest thing to filler material on the record , but this has a lot more to do with the strength of the rest of the songs , for they are still fine cuts in their own right . ` End of the Night ' has a wonderful double-tracked baritone vocal from Morrison , and hints at the finale. ` The End ' , while an obvious showcase for Morrison 's fancies and vocal abilities , is also a fantastic piece of rock theater , and all members share in its glory . Robbie , in particular , ( who never seems to get due credit for his contribution to `` the Doors sound '' ) gives the piece its Mid-eastern flavor , with some dazzling fingerwork . John , likewise , takes advantage of all the space within the music to complement Jim 's words with some sharp and inspirational fills and flourishes . A fitting finale to a fantastic album .	1
It was the summer between my sophomore and junior years in High School . An adolescence spent listening to Top 40 Radio was gradually giving way to early adulthood . With a growing maturity also came a realization that there was more out there than the Beach Boys , Beatles , and the Dave Clark 5 . A music style that had given teaser previews with a few Yardbirds , Animals and Kinks hits exploded onto the music scene with the driving Rock and Roll , musicianship , and guitar tones of Jimi Hendrix , Cream , the Who , Steppenwolf , and other groups . I was eating it up , forgetting about Top 40 forever . No more AM radio for me , FM was where the good stuff , the music with guitar tones , solos , attitude and extended versions lived.I remember sitting in my parent 's room as the first echoes of CCR 's `` Susie Q '' insinuated themselves into the night . The song exploded into its agonizing distorted guitar solos , and I wondered , who the heck is THAT ? How can they be so good on the guitar ? Is there more of this stuff ? Of course , the answer was `` yes '' , and I have never looked back . A great summer , that , with musical experimentation blasting out everywhere . I ate it all up , buying `` underground `` records up everytime they appeared.Some of the albums from those days sound dated , and are unlistenable except for nostalgia purposes . Other offerings still stand tall , and some still blow the competition away.I heard about the Doors from a friend , and of course bought this first offering from the band . `` Light My Fire '' was a monster hit , but I owned the album for all the songs , not just the circus-like hook of the organ on the featured song . Good as that song is , it is only tied for maybe 6th place on the record . `` Break on Through '' is the first cut , and the near manic vocal by Morrison , over a driving rhythm and great lyrics , sets the tone for the album . Also on display is that strange , otherworldly quality to the tone and feeling of the album , a staple of Doors music . It 's hard to describe , but other fans know what I 'm talking about.The album contains hard core rockers , like the aforementioned `` Break on Through '' , as well as blusey numbers like `` Back Door Man '' . `` The End '' , an 11 minute play , caused a sensation with its story about a killer that awoke before dawn , killed his family and raped his mother . Things like that just did n't appear in media in those days . `` Alabama Song '' is a drinking song , but I bet everyone can sing along with it . I 've read in several places that the Door 's next album , `` Strange Days '' is better , but do n't you believe it.Morrison has a big voice on this album . He hits the notes with power and presence . Ray Manzarek showed star power on the keyboards , backed with solid , powerful drumming by John Densmore . Robbie Krieger hits some nice licks on the guitar . In concert , Manzarek played bass with his left hand , on another keyboard . Larry Knechtal is often credited with doing the studio bass work on this album.No matter who backed him , Jim Morrison was going to be a star . He hit the music industry at the right time , with a stage presence , lyrics , looks and voice that were going to propel him into the absolute upper reaches of the Rock and Roll stratosphere . This album rocks like no other Door 's album , as close to pure Rock and Roll as they were ever going to get . It is a truly great album , not only for its content but its impact on the industry . Going on 40 years now , and this one is still one of the very , very , very , best albums ever made .	1
If you 're a child of the 60 's ... ... who does n't love the Doors . I used to have this in an LP , now I have it in CD format .	1
I 'm not a huge fan of The Doors , I 'm rather just getting into band . I own this album and `` Waiting For The Sun '' and I think this one is much better . I got really inspired by Doors music ; their magic , psychodelic style , supported by amazing Manzarek 's keyboard playing and haunting vocals by Morrison is just what I love.Back to the album , it 's great . It has Doors ' biggest hits including `` Light My Fire '' or `` Break On Through '' but the rest of the disc is , for me , equally great . This is just the album I love to listen all the way through , from the beginning to the end , not skipping anything.Break On Through - Angry , intense rocker , setting You in the right place . Incredible . 10/10Soul Kitchen - My personal favourite . Great keyboard work , catchy chorus , ah , the entire song is excellent . 10/10Crystal Ship - Another classic . Dark and haunting . Love this song . I think it could be a bit longer . But still gets 10/1020th Century Fox - Catchy , typical Doors number . 8,5/10Alabama Song - Another hit . Catchy chords . Like this song . 9/10.Light My Fire - Doors ' classic . I really love this song , but sometimes have the feeling the jam part in the middle is a bit too long . 9,5/10Back Door Man - A blues cover , filled with Doors ' essence . This one is much better than the original . 10/10I Looked At You - Typical catchy song . Do n't know what to say about it ... just cool . 8,5/10End Of The Night - Oh yes ... the haunting climate and the psychodelic slides always gim me the thrills . 10/10Take It As It Comes - Another catchy one . Cool . 9/10The End - Well ... I think it 's a bit too long and gets too weird in few moments . Has its climate ... but not my favourite . 9/10Great . If You like 60s psychodelic music , You should own this one .	1
Along with Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin , this is one of the greatest debuts ever . It has `` Light My Fire '' and `` The End '' which set the tone for those epic Doors songs we 're so familiar with . `` Break On Through '' is the one everyone knows , just a firey and driving and out of control song that just makes you beat your steering wheel as you drive or drum along in the living room as you hear it on the radio . `` The Crystal Ship '' is the most beautiful and melodic The Doors ever got . Followed by the raucous and punchy `` Alabama Song , '' the funnest drinking song ever . Then its predecessor , 20th Century Fox is about as pop as The Doors ever got but it 's still a damn good song on a damn fine album . Check it out , it 's great . There n't many albums to which I can give a higher recommendation .	1
Released in 1967 , the Doors groundbreaking first album remains the standardbearer by which journeys of self-discovery are made through music . For years , the critics focussed on their reptilian , sometimes bloody lyrics , and proclaimed that the Doors music was `` all about evil . '' Thankfully , time has softened this view ; if the band 's music sometimes seems evil , it is because we are seeing ourselves , our own mirrored reflection , the evil ( as well as the good ) we carry in all of us . The band 's very name came from quotes made by Aldous Huxley and William Blake concerning `` the doors of perception , '' and if self-discovery and finding out the purpose and meaning of Existence is important to you , then you must discover the Doors . `` Break on Through '' deals with breaking through doors , i.e . barriers , between night and day , known and unknown , possibly even sanity and insanity . Drummer John Densmore kick-starts a hypnotic beat , guitarist Robbie Krieger pushes the song forward with classic figures , and keyboardist Ray Manzarek spins the first of his many memorable organ solos as singer Jim Morrison wails , shouts , and begs for understanding . It 's as great a beginning to an album ( and a career ) as has ever been recorded . `` Soul Kitchen , '' is the first of many much-needed breathers ; love , companionship , and great food can be found in this homey little restaurant if you `` learn to forget . '' `` The Crystal Ship '' conjures up a heavenly view of thousands of fellow travelers on a one-way boat to Nirvana , and is the Doors most breathtakingly beautiful ballad . `` 20Th Century Fox '' is a fashionable , sexy song about a fashionable , sexy lady , no more and no less . `` Alabama Song , '' written by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill and featured in their opera The Rise and Fall of The City of Mahoganny ( not Threepenny Opera , as is sometimes reported ) , is another breather , pure German beer-hall , oompah delight ! `` Light My Fire '' is the album 's titanic hit , with near-perfect solos by Ray and Robbie , and Jim 's most romatic performance ever . `` Back Door Man '' is Howlin ' Wolf blues and proves that the roots of the Doors , as with so many contemporaries , lie deep in the soil of black America . `` I Looked at You '' is a brief little ditty with a charming , carnival-style hook . `` End of the Night '' includes lyrics reportedly taken from the Tibetian book of the Dead and is the band at it 's most mystical ; everyone shines on this one . `` Take it as it Comes '' is similar to `` I Looked at You , '' but more hypnotic and insistant , more great organ by Ray . Finally , we come to The End , the masterpiece that pulls the album and it 's themes all together ; The End of Self as we knew it . Robbie 's guitar is at its most mournful best , and Jim 's wail seems to split time and space and travel down to us through centuries past , with a particularly strong retelling of the Oedipus myth midsong . ( Reportedly , when the Doors played Mexico , this was their most requested song . ) In summary , a stunning debut and one of the best rock albums ever recorded . Let the Doors start you on your own journey of self-discovery today . The doors of perception await ! ! !	1
I can only imagine what many people thought the first time they heard this album , if they were only familiar with `` Light My Fire , '' back in early 1967 . Sure , the Beatles were experimental , but their experimentation was with studio tricks , not the songs themselves . The Doors were the first real rock band to mix two celebrated art forms together , poetry and rock and roll . This debut album is still today , one of the most brilliant , if startling , debuts in music history.1 . Break On Through ( To the Other Side ) -5/5 . The Doors ' first single was a total flop , but the song itself is absolutely brilliant . It clearly defined who they were and what it would be like to listen to their music . The vocals , music and lyrics are all superb . Great organ by Manzarek.2 . Soul Kitchen-5/5 . Excellent soul/blues tribute to something very dear to me ( being from Mississippi ) , southern soul food . The lyrics are about Morrison wanting to spend all of his time at his favorite southern cooking restaurant . Morrison was also a southerner and you can tell in his passion for the lyrics and music . Excellent performances by all.3 . The Crystal Ship-5/5 . Another classic . This one appears on every Doors hits collection , although it was n't released as a single . The music is slow and mystical . The lyrics are excellent and Manzarek 's piano is remarkable.4 . Twentieth Century Fox-4/5 . This one is atypical of the Doors . The lyrics are simply about a woman who knows she is in control of her man . The lyrics are n't great and Morrison sings it as if he only half believes it , but the music is great.5 . Alabama Song ( Whisky Bar ) -5/5 . This is a cover song , but I do n't know who did it first . It sounds very Eastern European , like several drunk Germans searching for another watering hole after being kicked out of several already . It is kind of silly , but a lot of fun and fits in with the album well.6 . Light My Fire-5/5 . Not much to say about this song that has n't been said a million times . It remains their biggest hit single and the song that casual listeners always know . The music , particularly Manzarek 's organ , is absolutely brilliant . The lyrics are a perfect mix of melody and poetry . Simply a classic ! 7 . Back Door Man-5/5 . This is a Willie Dixon cover song . Rockers in the late 60 's , and even more so in the early 70 's , loved to cover Willie Dixon . His blues are very conducive to hard rock music . The lyrics are typical southern blues , but Morrison sings them like they are his own . Played perfectly with the Doors ' own spin on it.8 . I Looked At You-3/5 . This is one of the weaker songs on here . It is n't anything special . The music are typical for this time period and the lyrics are simply average . The main thing that keeps this above water is Morrison 's vocals.9 . End of the Night-5/5 . I love this song very much . It is slow and creepy and sounds exactly like a perfect Doors ' song should . Very Indian sounding with some excellent guitar from Krieger . The lyrics are also phenomenal . Great song.10 . Take It As It Comes-3/5 . This one is similar to `` I Looked At You . '' Nothing special . Sounds more like Jim Morrison singing with the Animals than the Doors . The lyrics are okay and he sings well , but it is too typical of 60 's rock.11 . The End-5/5 . Much has been written about the philosophy behind this song . Lyrically , there are several themes in it . The track is over 11 minutes long and explores the darkest depths of the human soul . The vocals are absolutley perfect . The music is very slow with Densmore 's tribal drumbeats being the standout . It is simply the best he has ever been . Perfect song.Bonus tracks:12 . Moonlight Drive ( Version 1 ) -4/5 . Slightly different version than the one that appeared a few years later . It is pretty good , but a little flat.13 . Moonlight Drive ( Version 2 ) -3/5 . This version sounds kind of hollow . It is definetly missing the meat on its bones.14 . Indian Summer 5/5 . Early recording of a song that later appeared on `` Morisson Hotel . '' No significant difference . It is an absolutely beautiful song.All in all , an absolute classic . This CD has been remixed and remastered , so the sound quality is superb , The liner notes explain that the speed of this album has always been slower than intended , but not by much . This remaster has fixed that . On first listen , I did n't notice . But the second time around , I did notice it . I believe that this is an all around improvement . Highly recommended for every person who is a fan of great classic rock .	1
Obviously , this is a masterpiece of classic rock and to hear it remastered with the correct speed ( the original had a muddy and dull sound but I never knew why ) and with lyrics that were buried in `` Break on Through '' and the then controversial `` The End '' make `` The Doors '' sound like the way they were supposed to be heard . The bonus tracks do n't really add anything to it but who cares . More importantly , though for years people into punk dismissed this album , unfairly and put it in the same category as a lot of bloated dinosaur bands that punk was a reaction to . However , the influence of the Doors , especially the first album on post punk and goth with their dark and disturbing lyrics and sound can not be understated , especially groups such as Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen ( who actually did some Doors covers ) . As for punk a certain Jim Ostenberg was inspired by the Doors to take their confrontational stance to a higher level and form the Stooges under the name Iggy Pop . So really there is nothing not to like about this album . The albums that followed ( except for `` Strange Days '' , another classic could not leave up their debut ( but what could ? ) and with the analog organ work by Ray Manzarek giving the album a jazz like quality , this is a perfect compliment to Jim Morrison 's vocals . Anyway , this should be on everyone 's top 100 list , if not top 10 list and deservedly so .	1
This album is so complex , so riveting , so inexplicitly mysterious ... it is impossible to put into words.I know a lot of people say Morrison was such a burn-out , he had nothing going for him , blah blah.Jim Morrison tested at genius levels in High School . His poetry seemed illiterate and self-indulgent to those who were not smart anough , and were too blunt , to understand his poetry.Jim 's voice is soothing and relaxing at times , and howls in rage at others.Moving on to the musical section of the Doors , Ray Manzarek , possibly the best keyboardist in the history of rock and roll , bursts into melodic leads throughout and makes the songs truly wonderful.Robby Krieger , the most creative member of the doors and really the best bottleneck/flamenco guitarist ever , leads a chaotic and enjoyable second hand to Manzarek 's keyboards . Robby 's near FIVE MINUTE jazz solo in & quot ; Light My Fire & quot ; pretty much sums it up . This guy can play.John Densmore is without a doubt the most unrecognized drummer in Rock and Roll history . He plays Latin and Jazz beats , and is never above adding in an excellent drum lead-in at the end of a riff . His playing is extraordinary on & quot ; The End & quot ; but really he is majorly responsible for the songs being as good as they are . Being a drummer myself , I know John wasnt fond of playing the bass drum , but he definately makes up for it in his snair/single tom beats.Every song on this CD is perfect . From the bassy guitar opening to & quot ; Break On Through , & quot ; to the pop-charm of & quot ; Twentieth Century Fox , & quot ; this CD has it all . Songs about deep , depressing aspects in life ( & quot ; End of the Night & quot ; and & quot ; The End & quot ; ) to songs that include Morrison poetry ( & quot ; The Crystal Ship & quot ; and & quot ; Soul Kitchen & quot ; ) to those simple pop songs about girls that were trademark sixties ( & quot ; Twentieth Century Fox , & quot ; & quot ; I Looked at You & quot ; and & quot ; Light My Fire & quot ; ) .There is Jazz solos ( such as in & quot ; Light My Fire & quot ; ) , and some excellent blues ( such as & quot ; Back Door Man & quot ; ) . Nothing can compare to this album.Here now are my favorite studio Doors CDs , in order : The DoorsThe Doors/LA WOMANThe Doors/STRANGE DAYSThe Doors/THE SOFT PARADE ( very under-rated ) The Doors/WAITING FOR THE SUNThe Doors/MORRISON HOTELAlthough EVERY SINGLE Doors CD is great . Let me tell you this : The Doors never did a bad song . They will forever be remembered as the GODS of 60s Rock and Roll.Forget The Beatles . Forget The Stones . Forget Jopplin . They were all great bands , but they were poster boys . Jim Morrison 's lyrics were real , they had emotion . This music is truly something sacred , unmatched by all immitators. & quot ; There are things known and things unknown , and in between are the doors. & quot ; -Jim Morrison	1
This album is a must-have . I had the greatest hits of the Doors but when my local classic FM station plays songs like Soul Kitchen and I ca n't find them on the greatest hits , I realize that I have to have the original album . Yes , you 'll read how this album has been remastered and it does n't sound the same as the original vinyl recording but so what ? You can finally hear what Morrison says about his girlfriend in & # 34 ; Break on Through & # 34 ; ( it was censored in the original recording ) . People tell me that no one buys CD 's anymore . I have no interest in MP3 files . The quality is awful . Give me a CD any day . The sacrifice of using MP3 files for their portability it not worth the crappy quality .	1
If you want to listen to a great example of the psychedelic rock of the 1960s , played by one of the most definitive bands of that generation ( and perhaps of all time ) , look no further than The Doors ' self-titled album ( originally released in 1966 ) . Lead singer Jim Morrison was the stuff of legends , for reasons that are very apparent . He was a highly charismatic ( and , at times , very unsettling ) figurehead of his generation , and a rock music icon that continues to haunt people today , as a fallen legend . The bands ' penchant for excessive drug use is alluded to on many occasions on this album ( hence , that is why they call it psychedelic rock -- this music was composed specifically for the purpose of appealing to people sailing off on to acid trip induced journeys in their minds ) .Though , I have never done a drug in my life , even I felt high after listening to these songs . Some of the most well-known and appreciated songs from The Doors ' repertoire are featured here . They include `` Break on Through ( To the Other Side ) , '' `` The Crystal Ship , '' `` Light My Fire , '' and `` The End . '' ( among others ) Between Jim Morrison 's piercing and ( no doubt ) slightly menacing vocals , charged guitar and percussive work from the other musicians and lyrics rich with double ( and triple ) entendre , you 'll come away from this music feeling more than slightly rummy . Then , once you come down from that contact high , you 'll want to go on that trip all over again .	1
This album is great . If you have only heard of the Doors , but not actually heard them , then this should be the first album of theirs to purchase . It 's got classics that have stood the test of time like : break on through , alabama song , light my fire and the end .	1
there is no doubt that this is one of the greatest records ever concieved.jim morrisions deep mournful voice booms nice twinkly key boards parts and jagged quitar work ( and a pretty good drummer to ) this is the doors first album.i cant even put into words how good it is so i sugest you by it now	1
So far - I 've been a big fan of these 40th anniversary remix/remasters . The sound quality has been Excellent ! It jumps right out at you ! It 's cool to hear `` Light My Fire '' at it 's intended speed , as they finally fixed it on this release . Every song on this album is awesome ! The album that took The Doors into super-stardom and launched Jim into rock-icon status ! I highly recommend it to those who have n't discovered the Doors yet or for those who are interested in a better quality sounding Doors debut . Decent bonus tracks except `` Indian Summer '' basically sounds the same as the version on `` Morrison Hotel '' . Two takes of `` Moonlight Dr. '' are cool to hear . Long live the Doors !	1
Yeah , we all know this is a masterpiece , blah blahblah ... ..What I want to know is if the current pressings are digitally remastered ? ? I know that the entire Doors back catalog was released as such a few years ago , are they the same masters used for the current re-issues ? ? ?	1
THE DOORS WALKED INTO A STUDIO IN 1967 AND THEY WALKED OUT WITH A MASTERPIECE ... THIS THING IS REALLY REALLY INCREDIBLE BUT NOT SO MUCH FOR JIM MORRISON AS IT IS FOR ROBBIE AND RAY ... RAY MANZERAK IS JUST SUCH A TOTAL MUSICIAN ... AND ROBBIE 'S GUITAR IS LIKE BRIAN JONES ON CRACK ! AND THESE SONGS ? WELL..DO N'T GET ME STARTED TOO MUCH HERE ... THE DOORS PULL NO PUNCHES AND THEY DO NOT MESS WITH YOU FOR LATER ( LIKE THE WHO AND OTHER BANDS WOULD DO TO TEASE YOU ) ... THE DOORS LET IT ALL FLY ON EVERY ALBUM..THEY SHOW YOU THAT THEY ARE THE BEST ON EARTH AND THEY AI N'T MESSIN ' AROUND ... JIM MORRISON WAS THE FIRST EYES CLOSED TRANSI-NEO KURT COBAIN WITH TONS OF WORDS THAT MADE NO SENSE AND YET SAID IT ALL WITH LOADS OF PAIN AND GLOOMY ALCOHOL SOAKED HATE FOR THE EARTH AND EVERYONE AROUND HIM YET TRYING HIS BEST TO LOVE AND RELATE ... THIS GUY WAS A GENIOUS AND HE `` HAD '' TO CHECK OUT YOUNG ... THATS JUST THE WAY IT IS MAN , ... THE DOORS ARE PERFECT CHAOS..I KNOW ROBBIE AND JOHN CAN BE BITTER WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT JIM TODAY BUT IT ALL HAD TO BE THIS WAY TO SURVIVE ... '' EVERYTHING MUST BE THIS WAY '' A PERFECT 5 STAR RECORD .	1
Already immersed in the disease of alcoholism at the age of 23 , Jim Morrison provides us with a catbird 's seat of his own self-destruction . The Doors as a band were incredibly unique and gifted , but no one has captured the train wreck as existance that is addiction better than `` The Lizard King '' .The pursuit of danger is captured perfectly on `` Break On Through '' and `` Take It As It Comes . '' The surreal escapism of drug abuse is explained in `` The Crystal Ship '' and `` End Of The Night . '' The final destination of this progressive disease finishes up the album ( `` The End '' ) .To find a artist who honestly performed as a means of exorcisng his own demons , to keep from slitting his throat or jumping out the nearest window , has a certain integrity to it in today 's world of corporate rock . The music of the Dors stands on its own merits , but I ca n't help but believe that , with drug addictions of all kinds on the rise , its lyrics speak to more people today than they did in 1967 . Easily one of the top 5 best rock albums ever produced !	1
This is quite simply one of those albums that puts the `` classic '' in classic rock , and truly one of the best debuts in history . Every day their are people listening to this album for the first time and going `` wow '' ! I really like every one of their albums , but I can safely say that 9 of 10 fans would call this one the best . 8 of these 11 songs made the last `` Hits '' collection this is so good . I would have added 9 . I 'll say no more , but since the tracklist is currently missing here , I 'll list it : Break On Through ( to the other side ) , Soul Kitchen , The Crystal Ship , Twentieth Century Fox , Alabama Song ( whisky bar ) , Light My Fire , Back Door Man , I Looked At You , End Of The Night , Take It As It Comes , and The End . A must .	1
And believe me , that was n't a tough conclusion to jump to . This record is unbelievable . Throw away your Nickelback and Linkin Park bullcrap and prepare to be treated to an unforgettable listening experience .	1
This classic , totally outstanding album , first released in 1967 on the Elektra label is , undoubtedly , one of the upmost impressive , compelling recordings in rock music history . It is also most certainly one of the very best first-outings by a rock group.Indeed The Doors were one of the most exciting , influential and controversial rock bands of the swinging sixties with the legendary genius Jim Morrison as The Doors lead singer , Ray Manzarek controlling the spiralling electric organ , John Denmore on drums and Robby Krieger on guirtar . The Doors never actually recruited a bass player so the sound was , endearingly , highlighted by Ray Manzarek 's predominant electric organ , providing a hypnotic backdrop for Jim Morrison 's captivating vocals , who rides through the inventive musical landscapes with finesse.The Doors ( 1967 ) album introduced the world to their adventurous , startling fusion of rock , blues , classical and jazz . These diverse blend of styles intertwine beautifully with the poetic , often thought-provoking lyrics , making for an incredibly powerful , innovative album that has set standard 's for generations.The albums opener is the belting and thoroughly infectious 'Break On Through ( To The Other Side ) ' , one of my personal favourite 's . 'Break On Through ' was also The Doors debut single release . The propulsive rhythm flows gloriously with notably nifty guirtar work courtesy of Robby Krieger , entwined with Ray Manzarek 's bewitching , ever-effective electric organ interludes and incessant , pounding drum beats from John Denmore , not to mention Jim Morrison 's rocketing vocals . An extremely credible start to the album and the single deserved far much more commercial recognition than it initially received at the time.The stomping , thunderous rock of 'Soul Kitchen ' is a cracking affair , complemented by Morrison 's mesmerising vocal delivery while the beguiling Oriental mystery of 'The Crystal Ship ' is a pure masterpiece ( as is the entire album ) , mellowing the mood somewhat.Beginning with a magical guirtar riff , blended with the customary electric organ , this leads us into another compelling , stomping rock number 'Twentieth Century Fox ' , while the fun 'Alabama Song ( Whisky Bar ) ' making for an immediately striking and rather diverting experiment . Morrison 's deep , sonorous voice pulsates seamlessly through all the enchanting ebbs and flows . 'Light My Fire ' is an out and out classic and one of The Doors major landmarks . Hauntingly atmospheric with its funeral-like electric organ backdrop and Morrison 's stirring delivery . They enjoyed their first real taste of significant commercial success and acceptance with 'Light My Fire ' , swiftly topping the US Billboard Chart ( though barely dented the UK Top 50 on its original release ; upon its re-issue in the summer of 1991 it flew up into the Top 10 ) . The full severn-minute version is a pure sonic masterpiece , allowing us to enjoy the groups ever-dynamic playing . Another utterly mesmerising and hypnotic afair.The mid-tempo rock number 'Back Door Man ' capture 's yet more powerful , expert playing , hosting a rich and deep performance from Morrison who also enhances the tremendous and startling production of 'I Looked At You'.The dreamy , mysterious 'End Of The Night ' highlights the groups remarkable affinity for shrewd , poetic , profound lyrics . Beautiful . 'Take It As It Comes ' kicks up the tempo again and this held ample commercial potential ( as did practically every track on here ) , while the tinkling 11-minute oedipal drama 'The End ' is literally spine-tingling and has to be one of The Doors most daring , compulsive outings that is completely haunting with its non-stop melodicism , dynamic tension and sombre , dreamy tone.This album is a pure masterpiece , ranking ( in my opinion ) among their very best , most innovative work . Excellence all the way . It also became a major seller and spending over two years on the US Billboard chart . Essential ! Ian PhillipsApril 2010	1
4 1/2Undoubtedly one of the all-time classic rock debut albums , The Doors '67 self-titled release set the bar for their own specially formulated psychedelic blues awfully high , a level they were allowed to reach again , though arguably never surpass . Although I would be lying if I said all the songs hit me like the greatest ones do ( maybe it would have also benefited from a different sequence ) and also I 'd be lying if I said I have not drained most of the emotional truths from their best work long ago , but after all the subjectivity , what is really not to like here ? Rare is the album where each song can stand as a microcosm of it 's brilliance- be it the longer , literate jams I personally gravitated towards or the more traditional verse-chorus keyboard driven bluesy numbers which in itself stood far apart from comparative kind . Credit Manzarek and company for ushering in a radio-ready rock synergy that has stood the tests of time like such few bands have .	1
You might be surprised to find that only eight of the eleven songs on The Doors were written by Jim Morrison . `` Light My Fire '' was written mostly by Robby Krieger ( a song that Morrison learned to hate by the way ) , `` Back Door Man '' was written by the blues king Willie Dixon , and `` Alabama Song '' was a Weill/Brecht composition . Which leaves the other eight masterful songs . Everything great about the Doors is on this album . Psychedelia ( `` Break On Through '' , `` Soul Kitchen '' , `` The End '' ) , rock ( `` Twentieth Century Fox '' , `` Take It As It Comes '' ) , pop ( `` Light My Fire '' , `` I Looked At You '' ) and even balladry of a sort ( `` The Crystal Ship '' ) are all done with a confidence that no debut album has any right to . It also remains Paul Rothchild 's finest production with Morrison 's vocals reaching a majestic quality . But perhaps the best thing about The Doors is the teasing mystery surrounding the lyrics , especially on `` Soul Kitchen '' and `` The End '' . The underlying message of `` Soul Kitchen '' is learn to forget , a message that can not be overstated . `` The End '' is loaded with symbolism recalling Rimbaud ; `` father , I want to kill you/mother , I want to ... '' should not be taken literally as they are pure symbolism .	1
The Doors ' debut album is often described as `` one of the best debut albums in history , '' but are ANY rock albums better ? `` The Doors '' dazzled the world and established the group 's unique sound : a blend of sensuous dark rock and blues . Here , at its best , Doors ' music is tightly structured , clear , and fluid -- whether hard driving or eerie . The music speaks for itself ; fuzz boxes need not apply . Lead singer Jim Morrison 's lyrics and the imagery they conjure up are supported by Robby Krieger 's aggressive , sometimes sinewy guitar . But Ray Manzarek 's keyboards , mostly organ here , became The Doors ' trademark , even as Krieger had more edge.The 1967 debut has been described as `` perfect , '' but it has one so-so track , `` I Looked at You . '' Substitute this CD 's 2d bonus track of `` Moonlight Drive '' ( a little better than 1st ) to neatly lead into `` End of the Night '' : Perfection would then be achieved using Jim 's first-ever composition , but `` Strange Days '' would then lose a great song.The one song Morrison did n't write was the one that blasted the group into prominence . Krieger 's `` Light My Fire '' is an erotic journey . Ray 's solo is majestic and ecstatic , with dramatic cadences . Robby 's solo explores the dark underside of consciousness , using a flamenco/latin sound with beautiful high-pitched motifs . John Coltrane 's `` Ole '' and `` My Favorite Things '' were influences , but `` Light My Fire '' has its own structure and Doors'-infused dynamic tension -- It is The Doors ' creation . Let 's not forget Jim 's terrific opening and finale , either.The electrifying opener , `` Break on Through , '' epitomizes what the group represents . One of the most tightly performed , hard-driving songs ever , it bursts outward in centripetal force , revolving around Jim 's verbal invitations to sex and violence , freedom , and mystery . Morrison 's lyrics shine just as much in the second track , `` Soul Kitchen '' : `` The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes/Streetlights shed their hollow glow/Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise/Still one place to go ... ../Your fingers weave quick minarets/Speak in secret alphabets/I light another cigarette/Learn to forget . '' Jim 's song lyrics were always much better than his regular poetry . `` The Crystal Ship , '' beautiful and highly evocative , explores fleeting romance within an acid-induced setting . A lovely piano solo is sandwiched between Jim 's fabulous crooning.The album 's theatrical atmosphere is most marked in the next two songs . `` Twentieth Century Fox '' is an amusing commentary perhaps not restricted to Hollywood starlets , with cool , sarcastic lyrics by Jim joining sexy instrumental crescendos and a very clever pause in the chorus . `` The Alabama Song ( Whiskey Bar ) '' is the Doors ' catchy interpretation of a tune from Bertolt Brecht 's opera `` The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny , '' with decadent lyrics . The other cover is Willie Dixon 's bluesy `` Back Door Man , '' in which The Doors heavily adapt the structure to fit Jim 's dramatic needs and forceful singing.In `` End of the Night , '' the group invokes the dark themes of French writer Louis-Ferdinand Celine , again relying on Krieger 's high-pitched guitar twangs in support of Morrison 's dark journey down an endless highway to the `` Bright Midnight . '' The un-Doors-like `` Take It as It Comes '' has an optimistic tone ( but Robby insists Jim wrote the verse and lyrics ) , featuring swirling keyboards by Ray . I feel `` The End '' is overrated , notably the Oedipal section , but its atmosphere forever clarifies that The Doors ' Hearts are in Darkness .	1
Before The Doors released their debut album in 1967 , rock and roll at that time was starting to sound more and more the same and just `` typical '' or run-of-the-mill . In other words , pioneers and trailblazers were in short supply . The Doors shook things up when they emerged on the scene playing at clubs in Los Angeles in 1965 and 1966 . They were pioneers or `` radicals '' because of their unique sound . A bottleneck guitar player ( Robbie Krieger ) who used his fingernails instead of a pick , a jazz drummer ( John Densmore ) , an organ player ( Ray Manzarek ) who played both the organ and organ bass at the same time , and an out-of-control singer ( Jim Morrison ) who was a poet and wrote poetic lyrics and was a student of film and was college educated , as Ray Manzarek was , also.A unique lineup of musicians formed one of the greatest rock bands of all time , The Doors.The Doors had no regular bass player , so Ray Manzarek played keyboard bass on this debut album , and also in concert . On later albums , session bass players were used in the studio , but during concerts the bass was provided by Manzarek 's organ bass . The debut album was recorded almost all live - the band would play and Morrison would sing at the same time , so virtually every song was a one-shot recording , if you will . This album contains some classic songs such as Break On Through ( To The Other Side ) , Soul Kitchen , The Crystal Ship , Twentieth Century Fox , Alabama Song ( Whiskey Bar ) , Light My Fire , Back Door Man , I Looked At You , End Of The Night , Take It As It Comes , and the 11 minute epic , The End . I named the whole album ! The revolutionary sound of The Doors is what made them trailblazers . An eerie organ , keyboard bass , bottleneck guitar playing , jazz drumming , and the unique vocals and poetic lyrics of Jim Morrison . What 's not to like ? If you like bands that are different and think outside the box and do n't fall into the same category as everyone else , give The Doors and their debut album a listen . They have remained my second favorite band behind Motley Crue . They might become one of your favorites if you have n't heard them before .	1
After bringing their somewhat revolutionary sound around the LA club circuit for 2 years , the Doors released their debut album . Recorded in just a week or 2 , the Doors made one of rock 's most eerie , musical and amazing albums.Jim Morrison 's dark and trippy poetry is evident in & quot ; Break On Through , & quot ; & quot ; Crystal Ship , & quot ; and & quot ; End of the Night. & quot ; The Doors also had a pop sensibility , on & quot ; Light My Fire , & quot ; and the unusual adaptation of a Kurt Weill song ( & quot ; Alabama Song ( Whiskey Bar ) & quot ; ) , but it still was amazing . A lot of this album pays attention to their rocking-blues roots ( Soul Kitchen , 20th Century Fox , and the cover of Willie Dixon 's Back Door Man ) .The focal point of this album is the 11-minute finale , & quot ; The End , & quot ; a dark , mysterious , and unsettling song with Eastern influenced rhythms , Ray Manzarek 's organ , and lyrics starting off about a romantic breakup but then transforming into an Oedipal , and violent frenzy , all contained in the psyche of Jim Morrison . It even got them fired from the Whiskey-a-Go-Go in 1966 after Jim said the infamous & quot ; Mother.. I want to.. & quot ; I think you get the idea . It really is one of the best songs the Doors ever did , and very strange for such a period of optimistic muisc and the genesis of flower power . Many regard this as their best , but this was the beginning of a very interesting career for a very influential and seminal band .	1
In 1967 , the year of SGT . PEPPER 'S , PET SOUNDS , ARE YOU EXPERIENCED ? , SURREALISTIC PILLOW , DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED and THE VELVET UNDERGROUND AND NICO , The Doors released this self-titled debut album which had and has as much influence as any of them.THE DOORS introduced the world to Jim Morrison and his bandmates . They were never better . From the opening notes of `` Break On Through To The Other Side '' The Doors began to weave a dark tapestry of depravity and humor noir . The carnivalesque notes of Ray Manzarek 's keyboards meshed perfectly with Morrison 's rich but bleak baritone . The overall effect is the aural equivalent of an opium den.The dusky , smoky , cloying sweetness of the notes is reinforced by the lyrics which range from the merely aggressive ( `` Break On Through '' ) to the demandingly intoxicated ( `` The Alabama Song aka Whisky Bar '' ) to the overtly erotic ( `` Crystal Ship '' ) to the profoundly disturbed ( `` The End '' ) . Morrison 's fixation with Nietzche , Celine , and the Oedipal Conflict is never more laid bare.Had Jim Morrison stopped performing after THE DOORS and vanished into the trackless wastes of the world he would have been considered a prodigy . As it was , he devolved into a suicidal alcoholic whose artistic visions became progressively weaker on succeeding albums . Although there were subsequent Doors songs that matched or exceeded the best on THE DOORS , the band never spoke so clearly or consistently again .	1
The Doors had three great albums in my opinion . LA Woman , Strange Days and this one , their debut . Anyone who knows anything about rock music has heard most of the songs on this album already . There 's probably not much more to say other than if you want an original Doors album and not a compilation , choose this one , Strange Days or LA Woman .	1
Great add to my cd collection.I still have the vinyl ! This is one of the best by the Doors !	1
Let me tell you how great this album is . I found every song so great , I grew up thinking this was a greatest hits album . Until I realized I was an idiot ... and wrong , I always never considered this one of their greatest albums because I never thought it was a regular album . That being said , you can already understand the power this has . Either that or how much of an idiot I am.The Doors is my all time favorite band . Morrison , Manzarek , Densmore , and Krieger ... the finest in each of their professions . From Morrison 's swagger and unintelligible poetry at times , to Manzarek 's blues and soul organ , then forth to Densmore 's eccentric jazz drumming , and finishing up with the inane flamenco aspects of Krieger 's finger picking guitar work ... The Doors in retrospect , own . Their debut is such a powerhouse and makes you scream , explode , and reach for the air , that you really just ca n't get enough of it.The singles , the hits , and the golden ones are obvious . Who in their right mind HAS N'T heard 'Break on Through ' or 'Light My Fire ' ? Or even 'Whiskey Bar ' ? It 's apparent that this album has highlights . But , look further and you can see just where the Doors progressed . From the opening rawhide thunder opener , 'Break on Through ' we slowly diminish into this psychological warp that is , 'The End . ' Surprisingly , that 's exactly where the Doors left off and began with their follow up , 'Strange Days . 'While this is their debut , it is almost a greatest hits album . It culminates everything the damn Doors are . It has psychological , psychedelic rock with that jazz , that blues , and even that thrill . You watch sneak previews at the theaters today and it 's not too different than this . Their self titled debut is a demo to what was to come , the ride they were to take us on.While it 's certainly not their best , I rate all of their albums five stars , even the distant 'Soft Parade . ' Why ? Simply , The Doors were one of those bands that you rarely ever see . Much like 'The Beatles ' or 'Led Zeppelin ' , they were perfect . They matured and they thrived and they never looked back ... they just increased upon . It 's obvious 'LA Woman ' , their last album , had hints of this self titled debut , but even then ... that was different too.Forget all that , this is n't about the history of the Doors , but this album almost depicts that . If you want to know what the experience of the Doors is like , I more than highly recommend this to you . You can start from here and keep on going , never look back ... that 's what they did . This is easily one of the most influential and greater albums from the past . You will not be disappointed . Buy this , then buy Strange Days ! That ... or rent 'The Doors . '	1
The Doors ****1/2One of the greatest things about the Doors ' catalogue is that no single album in the bunch sounds anything remotely like any other in the collection . The bands self-titled debut being the most straight ahead shoot at a pure rock n ' roll album . Thought even then it is a stretch to consider this a rock n ' roll album ; psychedelic is more likely . Irregardless The Doors is one of the greatest debut and rock albums of all time.The purple hued music that fills the eleven tracks on The Doors are some of the strongest that the group would ever make , many of which would go on to be hit singles and covered by many . Criminally underrated guitarist and songwriter Robbie Krieger 's 'Light My Fire ' went on to become the bands biggest hit single and signature song , both being sold to Chevy for a commercial and to many other artists who would also gain number one singles with it . 'Break On Through ( To The Other Side ) ' while never becoming a hit has become a classic and a radio staple . 'The End ' the most taboo song in rock history closes the album in true epic form but not before many other great tracks . 'End Of The Night ' might be the greatest and most impressive thing that Morrison ever recorded . The darkly haunting slide work from Krieger along side Manzarek 's keys create a feeling of desperation . Not but to help this feeling is Morrison 's autobiographical lyrics about his love for the dark side of life , including death . 'Back Door Man ' is the blues cover Jimmy Page wishes he pulled off and 'Twentieth Century Fox ' is just a killer rocker . Both 'Soul Kitchen ' and 'The Crystal Ship ' were covered by seminal L.A. punk band X and guitar God Joe Perry on his solo album . While both were good they failed in comparison to the originals.The only minor flaw to the album is the often horrendous 'Alabama Song ( Whisky Bar ) ' which while fun for the occasional spin is very novelty and unworthy of a Doors record , though it would have made a bitchin ' B-side.The Doors is one of the rare moments in rock n ' roll where everything just seems to click and fall into place . While the Doors would go on to record better albums , none would surpass this in importance , influence or in stature .	1
I 'm not a big fan of the whole psychadelic period ( except for these guys , the stones '67 on , hendrix , and cream ) , but when I first heard this album , I was in awe.Never have I heard such mind-warping lyrics and an organ on a rock track that actually sounded pleasant.No one pulled off an effort like this before them , and no one to this day could do it again.This debut is simply magical and very , as most people have put it , atmospheric.Morrison 's voice is just hypnotizing.His lyrics are very poetic , afterall the guy was a poet.At times , the lyrics may have underlying meanings , but that 's the cool thing.Just the whole `` what the hell does that mean ? '' after your first listen of `` The End '' .Sure Jim was known for his excesses , but he was a genius without a doubt.The entire album rocks from the opening drums of `` Break On Thru '' to the decresendo of the epic and enigmatic `` The End '' .Only listen to this album when you have time to listen to it straight thru.It all goes together so well and anything these guys did up to LA WOMAN is essential music for anyone into psychadelic rock or even hard rock.Long live The Doors ! Long live the Lizard King ! ! ! !	1
Like most , i became familiar with the doors through the song 'light my fire ' on the radio and was immediately intrigued.My first album was one of the greatest hits albums when i was a kid and they immediately became one of my favs , still to this day.This their first album is perfect , from beginning to end.Nuff said .	1
1967 was considered the Summer of Love but also the year of great albums too ! ! ! Sgt Pepper by the Beatles , Disraeli Gears by Cream , Are You Experienced by Jimi Hendrix , Days of Future passed by the Moody Blues , Spirit of 67 by Paul Revere & The Raiders , even the Monkees album Pisces , Aquarius , Capricorn & Jones LTD was a pretty decent album so many more groups came out with a great album that year including a New Band with their self titled album simply called the Doors would be considered a Classic just by the first song on the album Break on Through , followed by Light My Fire which became a big single for them all songs written by the Doors except Back Door Man & Whisky Bar but still some great covers and the last song on the album The End says it all ! ! !	1
The Doors debut record has to arguably be one of the greatest debut records of all time , up there with The Mothers of Invention 's ` Freak Out ' ( 1966 ) The Velvet Underground 's ` Velvet Underground & Nico ' ( 1967 ) Jimi Hendrix 's ` Are You Experienced ? ' ( 1967 ) The Clash 's ` The Clash ' ( 1977 ) and Black Flag 's ` Damaged ' ( 1981 ) . The thing it lacks is the influential stature of some of the above albums but it had the chart success.In 1967 , the summer of love , it climbed to the no.1 spot on the billboard charts mostly aided by the success of the edited single of ` Light My Fire ' . While the rest of the album has many highlights like ` Break On Through ( To The Other Side ) ' , ` Crystal Ship ' the focus of the attention is on ` Light My Fire ' and the Oedipal drama of ` The End ' that got them banned from the Whisky-A-Go-Go . ` Light My Fire ' with it 's lengthy solo is an excellent example of modal playing which was based on the music of jazz giants John Coltrane and Miles Davis . The idea is to improvise over just one or two chords without falling into the pentatonic trap . Interestingly according to Krieger he used the same two chords Coltrane used on ` My Favourite Things ' ( Am & Bm ) . Apart from the obvious reference to drug taking in the lyrics the structure of the song emphasises the swirling repetitive ` high ' of the solo before the final come down into the 3rd and 4th verses and outro. ` The Doors ' is probably the only popular record that adequately captured the true atmosphere of 1967 , the summer of love as well as its darker elements . Love 's ` Forever Changes ' ( 1968 ) may be a better record but like the Velvet Underground 's no one heard it . The problem with the record is that it was virtually impossible to follow up . All the albums released afterwards seem to somehow pale in comparison , with possibly ` L.A. Women ' being the only exception , however this is an outstanding debut that is nearly 40years old , yet still remarkably fresh sounding . It should be in all record collections .	1
The Doors debut album is their best . Their well known singles like & quot ; Break on Through & quot ; and & quot ; Light My Fire & quot ; are excellent and the rest of the songs maintain the same quality . & quot ; The Crystal Ship & quot ; is an beautiful piece of poetry , performed perfectly by Jim Morrison 's haunting voice . & quot ; Soul Kitchen & quot ; and & quot ; Twentieth Century Fox & quot ; are also lyrically clever and surprisingly catchy. & quot ; Back Door Man & quot ; is a rousing blues number , likely the weakest track on the album , but still worth listening to . & quot ; I Looked at you & quot ; and & quot ; Take it as it Comes & quot ; are both energetic songs , surrounding the hypnotic & quot ; End of the Night & quot ; . The final track is & quot ; The End & quot ; , a near-masterpiece drawing influences from the Greek Tradgedy of Oedepis.The Doors , and in particular Jim Morrison , are the only people capable of pulling of this album . If you have any interest in the Doors check this out . It 's worth every penny .	1
The Doors came out with this album in 1967 , and it has remained of the best debuts to this day ! This album has a plethora of songs that are awesome to listen to . There is no bad song on this CD . It is pure gold . It starts off with one of the first songs that got me into rock and roll , & quot ; Break On Through & quot ; . It continues on to & quot ; Soul Kitchen & quot ; , and the album continues till there . The band 's true talent comes out on this album , and each song shows another talent they have . Take a look at & quot ; Light My Fire & quot ; , where you see the keyboard talent of Ray Manzarek , the guitar talent of Robbie Krieger , and Jim 's vocal talent ! You see Jim 's ability to write poetry from & quot ; The End & quot ; , an 11:30 masterpiece dealing with several ... . issues . It has a couple of stories in it , but it ties it all together . John Densmore shows his talent most in & quot ; Break On Through & quot ; . This album was a hell of a milestone in the career of the Doors , and their precense was immediately felt with this album . Buy it , music fans , you 'll be surprised !	1
Very good album every song is awesome this album is in my top ten albums of all time ! It still sounds as fresh today as it did in 1967 when it first came out !	1
Some of the most powerful music ever recorded . Get the replica vinyl or the cd box set though as the sound quality is much improved	1
okay and well then there are some people who are against this , but they can get bent . the lizard king will ride a snake seven miles and stab your mother . eat the hippies in their cribs . oh yeah , baby in their cribs .	1
The Doors was released in January of 1967 . Beginning with a breathtaking introduction , & quot ; Break On Through & quot ; and climaxing with & quot ; Light My Fire & quot ; most of the songs on side one have that trademark organ sound . The organ , a Vox Continental , is played by the incomparable Ray Manzarek , who also played a Fender Rhodes keyboard bass with his left hand at the same time , keeping the bass lines precise and melodic . An amazing feat of musicianship indeed ! Side two starts off with a Willie Dixon/Chester Burnett composition , & quot ; Back Door Man & quot ; . A jazzy little number complete with bluesy guitar solo by Robby Krieger . Followed by & quot ; End of the Night & quot ; , the most haunting melody I 've ever heard . The final song is the 11 minute 35 second Oedipal epic & quot ; The End & quot ; . I thought the song was a little boring the first time I heard it but it seems to grow on you . The icing on the cake is the album cover artwork . The psychedelic green logo over brown matches the music somehow . And the back cover photography ( by genius photographer Joel Brodsky ) with the half faces is extraordinary . I 'm a tough critic but I 'm glad to give this CD five stars !	1
1967 ... . the year Jim Morrison and the Doors pretty much conquered the music world with their incredible self-titled debut . Dark , pulsating , and blazing with energy , this is one of those albums that defined classic rock and caught the essence of a rebellious generation.There are loads of classic songs on this disc , and I 'm not just referring to the monster hits like & quot ; Light My Fire & quot ; and & quot ; Break on Through & quot ; ( both excellent ) . Other awesome songs include the psychadelic & quot ; Crystal Ship & quot ; , the distorted blues sounds incorporated into & quot ; Alabama Song & quot ; , & quot ; Twentieth Century Fox & quot ; , the slower & quot ; End of the Night & quot ; , and the raging psychosis of the epic finale & quot ; The End & quot ; .Every song on & quot ; The Doors & quot ; is a classic , and no serious music collection is complete without this masterpiece . Jim Morrison is the rock star personified , and he fronts a highly skilled group of musicians ( aka Manzarak , Krieger , and Densmore ) . This music transcends the age in which it was created , and were it released today for the very first time it would be every bit as revolutionary and inspired as it was over 35 years ago . Simply put , a must have .	1
This is probably the finest debut album of any group in the history of rock and roll . The Doors immediately established their own unique sound with this masterpiece . Paul McCartney and John Lennon both supposedly bought ten copies of this album , which by itself is an amazing statement . & quot ; Break on Through & quot ; and & quot ; Light My Fire & quot ; are both classics that endure to this day . Five of the eleven songs would reappear on the group 's greatest hits collection and three of the other songs , & quot ; Soul Kitchen , & quot ; & quot ; Back Door Man , & quot ; and & quot ; End of the Night , & quot ; would be more than good enough to make a lesser group 's greatest hits . & quot ; The End & quot ; is arguably the best song ever produced by the Doors , as it takes its listeners on an intense journey of love found and love lost . This album actually deserves four and a half stars . The only reason it gets docked half a star is because of three forgettable songs , & quot ; Twentieth Century Fox , & quot ; & quot ; I Looked at You , & quot ; and & quot ; Take it as it Comes. & quot ; Fortunately , the group was smart enough to place these songs between stronger entries instead of bunching them all together for an extended cluster of lackluster music . All of the other songs are at least good , if not great . As a result , this is easily the Doors ' best original album .	1
There was something in the water that year . Most of the music that endures without sounding dated is from 1966 , I think .	1
This album is pretty good . I 'm one of the younger Doors ' listeners that grew up with the brilliance of Nirvana beforehand . This shocked me though , I did n't think an older band could make such a great album . Pure pyschadelica ! It really takes you away to a beautiful place if you allow yourself to just kind of drift into it . `` Break On Through '' is pretty good and really rocks out but is a song that I get tired of after a while . `` Soul Kitchen '' has great synthesizer and is one that you can just slip into . Contrary to what some people may think , it 's not about sex . Its about Jim drifting and a nice lady let him spend the night at her house and he thanked her through the song Soul Kitchen . `` The Crystal Ship '' is a nice little ballad that is one of my favorites on this cd . I think it 's timeless.Well there you go . Get this cd and I also recommend Strange Days , Morrison Hotel , and In Concert . I havent gotten LA Woman yet so I 'll write a review on that one too sometime most likely .	1
Together with the first one , this second album of the Doors shows the band in it 's most wellknown period and sound . You can call it the basic Doors . When Morrison sings in Strange Days : ` we shall go on playing or find a new town ' , I always think of Paris were I 've seen his grave on P & egrave ; re La Chaise . The playing had stopped ; he found a new town were his playing stopped definitively ... ( When you 're on the graveyard his grave is n't hard to find . You just follow the marks other Doors-fans left to show you the way . ) Strange days is one of my favourite Doors-songs because of the way the strangeness of life in a great combination of music and lyrics is brought to us . Especialy when the song is played we have to agree : this certainly is the strangest life we 've ever known . The album has more moments with that nice touch of melancholic filosophy.There are some down to earth songs on the record too : You 're Lost Little Girl and Unhappy Girl are typical Doors-songs about love/women with a little twist . Love Me Two Times is a nice little blues with the small touch of male-ignorance a good blues should always have : ` one for tomorrow and one just for today ' . Moonlight Drive is maybe not as striking as some other Doors-material , but it has a very consequent metafore in it . ( Lesser Gods on the poetic stage tend to forget what metafore they using halfway their lyrics . ) As a not native speaker I liked to sing along with the ` going down'-part at the end of the song with a low voice , without thinking about what it meant . Well , let 's put it like this : when they 've managed to swim to the moon and climb to the sky , they have to come down again . Morrison was a decent man.Horse Latitudes is more poetry and free- ` jazz ' than rock . The contrast of down-to-earth ( blues ) material and the ` stranger ' music that is typical for all Doors-albums is very much present on this album . Horse Latitudes is placed between the two earlier mentioned blues songs.The almost simplesounding song People Are Strange has the same contrast . The music is very happy but when you take the lyrics seriously there 's nothing happy about this song . It 's wellknown : ` people are strange , when you 're a strangerfaces look ugly when you 're alonewomen seem wicked when you 're unwantedstreets are uneven when you 're down'You should compare the lyrics to L'America of the album L.A. Woman ( see my review ) . ` friendly strangers came to townall the people put them downbut the women love their wayscome again some other day'At least the women started to like the unwanted.The two lovesongs that follow have the same theme but they contradict eachother in a way . I 'm talking about My Eyes Have Seen You and I Ca n't See Your Face In My Mind . The lyrics are still allright considering the fact that they 're just two lovesongs.But then something happens . Manzarek digs deep inside his organ and there it is : When The Music 's Over . Another song of great theatrical suspence and terribly good lyrics . Songs like this had never been done before , exept by the Doors themselves in The End . The tension in this song reaches it 's highest point when the music dies out and we ` hear a very geantle sound ' ... 'we want the world and we want it ... 'Since I know songs like this exist , I 've been looking for them . There 's not much around . I found one band that can play the same trick on me as The Doors did when I was about 15 years old . There an instrumtal band tough . A jazzband from Scandinavia , called the Esbjorn Svensson Trio . See them live and find out what I mean . They 're coming to America soon . Great pianojazz with large themes and mystical enchanting rythms and compositions with heavy parts and still parts , freaky things and clean things , sweeping you off your feet .	1
The Doors second album , `` Strange Days , '' is an excellent follow-up to their self-titled debut , with several classic Doors tunes on it . Jim Morrison , Ray Manzarek , Robby Krieger and John Densmore totally shine on tracks like the spooky title song , the catchy blues-rock of `` Love Me Two Times '' and `` Moonlight Drive , '' the haunting `` You 're Lost Little Girl , '' the driving rock of `` My Eyes Have Seen You , '' and , of course , the 11-minute rock epic that is `` When The Music 's Over , '' with Jim and the boys really stretching out on their respective instruments with gusto . Only the poem `` Horse Latitudes , '' with Morrison shouting the words over jarring , chaotic noises , is a little hard to take . Thankfully , it 's only 1 1/2 minutes long . But other than that , `` Strange Days '' is a great , essential album in the Doors ' catalog .	1
This indisputable rock masterpiece includes that one song that exemplifies what I consider the true Doors sound : `` Strange Days . '' Sure , most of the songs in The Doors ' catalog are good , but not the same way the title track for this album is . Marked with an eerie pulsing quality , the melody and effects seem to emanate like concentric circles , with Morrison 's voice that of a demented ringmaster shouting down from the periphery of our consciousness . It 's a creative milestone . It is a sound I wish they had explored more often , but was to be actualized only rarely , and never really quite the same way . From later albums , `` Not to Touch the Earth '' and `` Waiting for the Sun '' come to mind as created from that same haunted cavern.Not of the same feel but still a particularly fine composition from STRANGE DAYS is `` I Ca n't See Your Face in My Mind , '' with its lyrical abstraction and tearfully cracked vocals , and ending with a lone note eventually tweaked and dropped into empty space . Along with `` Crystal Ship '' from the first album , this song stands among the most beautiful songs I 've ever heard.Thirty-five years later , the album stands the test of time . `` When the Music 's Over '' seems a bit bombastic , now feeling more experimental to me than it did originally . However this does n't detract from the album 's ranking among my all-time favorites . It is The Doors at the crux , which in hindsight turned out to be their peak . They never seemed to regain their focus or footing after this.___________________________________________	1
To me , this is a gorgeous work of dark romanticism , a beautiful black pool in moonlight . The acoustic textures of drum , guitar , keyboards and voice are completely in sync : all four are liquid , hazy and always slightly manic . The record creates a tremendously potent mood of sweet melancholy , of dream , of vaguely heartbroken yet nonetheless ecstatic love . As ineffably poignant as poetry ( and containing some rather good poetry ) , it is a strange and wondrous combination of love , hope , and violence that has become , probably irrevocably , part of my soul . I can not really imagine California without this record informing my visions . And what visions `` Strange Days '' evokes ! The voice of an arguing couple coming down from a lit window at night ... A lonely poet wandering the beaches of LA at high tide , beginning to dance ... Cars going everywhere and nowhere down the highways of California ... Rain falling on the pages of a copy of one of Freud 's works ... . Red wine in a glass ... something beautifully , unmistakably American , Californian , absolutely L.A. and nothing else , yet framing only all the most aesthetically perfect aspects of the culture , cutting out everything shallow and blunt ... doing nothing less than redeeming L.A. from the bleary eye of its drunken daylight.Amazing stuff .	1
Even though the 40 anniversary version does n't introduce many changes to the original version , you can notice some improvement in comparison to the original . Great album !	1
`` Strange Days '' continued the breakout of the Doors , back in the flowering of the 1960s music scene -- which is admittedly a great place to start . Their sophomore album showed no signs of a slump , polishing up the rough blues'n'rock of their first album , and continuing into weirder , more intense territory.It opens with the dark , hallucinatory beauty of `` Strange Days , '' with Jim Morrison 's rich voice singing distantly , `` Strange days have found us/Strange days have tracked us down/They 're going to destroy/Our casual joys ... '' His melancholy vocals are totally at odds with the energetic drums , keyboard and bouncy melody.It 's followed by the affectionate-sounding `` You 're Lost , Little Girl , '' and the deliciously stompy-bluesy `` Love Me Two Times . '' Having hooked listeners in , the Doors spill out a stream of bluesy rock'n'roll -- sometimes it 's dusty and raw , and sometimes it 's flavoured with keyboard . And at the end there 's a haunting pair of slow , atmospheric rockers -- the darkly enticing `` I Ca n't See Your Face in My Mind , '' and the sprawling electrobluesy `` When the Music 's Over . `` `` Strange Days '' does pretty much the same thing as the Doors ' first album -- a catchy intro , blues-rocky middle parts , and a haunting , long outro that lingers in your mind . The big difference is that in this album , their music is less striking , but it is more polished and experienced.That polish is especially present in the music -- Robby Krieger played some brilliantly flexible guitar , whether it was lean rock riffs or a funky little tune , and John Densmore was equally good with some quirky drums . Ray Manzarek flavoured the whole thing with marimba and colourful waves of keyboard . Most of the time this worked -- the only real exception is the dark , mildly frightening `` Horse Latitudes , '' which is a good experimental track , but it feels out of place.But Morrison gave the music that extra boost into genius . He had a rich , full voice that could flower into a croon , a murmur , or an impassioned howl . And his songwriting was pretty much poetry , full of strange imagery and passions ( `` The face in the mirror wo n't stop/The girl in the window wo n't drop/A feast of friends/Alive , she cried/Waiting for me outside ... '' ) .The Doors continued doing what they did best in `` Strange Days , '' a blend of blues and psychedelic rock'n'roll . Definitely a deserving classic .	1
This album is other worldly . I 've loved this album for a long time and once i tripped HARD while listening to it . It was pretty intense ( ..totally bro ... haha ... .ehem.. ) . Moonlight Drive seemed to last for half an hour and the entire room moved to the beat/rhythm of the music but i 'm sure most people do n't care about such things ... i digress . This is great psychedelic music ( drugs or no drugs ) and probably the weirdest Doors album .	1
Is there really a need to review this album ? Any album with Doors music on it is worth purchasing . But while I 'm at it , I 'll write a short review.Strange Days was , of course , the follow-up to The Doors ' stellar debut album . Slightly more poetic than its predecessor , Strange Days is no less genius . The album contains several hit singles ( Love Me Two Times , People Are Strange ) , but is most beautiful when percieved as a whole . Sit back and listen to The Doors as they change rock forever and influence millions .	1
The tone on the Doors second release is dark and haunting . Strange Days , Unhappy Girl , People Are Strange , all of them talk about the eerie side of life . Creative set to the color black . Moonlight Drive is the song that especially does it for me . The haunting lyrics , the slick slide guitar , and the atmospheric keyboards make it one of my all time favorite Doors songs . I like the Marimba effect on I Ca n't See Your Face In My Mind . I like the debut and LA Woman more but this release has a lot of merits as well including one awesome album cover !	1
These songs were a continuation of the dark themes from the debut album . There was more of an experimental and psychedelic feel replacing the live garage band sound on the previous record . One could sense that the stronger batch of songs were picked for the first album , and leftovers were used for this one . Despite that , there are still six gems that clock around or less than three minutes that are not played on the radio , ( tracks 1,2,4,6,8 , and 9 ) . Among those are mysterious ballads such as You 're Lost Little Girl , and rockers like My Eyes Have Seen You , of which Black Sabbath partially ripped off the riff in 1970 ( the song was N.I.B ) . The Top 40 Hits on the album include Strange Days ( # 12 ) , and Love Me Two Times ( # 25 ) . The remaining two tracks are perhaps the least accessible . Horse Latitudes , a demented albeit humorous poetry recital , is somewhat of a throwaway track , and When the Music 's Over , another rather pretentious yet successful mixture of poetry and music , in the mold of The End , including better variation in the instrumentation . After obtaining the first album , this is a good companion record , although it falls short of it 's predecessor in both length ( 35 minutes to the debut 's 44 ) , and overall quality , though the high points are among the band 's best work .	1
Being cognizant of his on-stage antics , when I used to listen to Jim Morrison singing `` People are Strange '' on the radio , back in the 1970s , I could n't help but think of an old put-down from my childhood : `` Takes one to know one ! `` But strange people can still make great music.Unlike most other reviewers here at Amazon , I do not consider `` Strange Days '' to be one of The Doors ' best albums ; however , it 's still pretty good . Even when The Doors were at their worst , they were still near the top of the Rock music heap.The songs from this album that got the most airplay were `` Love Me Two Times '' and `` People are Strange . '' But , while `` Love Me Two Times '' is certainly one of The Doors ' best , `` People are Strange '' is a rather odd tune and , in the opinion of this reviewer , one of the weaker tracks on this CD.In addition to `` Love Me Two Times , '' `` You 're Lost Little Girl '' and `` When the Music 's Over '' are the most outstanding compositions on `` Strange Days . `` Some of the music on this CD is pure psychedelic . If you did n't know it was The Doors , you might think it was Iron Butterfly or the Electric Prunes.Getting back to the strangeness issue , in conclusion I would add that Mr. Morrison was certainly on the beam compared to those of his fans who think that he is still alive and living on an Island off the coast of Africa somewhere . Yeah ... Maybe he 's there with Elvis and JFK ... .	1
New 45RPM 2 LP 200gram vinyl edition from original master tapes sounds far better than any previous version including the original 1968 Electra pressing ! Sell your old versions and buy this one because it is the last you will ever need to own . I 've tested it against the recent Rhino , ( awful ) , Mobile Fidelity , ( 1980 's pressing ) , and the fantastic DCC LP pressing from the 1990 's . This one beats them all in terms of detail , dynamics , bass , Etc ... .	1
I 've yet to hear a Doors album I did n't like . That said , I enjoy & quot ; Strange Days & quot ; above any other Doors work , including the multiple & quot ; Best Of & quot ; compilations that have been released throughout the years.This is one of those rare works where both the music and the lyrics stay powerful from the first track to the last . We hear several wonderful pieces familiar to the casual Doors listener like & quot ; Love Me Two Times , & quot ; and & quot ; Moonlight Drive. & quot ; But the rest of the album is n't just filler . This is one tight and clear selection of tunes that all had potential to be hits . & quot ; Horse Latitudes & quot ; is a brief but chilling narration by Jim Morrison , and & quot ; My Eyes Have Seen You & quot ; is -- in my opinion -- the most overlooked songs in the Doors repetoire . This song has a surreal flowing beat and dreamy lyrics that gives that personifies that psychedelic flavor that The Doors are known for.Many feel the songs on & quot ; Strange Days & quot ; are some of The Doors ' darkest imagery . I can understand why they feel that way ; but there is such a gentle flow to the music that I actually find soothing , with & quot ; Horse Latitudes & quot ; being the only pure haunting Guajardian piece on the album . This album is surreal in parts and sweet in others . This CD is one of the most complete albums I have ever heard .	1
I was upset by the one-star review that was given to this great album by a reviewer who states that he has never heard it . Every Doors fan needs to hear this . The bonus tracks are great , too .	1
It seems like most people believe that either the first Doors album or LA Woman is their best . While both of those are great , I have to go with Strange Days as my favorite . I think it 's more consistent and while it does n't have any song as great as Light My Fire or LA Woman , it does n't have any filler like Alabama Song or Been Down So Long either.Again , all three are terrific , I just believe Strange Days is a little more consistent from beginning to end .	1
I have always loved and related to this album . Played non stop in my youth.A lot of SACD 's are a crap shoot as far as production vs cost goes . This remaster , multi channel is as good as I have heard . The balance and temper through a 5.1 system is an absolute must buy . It rates equal with sound production of Pink Floyds SACD and Dire Straits which are bench mark SACD's. $ 40.00 for a CD is costly but if you have the equipment you will never regret it . My equipment that I listened was via a McIntosh SACD player , receiver , and amplifier , Klipsch sub , B & W ; bookshelf fronts and in ceiling rears .	1
This release is worth the money-if you have a SACD player . I closed my eyes and listened and I seemed to be in a small room listening to a live band , The sound was open and clean . The surround mix was amazing even startling at times . This and the first album are my two most favorite Doors releases . I also listened to it on my computer speakers ( Logitech THX 2.1 Channel ) and the sound in stereo was excellent , also . I find myself wishing I could play the multichannel in my car as well-maybe someday if SACD goes mainstream . I also bought the first album , Morrison Hotel and LA Woman over a 2-3 week period . I tried `` The Doors '' first and that convinced me to get this one -and my wife-after listening to the first two , wanted Morrison Hotel , after which I went for LA Woman . I am not disappointed with any of them .	1
The Doors broke new ground once again , this time releasing a collection of songs some may feel is uneven ; but this one pays great dividends the more you listen to it ; myself I only half-listened for years , but just recently , finally put forth the effort . Though initially not all the tunes seemed melodically accessible - after I invested a bit more time and sensibility , the dividends started to accrue in a dramatically meaningful fashion.The way the engineer manages to allow all the instruments and the vocals to be heard and still maintain the Doors ' signature murky sound is amazing . But it would be nothing if the musicians did n't allow every part/moment to dovetail together . Robby Krieger brilliantly re-invents the guitar ( tonally , melodically , and harmonically ) on every song , as well as on every instrumental break of `` When the Music 's Over '' , the long song/poem which closes out album . Ray Manzarek counters with mostly organ , but at times barroom piano or harpsichord . From him , also , you do n't hear the same kinds of riffs or the same sound palette from song to song . And at times , each will be heard overdubbing a part with a different tonal setting , melody and rhythm , panned to the opposite side of the stereo field . So you 'll have two organs , or else two guitars riffing off of each other , while Morrison 's vocal pleads/saddens/exults/growls/hovers/screams somewhere in between.On the cover is a blue-tinted photograph of all these animated circus performers ( somewhat reminiscent of Picasso 's more quiescent painting of the `` Family of Saltimbaques '' from his Rose Period - the record is indeed the quintessential dark metaphysical/emotional/visceral circus . 'Sergeant Pepper ' and 'The United States of America ' may have started the carnival ball rolling . . . 'Strange Days ' and [ Procol Harum 's ] 'Shine On Brightly ' rolled the big sonic circus ball underground , undersea , into heaven and hell and all points between . [ The song ] `` Strange Days '' is the perfect beginning for what 's to come [ like a giant violet-and-gold-hued moth emerging from its chrysalis in the dead of night ] . Ray Manzarek switches drawbars on his Hammond B-3 organ every four beats of the repeating ostinado introduction , creating a luscious viscerally appealing four-bar lead in . The three instrumentalists working in tandem generate an unbelievably inventive melodic/harmonic sound space . Morrison , when he reprises a verse does it differently each time , with intensely emoted melodic inversions , submersions , etc . His voice is fed through an electronic delay box ( emerging ~ beat late ) and through some sort of weird combo algorithm of distortion/reverb/tremelo , then panned slightly left of his real vocal sound , the whole which further augments the already disjointed , mysterious atmosphere . The bassist has the main melody during instrumental breaks - the organ plays chord changes over his expressive ( almost meandering ) ostinado pattern . Even the drums are melodically impressionistic , in addition to providing the usual function of sonic timekeeping.Every song has something very different to say , both musically and lyrically . And the message , the poetry is , to my mind , moving and profound . Listen to the meaning of the words with your heart - your mind and possibly your life will never be the same . When Jim is singing about something that enrages him , the emotion is obvious ; and when he sings about something that is sad or saddening to him , you hear the empathy in his voice . This is no detached , lightweight ego-tripper . The Doors are totally involved , totally committed to their muse ( s ) , and it implodes/explodes/seeps into you with every beat and every phrase . `` We want the world . . . and we want it . . . NOW ! ! ! ! ! `` ...	1
But NO ONE did Halloween like the Doors ! This album makes `` eerie '' into an art form , with strategic use of echo effects throughout . This is easily my favorite Doors album , with great , Rimbaud , William Blake-type lyrics decrying the sinfulness of society , the recalcitrance of feckless young women and pollution , among other things.One of my very personal favorties on the album , `` My Eyes Have Seen You '' , could easily be called the `` obsessive mania song '' for its intensity and powerfully insistent arrangement . `` Horse Latitudes '' has oodles of Freudian imagery and puts you in mind of Moses or God Himself screaming from the top of Mt . Sinai . If madness had any patron saints , they were the Doors ! The eerie aesthetic carries on even to the romantic ballads on the album , like `` Love Me Two Times '' , `` You 're Lost Little Girl '' , and `` I Ca n't See Your Face in My Mind '' . The epic piece on the album , `` When The Music 's Over '' , is much more accessable and less terrifying than `` The End '' from the previous album , and is actually largely a polemic advocating the advancement of the youth movement of the time and eco-consciousness . The title tune is the moralist of the group , decrying rampant sin , while advocating `` playing '' or `` finding a new town '' , a dichotomy to be sure.Considering how soon this came out after its predecessor , the first Doors album , it was obvious that the group had done a LOT of writing , practicing and refining of their sound , since this is STILL the best thing the Doors ever put out , and it was only their second album ! By this time , they were already legends , and this album certainly cemented it ! Alas , we lost Jim Morrison in the early seventies , due to his both `` playing '' AND `` finding a new town '' , namely Paris , France , where he died of a heroin overdose , a la Jean Paul Marat , in his bathtub . At least he had found his `` Lost Little Girl '' ... ..	1
This cd is the best group of songs that the Doors ever produced . As compared to the echoey distance and relatively unadorned production of the first album , this one reaches new heights in terms of sound and experimentation . Morrison 's voice has developed into a rich and vibrant instrument that is equally at home on the bluesy & quot ; Love Me Two Times & quot ; to the acid jazzy of & quot ; Moonlight Drive & quot ; . All the songs on this cd are standouts . It almost plays like a concept album . This album is full of isolation and dissatisfaction with American culture and all the materialism that comes along with it . The songs seem to follow a couple striving to find something , to & quot ; break on through & quot ; and find some spiritual grace . & quot ; You 're Lost Little Girl & quot ; and & quot ; Unhappy Girl & quot ; both touch on the topic of women empowering themselves as Morrison and Kreiger try to encourage them to & quot ; melt your cell today & quot ; and & quot ; saw through all your bars & quot ; . & quot ; Moonlight Drive & quot ; , & quot ; My Eyes Have Seen You & quot ; , and & quot ; I Ca n't See Your Face In My Mind & quot ; all play as post-modern love songs . Morrison especially shines vocally on & quot ; My Eyes ... & quot ; . And then we have the apocalyptic songs of death and paranoia in & quot ; Strange Days & quot ; , the spoken and screamed & quot ; Horse Latitudes & quot ; , and & quot ; When the Music 's Over & quot ; . & quot ; The Music 's Over & quot ; is this cds compliment to & quot ; The End & quot ; from the first Doors cd . This song is even more desperate with the ending consisting of screams to Jesus to & quot ; save us ! & quot ; . You get the sense that Jim is screaming for anyone , anything to save us and him from destruction . This is the highpoint of the Doors , and along with the first cd , ranks as one of the greatest cds in rock history or music history , period .	1
I bought this when it came out , way back in 1967 . I thought it their best , and that afterward they steadily declined with pop stuff like `` Hello I Love You '' , etc . The album cover is interesting , and fits the `` Strangeness '' which seems to be the theme for this , their 2nd album . So `` Strange Days '' with its eerie organ , and `` People are Strange '' , with its beer hall style piano , are perhaps the two best songs here , and still hold up . `` My Eyes Have Seen You '' , a guitar and vocal near-virtuoso performance not bad either . `` You 're Lost ... '' quite a nice ballad ; `` Horse Latitudes '' , which is hard to listen to straight through , is apparently a Morrison shout-fest about , well maybe that 's anyone 's guess . `` Ca n't see your Face '' , a trippy ballad not unlike my favorite Doors ballad `` Crystal Ship '' on their 1st album . `` When the Music 's Over '' another very long apocalyptic downer , the sibling of `` The End '' from the 1st album . The rest passable at best . Perhaps , with a little education and life experience , self-proclaimed weird and trippy songs like some by the Doors loose their appeal . But I still give it a very good rating ( 4-stars ) , since like many of the Doors 's records , the sound , effects , lyrics , et al are unique to this band , and hold up fairly well after so many years ( 45- a long time ! ) ; not to mention the 5 songs noted which are way above the average pop songs of that or any era !	1
The strangeness of this album is indicated not merely by the title , but also by the obscure photography source . 'Alabama Song ' , from the first album , is a compostion by a strange musician from early century Germany named Kurt Weill , and was originally sung by his wife , the gritty songstress Lotte Lenya.This street on the cover , is where Weill and Lenya were prominently photographed.The Doors were obviously quite taken by this unusual looking place.The characters spookily and humourously gracing this street here on `` Strange Days '' , further enhance the European sentiments of this album.The Doors are of course , an American rock group.But the underlaying mood is here is most definitely not of Americam typicality.The cynicism of the Berlin cabaret scene , of which 'Alabama Song ' is an infamous part , runs steadily through almost every song on `` Strange Days '' .A cynicism , which is in contrast to the slick pizazz of the Broadway cabaret culture of the Doors ' countrymen.The man with the fingers ( Manzarek ) must have dislodged the sound mechanism from some showground carousel to produce his contribution.It 's a very different treatment to the upfront , clear and unreverbed sound of the first album 's organ.This pretty musicality though , is set-off by excedingly dark lyrics , sung with the utmost gloom.The slide guitaring by Krieger sums up this contradictory sentiment with perfection.I often do n't know whether to smile or to fear.Add to this Densmore 's odd-ball choice of rhythms , and suddenly the carousel organ does n't seem so pretty anymore.With the Doors , it 's never really darkness by obvious means.They incorporate niceties , then display the perverted relationships that can exist with such things . 'Strange Days ' , organly chord-grinds its album name-sake onto the scene , true to its word . 'You 're Lost Little Girl ' , with an easily detectable bass-line , recieves delicate treatment from Krieger 's guitar and Morrison 's voice.I find this album 's ballads to contain his career 's most pleasant singing . 'Love Me Two Times ' is perhaps the only track which steps outside of this album 's induction of emotional confusion.I 've always loved the song 's well-executed rhythmic interuptions.Ray 'the Man ' zarek , swirls throughout 'Unhappy Girl ' like a Dutch organ-grinder with tulips painted on every of the instruments panels.And Krieger has no shame in bending the same note at the end of nearly every single phrase of the song.Semi-playfully , yet eerily aswell.Next onboard , are broken pianos rollocking on a pirate 's ship.A woman ghost , ( maybe named Mary Celeste ? ) wearing a white laced dress flayling in the wind , and shipmates are screaming as the ship goes down , beneath the psychotic waves.Pain.This is 'Horse Latitudes ' . ( Actually a sea-fearing expression , perhaps likening the sea 's power to that of a horse ) .It ca n't possibly mean anything.It 's merely a dream.No melody to be found , it is a poetry reading atop sound tapestry . 'Moonlight Drive ' is quite American , but hangs onto the album 's vague experimental theme due to excessive guitar-neck slithery , like a hyper-active child insisting on expressing every impulse simultaneously . 'People Are Strange ' , has arguably Morrison 's best , most coherent lyrics.They 're even cited in psychology text-books to describe inner symptoms of the global illness which is depression.City life lends itself to feelings of isolation.People are too rushed and enslaved to afford reassuring glances with each other as they 're passing by.So , it 's easy to feel alone and uncared for . 'People Are Strange ' is the soundtrack I have playing in my head in such circumstances , just as those confidently strutting down the city street would have 'Stayin Alive ' by the Bee Gees as their soundtrack . ( Cheesy , I know.But lets face it ... if you 're STRUTTING , you 're already in a cheesy mood anyway ) . 'My Eyes Have Seen You ' rocks itself into the perimeter of passible normalcy.But , bizarre traces just adhere it to this albums rule ; The days must remain strange . 'I Ca n't See Your Face In My Mind ' introduces a marimba ( Central American ) with slightly Japanese inclinations.A soft brushing keeps rhythm with this gentille , musical snail . 'When The Music 's Over ' retains the first album 's screatchy organ , and the ocean-deep bass-line is well worthy of the song 's extenuous length.Its primal creepiness , drags the album home ... clawing and screaming !	1
Doors part two . I 've reveiwed all the studio albums this morning and I saved this one for last because , well , it 's the most thought provoking of the bunch.My title should say it all . This is way darker than the first album and darker than any of the rest . It rocks and is definatley somewhere in my top 25 albums . ( My top fives got DOORS ONE , top tens got LA WOMAN and top 15 got MORRISON HOTEL . ) I could write a thousand pages on this and probably deep anylyze the hell out of every song but I wo n't . None of us got the time for that BUT like all other DOORS this is a must have .	1
The band 's first album remains , in my eyes , the best - the songwriting and production are top-notch , and although the lyrics are typically oblique ( & quot ; You get the diplomatic treatment/You get the force-fed future & quot ; ) , the songs are performed and sung with such skill that you tend not to notice . An excellent combination of various styles - post-punk , new wave , power pop - it says a lot that both classic rock radio and alternative radio lay claim to the Cars . My favorites are & quot ; Bye Bye Love & quot ; , & quot ; Just What I Needed & quot ; and & quot ; All Mixed Up & quot ; , but even songs I did n't particularly like ( & quot ; I 'm in Touch With Your World & quot ; ) have grown on me . An excellent recording for any pop or rock fan .	1
While Van Halen were redefining metal with their debut album in 1978 , The Cars did something even more improbable the same year -- they invented a new kind of rock : `` new wave '' . This weird album could have stiffed at the cash register , but for some reason it took off . Five nerds from Boston reinvented pop music , and people dug it ? So why did it work ? You can choose melody or lyrics , and either way you win . Upbeat tunes , catchy arrangement , and instrumentation that we now take for granted ( choppy guitars and synths ) added up to hummable music . No matter that the lyrics were often dark , cynical and depressed . That just added to things . ( When the local metal cover band is bellowing `` let 's party ! `` , the Cars sophisticated world view seemed more appealing , especially if you were as big a nerd as the band seemed to be . Of course , Ocasek ruined that by marrying a super-model , but no matter . ) Together , the hiccuping guitars and yearning vocals added up to a musical tension-and-release that perfectly mirrored the bedroom fantasies of the nerds who were listening . The Buzzcocks were more obviously about that connection , but the Cars were better . One of the greatest rock albums of all time . Five stars .	1
For the most part , The Cars were a singles band , but their debut stands as one of the best ever new wave albums . The hit songs were solid , including the amazing threesome , & quot ; Let the Good Times Roll , & quot ; & quot ; My Best Friend 's Girl & quot ; and & quot ; Just What I Needed & quot ; that kick off the album . But side two is were The Cars demonstrate their artistic complexity , particularly on the lengthy double track & quot ; Moving in Stereo/All Mixed Up. & quot ; & quot ; You 're All I 've Got Tonight & quot ; and & quot ; Bye Bye Love & quot ; make for another couple of great singles as well . This album is so good , it could stand as a greatest hits package all on its own .	1
Back in the late 70 's and early 80 's , when musical technology made its biggest breakthrough since multi-track recording , some bands combined synthesizers with guitars , only to make them sound pretentious or out-of-place while others favored one instrument to the near-exclusion of the other . The Cars broke through by mixing guitar with synthesizers to produce a remarkably rare synergy . The result was danceable and appealed to both rockers and new wave fans . The band is fronted by two first-rate lead vocalists , Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr . Ocasek , a quirky-looking scarecrow of a man with voice to match , provides an almost cartoonish foil to the earnest , understated Orr . The cutting-edge keyboards and deceptively skillful guitar work are driven by thunderous drums and background vocals that sound somehow like thirty people crowded around a microphone in a room much too small to hold them . The result is music that entertains , breaks new ground and fills my memories of college . This debut album shows the Cars at their most down-to-earth and raw , before drum machines and Fairlight synthesizers gave them much more `` corporate '' kind of sound .	1
got the disc at good price . good tunes . if you are into the Cars , this is probably one their better records	1
The music magazine Q recently compiled a list of the 100 best debut albums ever . The Car 's debut was NOT on that list . It was , however , on the Top 10 Debuts We Love To Hate list . From my standpoint , they were in good company among artist such as Queen , Dire Straits and Boston . Being a British magazine , Q may have simply missed the influence this album generated since it was n't that big in the UK ( # 29 ) . My Best Friend 's Girl ( # 3 ) became a major hit but in great part due to the single being among the first singles ( if not the very first ) released as a picture disc ( shaped like a car ) . Just What I Needed ( # 17 ) barely crawled into the top 20 and that was practically it for the Cars until they stroke gold internationally with songs from their Heartbeat City album.In the States this album would hardly be treated similar compilations . My Best Friend 's Girl ( # 27 ) , Just What I Needed ( # 35 ) & Good Times Roll ( # 41 ) became radio staples and really much more popular than their Billboard top 100 rankings indicate . During its release it was still common on late night radio shows to play whole sides . The three songs already being hits on side A , side B became a popular choice for such occasions . The album did n't set the charts on fire , barely sneaking in the top 20 ( # 18 ) . With continuous airplay of many of the album 's tracks sales were consistent , which in the States matters much more than in most other territories . It wound up being among the top 30 sellers of the decade , selling 6 million copies , an incredible achievement for an album not even close to cracking the top 10 . The Cars , both band and album , thus became huge in the States.There are a few things special about this album . At the time of its release , 1978 , its producer , Roy Thomas Baker , was in huge demand , mainly due to his work with Queen . With Queen , the production was full of sound effects and bombastic vocalizations ( Bohemian Rhapsody is a prime example ) . The production on The Cars is , however , sparse on most of the album ( the intros of My Best Friend 's Girl and Just What I Needed are especially good examples ) . This made the use of synthesiser more prominent in a sense . The texts were filled with Ric Ocasek 's irony which he delivered in a dead panned way ; along with the late Benjamin Orr 's more emotional approach in singing . In between this sparse production came forceful harmonies , e.g . on You 're All I 've Got Tonight and Good Times Roll . Combined , this gave the Cars a punkish feel , what today would be labelled as post-punk rock . This sounded very fresh from the typical rock sound which at that point dominated the airwaves as some kind of alternative to balance the popularity of disco.Actually , it is remarkable how fresh the music still sounds today , more than 25 years after its release . Many groups today are basically doing similar things but now it is viewed as being retro . There is , however , one major drawback on buying this CD ( meaning 4 instead of 5 stars ) . The sound quality is below par , which becomes more evident listening to their Just What I Needed Anthology . Despite being 10 years old , the re-mastering job on that release draws forth the sloppy transfer to CD . The sound is very low although not being muddled as many other badly transferred records . This album really could use some re-mastering ( there is one available , a deluxe version from 1990 with an extra demo disc ; there have , however , been many albums re-mastered originally released later with clearly audible results so that version does not cut it in my books ) . Given the sonic achievements that have been done with old Queen releases ( the recent 30th anniversary edition of A Night at the Opera could have been recorded yesterday ) , this album should have tremendous potential in being a major re-release . Not only would a re-mastering job be welcome but a hybrid SACD version would have the potential of making these classics fresher than ever.Ric , are you reading this ? !	1
All tracks are perfect ! Great music . This is a must album with such iconic hits . Seems like they never get old .	1
i grew up with this album . 20 years later and i cant believe how it holds up , i could listen to it everyday .	1
Wow ! What a pleasant surprise it was to get this CD and take it for a spin ( no pun intended ) . This is a classic and loved album as can been seen from the other reviews on this page . Five stars all the way.What does come as a surprise is how GOOD this CD sounds ! Yes , it 's HDCD . And yes , it will knock your socks off with it 's pure tonal quality . Bass is tight , drums are full of dynamic range , guitars 'jangle '' as they should , and the keyboards are clean and crisp . There is no harshness here and acceptable use of compression still leaves room for the music to breathe.There 's no mention of this disc being remastered on the sleeve . For a first edition CD pressing , this is a true gem . I ca n't imagine how the ( now discontinued ) MOFI Gold version of this album could sound any better.These days you never know how your favorite music is going to sound on CD . A poor digital mastering job can sap the life right out of any recording . Not in this case . The Cars debut is excellent both musically and sonically . Buy with confidence .	1
This is so real toe tapping music . Another on for the road trips . Like it loud ! That 's about all I have .	1
I have loved this & # 34 ; album & # 34 ; for many years . It just does n't seem to get old even after such a long time . I really do own the LP and now the CD . Good stuff .	1
I own all the Cars ' releases save for Heartbeat City , but if I could only own one , this would be it without question . This album is one of the best of its time and genre . A great listen all the way through .	1
I got the HDCD version . I do not believe that it is the original CD mastering . I was very unhappy with the newest remastered version which I had gotten through iTunes . A wave analysis on Audacity shows the iTunes mastering in the red all over the place.That said , I took a gamble on this version after doing some reviews on the Steve Hoffman forums , and while many folks recommend the vinyl or DCC CD if you want the best sound quality , this HDCD version is great sound quality and very listenable , did not see any clipping going on.Amazon was also very quick with the shipping . Got it a few days ahead of time . Now if only third-party retailers would get their stuff together and get me the items I ordered last Wednesday night which are not expected until Friday , June 27 .	1
Learning to drive was one of the most liberating experiences I have had . It just changed the rules of the game . I went from being a kid who had to be shuttled around to a more active participant in the world at large . I not only had a new lease on life but also new responsibilities ( a 1990 Honda Civic to take care of - my parents ' old car that became mine around 1995 or so ) that felt adult-like . I think I grew a lot overall from the experience and now , many years later , ca n't imagine what life would be like if I could n't get behind the wheel.I 've always associated driving with liberation and excitement , and to this day it 's my best place to think . I have logged a lot of miles on several vehicles over the years and ( wait , I 'm reviewing something are n't I ? ) can think of no better soundtrack for this experience than the first Cars album.This album was released the year after I was born , so I certainly did n't `` grow up with it '' through my formative ( read : teenage ) years like some of the other reviewers here . However I 've always felt a certain kinship with this little classic , as if it 's something that I should ( in italics ) have grown up with . Perhaps that 's because , for all of its virtues , a lot of the music that came about in `` my '' era was n't particularly fun and catchy . Driving to Nirvana or Soundgarden is ( IMHO ) a soup-sandwich unless you 're really angry and/or depressed . The closest corollary is Teenage Fanclub ( another band that has created some of my favorite driving music ) , Fountains Of Wayne ( of course ) and Canadian band Sloan.The Cars ' first disc is the driving album that every generation ought to have , full of good poppy rockin fun with an ever-so-slightly-twisted perspective ( arched eyebrows at the ready ) that allows you to still feel smart while singing along . I could n't ask for more . However , absent any discoveries yet to be made , I do n't believe there is such a thing for Gen-X and beyond . In the meantime , give this a spin the next time you head out on the road and try to picture that rush of liberation that you may have experienced when you first got behind the wheel unsupervised . It 's a nice feeling .	1
Ocasek 's sublime and obscure poetry combined with Easton 's right-brained axe make this first-wave collection required listening . While we 're all familiar with Good Times Roll , My Best Friend 's Girl and Just What I Needed , side two segues are proportional to & quot ; Abbey Road & quot ; or & quot ; What 's Going On & quot ; by Marvin Gaye .	1
THE CARS ( 1978 ) is the The Cars ' greatest work ever . Sure , '80 's Top 40 pop enthusiasts would probably say that about HEARTBEAT CITY ( which did sell more records upon release ) , but real rock fans rate their debut at the top . Why ? Because , just like most great rock debuts ( such as BOSTON and VAN HALEN ) , it shows The Cars in hungry mode , pulling out all the stops to create a hard , edgy , and energetic record that was different from anything else out at the time . This band combined hard guitar-rock with a spacey keyboard-driven New Wave sound ( that only then was beginning to emerge ) in equal amounts , with straightforward , simple lyrics -- and created a sound that was raw yet sleek , edgy but commercially accessible , and totally fresh at that time . Between Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr 's similarly cool , unaffected lead vocals , Greg Hawkes ' incredibly cool , futuristic keyboards , and Elliot Easton 's slicing , awesome guitar-work , this album was truly unique . It influenced countless other New Wave/rock bands afterwards . It has since stood the test of time , and that 's what makes it a true classic.When I first heard THE CARS on a cassette tape 22 years ago , I was already quite familiar with & quot ; Just What I Needed. & quot ; Then , I really got hooked on & quot ; Good Times Roll & quot ; and & quot ; Best Friend 's Girl. & quot ; It was n't until 1982 that I really started liking & quot ; You 're All I 've Got Tonight & quot ; and & quot ; Bye Bye Love. & quot ; The following year , I got into & quot ; I 'm In Touch With Your World. & quot ; But it has only been in the past couple of years that I have totally fallen for the medley of & quot ; Moving In Stereo/All Mixed Up. & quot ; Talk about a true classic ; over the years , every now and then , it 's given me something new to love about it ! MOST RECOMMENDED	1
This album is clearly their best . THE CARS has a wonderful flow to it . The songs work quite well together . While you ca n't deny the big hits from side one , my favorites are Bye Bye Love and All Mixed Up , both sung by bassist Benjamin Orr on side two . Ric Ocasek always seemed to be identified as the `` singer '' in the group . Personally , I prefer Orr 's strained sense of urgency to Ocasek 's quirkiness , but both voices serve well on this release . If you 're getting acquainted to the cars for the first time , buy the GREATEST HITS package if you must , but do n't ignore this rock classic . They had a space age sound ( keyboardist Greg Hawkes was so important to this band 's sound ) that really ushered in the New Wave sound of the early eighties .	1
Every track on this album is a classic . Almost all of them are in rotation on classic rock stations . Even so the songs do n't seem worn out or dated . Ric Ocasek had a genuine ear for pop , which he melded with the bands New Wave sensibilities in order to create a classic album .	1
After years of listenting to metal/rock/pop/ ... rock , I heard this album ... and the world turned on it 's head for a moment ( for me , of course ) ... my first intro to something other than 'Free Burd ' , and although it took some getting used to , this still remains on my list as one of the best new-wave/rock classic albums of all time . The 'best of ' they did covers the hits , but this CD , from start to finish , is a work of new-wave art - rarely matched by their contemporaries ( except maybe the 1st Pretenders album ... ) .They ( The Cars ) brought cynicism to a new level , without being obsessed with anger/etc . This CD has an underlying power to it that is unmatched by others - one that will remain as a CD that listened today ( 20 years on ) for a reason beyond their sheer popularity .	1
If you love this album as much as I still do , pony up the extra couple of bucks and be prepared to be wowed , loud . Go for the double disc deluxe set , which sports a great remaster . `` The Cars '' was a classic debut and one of the first bands with a new wave association to actually make it big . Their blend of irony laden Roxy/Bowie pop and AM radio hooks made `` My Best Friend 's Girl '' and `` Just What I Needed '' sound like Top 40 classics from play one , and the rest of the album skirted experimental stuff like `` Moving In Stereo '' with the classic nervy album rock ready sounds of `` Good Times Roll . '' Roy Thomas Baker 's spare production is gave the band a sharper focus , and made the songs leap from the speakers with a fresh sound.The band 's arsenal was well loaded . Greg Hawkes brought keyboards to the front of the band , as well as his sax work . Elliot Easton made his choppy guitar work as fluid as it was jittery , and Ben Orr and Ric Ocasek switched vocals just enough that , while there was variety , it was seamless . True originals , The Cars were often aped but never replicated ( as opposed to the dozens of Joe Jackson/Elvis Costello copycats ) and it makes this debut sound great almost 25 years after it was released .	1
Not sure why it is not listed as such but wanted to confirm that this $ 6.99 Elektra release is HDCD Remastered and sounds fantastic . Panorama and Candy-O also received the same quality HDCD remaster and sound great as well . Unfortunately the Elektra $ 6.99 Shake It Up and Heartbeat City releases did not receive this remastering and the difference shows , especially on SIU .	1
I am very excited for acquired one copy of this rare version of this epic album . all songs are great , special mention to Just what I needed , Bye bye love , My best friend 's Girl and You 're all I 've got tonight ! !	1
The Cars formed in Boston circa 1976 and debuted in 1978 with this eponymously titled release . Straddling the line between rock and new wave , the group managed to maintain rock credibility while also racking up some major pop hits . `` Just What I Needed '' peaked at # 27 and has become a rock radio staple . The single is my favorite song of all time - it so perfectly encapsulates the late 70s new wave scene . And it 's catchy as hell - I have to turn up the radio whenever I hear it.The second single , `` My Best Friend 's Girl , '' went to # 35 ; the song starts with handclaps before a major synth line kicks into gear . Finally , `` Good Times Roll '' just missed the Top 40 , peaking at # 41 . However , not a single track is filler - any of them could have been a hit.I was a little too young in 1978 to become a Cars fan , although I caught them in their pop heyday , when `` Drive '' was a major hit . I 've picked up the rest of their catalog in the last few years , and I 've been blown away by the quality of their music , especially `` The Cars . '' Propulsive synths combine seamlessly with the rock-edged guitars to form one of the most distinctive sounds ever . This CD really demonstrates why the Cars became stars - it still sounds completely amazing . `` The Cars '' sold very well when first released and was certified platinum in late 1978 . Since then , the CD has continued to win fans - with certification for sales of 6 million by 1995 . Every time I hear The Killers or other current retro new wave bands , I want to throw on this CD and hear how it was done right the first time around ! Most highly recommended .	1
I really like the sound of the remastered CD . The dynamics are much better than with the compression in the old mastering . the sound is overall cleaner with less noise . BUT , I think more important for most Doors fans are the bonus tracks.First , I love them because the are so raw . Second because they give some insight into the process of The Doors recording sessions . Third because the takes themselves , while imperfect , are very interesting and different ! Good version of this recording !	1
& quot ; LA Woman & quot ; is my favourite Doors album and it is EXCELLENT . Jims lyrics are , as always , mystical , potent and self reflective . The often over looked talents of Robbie Kriegers guitar and Ray Manzericks keyboard mastery , along with the solid backing of John Densmore on drums jam pack this album with classic Doors greats.It starts with & quot ; The Changeling & quot ; , an excellent opening song of Jims energised voice as he sings & quot ; I 'm a changeling , see me change ... & quot ; & quot ; Love Her Madly & quot ; is a teriffic and catchy rock tune , showing Rays panache on the keyboard and the bands awesome combined sound . & quot ; Been Down So Long & quot ; is a great , grindy , gruff song , with a typical bluesy feel . & quot ; Cars Hiss By My Window & quot ; is close to my favourite track on the CD ( if it were n't for & quot ; LA Woman & quot ; ) , as we see another simple bluesy song , with dynamite lyrics and Jims growling , instrumentesque voice at the end taking the song out . This leads on to my favourite track , not only of the CD , but of all Doors songs , & quot ; LA Woman & quot ; where Jim compares LA to a woman . The whole song is brilliant , with Krieger shining in his awesome guitar opening twang that sets the song running and in his solo display . All band members in this song play an intergral part of making this song the classic it is , as & quot ; Mr Mojo Rising & quot ; settles down the songs frantic pace and then brings up again ; a rock classic ! & quot ; L'America & quot ; is a spooky sounding song and the most unusual on the album , but it fits , as do all the songs in the order they play . It is like a halfway point in the energy of the album . & quot ; Hyacinth House & quot ; is another favourite , where the band sounds awesome playing the melody together and feeding of Jims deep toned , bluesy lyrics as he sings & quot ; ..why did you throw the jack of hearts away ? It was the only card in the deck that I had left to play.. & quot ; This song shows the diverse talents of all band members and how well they sounded when they were gelling . & quot ; Cawling King Snake & quot ; and & quot ; The Wasp ( Texas Radio And The Big Beat ) & quot ; are also great tracks that continue the blues influence evident throughout the album . It is only fitting that the album finishes with the legendary & quot ; Riders On The Storm & quot ; as Ray magically invites you in amidst the sample of rainfall and thunder as Jim croons the ever famous lyrics ; an unforgetable song ! This album as a whole is masterful and produced brilliantly , evident by the changing of the sound of Jims voice on the tracks and his sampled voice in the background . It is a fitting finale to one of the greatest and most infamous bands of all time . The & quot ; Lizard King & quot ; ended on a high . A must have album !	1
THIS WAS A CD THAT WAS WAY AHEAD OF IT ` S TIME.THIS HAS SOME OF THE BEST SONGS BY THE DOORS ON IT.L.A . WOMAN , ONE OF MY FAVORITE DOORS SONGS IS ALMOST AN 8 MINUTE RIDE.RIDERS ON THE STORM IS ANOTHER CLASSIC FROM THIS GREAT CD.THIS IS PROBABLY THE DOORS 3RD BEST CD BEHIND ONLY MORRISON HOTEL AND THE FIRST CD.I THINK THIS CD ROCKS MORE THAN MOST OF THE DOORS CD ` S.THIS IS A MOST HAVE FOR ANY FAN OF 60 ` S AND 70 ` S ROCK .	1
This was by far the best Doors album that they put out . After everything that they went through putting up with Jim this was a masterpiece . This album really showd that Jim could write some amazing songs.Riders On The Storm was a perfect ending for this unique band and Jim Morrison . I can listen to this album all the way through over and over again.Every song is a ten in my book . This was probly the last of the Doors anyway , but who knows what could have been .	1
Some of the finest work done by the Doors is on this release that could be called L.A. Blues as only the Doors could do ! A great listen !	1
Even with their sub par & # 34 ; Waiting for the Sun & # 34 ; and okay & # 34 ; Soft Parade & # 34 ; albums , The Doors totally reinvented themselves with & # 34 ; Morrison Hotel & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; L.A. Woman & # 34 ; . It 's a total waste , having Jim Morrison die at such an awesome time of the band . I believe they had the power to change the face of music forever ! They were totally awesome in that psychedelic to progressive rock stage , and had strong potential to be the leaders .	1
`` She Smells So Nice '' , or whatever it 's called , is quite weak , as is `` Rock Me '' . What you want this release for are the 7 alternate takes of the L.A. Woman songs . Very interesting , significantly different and extremely enjoyable versions of the album 's songs . All the members of the band are excellent , creative musicians , a fact which these tracks amply demonstrate . A welcome transmission from Planet Morrison .	1
It 's got three real good songs on it : Love her madly , L.A. woman and Riders on the storm . Most of the songs are good on this album and this is worth buying even if you are n't a Doors fan . Good music that you can relax and listen to .	1
Ther 's only one Doorsalbum that can outgrade this one and that 's the first one , simply called & quot ; the Doors & quot ; . This album contains songs like & quot ; Riders On The Storm & quot ; ( my favourite ) and & quot ; Do n't You Love Her Madly & quot ; . To the sound , it 's identical to the the first one . This was made just before Jim flipped out , which resulted in the weakly made & quot ; Soft Parade & quot ; . Why is n't it worth 5 stars ? well the songarrangement quality is a bit muddle . Otherwise than that , a great buy .	1
Rest assured , this is not the 2007 remix that came out a few years ago . This 40th anniversary edition is the original 1971 mix . It 's essentially no different than the 1999 remaster other than it has a second disc with some great bonus tracks with plenty of funny and clever Jim Morrison between-takes dialog . One of the most hilarious bits is when they 're about to record Take 1 of `` Cars Hiss By My Window '' and Jim tells the engineer the song is called `` The Bastard Son Of Jimmy and Mama Reed '' . Too bad they do n't sell just the bonus disc by itself . Otherwise , this is a very recommended purchase if you do n't already have a copy .	1
I give this album only 4 stars because no Doors album , by itself , is 5-star worthy . However , The Doors ' catalog is greater than the sum of its parts ; hence , their entire collection deserves 5 stars , without question.THE POSITIVES : The album is a great blues & amp ; rock combination . The Doors played a good amount of blues on the road , and this album finally captures some of that . Morrison 's voice is much more gruff-sounding and deep ( he sang while in the bathroom on some of the songs , and was smoking 2 packs a day at the time ) and the band 's sound is more refined , overall . As with 'Morrison Hotel ' , 'L.A Woman ' sounds nothing like the first 3 albums ; gone are the special sound effects and over-dubbing ( which certainly had their place in the earlier albums ) . While listening to 'Riders on the Storm ' , keep in mind that this was the last song on the last album from Jim Morrison . Eerie.THE NEGATIVES : L'America seems out of place , and is generally not a very good song . Crawling King Snake is ok , but it drags at times and is n't nearly as solid as it was when they performed it live .	1
L.A. Woman , the last of the Doors releases with Morrison , relied even more on blues than it 's predecessor . Morrison 's voice occasionally sounds worn , but the lyrical quality is undiminished . The hits on the album were Love Her Madly ( # 11 ) and Riders on the Storm ( # 14 ) . The former was written by Krieger , and was one of the most well arranged short singles the Doors ever made . Some of the straight blues seems common in places , ( both tracks 3 and 4 have the same key and progression , ) but the simpler lyrics and burning slide guitar make them enjoyable enough . The title track has become something of a car-cruising anthem with its regular classic rock radio airplay , featuring a strong and steady rhythm section led by Densmore . The Changeling was also effective , being in a similar style to Peace Frog , with the lyrics more down to earth and Manzarek 's keyboard to the fore . L'America and Hyacinth House were also admirable , with the former , a mysterious rocker with the latter being melodious and melancholy . The Wasp was perhaps a bit pretentious , though the musicians made a creative backdrop for Morrison 's poetry . The album ends with the hit Riders on the Storm , which featured impressive jazz improvisation , and occasional , but effective Morrison lines . This writer sees L.A. Woman as the Doors third best album . This and the rest of the Doors first six studio albums are recommended .	1
I 've always enjoyed the lizard king ... and his bandmates.Unfortunately I was too young for the show in new haven , ct in 67 ' . This cd is incedible . I lovvvvve the alternate versions . JDM left this world way too young . `` I live uptown ... I live downtown ... .I live all around . `` So many years later , and yes the bandleader does ... .still..Thanks for your time ... .Jikan	1
With the first album , you had a out-of-left-field record thatstill is influential to this day . The more expansive and surreal2nd album makes it a must-have for Doors fans . The incomplete '' Lizard King '' project turned into the 3rd album , which includesthe unforgettable `` Spanish Caravan '' . Mandatory if only for thatone song . Then the often-abused `` Soft Parade '' came out and showed that the group could branch out and try new avenues . Theawesome and scary `` Morrison Hotel '' followed and cemented theirplace in rock history . Absolutely Live was the first double discand showcased some drunken moments and some brilliant moments ( the scream at the beginning of `` Back Door Man '' comes from another world ) . Now we come to their finale - `` L.A. Woman '' . Thisalbum is notable due to the bluesy feel of most cuts . But thereare moments on this one that take you back to the Sunset Strip in 1967 when they played at the Whiskey . I really enjoy listening to `` Cars Hiss by my Window '' and the intro space part of `` L'America '' . The latter is the most underrated song the Doors ever recorded . In the days of the vinyl LP it was very important for most groups to have a strong statement to open up side 2 , especially if side 1 had a bunch of great tunes . The Doors knew this better than any other band . Think about some of their side 2 openers - Back Door Man , People are Strange , Spanish Caravan and of course L'America . `` L.A. Woman '' is such a great CD that it is essential to any rock collection . 1971 had some all-time rock recordings and `` L.A. Woman '' was one of them . Buy it and wear it out ... ... ... .	1
The music of The Doors as hippe counter culture icons is best showcased on their first and last albums which respectively got the most radio play song for song . The albums in between take a back seat to Morrison 's alcohol and drug abuse which the band , especially Robby Kreggar had a hard time putting up with past their first few gigs in the LA area . The Doors live shows were intimate spectacles of hippie excess- a joke they are not . The Doors were like the Marilyn Manson back then before the makeup and geeky outfits got in the way of the music and the band performing together as a unit . This 2007 reissue is the closest to the original 1972 or so it will look and sound like . I got this at Wal Mart for 10 bucks and they got rid of any humor . The 90s version saw a drunk and stoned plus hung over Morrison while the rest of the band on the cover photo were old men and did n't care if the were popular any more . The last Doors album with Morrison represented a point when The Doors were physically old men and did n't care if they were popular any more . Latter Doors album with Ray Manzarik singing were unfocused affairs that failed to even get a cult following or even sell . This went gold upon its release and later went platinum with a renewed interest in Morrison era Doors following the 90s movie , continuous radio play and the atrocous sales of Manzarek led Doors . Jim Morrison faked his death of a heroin over dose shortly after the last few gigs of the LA Woman tour . He has lost any humor and is still burnt out . The Doors used a session bass player only on this album LA Woman to flesh out their sound that they needed here in the heavier bass parts .	1
I know a lot of people who consider this the best Doors album . This album produced my favorite Doors song ( Love Her Madly ) butit 's not the best Doors album . This , album , like `` The Soft Parade '' except much better is experimental . It 's a little more bluesy , Morrison 's voice has gone a lot deeper since the first album . The lyrics are great . There 's really nothing wrong with this album . Here are the tracks:1 . The Changeling-5/5-Lyrics and keyboards are great . The best thing about the lyrics is that they 're true.2 . Love Her Madly-5/5-Probably my favorite Doors song . It 's just so catchy and cool . I love the lyrics , they 're funny though . ( Do n't you love her madly ? Wan na be her daddy ? ) 3 . Been Down So Long-4/5- '' Well I 've been down so godd @ mn long . That it looks like up to me . '' This is probably a great song for a man about to kill himself ... Or hire a french doctor to sign his death certificate and escape to Africa.4 . Cars Hiss by My Window-4/5- ( No Comment ) 5 . L.A. Woman-5/5-Killer song . Mr. Mojo Risin ' ( for those of you who have n't figured it out ) is an anagram for Jim Morrison 's name . This is a great song.6 . L'America-4/5-Good song . Catchy.7 . Hyacinth House-5/5-This song is great.8 . Crawling King Snake-5/5-A great cover song . Brings to mind `` Back Door Man. '' 9 . The WASP ( Texas Radio & The Big Beat ) -4/5-I do n't really like the song , but the chorus is good.10 . Riders on the Storm-5/5-Beautiful song . The keyboards are great , lyrics are great.A	1
This album has got to be one of a handful of the best albums ever recorded , in any genre , right up there with Born in the USA and The Wall . This is more a blues CD than Rock , in my opinion . Every track is great , but a few stand out as absolute all-time classics : Love Her Madly , L.A. Woman , and Riders on the Storm . The Changeling , King Snake , and Been Down So Long are great , driving Blues songs , and Hyacinth House is a delightful rarity . If you can only own one Doors CD , make it this one !	1
Pros : The sound is absoultly phenominal . This should be an example of what the standard should be in re-releasing material . It honestly sounds as if you are in the studio with the band . Side by side with the original issue of the cd this blows the older version away . Everything is so crisp and clear . This should be expected with technological advances.The price . If you 're looking to update the original cds without all the fancy packaging it 's cheaper to by these new issues rather than the latest boxed set.I 'm a purist at heart and do n't think albums should be remixed but I 'm indifferent here . The one thing that I did n't expect was the additional lyrics during `` Cars Hiss By My Window '' . Knowing the song the way it was originally released , it threw me for a loop when I first heard it and was totally unexpected.Cons : None . Hands down this is my favorite Doors album . Next in line is to upgrade my Morrison Hotel cd ( the 2nd best in my opinion ) .	1
`` L.A. Woman '' is the final album put together by the Doors before the death of Jim Morrison and what is so striking about it for me is how the two best tracks , the title one and `` Riders of the Storm , '' are so different from the rest of what is on the album . Contrasting the start of those tracks with the opening song on the album , `` The Changeling , '' and they are like night and day . Most of the rest of this 1971 album is really blues oriented , with `` Love Her Madly '' clearly being the best of the bunch , and some of the rest being instantly forgettable . I think it is obvious that the band was trying to get back their credibility after veering too far in the direction of pop for a couple of albums , with `` Morrison Hotel '' and this one righting those wrongs . But since a few of these songs are pretty forgettable , `` L.A. Woman '' is an album that is caught between a 4 and a 5 but you have to round up given how good its two best songs end up being.My two favorite parts of Oliver Stone 's movie `` The Doors '' is when we hear Ray Manzarek in the background fooling around on the organ until he gets the bit for `` Light My Fire '' right and the end credits with the tracking shot showing the record of `` L.A. Woman , '' with Val Kilmer 's Morrison taking advantage of the great acoustics in the bathroom . For years when I was driving back from the Twin Cities and coming up the final hills before being able to see the lights of home , to wit the `` city of lights , '' `` L.A. Woman '' was the song I would play in the car because it perfectly suited the moment.Since the track opens with the sound of an accelerating car engine it is easy to see why the songs is associated with driving . Robbie Krieger simulates that sound on his guitar , but with a hint of eeriness that leads into first Manzarek 's keyboards and then John Densmore 's cymbal tapping and session player Jerry Scheff 's throbbing bass . From that intriguing beginning the song generates its compelling rhythm and allows Morrison to wax lyrical . The bridge represents one of the most creative changes in rock history , using a tango tempo while Morrison sings about burning hair before getting to the final section where the anagrammatic `` Mr. Mojo Risin ' '' makes his appearance . On a lot of these tracks Morrison 's voice sounds about shot , but there are no complaints about `` L.A. Woman , '' which qualifies as his last great vocal performance . `` Riders of the Storm '' is one of the moodiest Doors ' songs and the lyrics create a sense of foreboding ( e.g. , `` Into this house were born/Into this world we 're thrown '' ) representing the questionable side of human existence . Musically Manzarek captures the sound of the storm , with actual thunderstorm sound effects dubbed on to the track , while Densmore again works the cymbals and Scheff provides a simple bass line , reflecting a minimalist approach that is quite effective . The song made it to # 14 on the Billboard charts after Morrison 's death in Paris ( `` Love Her Madly '' had made it to # 11 while the title track was just too long for AM radio ) . The `` L.A. Woman '' album only made it to # 9 , which , believe it or not , makes it the worst performance by a Doors album . Of course , a decade later Morrison and the Doors were bigger than ever and `` L.A. Woman '' was a frequent mention as the group 's best track .	1
L.A. Woman is the Doors ' final album with Jim Morrison on lead vocal . Like its predecessor Morrison Hotel , this album is also excellent , considering that Morrison by this time was basically at death 's door ( he died in Paris not long afterward ) .Morrison 's vocals on L.A. Woman sound much like an old man 's , which adds a bit of ambience to the whole record . The band is in fine form , with Jerry Scheff on bass . Again , when you consider the shape Morrison was in , it 's a miracle this record even got made.Like Morrison Hotel , it 's extremely blues-oriented . The Changeling is a table-busting jam , and Texas Radio and The Big Beat is terrrific . Hyacinth House is appropriately creepy , as is Cars Hiss By My Window.And like all Doors albums , it 's got the hits : Love Her Madly , L.A. Woman ( one of my all-time favorites ) , and Riders on the Storm , which many hate . But as the last song on the album , I see it as a fine way for the Bozo Dionysius ( Lester Bangs ' term for Morrison ) to say goodbye.L.A . Woman is not as good as Morrison Hotel , but still terrific and worth owning .	1
if you take even jimi or janis or nick drake , by the time they died their talent was only a glimmer of their earlier brilliance . jimi could never surpass what he unleased with 'are you experienced ? ' . janis could never recover the visceral intensity of 'cheap thrills ' . by 'pink moon ' nick drake had dissolved into incoherence.even for others who lived on like clapton or peter green , their talent too petered out over a period of time.but not so with the doors apparently.for 20 years , the only doors i had heard was a 10 song 'best of ' compilation with all the predictable songs.but recently i started checking out their individual albums and having listened to all of them repeatedly it is my opinion that LA Woman was their best recording.it is edgier and still very inspired . intense and highly riveting . highly musical lean and mean blues rock.the last song in the album is my favorite : riders on the storm.considering that this was their last recording , it is a shame that morrison died . i do n't mour jimi or janis , the way i do with morrison now.trivia : jim morrison 's father upon hearing the Doors debut LP advised his son in a letter : & # 34 ; to give up any idea of singing or any connection with a music group because of what I consider to be a complete lack of talent in this direction. & # 34 ; ! ! !	1
There is no denying that this is one the Doors ' best and the perfect cap on their career with Morrison . Anyone who likes the Doors should probably buy this , even though Orange County Suite and You Need Meat are missing . But if you 're a fan you probably have those songs anyway . My only beef is calling the songs on the second disc alternate versions . I think alternate takes is more accurate . An alternate version to me would be , for example , having two different cuts of Hyacinth House that sound different but are both album worthy and the band then releasing the version that did n't get chosen for the album . The alternate takes are interesting to hear but not probably something I 'll go back to over and over again .	1
This sixth and final studio album by The Doors had been recorded and was still in the final stages of mixing when Jim Morrison left on that fateful trip to Paris . `` L.A. Woman , '' like all of The Door 's albums , covers a wide spectrum of emotional territory , from out and out rockers like the title cut , `` L.A. Woman '' ( which is the highlight of the project ) , and the cryptic `` The Changeling , '' to the acerbic musings of `` Been Down So Long '' to the wary strains of `` Cars Hiss By My Window , '' and `` Crawling King Snake . '' Then it swings all the way to the other end of the scale with the disturbing metaphor and Morrison 's hypnotic delivery of `` Riders On The Storm , '' the final song on the album which , in retrospect , seems somehow appropriate : `` Riders on the storm / into this house we 're born / into this world we 're thrown . '' Overall the album conveys a strong sense of worldly wisdom and weariness that is reflected , not only in the music , but chiefly in Morrison 's voice ; there 's the clarity of `` Love Her Madly '' and the ethereal quality of `` Riders On The Storm , '' to the gritty resonance of `` L.A , Woman , '' to the downright ragged coarseness of `` Been Down So Long , '' in which he sounds as if he could tear his own heart out , and yours along with it . There 's two cuts steeped in allegory , `` L'America '' and `` Hyacinth House : '' `` What are they doing in the Hyacinth house / to please the lions / this day ? '' And listen closely to the lyrics of `` The Wasp ( Texas Radio and the Big Beat ) ; there is a longing in the subtle poetry and a determination in the way Morrison delivers it that makes it possibly the most insightful cut on the album : `` Listen to this I 'll tell you about the heartache / I 'll tell you about the heartache and the loss of God / I 'll tell you about the hopeless night / the meager food for souls forgot / tell you about the maiden with wrought iron soul . '' This album may take you down streets rarely traveled ; Morrison 's words alone are captivating , but when underscored by Ray Manzarek 's keyboards , Robby Krieger 's guitar and John Densmore 's drums , it combines into a force that will carry you off to an entirely different plane . This is rock n ' roll at it 's best ; elitists may scoff , but there is a strength and power to this music that can not be dismissed out-of-hand . The music of The Doors is alive , and it will continue to endure because , as `` L.A. Woman '' proves , it is timeless .	1
After the first few minutes you still know that `` L.A. Woman '' is a monster of an album , a huge , roaring blast of blues and rock n ' roll with all the force of a seasoned band that has come full circle . It was the last Doors album with legendary frontman Jim Morrison , and it is a dirty , mean , ghostly work . This is also the final release of the 40th anniversary remixes where sound engineer Bruce Botnick has taken every Doors album and remixed them from their original sources . The results have been impressive and `` L.A. Woman '' is no exception . The songs now race along with a sharper , cleaner sound , with their rhythms and elements brought back to new life . `` The Changeling '' kicks things off with a hard funk beat that here has a much clearer sound and rocking bass , `` Love Her Madly '' has sharper drums and Morrison 's vocals come across more clearly and with powerful force , the same as in the song `` L.A. Woman '' which has a smoother drum beat and guitars , Ray Manzarek 's keyboards also shine better here . You can also pick up sounds that were originally lost here , effects and background instrumentals which had been lost to the rotting effects of tape hiss and age . Purists have been huffing and puffing over these remixes , claiming they are different albums , which they are not . Botnick has simply taken the original tracks and remixed them , he 's bringing up to the surface what we could n't hear before . Now the music of The Doors sounds better than it ever has , and new generations of fans will be delighted to discover them this way , without the aging limitations of other artists ' releases . As an album this is still a masterful blues work as The Doors produce a potent combination of blues and rock , giving us a beautiful , edgy hybrid , just listen to the menacing `` Crawling King Snake '' and rough `` Been Down So Long . '' And yet they never lose their haunting , dark poetic quality that made them famous , `` Riders On The Storm '' is still a ghostly recitation framed by a thunder shower . What comes across so well in this re-release is the stunning detail and quality of what The Doors created with this album . This was their first project without their long-time producer Paul Rothchild , who was simply burned out from working with a frontman who 's wild antics and stage attitude preceeded Iggy Pop and Marilyn Manson . Independent and producing themselves , the band recorded an album that sounds and feels completely free and unrestrained with amazing lyrical and musical creativity . `` L.A. Woman '' is a masterpiece , and now it sounds better and louder , a must for Doors fans and a must for any rock n ' roll library .	1
And it works . Very well . This is the ultimate finisher of the legacy that the Doors left us . Love Her Madly , Riders on the Storm , the title track , and WASP are all essential cuts to any Doors collection . This is probably my favorite album out of them all , save Strange Days and their self-titled debut . Wow . This album 's damn good .	1
I picked this up at a local music shop called `` Record Wear House '' . They do n't specialize in LPs like they used to . Which made this an exciting find ! I was out Christmas shopping , but I figured no one would be getting this for me . So , I went ahead and got myself something a little early ! : D I dropped the needle to it when I returned home later that night . It sounds great ! Besides the music , I had only a few candles and lava lamps going , which on a cold , wintry night gave the music a certain eerie-ness ! I had heard some horror stories regarding some Doors reissues that came out within the last few years , and I was hoping this was n't one of 'em . As it turns out , it was n't ! I would recommend this vinyl reissue to any Doors fan who might be considering it . Also , a nice plus , the plastic the LP was wrapped in doubles as a protective outer plastic sleeve for the cover . You just open it using the perforated edge . As I said before , `` Very Nice ! '' ; )	1
Gift for friend.He could not believe I found it . NEW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Did not tell him far it had to travel to get here 3 days before Christmas ... ... ... ... .He was happy , dog was happy .	1
The music ( and opinions thereof ) are well documented in the reviews here . Personally , I have always loved this album . It is a logical extension from Morrison Hotel but a bit more bluesy . The crowning bookends are the original LP side-enders LA Woman and Rider on the Storm . I am only posting this in terms of the vinyl re-issue . I am not sure if Amazon has it , but Analogue Productions has recently released the definitive master - 2 LPs at 45rpm on 200g vinyl . It is not cheap - I shelled out $ 50 - but the sound is so clean and pure there really is no comparison . Listen to the end of Riders and you will want to go outside and roll up your car windows . It is that good . So if vinyl is your choice , I am only offering this brief snippet to let anyone know a better option is available than the standard 180g.Cheers	1
This is my favorite Doors studio lp . I think its somewhat rare for a groups last lp to be the best but in this case its true . For me , anyway . And actually there is only a span of about 3 years from the first to the last lp . That aside , I love this lp . Most of you guys know the songs . I really like the second disc as I am a sucker for demos , outakes and the like . I know it seems like the Doors re release thier albums over again every few years , but this seems like the definative copy of this great lp .	1
I really like it but ca n't say I love it.I really do n't like mono and do n't think it was needed	1
Brian Wilson was so blown away after hearing Rubber Soul by The Beatles that he felt the need to compete with them , so he immediately went to work on a new album in the first few months of 1966 . What he came up with goes even further than the amazing Rubber Soul in melody and harmony development . Brian had a genius ear when it came to crafting melodies , so he was at the height of his powers here . He went to work at this while his fellow Beach Boys were on tour and developed a dozen sophisticated songs that expressed how he was feeling inside . This was totally new in rock music at the time so it is a landmark recording . To open up the album we have & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice , & quot ; which is a sweet song with a phenomenal bridge . & quot ; You Still Believe In Me & quot ; is a minor melody ballad that is really beautiful . The song is very emotional with moving progressions and is most striking at the part where he sings & quot ; I wan na cry & quot ; over a feast of notes. & quot ; That 's Not Me & quot ; is sung by Mike Love and is another highlight with its key changes . Then comes & quot ; Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder ) , & quot ; another emotional ballad that comes to a climax in the middle when Brian tells us to & quot ; listen & quot ; with the sad violins coming directly afterwards . & quot ; I 'm Waiting For The Day & quot ; is faster and neat , but then comes & quot ; Let 's Go Away For Awhile & quot ; which is a very moving instrumental full of violins , Hawaiian-styled guitar , and strings . & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; is said to be the least striking on the album , but it 's actually really good and it has a beautiful a capella section in the middle . & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; has been called by Paul McCartney the best song ever written ; so many excellent songs have been written but it does have excellent harmony vocals and it 's another highlight.Then comes the wonderful & quot ; I Know There 's An Answer , & quot ; and after that is & quot ; Here Today & quot ; which is the most ambitious of all the songs . Although it appears quaint with its production , it has some neat key and tempo changes within its fairly sparse minor-key melody . Next is & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; which is sung from the heart and is another minor ballad like the rest . Near the end we get the title track , the second instrumental of the album , which uses two coke bottles for percussion and more Hawaiian guitar . Finally & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; ends the album on a graceful and sad note and shows that this is a truly genius piece of work . It 's hard to express the utter perfection and beauty on this record ( even though the bonus track & quot ; Hang On To Your Ego & quot ; is nothing special ) . You 'd really just have to hear it . Buy it , you fool !	1
For those that say they & quot ; do n't get it & quot ; . You have to understand at that point in time when this album was released no one had ever tried any of the things that The Beach Boys IE : Brian Wilson tried that was/is & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; . I hear a lot of babble from those that & quot ; do n't it get & quot ; that it sounds like bland harmonizing vocals , etc etc . The album is a masterpiece simply because of the daring arrangements . The use of sounds that no one at that time had thought of using in the way that they were used . The drum work . You can hear how Ringo Starr was influenced on Sgt Peppers . You can hear how the use of & quot ; samples & quot ; IE : the sound of the train at the end of & quot ; Caroline NO & quot ; was used on Sgt Peppers . Or the beginning of & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; ... go listen to & quot ; Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite & quot ; off Sgt Peppers and you will hear where the influence for the beginning of that song started . These are things that make this album special , they were the 1st band to try things like this using those sounds . The arrangements themselves of the songs are just simply brilliant , they can actually be compared to Classical . The brilliance of & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; go listen to the ballad of & quot ; John & amp ; Yoko & quot ; , or & quot ; Ob Li Di Ob Li Da & quot ; and you can hear an influence of this song in those songs ! The Beach Boys created brilliance . Those who do not get it are not listening or do not understand the history of music . For those who have not heard this album and are wondering if you will enjoy it . All I can tell you is to ask yourself first how much are you into musicology and if you have an open mind .	1
You know , even with classic radio hits like & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; , & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; and & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; I just ca n't putThe Beach Boys & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; into my CD player and not listen tothe entire album in one sitting ! I 'd be missing out on my favoritesongs like & quot ; Do n't Talk & quot ; , & quot ; Let 's Go Away For Awile & quot ; , & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; , & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; ... I can go on and on , really ! This has less weak cuts then The Beatles & quot ; Sgt.Pepper & quot ; and thatonly had ONE mildly weak song if that tells you anything.Okay-order this NOW ! It will brighten your day !	1
After reaping huge success , both commercial and critical , with & quot ; The Beach Boys Today & quot ; , leader and producer Brian Wilson set out to make an album even better than that . What he came up with has been called the greatest album of all time.1966 's & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; was the least successful Beach Boys album up to that time , barely hitting the top 10 ( it peaked at 10 ) and not going gold . So it 's no small irony that it remains their best and popular album of all time . Under Wilson 's guidance , the group became more experimental , moving out of their signature & quot ; surf rock & quot ; realm and writing songs that dealed with real - life issues such as maturity ( & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; ) , love ( & quot ; Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder ) & quot ; , & quot ; You Still Believe In Me & quot ; ) , rejection ( & quot ; Here Today & quot ; , & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; , & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; ) , even death ( the ethereal & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; , with Carl Wilson 's angel - like vocal and Brian 's stunning production ) . The only song that seems even remotely like their earlier work is & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; . But while this one has to do with the ocean they loved so much , it is more of a distress call than an ode to summer fun . The two instrumentals , & quot ; Let 's Go Away For Awhile & quot ; and the title track are great . The former is carried on by the gentle , slightly mysterious vibraphones and great strings , while the latter is a sidewinding instrumental workout . & quot ; I Know There 's An Answer & quot ; is a crackerjack keyboard workout with a fierce chorus and scorching lyrics . The bonus track , another version of the song entitled & quot ; Hang On To Your Ego & quot ; is just the same song with just the title line changed. & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; now comes with a beautiful booklet filled with pictures and track information . Brian Wilson provides a wonderful inroduction , and the essay is beautifully written . verall , this is what I conisder the greatest album of all time . For me , to be a great album , the album has to really speak to you , and & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; speaks to me because , as I mentioned earlier , it talks about the issues in our lives . If you want an album , look no further than & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; .	1
Fred Durst 's # 1 Fan does n't know the meaning of good music , or what decent English is . Durst can go rot.Yes , Pet Sounds is overrated , but there is is still a lot to it . Some songs are just minor pop songs . They all have brilliant moments , but that 's it . `` Do n't Talk '' is a fine example . It 's slow and the tune is odd , but then there is at he gentle chorus and the `` listen , listen '' part . But there are great tunes . `` Would n't It Be Nice '' and `` I Just Was n't Made For These Times '' are brilliant . Most of all , the album has a soul . A strong spirit . I think that 's what Brian was trying to come across with . 100 years from now , they will think back to how bad some music and so-called `` music '' ( AKA rap ) was , but they will remeber the strong soul of Pet Sounds .	1
I often write about heart and soul when reviewing cds , describing the enormous effort musicians put into their works . Certainly there are many bands and singers who have devoted their lives to music , but never , ever have I heard an album that is remotely close to the breathtaking Pet Sounds , as far as work ethic , creativity , perseverence , and in the end , pure perfection.Many people liken Pet Sounds to The Beatles Sgt . Pepper album . People often criticize Sgt . Pepper for taking its influence from the primordial Pet Sounds , but the fact that Brian Wilson was first inspired to make Pet Sounds after he heard Rubber Soul is often overlooked . Here 's what he said in the liner notes : & quot ; In December of 1965 , I heard the album Rubber Soul by the Beatles . It was definitely a challenge for me . I saw that every cut was very artistically interesting and stimulating . I immediately went to work on the songs for Pet Sounds. & quot ; As a huge fan of both the Beatles and the Beach Boys , I find it absolutely wonderful and riveting that the two biggest bands from across the seas were involved in somewhat of an artistic spar ; one which ended up helping both bands produce some of their greatest music.As far as the individual songs of this album , there are no highs and lows . Pet Sounds stays at a steady constant of brilliance , sounding at an uncalibrated musical high . From the swirling harmonies of the opening Would n't It Be Nice to the wonderful coda of Hang On To Your Ego , this recording is thoroughly enjoyable . My personal favorites are Would n't It Be Nice , God Only Knows and I Just Was n't Made For These Times . To wrap things up with a hackneyed yet appropiate cliche , your music collection is incomplete without Pet Sounds .	1
What else needs to be said about & # 34 ; Pet Sounds ? & # 34 ; When Paul McCartney is quoted as saying it was part of the inspiration for Sgt Pepper , you probably should check it out .	1
Pet Sounds . This is where the group 's mastery of the technical came to the forefront like never before . There are so many vocal layers , and such a rich symphonic sound that by this point it was clear , the Beach Boys had something pretty special happening . However , it has all been said before . And my guess is you 're probably pretty sick of hearing about it . Pet Sounds is a classic so universally recognized that it seems silly for me to even bother reviewing it . But the fact remains , some of the Boy 's greatest tunes adorn this album . Also , some of the most sweetly naive and almost childlike lyrics on Pet Sounds color this period of the sixties permanently with the heartbreak of a nation 's collective loss of innocence . `` Would n't it Be Nice '' , `` Do n't Talk '' , `` Sloop John B '' , `` Caroline No '' ... These have all become part of the American musical landscape of the twentieth century , but that does n't mean they should n't still be appreciated for their almost hymnal beauty . And `` God Only Knows '' still stands as probably the greatest achievment in Brian Wilson 's storied career . Even though many contemporary musicians claim that the Beach Boys were a major influence on their music , I believe albums like Sunflower and Surf 's up actually sound more like modern pop than Pet Sounds does . The influence of the spirit of the late 60s Beach Boys though , and their interminable drive to push the musical envelope was great indeed . The Beach Boys of this period pretty much perfected pure pop , so unless the spirit of the music is once again channeled , today 's groups are just retreading old ground ... and I 'm not interested .	1
I 've seen on so many sites that this is the definitive Beach Boys - but I 'm not really sure about that . Part of it is a mono-version of their other albums and another is stereo and kind of iffy . I 'm just not seeing it ... I grew up in their era and knew about the drugs , etc . but the Beach Boys at their peak was one thing ... this is n't that . Rather than spending your $ $ $ on this , get one of the classics that 's been re-mastered . It 's a better buy .	1
Y'all lost me when you declared Pet Sounds as the best album of all time . That 's simply a ridiculous claim , hell I 'll take Black Sabbath 's Paranoid , or Sticky Fingers by the Stones , or Dark Side of The Moon by the Floyd , or Kid A by Radiohead , or XTC 's Nonesuch , or King Crimson 's Discipline , or the Sex Pistols , or Revolver by the Beatles or Axis : Bold as Love by Hendrix and many others ( and we 're just talking about rock here ) before Pet Sounds any day . Now if you 'd said that Pet Sounds was the most influential album of all time I 'd have given a longer pause to reflect . After all XTC would probably never have done Nonesuch which owes a huge debt to the vocal harmonies of the Beach Boys and the Beatles would n't have done Sgt . Peppers in order to compete with Brian Wilson 's masterpiece . Pet Sounds became for a brief time in the mid sixties a kind of pop music benchmark and was the most complex and ambitious pop music album of its day . And that ambition , that desire to make rock 'n roll or pop music grander , more musically serious , is Pet Sounds most profound and lasting legacy . A legacy that influenced the Beatles , Moody Blues , King Crimson on up to Pink Floyd and beyond . One could make a case that Pet Sounds was the first progressive rock album . But it does n't really matter if Pet Sounds is the best or most influential album ever made . What does matter is that Pet Sounds is sublime pop music . The lyrics may be slight , so what , the sound of this album is a gorgeous island of melodic and harmonic bliss . It 's just damn beautiful , at times very touching and should n't be missed . Do yourself a favor and check it out .	1
There have been many great things written about this album and it tops many listeners ' best-of-lists . I for one , love the album very much but something just gets in the way of my awarding it 5 stars ... the track Sloop John B.That tune was released as a single prior to the album 's release and according to the liner notes in the boxset , the record company dictated it to be included ... as a marketing ploy . Trust the powers that be to go and f**k up a masterpiece in the making . What do people who only care about the bottom line know about art ? ! Just check the current state of the music scene and you will know what I am talking about . Poor Brian was probably under pressure to make the compromise . THAT song was never meant to be for Pet Sounds ! Sloop John B. was not written by Brian ; it was a folk song that the Beach Boys rearranged . It sounds pretty but it does n't have the depth of the other songs on the album . Even the two instrumentals have more emotional resonance than this tune . To me , having this tune here mars the whole experience of the album and in my opinion , is even more tragic than Brian not being able to complete Smile back then ( we now know that he has finally done so ... am waiting for my copy in the mail ! ) . If Pet Sounds was perfect ( as it is without Sloop John B . ) , the Beatles would probably have tried harder with Sgt Pepper 's and kept the original concept that included Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane ( again , the record company got in the way and forced them to release the songs as a single ) .Alas , in my book , the two ( friendly ) competing camps lost out in the `` race '' to make the best album of all time ... that accolade goes to Love 's Forever Changes !	1
I 'm pretty sure that there were lots of drugs and alcohol involved in the making of Pet Sounds ... .but it is amazing stuff .	1
I originally bought `` Pet Sounds '' in 1973 and it is still a pleasant album . In Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time it appeared at # 2 in 2003 . In my opinion the album has been over-praised by critics since about 1973 . The Phil Spectorish production and lush orchestration now sound dated . There are four hit singles on the record . `` God Only Knows '' is a great song . `` Would n't It Be Nice '' , Sloop John B '' and `` Caroline No '' are very good . Much of the rest sounds like elevator music.Music taste is entirely subjective . However , a potential buyer should beware of the hype surrounding Brian Wilson . The music critics would have you believe that Wilson was the Beethoven of pop music , unfortunately he 's became a little overrated . Wilson wrote about a dozen great songs that are still worth listening to . Pet Sounds is essentially a nice pop album from the 1960s .	1
Bought this album on reputation ... many critics would have it as the greatest album of all time . The track listing had never grabbed me enough to want to get the album without the reputation given to it by the critics . Anyway , I took a punt . The cd I have is listed as released in 2001 , and it has the mono version of the album first , then the stereo mix of the album . There is a bonus track too , which is a reworking of one of the songs on the regular album . On first listen I gave this album 77.5/100 . On second listen and after listening to the mono mix as well , it 's difficult to rate . If it had 3 or 4 songs I liked as much as `` Sloop John B '' , then it could be an easy 5/5 . This album would score in the high 80s to 5/5 for me based on the fact that it is just so listenable ... no more killer tracks , but no dud tracks either . That 's been enough for me in the past to give an album 5/5 too . With a band like The Beach Boys , maybe there is just an expectation of lots of songs up there with their poppy best . On this album they move beyond their lyrically simple but highly infectious surf-pop confections . These songs are n't memorable to me , but I can imagine being pleasantly surprised at how pretty they are if I was to dig this album out again . Of course , `` Sloop John B '' is a great cover by the band , which they turned into a masterpiece . Perhaps it 's wrong to expect the other songs to measure up to this ? In any case , this album would be more uniform but still very strong without this classic on it ... and maybe easier to score.Overall , the album has many pleasant tracks , with symphonic elements to them at times . Lyrics have depth which their early surf-pop songs do n't have ... not that this was anything but a positive for those early songs . On second listen the album was just an easy listening pleasure , which I 've tended to reward here in the past with high scores . A difficult album to rate ... it 's listenability demands a high score though . Range : 87.5 to 100/100.The all time classic ( `` / '' ) : Sloop John B - iconic intro . Glassy percussion . A killer pop cover of the Caribbean folk song . Has a tuba , I think and great harmonies with good variety in the voices.The best of the rest ... on second listen ( `` > ( . ) '' ) : You still believe in me - bumped this up from a `` [ . ] '' . Nice lead vocal tone and melody . Cello ? Harpsichord ? Has bicycle horn type sound as well.Caroline no - Same bump up as above , but after my third listen , on the mono mix . Has chunky wooden percussion , which is nice . A pleasant track . Harpsichord , big bass notes and a pretty woodwind type of instrument . The outro features a train and barking dogs.Then ( `` [ . ] '' ) : Would n't it be nice - album opener . Iconic lead guitar melody intro . Brass . Good stereo balance ( albums of this era were experimenting with the new stereo capabilities and did n't often do stereo well by today 's standards ) .I know there 's an answer - catchy piano , tambourine and a tuba type instrument . Double bass plays in a jazzy kind of a way . Symphonic drums . Thoughtful lyrics and a catchy chorus.On second listen ( `` > [ . ] '' ) : Do n't talk ( put your head on my shoulder ) - was hoping that this was a cover of the sugar 1950s pop ballad . It 's not . Only has one of the Beach Boys singing on this track . Features organ , bass , piano , violins and cymbal percussion.Let 's go away for a while - a pleasant , experimental instrumental . Drums and symphonic drums . Piano , brass , violins , twangy string instrument and xylophone ( ? ) , God only knows - horn , bass , sleigh bells ( ? ) , interesting tone to the percussion , some sort of keyboard effect , violin and a lovely falsetto by one of the Boys.Here today - piano , tuba , tambourine , symphonic elements like brass . Double bass note picking . Catchy verse ( ? ) parts ... I mean like the opening vocal melody.On third listen ! ( `` > [ . ] '' ) : I 'm waiting for the day - interesting symphonic drumming and other symphonic elements feature as well . Quiet parts alternate with with percussive passages , which is a little bit catchy.I just was n't made for these times - bass notes , harpsichord ( ? ) , interesting percussion tones at times ... ( bongos ? ) , symphonic drums at times , woodwind ? I think that the mono version of this song may have that novelty instrument which was often used in the 1950s ... the one where you waved your hand over an aerial type instrument which created sci-fi type noises ... I forget what you call those ! The rest : That 's not me - organ , dual lead guitar , aboriginal percussion sticks sound , bass drum ( ? ) , reflective lyrics . Interesting.Pet sounds - instrumental with symphonic elements . Maracas , brass ... including a tuba , twangy lead guitar , bass , interesting drum tone and a tambourine , I think.Hang on to your ego - A bonus track . Very similar to `` I know there 's an answer '' . Wikipedia 's entry for the album version states that this bonus track was the original version , but there were concerns about supposed drug related themes ... as in the title ! Personally , I ca n't see it ! Recommendations ... easy listening classics : Fleetwood Mac - Fleetwood Mac ( 2nd self-titled album ) , RumoursGenesis - From Genesis to RevelationThe Velvet Underground - The Velvet Underground & Nico , The Velvet Underground .	1
The Beach Boys said it time and again : That The Beatles were their inspiration to keep writing good songs and produce better music ( if only such competition existed in today 's sick joke of a music market ... ) and Pet Sounds was inspired by , in my opinion , The Boys ' best album , Rubber Soul ( a record that was n't heavy on the studio tricks as its close second , Revolver , was ) .America was , by 1966 , still searching for a homegrown answer to top the boys from Britain , and Pet Sounds was supposed to be it . A group that made its mark on the charts by singing about the beach and how superior one state 's women ( probably , again , from the beach ) were to women from the rest of the country were supposed to be the answer . I do n't think so . ( Yeah , yeah , The Beatles sung about teenybopper love in the beginning of their careers but they progressed quite nicely . ) I listened to Pet Sounds quite a few times with an open mind and the only three songs I wound up liking were the ones I liked before : Would n't It Be Nice , Sloop John B , and God Only Knows ( which Paul McCartney , I believe , called one of the prettiest songs he ever heard ) . It did n't grow on me and I wish I could have liked it more.I do n't take away Brian Wilson 's producing capabilities but The Beatles they were not nor could ever be .	1
And not just for the more recognized songs like `` would n't it be nice '' and `` god only knows '' . The majority of songs are pretty mellow and understated , but they sure leave an impact . I 'll just say that no album collection is complete without this gem .	1
... ... ..is the greatest & # 34 ; RnR & # 34 ; album ever made . A 24 year old genius put together the most symphonic piece of & # 34 ; ear-candy & # 34 ; ; and , the label just dumped & # 34 ; sand & # 34 ; on it and washed it out to sea . This is the most under-appreciated album ( a real tragedy ) . Brian Wilson became rock n ' roll 's first artistic martyr .	1
At first I did n't think much of this album , but as I listened to it more , I started it loving it . It 's not much like The Beach Boys ' previous albums , but I still love it ! It 's definitely worth listening to and it 's a gem to any Beach Boys fan ! I 've heard many people say they do n't like the stereo mixes , but truthfully , I ca n't really tell the difference from the originals : / , though I really do enjoy `` Hang On to Your Ego '' which is right in the middle of the album . Some of my favourites are `` God Only Knows '' , `` Sloop John B '' , `` Caroline , No '' , `` Here Today '' , and the hit from 50 First Dates , `` Would n't It Be Nice '' . There 's so many songs on this album , it 's hard to choose favourites ! All in all , this is a wonderful album by the great Beach Boys !	1
When it ' cold outside and your looking to warm up , just put on some of the best music ever written . Surf 's up even though it 's -10 outside , Polar vortex my ass	1
I can remember when my older sister ( a Beach Boys fan ) bought Pet sounds when it first came out in 1966 . I asked her if it was as good as their other ones . She replied that it was too slow and that there were only one or two good songs on it . As a result of her negative assessment , I did not listen to this album for over 20 years ! When I finally heard it , I realized that my sister was hoping for more surfing music . What Brian WIlson gave the world was a great pop album which shows that , as a composer , he was right up there with Bacharach and Lennon/McCartney . This album is understated . There are few bells and whistles . Some of the best ballads have to grow on you . But it is , consistently , of such high quality that it eventually becomes a favorite of most lovers of pop music . Wilson 's production is amazing . His writing just soars . The vocals can make you swoon . It is an album to discover and re-discover again and again . If you are looking for a rocking album , you may be disappointed . If you are interested in finding out that Wilson could write pop music as well as Jimmy Webb , McCartney ( who rates this as his favorite album ) , Burt Bacharach , definitely get this album and listen to it over and over . Amazingly , it is one of the few albums from the sixties that has not dated at all . It sounds as if it could have been released last summer ! Barely noticed at the time it was released , its reputation grows with each passing year as one of the greatest albums of all time . Heartfelt , moving , gorgeous .	1
Has no one else noticed ? What amazes me about this , one of my all time favorite albums of all time.The Beach Boys only sing on it . They play absolutely no instruments on it.Produced by Brain Wilson & Phil Specter . They can make anyone sound this good.At least The Beatles played on Sgt . Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band , did n't they ? And golly gee , Paul McCartney did get so upset the way Phil Specter produced Let It Be .	1
Assuming that these are the same versions from the 4 CD & quot ; Pet Sounds Sessions & quot ; box , let me just say this . First , the stereo mix , for all but Beach Boy mono fanatics , is pure pleasure . We waited 30-something years for it , and mostly it 's what we dreamed about . The sound is rich , lustrous and full-bodied , well detailed and spread out across a wide soundstage . You 'll hear the complexities of Brian Wilson 's multitrack , multilayered arrangements as never before . & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; is one of my two or three favorite albums , and I 've been listening to the stereo version since before the box came out ( it was widely available as a boot ) . I 've embraced it and really come to love it . The nagging question is , is this what Brian heard in his head when he created this music and really wanted the public to hear ? If Brian 's hearing had allowed it , is this what he would have mixed ? We 'll never know , just as we 'll never know how many angels can dance on the head of a pin . But as time passes , the question troubles me less and less , particularly since the latest high-tech version of the mono mix is here as well for those who want that . A final remark : There are numerous versions of the mono mix on the CD market . The original Capitol version , run through something called the Sonic Solutions process , sounded clean as a whistle , with nicely surpressed tape hiss , but struck me as almost unnaturally airy and overly bright . On Capitol 's latest 24-bit digital remastering , which was included as a separate CD in the box set , no special doctoring seems to have been done between the tape and CD . But the much improved technology reveals the flaws in the now well-worn studio master tape . Not surprisingly , the stereo remix ( drawn , apparently , from less-worn multitrack worktapes ) sounds a lot better . For my money , the best mono & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; CD out there is the gold DCC version . I was less impressed with Steve Hoffman 's audiophile LP version of & quot ; Pet Sounds , & quot ; which had some darkish overtones , but the CD is well balanced and full , a trifle riper and with less hiss and more body than the current Capitol edition . Capitol 's is doubtless a truer reflection of the current state of the master tape than DCC 's , but I 'm willing to sacrifice a little gritty authenicity for listenability .	1
PET SOUNDS is without a doubt a wonderful collection of beautiful harmonies and melodies . Each song is an incredibly well-crafted set piece , individual masterpieces when heard separately . The problem is when they are put together in this package , there is a sameness to the songs . Found in the heart of each song is a gentle , haunting melody without an edge . The songs move seamlessly from one to another and this actually works to their disadvantage ; they just are not different enough from each other to be fully appreciated in this setting . Unlike SMILE , where Wilson is able to constantly surprise and amaze , PET SOUNDS is a pleasent and sweet series of songs , I enjoy them but they create a sense of comfort rather than amazement .	1
What can be said about an album already so acclaimed ? The editorial review gets it right that it 's already been over-pre-digested for the public , and when I first gave it a listen , the hype fogged my view and I did n't really take to it.Now that I 've gotten that initial reaction out of the way and really lived in the album , I see its brilliance . I ca n't even waste time extolling the handful of truly great pop songs here -- Would n't It Be Nice , God Only Knows , I Just Was n't Made for These Times , and on and on . They 're already canonized.Instead , two points : 1 ) Do n't Talk -- This may be the most haunting pop song I 've ever heard , and maybe the only one to really capture the intensity of those moments of young love -- the strings and big hall ( or church ) sound imbue the feelings with a quasi-religious awe.Wilson 's genius shows nowhere more than in this masterful composition , a short but unpredictably twisting harmonic journey.2 ) Sloop John B. is the album 's one flaw . It just does n't belong here -- thematically it does n't fit with the album 's young love and growing pains , musically it 's lame and boring , lyrically it 's just flat out corny .	1
No , I 'm not going to downplay revolver of course people claim the album to be so underrated that this inversely makes it overrated , but lets not bother with those `` music elites '' . Pet Sounds is a brillian album that grabs you through the hands of mild encouragemnt and intimate desire of love and dreams . I think what is commonly misconceived is that this is an album and singling out certain aspects or comparign various songs to one another or to other bands is generically puerile . This album stands well on its own and I suppose if you want to be hip and original rag on it some more and be openly orginal and say the world never noticed Revolver and you understood its genius even though you were born in 1985 and were forcefed the history of the record by Amazon . I think there is a natural tendency to overrate the 1960s and Rolling Stone expemplifies this tendency through there much ambiguous `` top 100 albums of all time '' . But of course I understand . As long as Astral Weeks sits behind three Beatles albums on a top album list I 'll be assured that people tend to prefer direct catchiness and originality in form of production . and I 'll understand . Do n't mind astral weeks complete rejections of melody and experimental contortion of tune and rhythm . It 's much too boring . It does n't vary enough . Wawa . Revolver is so experimental ! ! ! Geez guys ... `` Tomorrow Never Knows . I love it . I 'm so original nobody understands it and I 'll explain why its so great . It the sitar.. theres so much going on . Great Great production ... . '' Wow . its a okay song that its just completely overproduced that sounds like a trip to another planet . You people make me sick.Yeah , so I 'm rambling . Is this a great album ? Yes . Do n't let anybody sway you anyway . Do n't just skip to tracks 1 and 8 and turn off your album . Do n't call tracks 2,3 , and 4 , the down part of the album . I 'm sorry you were expecting something that didnt toy with melodies so much and with much more underground , `` genius '' , production ? Maybe you should try Revolver . Those beatles ... .	1
Pet Sounds is one of those albums that you just sit and listen to and say & quot ; My God , these guys were truly amazing & quot ; . Brian Wilson was so far ahead of his time in regards to songwriting . I do n't however recommend this album to everyone . This album is not & quot ; packed & quot ; with hits , but it is far better than most anything you would buy today . If you are looking for a more radio friendly BBalbum , go with the greatest hits Vol . 1 . But if you have a little extra cash , but this and see why so many contemporary artists believe that this is one of the best albums ever made .	1
First off , I would like to start by saying the comparison between the Beach Boys and the Beatles is a rather silly one because it was never a fair comparison to begin with . The Beatles were exclusively a studio band from 1965 on . And all four Beatles plus George Martin participated in the creation of albums . The Beach Boys were totally different . Brian Wilson was the only Beach Boy to stop touring to work in the studio . For Pet Sounds , Wilson composed all the songs , arranged the instrumental and vocal parts , sang most of the leads , and produced the whole album . He did all this while having no formal training on musical composition , studio production , or sound engineering . I never hear of a `` John Lennon vs. Brian Wilson '' debate , or `` Paul McCartney vs. Brian Wilson '' , or even `` George Martin vs. Brian Wilson '' . Individually , he was unmatched because he did it all . Sadly , he lost his sanity before being able to fulfill his new working method to create more Beach Boys albums.All the praises Pet Sounds gets are well-deserved . Aside from the technological feat it accomplished , all the songs are magnificent , all unified by concept and quality . Every single track on this album is a finely-crafted masterpiece : sweeping , dreamy instrumentals with warm , embracing vocal arrangements , all painting pictures of youth and naive love . The melodies are soaring and lyrics seem deceivingly simple , which is just about the point . It 's heart and soul on put record , not some self-indulgent , overly-complex hogwash made for the sake of experimenting . Pet Sounds also has aged remarkably well . Those who pan this album as outdated and cheesy have probably been listening to too much grunge ( ie : the reviewer below ) . Hm , grunge , now THAT is something that has n't aged well.I own the Beatles albums Revolver , Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , and Abbey Road . But Pet Sounds , through its delicate charm , modesty , and sincereness , gets way more rotation in my player than any of my Beatles albums do . They do n't resonate with me as much as Pet Sounds does ; they are commercially popular , well done , and are classics . But that 's all I get out of them . Pet Sounds ' most noted competitor is Sgt . Pepper , but that album , more than anything else , is basically a collection of experiments made to top it.Forget the detractors and Beatles comparisons . Yes , the Beach Boys were the underdogs . WE KNOW . But the fact that one person can single-handedly influence and turn the heads of the biggest band in the world is quite extraordinary . This album will always be a true classic for the ages . Thanks Brian.P.S . - For those who think Pet Sounds is the Beach Boy 's only great album , All Summer Long , Today ! , and Friends are also terrific .	1
A caveat - the 5 stars are for the music . 4 stars for pressing ! Re : Pet Sounds and OK Computer Capitol vinyl reissues : These are better than the abysmal ( imo based on disraeli gears and tea for the tillerman ) `` back to black '' reissues.both the capitol reissue of ok computer and of pet sounds that i bought today are dead quiet and neither suffer from obvious digitalis . they do not sound as if they were recorded using the cd as the source , which many people have felt about the b to b pressings.the lead vocal on pet sounds is a tiny bit on the bright side ( though it may simply be more revealing of whats there - and my system is extremely revealing and cuts no slack in this direction ) , but it 's not brittle like tea for the tillerman is in places in the b to b series . comparing this mono pet sounds to the generally well thought of 1999 mono cap reissue i am hearing slightly better defined detail and slightly increased bass . the more distinct detail may proove to be an improvement or a detrement in the long run . i have to get used to it before i 'll be sure which i prefer ; but i sure as heck prefer the silence of this vinyl to every pressing i 've ever owned of pet sounds . its just great to hear no distracting noises during the oh so many sublime moments that Brian Wilson created for us ! this pressing of ok computer is more dynamic than my uk parlaphone which til now has been my preferred pressing . i have never been wowed by any vinyl or cd of ok c. it aint a sonic pleasure like the radio head lps that have come after it . this does not reverse that assessment of its sound quality ( the recording quality of ok c is what it is ) , but this does seem to be an improvement , at least a bit.certainly compared to the huge bummer that the back to black series offers , and especially as many of us have been afraid that it foretold that this was all the big record companies were prepared to offer , this comes as a positive tasting of the capitol reissue waters.so , at first listen i 'd say these will at minimum fill the void for those not having quiet ( or any ) copies of these titles and perhaps bring some small improvements for those lacking pristine wlp 's or first pressings . of course the rest of this series may be all over the place by comparison . this is a very hopeful 1st sampling though .	1
I 've always been deeply torn over `` Pet Sounds '' . For decades it has been regarded as a foundational album in rock history , and to some degree I agree with this . Brian Wilson , Paul McCartney and John Lennon were the visionary rock and roll artists who decided to write songs about more controversial topics than surfing with girls and driving cars fast , and `` Pet Sounds '' was unquestionably Wilson 's artistic peak . So it would only serve to follow that the album should fall into the position of legend . And it has . Rolling Stone logged it as # 2 , behind only `` Sergeant Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band '' , in its 2003 ranking of rock 's all time best albums.So what 's the dilemma ? I 've always been deeply troubled by awarding the term `` legend '' to an album that does n't meet with significant consumer response . I know that can be dangerous , because some albums are so far ahead of their time that commercial success is n't ready for it . Some would argue that this was the fate of `` Pet Sounds '' , but I 'm unconvinced . Two songs , `` Would n't It Be Nice '' and `` Sloop John B '' , hit the top 10 , and `` God Only Knows '' also was a top 40 hit . So the public still was ready for the Beach Boys sound ; they just did n't buy this album in droves.And therein lays my concern . A band that was as well established as the Beach Boys were not able to bring the public along with it as it progressed from hitmakers to serious musicians . And other artists have been clearly able to bring the public with them . The Beatles did it with `` Sergeant Pepper '' . The Rolling Stones did it with `` Let It Bleed '' . Pink Floyd did it with `` Dark Side Of The Moon '' . And in this millennium , Green Day did it with `` American Idiot '' . So most certainly , a shift in lyrical topics can be navigated successfully without a total sacrifice of success . I can accept that album sales were not as brisk for rock acts in the mid-1960 's , but `` Pet Sounds '' charted a lower peak ( # 10 ) than 10 of the 11 Beach Boys albums that came before it . Lyrical shifts are not just topical , but timely - and the audience of the Beach Boys was simply not ready for this album . So the question continues to rage - and I still do n't see this album as a true legend .	1
This album is universally regarded as the Beach Boys ' masterpiece , and who am I to disagree ? You might say that this was the band 's peak , but I would say that they actually peaked with the `` Good Vibrations '' single after this . But Pet Sounds is certainly their peak from an album standpoint . This album always ranks among the top ten albums of all time in any survey of critics , and rightly so . If you ca n't appreciate how great this album is , I feel sorry for you .	1
Again Capitol are doing such a justice to there remasters . This album made me fall in love with The Beach Boys and the art of collecting and listening to vinyl . This album is a masterpiece.Really wish they would re-release Smiley , smile . I would buy it in a heartbeat .	1
This album was and is McCartney 's inspiration for the rest of his musical life and that is saying something . Brian pulls out all the stops to make the Teenage angst Masterpiece and the song I just was n't made for these times is the anthem for those of us that ca n't seem to fit in with the cliques . Highly Recommended for music fans , especially musicians . Casual BB fans should not start here , get the greatest hits .	1
One of the truly hyped albums of all time that lives up to the lavish praise heaped upon it . Brian Wilson was a 23-year-old who was struggling to express himself in new aural forms , and made this masterwork . Somewhat surprisingly , it flopped . The liner notes detail the reasons : kitsch cover ( no doubt ) , automatic dislike of anything & quot ; Beach Boys & quot ; by those that would have liked it the most - hippies . It also paints Brian in a glowing light as working alone , without a songwriting partner like the Lennon/McCartney team , or without a guiding producer like George Martin . That he was such a young man working alone , against the advice of his manager , and created such a beautiful album is truly a testament to his musical genius . The songs speak for themselves , and everyone should know them by heart .	1
Not enough praise can be given to this magnificant and beautifull album that plays to the soul and shows you things about yourself that may have never known before.The album does not have one false note on the whole thing . Each song plays like a carfully constructed piece of pure music . It is to be compared with classical music . Spector may have invented the & quot ; wall of sound ' effect but Brian Wilson uses it here to pure perfection . From the wonderful music of & quot ; Would n't it be Nice & quot ; to the beautiful vocals of & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; to the heart-wrenching simplicity of & quot ; Caroline , No & quot ; the album tugs on your heart-strings and makes you think about live , living and just who you really are.Not enough can be said about this album . A must listen for ANYBODY who likes music . Go get it.Thanks .	1
I must admit , as someone who was not a real fan of The Beach Boys , I always considered themselves to be a `` Fun in the Sun '' type of band . However , as I became intrigued by The Beatles ' `` Sgt . Peppers Lonely Hears Club Band '' album , I soon became equally intrigued by The Beach Boys ' `` Pet Sounds '' . I soon learned that there was a bit of a rivalry that existed between the Beatles and the Beach Boys ' from a creative standpoint . It turns out that when the Beatles released `` Rubber Soul '' , Brian Wilson felt compelled to push himself to the creative max - and the result would be `` Pet Sounds '' - which in turn inspired the Beatles to do `` Sgt Pepper '' . With `` Pet Sounds '' , I discovered was an album that was n't the typical Beach Boys ' `` Fun in the Sun '' , but an album that would prove to be one of complex instrumentation and be years ahead of its time . This would be the result of the efforts of Brian Wilson - with some songwriting help from Tony Asher.Wilson incorporates probably one of the widest ranges of instruments that had been heard on any album in the Rock era . This includes Strings , Woodwinds , Brass , and a variety of percussion and interesting sounds ( bicycle bells , dog barking , etc ) . If one is to basically compare `` Sgt Pepper '' against `` Pet Sounds '' , `` Sgt Pepper '' may have stronger and more catchy lyrics , but Wilson 's musical arrangements on `` Pet Sounds '' have the slight edge . For all practical purposes , Wilson incorporates a four piece orchestra for many parts of this collection . Two instruments that really stand out on this collection are the use of Tympani Drums and Baritone SaxophoneOne thing that makes this collection so unique is you get two flavors of `` Pet Sounds '' . The first 13 tracks are the original tracks as they were recorded back in 1966 and released in mono . In 1997 , Brian Wilson would take those original masters from 1966 and create a Stereo version of those tracks - which are also included on this collection . This basically is a win-win for the listener . I found that I would appreciate the charm and originality of the mono recordings while I could also appreciate how well these tracks sounded when converted to Stereo . Each version brings a different listening experience . You will hear a little more distortion with the mono version , but that is to be expected . There is also a bonus track that was not included on the 1966 release called - `` Hang On to Your Ego '' .Here is a quick synopsis of the tracks : '' Would n't It Be Nice '' : This is one of the more popular tracks . It has the classic Beach Boys ' harmonies . This song is enhanced by the use of Tympani , Saxophones , and Mandolins '' You Still Believe in Me '' : Slight psychedelic feel . The use of bicycle horns gives this song some charm . The music from the Harpsichord , Clarinet , and Tympani are some of the highlights here . `` That 's Not Me '' : Not a bad song . Mike Love does a good job on vocals here and Glen Campbell contributes 12 string guitar . `` Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head on My Shoulder ) '' : A gentle song highlighted by gentle vocals by Brian . Even the use of the Tympani is softer here . Nice string arrangements here . `` I 'm Waiting for the Day '' : This sounds like a cross between psychedelic and Hawaiian sounds . The Tympanis and Bongos sound great here , but also Ukulele , Flute , and English Horns sound good as well - all will really give this a terrific sound '' Lets Go Away '' : I never thought of the Beach Boys as an instrumental group , but `` Pet Sounds '' gives us two instrumentals . This one has a nice soft classical music feel to it . `` Sloop John B '' : Here Brian rearranges a cover of this traditional song . There is a bit of Doo-Wop in here . The Baritone Saxophone is used well here . Brian and Mike do a great job sharing lead vocals . `` God Only Knows '' : Paul McCartney still calls this one of the greatest songs he ever heard - and with good reason . This song is perfection . Carl Wilson gets the nod to lead the vocals here and does n't let anyone down . The French Horns , Baritone Sax , Clarinet , and String Ensemble really help as well . This song is lyrically very strong and probably the best song done by the Beach Boys . `` I Know There 's An Answer '' : Mike and Alan Jardine share vocals here . Some more strong lyrics . More of a Doo Wop sound and more terrific Baritone Sax work . `` Here Today '' : Great horn arrangements highlight this song - especially the Baritone Sax '' I Just Was n't Made For These Times '' : Lots of interesting percussion sounds on here . The Tympani and Baritone Sax stand out here again . `` Pet Sounds '' : The title track and another instrumental . Wilson admits to this having a James Bond psychedelic sound . More Baritone Sax and Percussions '' Caroline Ho '' : The train sound and the sounds of Brian 's dogs barking at the end of this song are most remembered . There is some nice Ukulele on this song . Brian does a great job on the lead vocals , but great harmonies by the Beach Boys . `` Hang On To Your Ego '' : This is the bonus track . Baritone Sax is the highlight here again . However , Brian 's vocals might be the strongest of any track on this album.The liner notes are incredible . You get a short `` letter '' from Brian Wilson about his perspectives on `` Pet Sounds '' . David Leaf has a two terrific write-ups - one is more of a biographical point of view of `` Pet Sounds '' while the other talks about the making of the `` Pet Sounds '' album . There are track by track notes that include commentary by Brian . You also get a Sessionography of all of the participating musicians in `` Pet Sounds '' . `` Pet Sounds '' might not be the best selling album in history , but it most certainly merits its place in music history . Highly recommended .	1
To those who have n't a clue ... ... . Listen again . You 're missing it ! ! ! ! One of the greatest albums ever ? Deceptively so ! You have to understand first that Brian Wilson 's genius was taking sophisticated musical ideas and making them accessible - almost simple . As in `` Do n't Talk '' you must `` listen ! listen ! listen ! '' ( By the way , one of the finest moments of this album ) .Brian Wilson was also a master at moving each of these songs through time . Although the musical/lyrical elements making up each song are staggering , every track moves effortlessly and unencumbered . The melody of `` God Only Knows '' for example , is understatement at best moving over layers of complex harmonies/sounds/vocals through a unsentimental steady chiming . A masterpiece . I just ca n't get enough of that song . Absolutely breathtaking . The pity is that so many people `` Frank Sinatra '' the song and absolutely butcher it . There should be law against it.I have to admit I 'm no Beatles fan -- - I ` m sure they 're great - history and legions of fans say so - I just do n't happen to `` get '' them -- -I just do n't hear it -- -- There is not one Beatles song that I have ever heard that I liked enough to listen to again . ( I 've heard many countless times - not by my choice . ) And I have never listened to an entire Beatle 's album through . I just do n't get how `` Yellow Submarine '' compares to `` God Only Knows . '' I guess I need to listen to an entire album to get a clue . As a previous reviewer stated - it 's comparing apples and oranges . The level of sophistication as far as I can tell is directed in different areas . The Beatles were clever , musically gifted and creative . Brian Wilson was ( still is - up for debate ) a genius - like I said ... .. apples and oranges ... ... Getting back to `` Pet Sounds '' a musician can easily discern the musical genius , however ( as someone previously stated ) for the average listener ( and musician alike ) it 's an experience that has to `` hit you '' . It 's either there or not . You either `` get it '' or you `` do n't . `` So for those of you who do n't have a clue , if you will give `` Pet Sounds '' another try , I 'll give the Beatles ' a listen or two or three or four ... .. Maybe we 'll both `` get '' it .	1
`` Let 's Go Away For Awhile '' is an instrumental piece from The Beach Boys legendary album `` Pet Sounds '' . Who knows instrumentals in the same style and near the same sound like `` Let 's Go Away For Awhile '' ? I love this music piece and want to know similars . Can you help me ? Please write to leif.boysen @ xp-win.com	1
Alright , heres the thing . I was under the assumption this was better than Sgt . Pepper and Rubber Soul , but after purchasing , I know differetly . It 's unfair to compare the Beach Boys and the Beatles , for one . Also , this album does n't have the emotional backing promised . There is some there , but mostly it is backed by Brian Wilson 's melodies . The Beach Boys mainly had Brian doing everything while the Beatles had Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and George Martin to produce . Now , with that aside , let 's look at the album pretending there were no Beatles : & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; - One of the 5 best songs on the album & quot ; You Still Believe In Me & quot ; - I must be missing something , it 's not as good as the first track even. & quot ; That 's Not Me & quot ; - This is too simple a song. & quot ; Do n't Talk & quot ; - I like this song . It says what it needs to say , and does it effectively . Another one of the good 5 . & quot ; I 'm Waiting For The Day & quot ; - I connected with this song . I do n't like the melody all that way , but it has the emotions needed . Another one of the good 5. & quot ; Let 's Go Away For A While & quot ; - This is why it ca n't compare to the Beatles ( sorry , I had to bring this up ) . When they wanted to say something , they wrote original lyrics . This is simply a symphonic tune . It 's a pretty tune , but I do n't feel like going away for a while now. & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; - I know this is on here to help sell it , and thats ok . It 's a nice song . It has no meaning , really , but it 's a pretty song , like all Wilson 's songs. & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; - THE best song on here , THEIR best song ever . It is one of the most beautiful love songs ever written and I can hear the love in Carl Wilson 's voice . Number 1 on the album. & quot ; I Know There 's An Answer & quot ; - Sounds pseudo-psychadelic . But it does n't say anything to me , maybe because I do n't understand its references to the LSD thing talked about in the booklet. & quot ; Here Today & quot ; - Simply a pop tune , like most of their others . Maybe he was trying to talk about himself , but it seems like he was more concerned about selling it than writing it with emotion. & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; - Good song . Not one of my good 5 , but it 's number 6 . I understand what he is saying here. & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; - Another instrumental , which really does n't have a place on a Pop/Rock album . The title track , but I really do n't feel anything from it. & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; - The number 2 song on the album . Very , very good . This and & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; -types are what this album should have been filled with to be called the & quot ; greatest album ever & quot ; by MOJO magazine.I like this album , it has beautiful songs . But , it should n't be called an emotional trip or the & quot ; greatest ever & quot ; beacuse , well , frankly , it is n't . It is n't even really much of a landmark album . I do n't see how it changed the course of music , except with semi-inventing the concept album . But Brian got caught up in competing with the Beatles and blew it . If you like the Beach Boys , this is worth it . If you like good POP music , this is still worth it . But do n't buy it expecting the greatest thing since sliced-bread like me and get disappointed . Oh , and the stereo versions are n't that good , either . The mono part is MUCH better .	1
This album is the showcase that Brian wilson begged his label to let him make . What you see here represents the greatest album of American history , and shows what music hacks the Beatles were . Everything that Paul and John wanted to be , Brian Wilson captures with his soulful , mournful songs . Pet Sounds captures youthful exuberance mixed with typical teenage depression-simultaneously . Pet Sounds is n't the peak of the Beach Boys harmonizing style . This is a Brian Wilson production through and through , Mike Love did n't even like this album . While only a modest commercial success , it only gets stronger with age .	1
Agree with the other 2 reviews ( to date ) that this is easily the best sounding version of Pet Sounds . Sound is fuller , lusher , more relaxed , more present . Great great job by MFSL on this Pet Sounds digital remaster . Nice packaging as well , with CD inner sleeve .	1
Are there still any music fans out there who *haven't* heard of this album ? Back when rock was maturing and growing more sophisticated , and groups were starting to produce & quot ; concept & quot ; albums , Brian Wilson discared the formulas that made the Beach Boys- Sun , Surf , Cars and Girls- and wrote and produced an intensely personal album that was n't all that popular in its time . Since then it 's been called a work of genius , Brian Wilson 's & quot ; Sargent Pepper & quot ; and other laudatory titles.It 's certainly a great album , and perhaps an important album , and without a doubt the most musically sophisticated of the Beach Boys ' albums ; it also contains what may be the best song Brian Wilson ever wrote ( God Only Knows , which Paul McCartney called & quot ; the perfect pop song ) . It 's not really a concept album , though . The songs range from the great ( & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; , & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; ) through the mundane , and & quot ; Sloop John B. & quot ; is hardly a Beach Boys song , popular though the single was . Most of the songs are Wilson 's personal statements that , while musically sophisticated , reveal an almost embarassingly adolescent outlook- and perhaps his coming breakdown as well.And yet for all this it 's still a magnificent album , musically and lyrically . Required listening for all Beach Boys fans , 60s music fans , and fans of lyrical pop music of all ages .	1
Being a Beatles fan I have heard about this album for many years . They say Brain Wilson made this album due to the Beatles & # 34 ; Rubber Soul & # 34 ; . Because of & # 34 ; Pet Sounds & # 34 ; they say it influenced the Beatles to come back with & # 34 ; Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Heart 's Club Band & # 34 ; . If you like true studio music this is a great CD for your music collection .	1
As a landlocked kid growing up without ready access to beaches or a car , I had a hard time relating to the Beach Boys . Their celebrations of sun , surfing , and hot-rodding were too removed from my own experience . It was n't until I got older that I appreciated them . Songs that had once sounded frivolous suddenly revealed multiple layers of emotions which had previously eluded me.Mind you , that was n't true of every Beach Boys song . But classics like `` Surfer Girl '' and `` Do n't Worry Baby '' were wistful and beautiful evocations of love and longing - both questioning and reassuring.Brian Wilson then outdid himself with his compositions for the landmark 1966 album `` Pet Sounds '' - their apex and finest achievement - and arguably the greatest record ever released by an American band . Paul McCartney has said that if you have n't heard it , your musical education is n't complete . He further said it inspired the Beatles to make `` Sgt . Pepper '' . I do n't really hear `` Pet Sounds '' influence on that record , but I do on `` Abbey Road '' - especially on tracks like `` Because '' and `` Here Comes The Sun King '' .This CD contains the full album in mono and stereo . Wilson 's musical and vocal arrangements still sound stunning to this day . If for any reason you 've resisted buying this , you should n't . At the very minimum , any serious music fan should own `` Pet Sounds '' and a good collection of their hits such as `` Sounds Of Summer '' ( 2003 ) .Wilson 's solo career has also been of interest . `` Brian Wilson '' ( 1988 ) was a good one . So was the belatedly completed `` Smile '' ( 2004 ) , which was originally intended as the follow-up to `` Pet Sounds '' - wherein he proved himself to be a latter-day Gershwin . `` Smile '' collaborator Van Dyke Parks and Wilson had previously released the excellent `` Orange Crate Art '' ( 1995 ) . Recently , Wilson issued `` That Lucky Old Sun '' ( 2008 ) , another innovative song suite in the style of `` Smile '' - and it 's fine . All are highly recommended.Whether you live in California or not , do n't miss out on the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson .	1
There 's not much I can say about this album that has n't been said millions of times before . These compositions are simply amazing , and incredibly beautiful . The vocal melodies , arrangements , lyrics , virtually every thing about this album is perfect . For those familiar with the material ( and who is n't familiar with at least some of it ) but not familiar with this latest version , the new stereo mix is fantastic . It makes great use of the stereo seperation , but without blatantly changing the sound of the songs . Its the only version I listen to , but the original mono recording is included as well for purists.A note to detractors , and those making unfavorable comparisons to Sgt . Pepper : Sgt . Pepper is an equally brilliant album , arguing which is 'better ' is pointless . Still , you naysayers would do well to consider that Pet Sounds was released a year earlier , and that The Beatles did Sgt . Pepper as a direct response to Pet Sounds in an attempt to top it , and they had a vast amount of money and the help of producer George Martin with which to do it .	1
This is the Greatest Album EVER ! ! ! ! Better than anything the beatles ever released ... YEAH ! ! ! !	1
One of the most emotional , heartfelt offerings of the rock-n-roll era , 1966 's Pet Sounds is Brian Wilson 's open love-letter to the world.Mature , yet disarmingly innocent , Brian 's orchrestrated arrangements and timeless melodies lure the listener over and over . The true knockout punch , however , is Pet Sounds ' ability to strike a universal chord through its lyrical themes of love , isolation and self-doubt . Brian lays his heart on the line and in the process brings us along for the ride.The youthful optimism of & quot ; Would n't it be Nice & quot ; and & quot ; You Still Believe in Me & quot ; -- the set 's opening tracks -- soon yields to the confusion of young-adulthood in the sparse & quot ; That 's Not Me & quot ; . This haunting , stripped-down track features what is arguably Mike Love 's finest and most understated lead vocal.The gorgeous & quot ; Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head on my Shoulder ) & quot ; is anchored by session ace Carole Kaye 's gentle bassline which pushes Brian 's vocal to the brink of heartache . Seconds after Brian pleas for us to & quot ; Listen , listen , listen ... & quot ; a classical string quartet rises to the forefront , driving the track to an emotional climax . At the this precise moment the shear weight of the arrangement relays Brian 's pain more effectively than words ever could . ( To fully appreciate this moment , listen to the remastered Stereo mix through a pair of headphones . ) Equally stunning in terms of production and emotion are the twin classics & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; and & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; . & quot ; Caroline & quot ; , the album 's closing track , is a paean to a simpler , happier time -- a elusive time never to be recaptured . & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; , The Beach Boys ' greatest love song , ponders life without love and the innate human ability to rebound in times of darkness . Carl Wilson delivers what is perhaps the most beautiful lead vocal ever recorded -- two and a half minutes of angelic bliss.Of course , the anthemic & quot ; I Just Was n't Made for These Times & quot ; , neatly symbolizes both the commercial failure of & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; upon its initial release and the well-documented troubles of Brian Wilson himself . Brian gave his all during the creation of this masterpiece and in the process nearly lost everything so dear to him.If & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; is n't the greatest album ever made , it 's darn close . Perhaps the Beatles , who achieved pop-perfection on & quot ; Rubber Soul & quot ; and & quot ; Revolver & quot ; , did equal , or perhaps even surpassed Brian 's masterpiece . But , that 's not the point -- the point is , quite simply , that because of records like & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; and & quot ; Rubber Soul & quot ; this troubled world is a better place .	1
Pet Sounds is one of those albums ( like Sgt . Peppers , Born To Run or Exile On Main St. ) that have been reviewed and analyzed to death . But the reason why it has garnered so much critical attention is that it truly one of the most original and groundbreaking albums in rock history . Brian Wilson had spent the previous few years writing and producing magnificent singles , but had yet made a truly great album . Spurred on by The Beatles ' Rubber Soul and his idol , Phil Spector , Mr. Wilson set about to make an album that raised the bar on what could be achieved on a pop album . He succeeded on every level . Pet Sounds is one of the most literate , intricate and lavishly produced albums ever released . The other band members were limited to just providing vocals on the album as Mr. Wilson employed studio musicians to provide the music . Despite this fact , the band never sounded better as they provide the luscious harmonies that make the songs practically float out of your speakers . The songs were no longer about surfing and cars , but about more mature relationships and growing up . & quot ; Would n't Be Nice & quot ; is a beautiful song about wanting to get married that hit number 8 on the charts , & quot ; You Still Believe In Me & quot ; is an airy number about a woman standing by her man , & quot ; Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder ) & quot ; is another gorgeous melody and & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; is a traditional song that was the album 's biggest hit peaking at number 2 . & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; is another brilliant introspective number from Brian Wilson and & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; is a beautiful ballad that closes the original album out and was actually released as solo recording by Mr. Wilson . & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; is perhaps the most heartbreakingly beautiful song the band has ever recorded and is the essence of the album . Carl Wilson gives his hands down best lead vocal and the song is a virtual symphony . Pet Sounds was not a big hit in the US , peaking at number 10 , as Americans wanted songs about sun and fun in the sun . But in England , the album was a huge success peaking at number 2 and blew the minds of the British musicians . One in particular , Paul McCartney called it the greatest album ever made and it was The Beatles ' inspiration for recording Sgt . Pepper 's . Brian Wilson tried to top Pet Sounds with Smile , but that album was never to be . Pet Sounds stands as The Beach Boys greatest album and one the best of all time .	1
Pet Sounds is an album that is totally beyond comparison . To call it the best pop album ever is an understatement , and also a little misleading . This music is beyond categorization as & quot ; pop & quot ; -- it 's simply brilliant , idiosyncratic MUSIC . That being said , there is nothing in the history of recorded music that even touches the sheer genius of this record . Every microsecond of sound is so carefully considered and perfectly arranged that the result is the most emotionally touching collection of songs you 'll ever hear . It is impossible to overrate Pet Sounds . It is unlike anything that came before or after . Nothing in the Beatles ' over-hyped catalog even comes close -- and anything that might be in the same general proximity is rightly credited more to George Martin 's production than the & quot ; Fab Four & quot ; . Remember , Pet Sounds is the work of one singular musical imagination -- Brian uses the Boys as & quot ; instruments & quot ; -- composed , arranged , produced/assembled , dreamed as a coherent whole.This album should be heard by EVERYONE , whatever you believe your musical to be . It is one of the great works of Western Civilization for us to study , consider and enjoy . Beyond essential.This version offers the original Mono mix as well as a new Stereo mix . Obviously , it should be heard in the original Mono to be fully appreciated , but I 'll be the first to admit the Stereo is REALLY good , offering a sense of spaciousness and natural sound that is hard to criticize . It 's not a substitute for the original , but a great addendum . Honestly , the best version is the DCC & quot ; gold & quot ; disc which is mastered with such attention to detail that it has an almost intangible like-like quality not even present on the original LP . But , I own about 7 different copies and versions of this album on various format , and this & quot ; two-fer & quot ; offeres excellent sound an value .	1
Yes . Playing this album is like remembering a prayer or going to a place of refuge . It is a spiritual experience as well as a musical experience . Pet Sounds is over 40 years old and is still timeless in every way . I am obsessed with the sounds , the melodies , the lyrics , the harmonies , and the beauty . I will listen to Pet Sounds a million times , but a million times would not be enough . I will listen to it forever . Maybe someday there will be a Super Audio CD of Pet Sounds like there is 5.1 Surround Sound of it on DVD . Long live Pet Sounds !	1
I must confess , I bought Pet Sounds out of curiosity , since it has been ranked as one of the best albums in history , behind the Beatles ' Sgt . Pepper . In addition , I also confess that before Pet Sounds I had very limited knowledge of the Beach Boys and/or Brian Wilson 's music and after playing it once I sincerely say : PET SOUNDS IS INDEED A MASTERPIECE CRAFTED BY A GIFTED ARTIST ! ! ! .The 40th Anniversary edition comes with a wonderful DVD that documents the making of this album through interviews and original footage , plus a video showing a visit Sir George Martin made to Brian Wilson 's home.This album is a MUST-HAVE for music fans , and I totally agree with Sir Paul McCartney 's views on this album ( printed on the CD 's booklet ) , expressing that `` NOBODY IS TRULY MUSICALLY EDUCATED WITHOUT LISTENING TO PET SOUNDS ''	1
... pop albums going back or forward in time . Let 's face it , there is more to good songs and music than youth-oriented rock . I was in 8th grade when this album came out , and always liked it alot , and the funny thing is not until maybe 30 years later , did I ever meet anyone who liked it much . But I 've always been a big BBoys fan . & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; is among the finest compositions ever , and , along with a handful of Brian 's songs , deserves inclusion in the 20th Century canon , along with Gershwin 's and Kern 's best , etc . I heard a beautiful recording of this by a Canadian children 's choir , which sounds better than the BBoys.Beyond this , most the tunes seem to be about late adolescent angst , high production value or not . As one gets into the Middle Years of life , can anyone really praise & quot ; Would n't it be Nice & quot ; , or & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; to the Sky ? They remind me of whining choir boys , stretching to hit a note . Yes , Brian was looking for a new sound at the time , but on this record there is almost none of the fun and whimsy so obvious in their earlier work . It 's true they were still very young ( mid- 20 's probably ) when they did PET SOUNDS..The songs with Mike singing the lead come off better , like & quot ; I Know there 's an Answer & quot ; , & quot ; Here Today & quot ; , and & quot ; I 'm Waiting for the Day & quot ; , with the high pitched Wilson brothers doing the backgrounds . Along with their own SURFS UP , this is among the great late 60 's , early 70 's pop/rock albums . Yes , it 's up there with the best of the Beatles , Simon and Garfunkel , and the Byrds . But 's let 's not go overly gaga on it ! Brian another Mozart or Handel ? ? Come on , let 's not overdo a good thing !	1
One thing was always clear when one discussed the most popular artists or bands from the 1960 's , The Beach Boys were near the top of each and every list and at one time in the 1960 's were voted the most popular band . Sultry vocals and harmonies , great songwriting about things that most people , in the U.S. in particular , could understand and relate to , being on the beach , cars and girls . However , Brian began to want to explore more in music and draw on the rich and outstanding wellspring of musical genius he had within him . This began to eat him up inside as the record label and those within his own band , Mike Love in particular , could n't nor would n't allow themselves to understand . I 've heard many reasons for his nervous breakdowns but I believe this to be the catalyst.This was a man who was hearing wonderful musical themes in his head and was not being allowed the time , space and creative freedom to explore and bring these themes into fruition . On top of that , the `` British Invasion '' was in full swing and those artists and bands were bringing a fresh perspective on music , both it 's recording and production , to the world as well as the `` Motown Sound '' topping the charts with one great artist after another . Fate typically does things when least expected and fate saw an exhausted Wilson being home recuperating from his breakdown at just the time the `` Rubber Soul '' album was being released by the Beatles . It would be the album that helped to validate the direction Wilson was feeling his music and that of The Beach Boys should be going.He found his creative `` second wind '' and with the help of friend and lyricist Tony Asher , he begin to compose , write , produce and record the songs that would become `` Pet Sounds . '' It was truly an ambitious project and one that would change the face of not just rock music but music in general forever . When his fellow band mates returned off of the remainder of the tour Brian had left , he had basically the entire project completed except for the vocals . Once the other members , along with Brian , laid down their gorgeous vocals which , as usual , were one of the many strengths of the album , they had completed a true game changer and neither they nor the music world would be the same . This album would inspire a whole host of artists to change their entire perspective on how songs should be both written and recorded.Paul McCartney took a copy to John Lennon and they listened to it over and over again until it became engrained in their thought processes . George Martin , their brilliant producer , also was listening to the album and it was now the catalyst for what would become `` Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . '' Funny how fate and destiny work , is n't it ? Bravo to you Mr. Brian Wilson , I recently listened to this album from beginning to end and marveled at what was produced . You and Mr. Asher created a masterpiece that truly changed the music world and more importantly , validated your true genius.P.S . Here 's what others were saying about the album and Brian Wilson : Eric Clapton stated that `` All of us , Ginger Baker , Jack Bruce and I consider Pet Sounds to be one of the greatest pop LPs to ever be released . It encompasses everything that 's ever knocked me out and rolled it all into one . `` Elton John has said of the album , `` For me to say that I was enthralled would be an understatement . I had never heard such magical sounds , so amazingly recorded . It undoubtedly changed the way that I , and countless others , approached recording . It is a timeless and amazing recording of incredible genius and beauty . `` Beatles producer George Martin stated that `` Without Pet Sounds , Sgt . Pepper would n't have happened ... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds . `` Paul McCartney has said `` It was Pet Sounds that blew me out of the water . I love the album so much . I 've just bought my kids each a copy of it for their education in life . I figure no one is educated musically 'til they 've heard that album . I love the orchestra , the arrangements . It may be going overboard to say it 's the classic of the century , but to me , it certainly is a total , classic record that is unbeatable in many ways . I 've often played Pet Sounds and cried . I played it to John [ Lennon ] so much that it would be difficult for him to escape the influence , it was the record of the time . The thing that really made me sit up and take notice was the bass lines and also , putting melodies in the bass line . That I think was probably the big influence that set me thinking when we recorded Pepper , it set me off on a period I had then for a couple of years of nearly always writing quite melodic bass lines . `` God Only Knows '' is a big favourite of mine , very emotional , always a bit of a choker for me , that one . On `` You Still Believe in Me '' , I love that melody - that kills me . That 's my favourite , I think , it 's so beautiful right at the end comes surging back in these multi-coloured harmonies , sends shivers up my spine . `` Bob Dylan has said of Brian Wilson 's talents , `` That ear - I mean , Jesus , he 's got to will that to the Smithsonian . `` Roger Waters stated that along with Sgt Pepper , Pet Sounds `` completely changed everything about records for me . `` Elvis Costello stated `` Last summer , I heard `` Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder ) '' played on the cello . It sounded beautiful and sad , just as it does on Pet Sounds . `` Pete Townshend stated `` 'God Only Knows ' is simple and elegant and was stunning when it first appeared ; it still sounds perfect '' .Tom Petty stated `` I think I would put him up there with any composer - especially Pet Sounds . I do n't think there is anything better than that , necessarily . I do n't think you 'd be out of line comparing him to Beethoven - to any composer . ''	1
I 've been a big fan of sixties music all my life - Beatles , Who , Byrds , Dylan , Stones , Band , Hendrix , Simon & Garfunkel , Small Faces , Springfield , CCR , etc . - all great . `` California Girls '' and , especially , `` Good Vibrations '' rank with some of the very best 60s songs . But , despite listening to Pet Sounds many times , and really trying to like it , I just do n't get it . There should be no question that the music production is absolutely , innovatively , exquisite . Some of the melodies are great , but most are merely good . The lyrics are often silly or preppy , even for 1966 . And , while the vocals are lush and generally beautiful , the vocalists seem mostly detached from the subject matter . `` God Only Knows '' is thoroughly excellent , while `` Sloop John B '' is pretty cool . `` Would n't It Be Nice '' is a terrific melody , but matched to mediocre , wimpy lyrics . I have to force myself to listen to much of the rest of the album . So , I 'd give this album five stars for production , three and a half stars for songs , and three and a half stars for vocals . Personally , I would rather hear great songs poorly produced , than mediocre songs perfectly produced . I would certainly welcome a convincing argument that it 's better than four stars !	1
By far the best Beach Boys album ( and the best Brian Wilson album , along with the recently unearthed treasure `` Smile '' ) . The harmonies and lyrics in the songs are perfect , and remain timeless no matter how many times you listen to it or how many years have passed since this masterpeice first hit the shelves . It was n't a big hit in the States , mostly due to the fact nobody was ready for it . It 's such a well-organized and cohesive work , much unlike what people were used to the Beach Boys putting out at the time . They decided to be something more than just a surf band , or a catchy and trendy pop band , something which nobody gave them credit for . Compare `` God Only Knows '' to `` 409 '' or `` Surfin ' Safari '' , and you shall understand what I mean . The melodies are perfect , and blend greatly with the vocals . This is a rare album without a single track to be skipped . If you have n't caught on yet , freaking buy this !	1
Does everyone already know that the title track , Pet Sounds , was an instrumental piece written specifically for a James Bond movie and then rejected by the film 's producers ? For anyone who thinks they know or love this album , the Pet Sounds Box Set is a must . People will never fully realize the Perfected Magnificence of Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys until they analyze these Pet Sounds compositions and arrangements broken down - 'instrumental only ' and 'vocals only ' - through a pair of really high-quality headphones .	1
can anyone dispute the fact that this is one of the best albums in all of rock and roll history ? no they can not , can they dispute the fact that it is better than sergeant peppers , yes they can ... have at it music people ; )	1
Brian Wilson 's genius is often cited as being with only harmony , but on this wonderful album , he has such a huge amount of orchestrated madness , it takes a back seat . From the overally optimistic & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; , to the simply listener absorbing & quot ; That 's Not Me & quot ; , this album runs the gamut and does so like no other I have ever heard . & quot ; God Only Knows & quot ; and & quot ; Sloop John B & quot ; alone make this a classic on par with & quot ; Sgt . Pepper & quot ; . I know I 'll never forget hearing Wilsons ' pleadingly honest vocal on & quot ; I Just Was n't Made For These Times & quot ; . He could n't have been more right . He was made for all times , and this album is testament to his greatness . Buy it so you have something of intricate value to share with your grandkids .	1
Just lay back and listen . Brian Wilson never misses a note . His voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop . His composing and arranging skills are without peer and he even plays some awesome bass ( the slow middle eight section on & quot ; Would n't It Be Nice & quot ; ) on this album . These songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling both excited and uncertain . Recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the Beach Boys themselves , this is a true pop magnum opus . The best tracks are the gorgeous & quot ; You Still Believe In Me & quot ; , & quot ; Do n't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder & quot ; ) , the title cut , and the tear inducing & quot ; Caroline No & quot ; . Instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity , Brian Wilson invites you into his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that have n't aged a day since 1966 . The more you listen to & quot ; Pet Sounds & quot ; , the more it 's beauty envelopes you .	1
After years of being a session player for tons of `` Big Name '' acts , Leon fianally went out on his own to record this album ( now released and remastered on CD ) . It was time to ask many of the folks who he 'd worked for to contribute here on this these tracks . Well , it was n't hard , they all wanted to be a part of his first release . George Harrison guitar playing on Leon 's first album led to his participation in the first rock and roll benefit concerts , the `` Concert for Bangladesh.This album was released on Shelter Records , owned by Leon and producer Denny Cordell , along with early albums by Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers , Phoebe Snow and The Gap Band , also three albums that Leon produced and played on for the great blues guitarist , Freddie King . In the 1970 's Leon was established as a major live performer and was reported by Billboard Magazine to be the top concert attraction in the world by 1973 . Many different performers OPENED for Leon in this period including Elton John , ZZ Top , Willie Nelson and Charlie Daniels.This was his first effort on the way to the top . Your collection of the era will not be complete without this CD ... ENJOY !	1
Like many others , I first discovered Leon on Joe Cocker 's Mad Dogs and Englishmen album . Although the entire album is great , Russell 's performance of `` Hummingbird '' was an instant favorite . I liked his voice so much I had to get this album , and it was certainly money well spent . `` Hummingbird '' is even better here , complete with the spirited outtro chorus that really makes the song . One of the surprises was the opening track , `` A Song For You , '' which has become something of a standard in its own right . This is truly one of the most beautiful and heartfelt love ballads I 've ever heard , and an amazingly low-key way to start an album . Many people are familiar with the song `` Delta Lady , '' which was written by Leon but originally recorded by Joe Cocker . I think it 's safe to say that the Master 's own amazing version of `` Delta Lady '' is actually better than Cocker 's by a long shot ( although I love both ) . Being his signature song , it embodies almost every style he has become known for . `` Delta Lady '' is not only Leon 's best song , it is one of the all-time greatest songs in popular music . Another highlight is `` Pisces Apple Lady , '' although I wish it was a little longer ! As for the rest of the album , the raucous tunes are tons of fun to listen to , and Russell is clearly a very skilled musician and songwriter . There is an equal blend of rock , blues , and gospel styles , all tinged with a bit of slightly inebriated country ( the inebriation being most pronounced during `` Give Peace A Chance '' ) . It 's obvious that everyone involved ( many of them very famous and respected in their own right ) had a blast making this album . I do n't really know why some people say he 's an acquired taste ... if you ca n't acquire a taste for this there must be something wrong . A very great album , highly recommended to all .	1
Star power galore on this cd.Leon Russell at his best.Great songwriting as well as great musicianship.They dont make them like this anymore ... ... ... ..support your favorite artists .	1
Leon Russell is easily one of the most underrated and underappreciated artists of all time . This , his first solo album ( although when listing his albums in chronological order , I list the earlier recorded but later released & quot ; Asylum Choir 2 & quot ; as his first ) is the one that people should get into to become familiar with Leon 's interesting musical mix . Blues , country , rock and gospel all fuse together into something some people have called Okie-Swamp music . Whatever you call it , it is incredibly infectious . And the Gold Disc is the way to go on this release because not only do you get the original order of the album ( which places Russell 's odd cover of Dylan 's & quot ; Master of War & quot ; into proper context ) , you get the original cover art ( with the famous Shelter egg in the top left hand corner of the sleeve ) , and a great number of bonus tracks including a sped up version of his Asylum-era & quot ; Sweet Home Chicago , & quot ; ( now called & quot ; The New Sweet Home Chicago & quot ; ) an awesome jam between Leon and Eric Clapton , an alternate version of & quot ; Shootout on the Plantation , & quot ; a great unreleased track ( & quot ; Indian Girl & quot ; ) and & quot ; Shine a Light & quot ; which features Leon on piano , Ringo Starr on drums and Mick Jagger singing ( oddly enough , this song is credited to Leon Russell here but when it turned up later on & quot ; Exile on Main Street , & quot ; it was credited to Jagger and Richards ... truth be told , it sounds more Jagger and Richards to me ) . Aside from the bonus tracks , the album has been remastered back to its original mix ( the album version of & quot ; Shootout on the Plantation & quot ; sounds more piano laden ) and all of the studio banter and stops and starts have survived . And on top of all of this , & quot ; Delta Lady , & quot ; & quot ; A Song For You , & quot ; & quot ; Hummingbird , & quot ; & quot ; Roll Away the Stone & quot ; and & quot ; Pieces Apple Lady & quot ; have never sounded better . This is the first time Leon put out so many great tracks on one album . Later , he would make more profound albums , more personal albums , more diverse albums and more complex albums but he never made a more fun album .	1
From early sessions with the Byrds , and production ally to Phil Spector , to arranging Gary Lewis & The Playboys lightweight fare , Leon Russell was well known inside the music world of the 1960s . With this first album tour-de-force , many in the late '60s rock intelligensia paid tribute to his participation and influence on their own work . From delta soul to gospel tinged rock & roll , Leon Russell hits all of the high notes that would define his career . As noted in earlier reviews , `` A Song For You '' and `` Hummingbird '' are stellar tunes , and `` Hurtsome Body '' and `` Delta Lady '' keep pace . But , for me , the true highlights are the rampaging `` Shoot Out On The Plantation '' and `` Prince Of Peace '' . Both songs capture Russell at his best with both lyrical clarity and musical muscle powering the performance . This album , coupled with `` Asylum Choir II '' with Marc Benno ( recorded a year earlier but of the same vintage musically ) , capture the Leon Russell that we all loved . He would make other significant albums but , as is so often the case , the first major work defines all that is to come . The promise of Russell 's first album was sustained well into the middle 1970s , and the art that resulted is now ours forever . When I first heard this record in the summer of 1970 , I was mesmerized . Now , 36 years later , the music is as fresh and original as it was then ... only improved with the understanding that the intervening years have conferred . And then , of course , it 's just great listening ... made when American rock was still exploring the possibilities . Russell found a unique corner to define ... and a made it his own . If you have n't listened to this for awhile , put it on and indulge . If you do n't already have it , buy it . You 'll never regret it .	1
I try not to give five star reviews lightly , but in this case the temptation is too strong to resist . The mood is a relaxed , peaceful , vaguely sybaritic . There is enough rhythmic excitement here to keep the music from being labelled new age , but the album has the same aversion to disonance or hard rock beats that we associate with new age music . The musicianship is first rate , with the interplay between band members a joy to experience . I never seem to tire of this album . This is melodic music with enough musical sophistication to avoid ever becoming cloying . One of my favorite jazz albums .	1
This is a great `` cool age '' Jazz album . You could sit , dim the lights , push yourself back in a recliner ( with or without a martini ) and just groove . . . . Stan Getz is truly an icon of this style .	1
Getz did not like this album because he felt that it should have been more authentic i.e . use more Brazilian artists . I am a fan of authenticity , but I also recognize great music when I hear it . This album was a huge hit and deservedly so . Charlie Byrd may not be a Carioca , but he was a hell of an acoustic guitar player . Getz is Getz .	1
Bossa nova music was created largely by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Joo Gilberto in the late 1950s and early 1960s . When Charlie Byrd and his trio heard it , they wanted to make a bossa nova album of their own . The result is this wonderful CD.The CD track set opens with an extended version of `` Desafinado . '' The guitar gets plenty of air time in bossa nova music ; and Charlie Byrd 's guitar solo stuns me with its beauty and sensitivity . `` Desafinado '' plays with a few key changes to enhance the quality of the number ; and the percussion works very well , too . `` Samba Dees Days '' picks up the tempo considerably ; and this ought to brighten any party you play this at ! Stan Getz plays tenor sax to perfection ; and Buddy Deppenschmidt along with Bill Reichenbach play the drums very , very well . `` Samba Triste '' is the only truly mournful sounding samba on this album ; the minor keys work very well as Stan 's melancholy solo enhances the forlorn flavor to `` Samba Triste . `` `` Samba De Uma Nota S & oacute ; ( One Note Samba ) '' exudes elegance and style ; when you listen to this track the fusion of jazz and samba is very evident . `` E Luxo S & oacute ; '' reverts to a faster tempo that really makes you want to get up and dance wherever you are ; and `` Bahia ( Ba & iacute ; a ) '' concludes the album with a silky elegance that is singularly beautiful.There is one extra number . The bonus track is the 45 rpm issue of `` Desafinado . '' Naturally , the shorter version of this number does n't provide us with the luxurious meanderings of the full length track . Nevertheless , it interests the listener to hear what the band chose to include -- and exclude -- when , under time constraints , they had to deliver the number fast yet with all the brightness of the full rendition . You wo n't be disappointed.The liner notes include the original liner notes by Dom Cerulli ; and there are great black and white photos of the band members playing . John Litweiler contributes an informative essay about the creation of the album as well . The quality of the sound is excellent.I highly recommend this CD for any fan of bossa nova music ; and people who enjoy jazz with a samba twist will cherish this one for ages to come .	1
A must piece of work in the latin genre to include in your collection ; I 've heard bits and pieces of these tracks throughout my life ; it 's about time I added all of them to my collection .	1
This is an amazing jazz album . You got Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz together , making the first bossa nova jazz record in the U.S . It got a Grammy , it made thousands of listeners transport themselves to a calm South American beach . To top it off , the lead drummer , Buddy Deppenschmidt , is my own drum teacher . How boss is that ? Awesome jazz with a twist . All instrumental . My greatest discovery out of Brazil since Sepultura.Pop it in and chill ...	1
When I heard the Bossa Nova for the first time in 1961 in my country at my office 's annual party , the following words came to my mind : & # 34 ; Who created this beautiful rhythm , so soft but so musical ... & # 34 ; and from then on I became a fan . I used to have a collection of Brazilian music on the big 33rpm records now I have them on CDs and they are my precious possessions . Desafinado is the song of the songs , no match for it .	1
Jazz Samba and Bossa Nova enters the peak of pop music ! And the music lives with Stan Getz and Louis Bonfa.I ` ve got my first item on an EP ` vinyl in 1964 !	1
This fabulous record shows off the great artistry of a master musician on saxophone . Getz seems to have such a natural feel to this type of music . The guitar of Charlie Byrd is also superb and blends into the music in a wonderful manner . The other amazing aspect of this record is that I never tire of listening to it .	1
someone here mentioned that this was compressed a little too much during the remastering , he 's right . if your using an equalizer it can distort at times . however , if you flatline the treble and bass on your receiver it works great . the sound quality is amazing compared to the original . very nice !	1
It 's a fair collection if you want to have some Beach Boys music in your catalog . I can listen to two , maybe three Beach Boys songs in a row and then I 'm very ready for something else . This is a great CD for pulling a song for this CD burn , or that iPod file .	1
This is the album that wonderfully and lovingly summarizes the best of the Beach Boys . Although not strictly considered a greatest hits album , it is essentially that , a sequentially ordered regurgitation of each of their releases , most of them , of course , monster hits . It is all here , folks , from the original number `` Surfing Safari ' '' to `` Surfer Girl '' , from `` Catch A Wave '' ( which Jan and Dean later stole the melody and chord progressions for `` Sidewalk Surfing '' , a major hit for them ) to `` The Warmth Of The Sun '' . yet the Beach Boys really were n't about surfing or even the relaxed southern California lifestyle . What they were about was fell-good music , a kind of instant nostalgia for a Hollywood-type confection . While I have always loved listening to Beach Boy music , I have never taken any of their music seriously , at least not in the way one would consider the Beatles or any of a number of singer-songwriters.Instead , Brian Wilson 's music is formulaic , but brilliantly so , a superb if sugary confection of great tunes , easy , sing-along lyrics , and a pronounced beat . It was rock and roll , produced for commercial success , and it was wildly successful . From `` Surfing USA '' to `` In My Room '' , from `` Fun , Fun , Fun '' to `` I Get Around '' , From `` Wendy '' to `` Do n't Worry Baby '' , this is great music , fun to listen to , and something you find yourself humming all day after hearing it on the radio . My favorites here are `` California Girls '' and `` Good Vibrations '' . This is an album you will want to keep around for background music , for it is a wonderful sound and reminds us all of a more wonderful time in our long lost youth . Enjoy !	1
As we all this collection was released in the summer of 1974 going all the way to No 1 at a time when there was the watergate scandal as well as other economic and political scandals . This album brought us back of the times when it was Fun Fun Fun , Surfin Usa , and Good Vibrations . This Cd is a good springboard to anyone hwo wants to familiarize themselves with the great tunes of the BeachBoys .	1
An all time classic from one of the greats . Full of hits and the sound is so much better because of the vinyl .	1
Released back in the 70 's , this historic and important compilation introduced The Beach Boys to new a generation of fans . Totally essential to your rock music library . The original Lp 's did not contain `` Good Vibrations '' , a song bursting with such creative power it perhaps remain unmatched in popular music since .	1
Legendary photo as the album cover ! Straight Up sounds like an extension of The Beatles , had they existed in the 70s with a hint of 80s hair metal mixed in . Visionaries ! With George Harrison and Todd Rundregren in the production office , this album was destined to garner some respect . An its well deserved . The power pop tag here has never been more accurate . Each song is well crafted , harmonies nailed down , slide guitar where appropriate , and overall great songwriting.While its no Big Star , if you are interested at all in 60s/70s rock , you should give this a spin .	1
Sadly , Badfinger was a band that never got much respect from the critics . It was generally criticized for being , at best , a Beatles `` sound alike '' and , at worst , a Beatles imitator . `` Badfinger recycles familiar riffs and harmonies in far less striking configurations '' says The Rolling Stone Album Guide . There was plenty of other circumstantial evidence . Paul McCartney wrote their first hit , George Harrison produced some of the tracks for STRAIGHT UP , and they were on the Beatles ' Apple label . Frankly , I do n't know enough about music to judge the accuracy or fairness of all this . I only know what I like when I hear it , and I like both STRAIGHT UP and its predecessor , NO DICE , a lot.STRAIGHT UP was originally recorded not too long after the release of NO DICE , the intent being to capitalize on the moderate success of that set . George Harrison produced much of it . The album 's release was delayed , however , and eventually Todd Rundgren was brought in as producer and many of the tracks were re-recorded . The current CD contains the album that was ultimately released with Rundgren as producer , as well as some of the original tracks produced by Harrison . Personally , I 'm glad Rundgren was brought in . I like the tracks done with him producing much better than the older ones.This is a very listenable album . The twelve tracks originally released are a pleasure ; there is n't a loser among them . My personal favorites include `` Take It All '' , `` Money '' , `` Flying '' , `` Suitcase '' , `` Day After Day '' , `` Sometimes '' and `` Perfection '' . `` Baby Blue '' and `` Day After Day '' were the Top 40 hits . Some are ballads and some are rockers , but nice vocal harmonies abound , there are lots of nice melodies and catchy riffs , and I particularly enjoy the jangly percussion and the guitar solo into the fade-out on `` Perfection '' . Favorites and hits aside , though , I often just put the CD in and listen to the whole thing . There 's not a bad cut in there anywhere.Whatever the validity of all the criticism , it all ended tragically for Badfinger and , especially , for some of the bandmembers . It 's all water under the bridge , now . Whether or not these guys were mining Beatles material for their music , the result sounds pretty darn good . It seems to me that if a rock band is going to look somewhere for inspiration , Beatles music is a pretty good place to start . The results are pleasing to the ear , and that 's what counts.I had a hard time coming up with a rating for STRAIGHT UP . I 'll concede that Badfinger was never as original or unique as some of the other great bands of the period , particularly the Beatles . They never did anything to rival albums like `` SGT . PEPPER ... '' , WHO 'S NEXT , EXILE ON MAIN STREET , LED ZEPPLIN IV , RUMOURS , or some others I could name . On the other hand , I like this album very much and still listen to it a lot . I decided to call it 4.5 stars and round up to five . Again , this is n't quite one of the real greats of classic rock , but it 's an excellent piece of work and a pleasure to listen to . If you like classic pop/rock , you 'll like STRAIGHT UP .	1
One of the best bands that never made it big in the US ... .kind of sad , really . Preview the cuts on Amazon .	1
LOTS OF MEMORABLE ROCK AND ROLL AND HAS THE END SONG ON THE TV HIT & # 34 ; BREAKING BAD. & # 34 ; REALLY ENJOYED MOST OF THE OTHER CUTS AS WELL .	1
Monday 25 October 2010 has seen 14 of the 'Apple ' label albums remastered and reissued alongside `` Come And Get It '' - a first-time-ever label 'Best Of ' . This reissue is one of them.Apple 5099964244020 breaks down as follows ( 61:50 minutes ) : Tracks 1 to 12 are the Stereo LP `` Straight Up '' released late December 1971 in the USA on Apple SW-3387 and 4 February 1972 on Apple SAPCOR 19 in the UK ( it reached number 31 on the American Billboard Top 100 ) .Tracks 13 to 18 are bonus tracks exclusive to this 2010 CD reissue : '' I 'll Be The One '' is a band composition that was once muted as a possible UK Apple single ( no number allocated ) , but never released ( 13 ) '' Name Of The Game '' ( a Pete Ham song ) was also considered for a single ( Apple 35 ) , but again never issued ( 14 ) '' Baby Blue '' ( a Pete Ham song ) was also considered for a UK single ( Apple 42 ) , but again withdrawn . It was , however , released in the USA on Apple 1844 in April 1972 and rose to number 14 on the Billboard charts . With added reverb on the drums , it 's presented here as the 'US Single Mix ' - its B-side is the album track `` Flying '' ( 15 ) '' Baby Please '' ( Pete Ham/Joey Molland/Mike Gibbins song ) is previously unreleased ( 16 ) '' No Good At All '' ( Tom Evans song ) is previously unreleased ( 17 ) '' Sing For The Song '' ( Tom Evans song ) is previously unreleased ( 18 ) Requiring extra payment , there are also 7 more tracks available via Digital Download from iTunes or Amazon - `` Money ( Earlier Version ) '' , `` Flying ( Earlier Version ) '' , `` Perfection ( Earlier Version ) '' , `` Suitcase ( Earlier Version ) '' , `` Sweet Tuesday Morning ( Earlier Version ) '' , `` Mean Mean Jemima '' and `` Loving You '' ( see either site for cost details ) .BOOKLET/PACKAGING : The front & rear of the original vinyl LP sleeve is reproduced on the gatefold card sleeve , while noted writer and music lover ANDY DAVIS does the new liner notes for the booklet ( they 're all a disappointingly weedy 12 pages long - EMI pushes the boat out again people ) . But with what little text he has been afforded , Davis does at least fill it with properly informative details - and there are black & white studio shots of the band - PETE HAM , TOM EVANS , JOEY MOLLAND and MIKE GIBBINS . It 's cute , but you do wish there was more ... PLAYERS/CONTENT : The album was famously produced by studio wizard TODD RUNDGREN - except for `` I 'd Die , Babe '' , `` Name Of The Game '' and `` Suitcase '' - which had GEORGE HARRISON at the controls ( he also played Guitar on `` I 'd Die , Babe '' ) . The 'bonus tracks ' were produced by GEOFF EMERICK of Beatles/Abbey Road fame - except for `` Baby Blue ( US Single Mix ) '' which was Rundgren.SOUND : The same team that handled the much-praised 09/09/09 Beatles remasters have done this too - GUY MASSEY , STEVE ROOKES , SAM OKELL and SIMON GIBSON . The audio quality is BEAUTIFUL - a massive improvement - makes you reassess a lot of the songs.Their 2nd album `` No Dice '' from 1970 is a gem , but Badfinger surpassed even that with `` Straight Up '' - leagues ahead of their patchy 1969 debut both in terms of songwriting quality and sheer polish . This is immediately evident on the two Pete Ham openers - `` Take It All '' and `` Baby Blue '' - the Todd Rundgren production values on the guitars and drums now so clear . `` Money '' with its `` buys you freedom '' lyrics has great chunky guitars and harmony vocals , while `` Flying '' sounds not unlike 10cc circa `` The Original Soundtrack '' . The liner notes tell us that Beatle George was literally dancing in the studio during the recording of `` I 'd Die , Babe '' - it 's easy to hear why - it 's a catchy little ditty and similar to own songwriting style.Joey Molland 's keyboard funk of `` Suitcase '' opened Side 2 of the original album and talks of the weariness of being on the road forever without too much success ( lyrics above ) . The lovely America-type acoustic tune `` Sweet Tuesday Morning '' follows - it was the B-side to the only single issued off the album in the UK ( `` Day After Day '' - 7 January 1972 on APPLE 42 ) . But then you 're hit with a triple-whammy of Badfinger songwriting excellence - `` Day After Day '' , `` Sometimes '' and `` Perfection '' . All three offer up different facets of the band 's capabilities - the lovely `` Day After Day '' is essentially a mid-tempo ballad from Pete Ham and that it was n't a huge UK chart hit is sort of inexplicable , `` Sometimes '' is a Joey Molland rocking gem that sounds like The James Gang on a roll , while the thinking man 's strum of `` Perfection '' comes closest to that Big Star comparison of out-and-out genius . As if that is n't enough , you get superb guitar playing on the Tom Evans album finisher `` It 's Over '' - it 's all so shockingly good , it really is . And like almost all of the releases in this series , the bonus tracks are impressive too rather than being superfluous . Very , very good indeed ... Niggles - in order to give a fuller review , I paid for the extra 7 download alternate versions - and typically their quality is superb - must haves . I burned them onto a CD-R and they clocked in at 23:59 minutes - when you add that onto 61:50 , you see that they could all have easily fitted onto 1CD . I 've Bear Family titles that regularly push past 85 minutes with no deterioration in sound , so it 's a crappy scam to have us fork out seven more pounds for versions EMI know fans will want - and badly . The gatefold card sleeve is nice to look at for sure , but the booklet and overall packaging feel lightweight ( what EMI could get away with ) . The CD should also have one of those gauze inner bags to protect it - a problem that no record company seems to want to acknowledge ( scuffing and damage ) . The packaging issues are minor points I know , but this otherwise brilliant reissue is docked a star for creaming fans on the download front.One Star or Five - Badfinger have always divided people - many calling them one of the great overlooked bands of the period - others calling them lightweight ( most of the first album and bits of the second ) . You will not call them the latter after hearing `` Straight Up '' - it 's a crafted gem.To sum up - recommended - especially given the brilliance of the album itself , the massive improvement in sound quality and those shockingly good bonus tracks . Shame about those downloads though ... PS : see also my reviews for other releases in this October 2010 series : '' That 's The Way God Planned It '' ( 1969 ) and `` Encouraging Words '' ( 1970 ) by Billy Preston , `` Doris Troy '' ( 1970 ) , `` James Taylor '' ( 1968 ) , `` Is This What You Want ? '' ( 1969 ) by Jackie Lomax , `` No Dice '' ( 1970 ) , `` Magic Christian Music '' ( 1969 ) and `` Ass '' ( 1974 ) by Badfinger	1
love it..lots of good harmonies , the type of psych rock isms i love , early power pop leanings , a good assortment of soundsand genres appropriated.great production , great musicality .	1
This is a great CD . Awesome tunes produced by George Harrison and Todd Rundgren.. It 's the Badfinger staple ... If this ever goes out of print , I 'll be bummin ' . We all know how finicky Apple is ... The acoustic `` Name of the Game '' is simply breathtaking ...	1
I already had this cd and thought the sound was very good . When I heard the new remaster , I could not believe how much better it sounded . The same crew that did the Beatles remasters . By the way , every song on this album is great .	1
Even though it had the two charted hits `` Day After Day '' and `` Baby Blue '' , your not gon na get a better album from anyone that rightfully belongs on the Beatles Apple label.This is one of those albums where every track on the album could have easily been a Top Forty hit record . They chose `` Baby Blue '' as their secondary hit from this album , but I would imagine that `` Money '' , `` Name of the Game '' , or `` Suitcase '' would have easily been Top Ten hits.I 've loved this whole album for many years and I do n't think anyone who loved the music of the early seventies would dismiss this album . It 's the one to have from Badfinger .	1
The sound is so much clearer and better , on this new recording of `` Straight Up '' # 31 , Apple did a great job here , with new pics and text . This version is great ! 2 of the newer songs `` No Good At All '' is an all out rocker and `` Baby Please '' is a great power-pop song .	1
There could be so much to tell about Badfinger 's third album . But i will just tell you , that & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; is such a beutiful album . It has so many incredible songs , wether it would be the heart-breaking Pete Ham 's & quot ; The Name of the game & quot ; Joey molland 's & quot ; Sweet tuesday morning & quot ; , or the rocy & quot ; sometimes & quot ; and & quot ; suitcase & quot ; . But it 's minaly Pete Ham 's incredible gift of writing , his way of combining touchy lyrics with up tempo music as & quot ; Baby Blue & quot ; . The album also includs , their biggest hit & quot ; Day after day & quot ; , but for me its the opner & quot ; Take it all & quot ; that worth the whole thing , When Ham and Tommy Evans combine their beutiful vocals into one great harmony and create such an exciting Chorus.They were such a great band , and in this album you could easily understand why .	1
Listen to that for a year than progress to this one . You will appreciate it that much more that way . Dr Ron . Jupiter , Fl .	1
Back in the early 1970 's , when Badfinger was a working band , it was roundly criticized for being , at best , a Beatles `` sound alike '' and , at worst , a Beatles imitator . `` Badfinger recycles familiar riffs and harmonies in far less striking configurations '' says The Rolling Stone Album Guide . There was plenty of other circumstantial evidence . Paul McCartney wrote their first hit , George Harrison produced their third album ( STRAIGHT UP ) , and they were on the Beatles ' Apple label.Personally , I do n't know the accuracy or fairness of all this . I DO know that it all ended tragically for Badfinger and , particularly so , for some of it bandmembers . But that is all water under the proverbial bridge , now . I also know that this recording , NO DICE , sold pretty well when it was released and I know why . Whether or not these guys were mining Beatles material for their music , the result sounds pretty darn good . It seems to me that if a rock band is going to look somewhere for inspiration , Beatles music would be a good place to start.The fact is , if you like the kind of music recorded by the Beatles and other pop/rock bands of their era , you 'll probably like NO DICE . Badfinger produced a nice sound both vocally and instrumentally , and the original album included twelve very listenable songs . The CD has been augmented by the addition of five more songs that were previously unreleased . I have my own favorites , but this CD includes nothing but good stuff . There 's not a real clinker in the bunch . NO DICE is a very good CD and I recommend it . Get it . You wo n't regret it .	1

This reissue is one of them.Apple 5099990580727 breaks down as follows ( 57:42 minutes ) : Tracks 1 to 12 are the Stereo LP `` No Dice '' released 27 November 1970 in the UK on Apple SAPCOR 16 and on Apple SKAO-3367 in the USA ( it reached number 28 on the American Billboard Top 100 ) .Tracks 13 to 17 are all previously unreleased and exclusive to this 2010 reissue : '' I Ca n't Take It '' is an Extended Version - 2:55 minutes to 4:14 minutes ( 13 ) '' Without You '' is a Studio Demo Version ( 14 ) '' Photograph ( aka 'Friends Are Hard To Find ' ) '' is a Previously Unreleased Version ( 15 ) '' Believe Me '' is an Alternate Version ( 16 ) '' No Matter What '' is a Studio Demo Version ( 17 ) Requiring extra payment , there are also 2 more tracks available via Digital Download from iTunes or Amazon - an Instrumental Version of `` Love Me Do '' and an Extended Stereo Version of `` Get Down '' ( see either site for details ) .BOOKLET/PACKAGING : The gatefold sleeve of the original vinyl LP is reproduced while noted writer and music lover ANDY DAVIS does the new liner notes for the booklet ( they 're all a disappointingly weedy 12 pages long - EMI pushes the boat out again people ) . But with what little text he has been afforded , Davis does at least fill it with properly informative details - and there are 4 superb colour portraits of the band - PETE HAM , TOM EVANS , JOEY MOLLAND and MIKE GIBBINS . It 's cute , but you do wish there was more ... PLAYERS/CONTENT : The original album was produced by GEOFF EMERICK of Beatles/Abbey Road fame ( except for `` No Matter What '' , `` Believe Me '' and the bonus tracks from 14 through to 17 which were produced by MAL EVANS ) . Unlike so many of the sessions of the time , the recordings 'did n't ' include a number of The Beatles and their talented friends - so the band got to shine all by themselves.SOUND : The same team that handled the much-praised 09/09/09 Beatles remasters have done this too - GUY MASSEY , STEVE ROOKES , SAM OKELL and SIMON GIBSON . The audio quality is BEAUTIFUL - a massive improvement - makes you reassess a lot of the songs.The album opens strongly with a Pete Ham original `` I Ca n't Take It '' - rocking guitars and pumping brass - it sounds really great . It 's followed by the Big Star feel of `` I Do n't Mind '' co-written by Tom Evans and Joey Molland - a song that starts out gently and then builds into an impressive melodious tune - it 's excellent . Not so I 'm afraid with `` Love Me Do '' ( no relation to The Beatles song ) - it 's a poor man 's rocker and does n't really work . But then you 're hit with a double-whammy of Badfinger excellence - `` Midnight Caller '' and the sublime `` No Matter What '' ( lyrics above ) . Both stand the test of time - especially `` No Matter What '' - surely a contender for a Top Ten position in the list 'best 7 '' single ever released ' . `` Without You '' would of course be taken by NILSSON and transformed into one of the most extraordinarily powerful cover versions ever made . I heard in a car on the radio a few weeks back in the early morning on the way into work - and to this day it moves me - its opening chords still capable of calling up a shivering memory . `` Blodwyn '' is a ditty while the excellent `` Better Days '' turned up as the B-side to the UK 7 '' single of `` No Matter What '' ( Apple 31 ) in November 1970 - they used `` Carry On Till Tomorrow '' as the B on the USA 7 '' ( Apple 1822 ) - a track off their debut album `` Magic Christian Music '' . The Mike Gibbins penned `` It Had To Be '' is a lovely song , while the band-composed `` Watford John '' is a rocker written about an Apple Studio Engineer called John Smith . The last two on the album are huge favourites among fans - Tom Evans ' sweet `` Believe Me '' and Pete Ham 's acoustic `` We 're For The Dark '' - accomplished playing , melody builders - both define that certain 'Badfinger ' sound . They end the album proper on a definite musical high note.But like the other issues in this series , the best seems to be kept until last . Having grown used to the short album cut of `` I Ca n't Take It '' - I must say that I love the way it 's spread out more on the fantastically rocking 'Extended Version ' . You can see why it was cut , but in 2010 I 'll take the 'indulgent ' version any day of the week . Then fellows the 'Demo ' of `` Without You '' which I find more affecting than the finished track - more akin to what Nilsson did with it - it 's a gem . `` Photograph '' is a rough rock song - it 's good , but it 's eclipsed big time by a sweet-as-honey Alternate Take of `` Believe Me '' with more Piano and Electric Guitar - what a treat . The 'Demo ' of `` No Matter What '' is close to the finished track , but without that killer electric guitar that made it . I must say that the bonus tracks are impressive rather than being superfluous . Very , very good indeed ... Niggles - the 2 download tracks will be desirable to fans and making them pay extra dollars for them via Download is cheapskate and crappy - and as you can see from the playing time above , there was plenty of room to include them on here ( they 're available as hardcopy on the double-CD that comes with the `` Apple Box Set '' ) . The gatefold card sleeve is nice to look at for sure , but the booklet and overall packaging feel lightweight ( what EMI could get away with ) . The CD should also have one of those gauze inner bags to protect it - a problem that no record company seems to want to acknowledge ( scuffing and damage ) . They 're minor points I know , but they 're worth making ... One star or Five - Badfinger have always divided people - many calling them one of the great overlooked bands of the period - others calling them lightweight . I 'd say that if you 're coming to them cold in 2010 , then it 's probably somewhere in between . But fans will see it differently - they will eat this reissue up big time . To sum up - I still see `` No Dice '' as a great album - with songmanship that shines through even now . And they repeated that craft and warmth on their next album `` Straight Up '' too.Recommended - especially given the massive improvement in sound quality and those shockingly good bonus tracks.PS : see also my reviews for other releases in this October 2010 series : '' That 's The Way God Planned It '' ( 1969 ) and `` Encouraging Words '' ( 1970 ) by Billy Preston , `` Doris Troy '' ( 1970 ) , `` James Taylor '' ( 1968 ) , `` Is This What You Want ? '' ( 1969 ) by Jackie Lomax , `` Magic Christian Music '' ( 1969 ) , `` Straight Up '' ( 1972 ) and `` Ass '' ( 1973 ) by Badfinger	1
Well . I guess you all heard the news by now . `` The Daily Snitch '' , one of London 's top newspapers printed a story with huge headlines , `` TOP SEER TO RETIRE FROM REVIEWING '' , including a picture of me being rushed into a waiting taxi cab . I want to assure all my fans that this is not the case . While it is true that I have stated that I wanted to cut back because of all the work involved . I was thinking of just submitting two sentences as a review , like many others ( you have seen them , have n't you ? ) . Two blerbs that say nothing and are n't challenging in the least . Of course it would be safe and non-threatening . And everyone goes home happy . Who cares if Metamorpho 's Universal sacrifice is shattered like fine Lennox crystal dropped on the floor ? Well ... ..at least there 's glue . : ) But , let 's move on to Badfinger , shall we ? I knew they were excellent a long time ago , and while I listen to it now , it has lost none of the magic it had since the first time I heard it . Such a phenomenal pop outfit that reminds one of the Beatles . And why should n't it since two of them ( Paul McCartney and George Harrison ) guided Badfinger in so many ways ? It was the wisdom and experience of how recording gets done that contributed to their superior sound . Also the smarts to recognize the talent that existed . It is the quintessential format of a pop quartet that is employed here . The harmony vocals , although rougher than the Beatles would use , are used here . We have the rythmn guitar keeping constant as tasty bits from the lead guitar color and shape the sound . The nice bass fill , jumpy and essential , and the sometimes active and sometimes understated drum breaks . Add to that , piano , some horns , and you have a very nicely put together album indeed.But let us not forget that the songwriting here is above parr in so many respects . They all could write tunes - and none of them were shabby in the least ! When you listen to the album you will be astounded on the variation of construction . They include tough rockers like `` I Ca n't Take It '' , `` Love Me Do '' , `` No Matter What '' , and `` Watford John '' . Semi-sweet odes such as like `` Midnight Caller '' , `` Without You '' , `` It Had to Be '' , and `` We 're for the Dark '' . Included with this is the country-flavored rock of `` Blodwyn '' . In fact people , if you like the diversity of what pop/rock can be , then you should investigate this album . There is not one bad cut here.I suppose by now that everyone knows the story of Badfinger . Pete Ham 's suicide , the non-support and atrocious activity of their record company . It is an amazement to me that a group this talented should n't have been mega . But , that only supports my wise Seer 's outlook ( after much reflection ) that the best music out there is music you have never heard . Keep in mind , that , in some weird way , we are victims as much as Badfinger in the fact that the music industry has vast power of what you do or do not hear . We are the ones who have to do the work and seek out the gems . This one really was a no-brainer for your Metamorpho ( stop that snickering -- I hear you ! ) .Anyway , enough braying on my part . If you like nice melodies , great songs , and beautiful construction , get this c.d . You wo n't be disappointed . It is a pure joy.Time to go and see if the newspaper will print a retraction . Hmmm ... I think I 'd have better luck purchasing another Lennox crystal . Oh well.Well beyond the looking glass - your `` non-retired '' Metamorpho	1
After sounding like a Beatles tribute band on & quot ; Magic Christian Music , & quot ; Badfinger staked out their own musical territory on & quot ; No Dice. & quot ; & quot ; No Matter What & quot ; may be the epitome of '70s power pop , and & quot ; Midnight Caller & quot ; is a haunting lost gem . A classic recording from one of the most underrated groups in rock history .	1
Unless you were born after 1989 or else have dropped in from another planet since then , you have probably heard the song & quot ; Love Letter & quot ; from this album . It 's only the most gritty , earthy , and outstanding torch song in rock . It was also the lead single from this album , and the rest of the album is no letdown . The songs here run the gamut from experienced toughness to aching vulnerability , hitting a lot of bases in between . Raitt 's expressive singing and first-rate guitar playing take these quality songs and drive them home very effectively. & quot ; Nick Of Time & quot ; dominated the Grammy awards and the charts in 1989 , and rightfully so . It is one terrific album and earned Bonnie Raitt recognition that was long overdue . She labored long in relative obscurity before hitting it big with this one . Built on solid rock tinged with blues and country overtones , the songs here all feature mature lyrics delivered with real feeling . Listen to the title song . Nobody over thirty can fail to identify with those words . & quot ; Love Letter & quot ; is my personal favorite song , but I also especially like & quot ; Thing Called Love & quot ; , & quot ; Cry On My Shoulder & quot ; , & quot ; Nobody 's Girl & quot ; , & quot ; Have A Heart & quot ; and & quot ; I Will Not Be Denied & quot ; .This is a truly outstanding album . Give it a listen and I think you 'll agree . Very highly recommended .	1
I 'm not a country music fan , but Bonnie does some work I truly enjoy . This CD is an example of that . I truly like every song on it .	1
if you are a guitar player , you will want both the nick of time album and songbook . that way , you can play along with the songs thing called love , loveletter , nick of time , have a heart , nobody 's girl , i will not be denied , real man , and the road is my middle name.the album and songbook go great together , so get both , strap on your guitar and have some fun . ed wilson	1
I was asked recently to list my favorite 10 albums , and this one made the list . Bonnie Raitt is one of my favorite singers and this album showcases her talent very well .	1
I am very surprised there are not hundreds of reviews for Bonnie Raitt . This is absolutely a classic album , great music , great voice .	1
Love Bonnie Raitt . She 's awesome . Gravelly voiced , extremely talented slide guitarist , soulful to the extreme , and devoted to her craft.This is my favorite record she 's ever done . And I love them all . But it 's my favorite. & # 34 ; Nick of Time & # 34 ; is the best groove song I think she 's ever done.- & # 34 ; those lines are pretty hard to take when they 're / starin back at you ... & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Thing Called Love & # 34 ; - badass blues song . The video is awesome too but if you ca n't get into this song - in my opinion - you have no musical ear. & # 34 ; Love Letter & # 34 ; - kooky song that I love . Just a true - out there - bonnie song. & # 34 ; Cry On My Shoulder & # 34 ; - is a knock it out of the park blues/sad/sweet/desperate song of love. & # 34 ; Real Man & # 34 ; - typical bonnie raitt takin ' on the boys song . love it & # 34 ; Nobody 's Girl & # 34 ; - this song is one that just ripped my heart out . all about a girl who does n't want to be owned and the unfortunate soul who loves her ... & # 34 ; Have a Heart & # 34 ; - beautiful song - beautiful video - and I think it has my favorite slide riff ... awesome ... The rest are awesome too - but these are just rip you up and tear your heart to shreds songs - or take your ear and spin it around until you understand what music is meant to be - or liberate your soul and make you dance rhythms that shake your body even if you do n't want to let it . I think it 's the perfect album - but that 's just me : )	1
I think this is one of her best releases . Every song is enjoyable that in its self says something . She truly came into her own with this album .	1
This is n't a compilation of Greatest Hits , but it could be . Even if all the tracks on this wonderful release were not commercial hits , Bonnie Raitt proves with this one that she can play with the big boys and come out unscathed.Nothing tops `` Have A Heart '' , a fantastic performance of a great song , which always makes me sigh , no matter how many times I 've heard it . There is a longing , a need for love in Raitt 's vocals that just grabs you by the throat and makes you listen.Other stand-outs are the appropriately named title track , `` Nick of Time '' , the more bluesy-raunchy `` Real Man '' and the melancholic `` Nobody 's Girl '' . But there 's really not a bad song on this CD .	1
Jethro Tull , a great flute player , self taught , 70 's rockers , with some unforgettable lyrics , that stick in your head forever	1
This album came from thin air to establish Jethro Tull 's `` Aqualung '' as contender for most inspired album since The Who 's `` Tommy '' ..I recall the release of `` Aqualung '' ..I just did n't care for it at first..But rock enthusiasts more forward than myself , said play it anyway , it 's a new brand of music..And that 's the legacy of Jethro Tull..All their albums do require some willingness , but come into focus upon a couple of play-throughs.. '' Aqualung '' is outrageously witty and graphic..With a twisted biblical sense of humor embedded into its pre - heavy metal leanings..This CD remains current ! ..At times Tull harkens back to early `` Steppenwolf '' , the original heavy metal band..The lyrics , like Steppenwolf 's `` Get your motor running , head out on the highway '' are daring and offensive , especially considering the times..But do n't overlook the one of a kind , electric flute play of Ian Anderson , a classically trained musician..I saw the `` Thick As A Brick '' tour..And never saw a better band `` live '' period ! .. `` Aqualung '' stacks up as Tull 's pinnacle achievement..Though Jethro Tull did morph into a soft brand of rock candy later , relegating them to an undeserved minor minion standing in Rolling Stone..But early Tull was certainly as cutting edge as either U2 or The Stones..Despite too , they have been unfairly typecast as a `` Renaissance '' band in certain other elitist quarters..Get back to early Jethro Tull though..Like Joseph Heller 's `` Catch 22 '' , easily ahead of its time , and worthy of the respect of those interested in the evolution of rock.. '' Aqualung '' is an overlooked missing link in hard rock geneaology , that led to other concept albums , like Pink Floyd 's `` The Wall '' , and `` Jesus Christ , Superstar '' ..If you are a connosieur of rock , imbibe in `` Aqualung '' like fine brandy..Your friends will admire your vintage `` find '' ..The shuffling madness , that is `` Aqualung '' , like the Big Lebowski abides .	1
The song is powerful and has static of its own . The first time I heard it I could n't believe it was actually Jethro Tull till I heard the flute solo . Magnificent , that solo makes my teeth screech .	1
I have owned this album in every format possible ( vinyl , 8-track , cassette , CD ) and have loved it & listened to it over & over for 30 years . This release , which boasts some interesting bonus material , disappointed me on the remastering end . It is still relatively thin , low in volume & fidelity . This new CD release is like all the others , you can never play it loud enough - it simply does n't CRANK . My vinyl version had the highest fidelity of all the formats , which had some great bottom end & crisp highs ( before the inevitable scratches & pops , of course ) and it could be played LOUD . While riffs from Aqualung & My God sounded big & piercing on vinyl , they sound subdued & repressed on every CD release and sadly this one as well.It makes me wonder what was going on in the control room when they were remastering this , because I really hear no improvement . On the strength of the songs themselves , I would rate this album 5 stars . On the basis of their latest `` remastering '' job , however , I would give it only 3 stars . I guess Aqualung will forever be UNCRANKABLE ! ! For an incredible remastering job , check out `` Warchild '' . They 've really beefed up the mix with great fidelity & deep bottom end , plus some awesome bonus tracks . Now , `` Warchild '' is definately CRANKABLE ! !	1
This is one album that just hits the spot in every way . Jethro Tull is just an amazing band . This album contains some outstanding songs . Locamotive Breath in my opinion is one of the greatest songs ever written . Of course Aqualung is a classic but Cross-Eyed Mary , and Hymn 43 are great songs . All I can say is outstanding .	1
As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book `` Take Me To A Circus Tent '' I am often asked to review or discuss rock albums from the 60 's and 70 's . `` Aqualung '' was able to more then satisfy the Jethro Tull fan that had been with the band since `` This Was '' , the casual observer that would purchase a few records by the group , and the outsider that wished to represent Tull in their collection with one item.You have not doubt have heard the- is or isn't- question by now . To some this is a concept album with the two themes homelessness and organized religion . To others it is simply a record conceived of songs that turned out a certain way . Which ever side you believe can not alter the final results.Martin Barre 's guitar percipience is evident from the opening notes . He can display every human emotion on the six string with the skill of a master craftsmen.The strong point of a recording to the average buyer can be if the non-radio songs measure up to those they are familiar with . Take the challenge . Listen with great intent to `` Mother Goose '' and `` Up To Me . '' They are not only magnificent compositions but two of the most overlooked Tull tunes in the catalog.If you still are n't convinced , maybe the bonus tracks will seal the deal.Enjoy the music and be well always , Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book `` Take Me To A circus Tent ''	1
It 's fair to say that Ian Anderson was the heart and soul of Jethro Tull but the band was the essense of the music . Martin Barres guitar work was prominent with Tulls sound and it was when I heard them perform live in Edmonton back in the mid- seventies that I appreciated the bands total work on stage . It was Aqualung , Thick as a Brick and Passion Play that came out of that tour and all the time , Ian co-ordinated the concert in a conductors fashion , much the same way Jagger would with the Stones.Aqualung is the true coming of age for Jethro Tull in that all the stories in the songs were like a renisance of time . Anderson had little difficuty telling stories with-in the music and blended the arrangements quite well . My favorites include the title song along with & quot ; Locomotive Breath & quot ; , & quot ; My God & quot ; , & quot ; Hymn 43 & quot ; and & quot ; Wind Up & quot ; . The CD has bonus tracks which I feel were added to increase the awareness of more music ( although the songs are good , they lack the original format that made the album such a listening treat ) . Still I feel that along with Stand Up and Benefit , Jethro Tull was the definitive alternate rock and roll group of the 70 's . Pink Floyd was the only other group that made the attempt to branch out of the norm and make a splash with being diverse . Buy this and enjoy the ride . It 's destined to be a classic	1
One of the best CDs I could have bought . Its a true classic with tunes that will forever be tied to the artist Jethro Tull , even if he has moved on to other modes of expression . I like this CD . It was a real classic in my time .	1
Jethro Tull 's Aqualung album is a masterpiece in my opinion . Without a doubt . This was the first Tull record I ever had back in the 70s , and while Stand Up , Living in the Past , and also This Was are all very good albums , I do n't think any other Tull ( even Thick As A Brick ) can top the 1971 Aqualung LP . The lyrics , the vocals , the guitar , the songs overall - the Aqualung album is outstanding in every way . Some of classic rock 's best music period is found here . If you like hard rock , prog rock , the 1970s , lavish soundscapes , folk music , or lyrics with biting social commentary , this is a must-have CD . The way they match the uncomfortable riffs of the title track with the just outright ugly vocals and lyrics is amazing . The flute intro that builds to the main verse riff of Cross Eyed Mary blows me away every time . Mother Goose is one of the best `` acoustic '' rock songs ever recorded . The songs `` Hym 43 '' and `` Locomotive Breath '' are as heavy as anything Black Sabbath ever did in their prime . I own one of the reissue versions that contains the 14+ minute interview with Ian , which is very interesting , and one of my favorite Tull songs not on the original Aqualung release , Song For Jeffery ( the version on Living in the Past is better though ) . The sound quality on the Aqualung CD is very low - while with most CDs if my stereo is on `` 10 '' they 're quite loud , I need to turn this one up to about 18 to reach the same volume levels , and the quietness is also due to a lot of dynamics in the music itself- light acoustic guitar into distortion-laden heavy guitar tones and back to soft flute , etc.Jethro Tull 's Aqualung is the only release in their discography I give 5 out of 5 stars to . Standout tracks : Aqualung , Cross Eyed Mary , Mother Goose , Up To Me , Hym 43 , Locomotive Breath	1
ALthough I have enjoyed individual songs from this album for over 30 years , I never owned it , I only just recently bought this CD . It is a wonderful album , and maybe one of the 10-15 best albums of the '70 's . I do want want to delve into the thematic concerns of Ian Anderson , as other reviewers here have done so very eloquently . What I will say is that this is a great CD , many of the songs are staples of classic rock stations , but the CD transends that status . If you are curious about Aqualung - buy it - you wo n't be disappointed ; do n't wait over 30 years like I did.At the same time , the remastering evident here is more than a little stange . While the hiss and rather tinny sound on unremastered Tull recordings is absent ; there also seems to be some `` presence '' missing on some tracks . I suspoect the desire to eliminate tape hiss led to some of the liveliness of the sound being diminished . Additionally , most remastered CD 's I have play loudly - this one has the volume unusually low , so you will need to crank your stereo up higher than normal to enjoy what is contained herein .	1
Regardless of what your opinions of Prog-Rock are , it 's undeniable that Jethro Tull was an essential Prog innovator and integral albums like Aqualung did much to shape the sound of the experimental mid 70s scene . Being a near perfect representation of the Prog-rock sound however , Aqualung experiences the same benefits and pitfalls as the grandiose genre itself making for an album that falls just short of being something truly great . Boasting impressive musicianship throughout , the album alternates between lush , classically inspired acoustic passages and arena-esque electric guitar blasts that manage to capture all the mammoth power of 60s classic rock while still experimenting beyond the already cliched style . Anderson 's awe inspiring flute solos and the band 's solid understanding of extended loud-soft dynamics makes for a continually interesting listen . Unfortunately , the consistently strong songwriting is constantly underscored and often hurt by the much more poorly executed conceptual element of the album . As was typical of Prog bands , Aqualung 's themes are far too ambitious . Attempting to tackle religion , school , childhood , and life in general all within the span of about 60 minutes , Anderson 's lyrics tend to be overly blunt and while he does make some good points about the problems of modern Catholic Dogma , Aqualung comes away with an utterly pretentious and not entirely cohesive message . Furthermore , Anderson not only tries to cram his views on some of the biggest concepts in modern life into a single album , but also does n't even truly start focusing on these topics until the album 's second half leaving about a half hour to discuss the entire struggle between god and human . The song `` Wind Up '' then attempts to sum up all of Aqualung 's massive concepts but the direct melodramatic tone of the song does n't hold up well and leaves the listener on a sour note making the entire album seem a little less climactic . Overall , Aqualung is a good collection of songs and accurately represents every detail of Jethro Tull 's intricate sound , but while an album format may work well in getting rid of the band 's distracting , flamboyant stage show , it also shows that the band was perhaps not accomplished enough in 1971 to undertake such a monumental feat .	1
While it was the next album , & quot ; Thick as a Brick & quot ; , that made them megastars , & quot ; Aqualung & quot ; , the fourth album by the band , established the Jethro Tull sound . Not that the first three albums were bad , they were n't . But the band would never have sold the amount of albums they did , nor fill the arenas they did with their old sound . To some , this change may have been as sacreligous as Bob Dylan going from acoustic to electric , but who would have even remembered Jethro Tull if not for the change that started with this record ? It still may still be their best , and as a big fan of their & quot ; classic & quot ; era , that 's saying a lot . From the signature guitar riff that opens the title song , to the ending message of & quot ; Wind Up & quot ; , it 's loaded with juicy stuff that I 've never grown tired of . OK , & quot ; Locomotive Breath & quot ; was played forever on FM radio , but that 's because it was a great song.It 's loaded with other good stuff , both hard and soft . & quot ; Hymn 43 & quot ; shows him at his angriest . But he also writes a tender love song with & quot ; Wond'ring Aloud & quot ; & quot ; Windup & quot ; starts slow , really rocks , and then softly ends to get it 's message out one more time.Who knows what kind of message about religion Ian Anderson was trying to convey in those days ? It 's probably changed over the years , but back then , it did ask some serious questions about how humans view God . Chances are he was a young artist rebelling about everything , and religion is always a nice target . My own interpretation is that there is a bit of God in everything , including bums like the title character . And the phrase & quot ; He 's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays & quot ; speaks volumes.So those of you who want to hear music these days instead of watching it , buy this classic . If you own it , dust it off and make contact with an old friend .	1
There are two irriating and related tendencies in Amazon customer reviews of rock music : 1 ) revisionism of a musical artist 's legacy ; 2 ) and the indiscriminate granting of the status of artistic greatness . Why is this ? Because customer reviews of rock music are dominated by a band 's fanatics . The result is the inflated greatness and revised assessment of musicans and their recorded output.In Amazon reviews , I have learned , for example , that Uli Jon Roth and Rory Gallagher are rock 's greatest guitarists and that the usual suspects ( e.g. , SRV , Clapton , Hendrix , E. Van Halen , Jimmy Page ) are all overrated due to mass ignorance of what truly constitutes greatness.In this set of reviews , I have discovered that Aqualung maybe makes the top four Tull albums but is , nonetheless , a `` masterpiece . '' If your part of those in the know , then you 'd know this . If only you wrapped your ears around Songs from the Wood , then . . . . Implied in all of this nonsense is more nonsense that Tull has generated at least 5 masterpieces . Tossing around the label of `` masterpiece '' as if it was a cigarette butt is neither attractive nor constructive.This is Tull 's best album . I enjoy Benefit , Brick , Wood , etc . They are all fine works . However , this is a perfectly paced album with a solid , propulsive groove across 5-minute-average tracks that allow this the crossover necessary to make this a monument to Tull 's artistic legacy to rock music . The album best represents Tull 's blues-based , slightly classical-and-jazz inflected , hard driving , progressive rock sound and , therefore , the best showcase of the band 's strengths.Tull fanatics might have other favorites . However , this is the one for those who simply want one Tull album and want to listen to one of rock 's great albums . A `` Greatest Hits '' album simply does not justice to a band as album oriented as Tull.I deduct 1/2 star in this album due to the remastered sound , which may be due to a problem originating in the master tapes . While the sound is clean , it is remastered at an extraordinarily low volume and with a slightly diminished high end . While this is immediately noticeable and disappointing upon first listen , this may or may not have been the best way to optimize the album 's fidelity .	1
I have been listening to this album for 2 years , and yet i have not found anything wrong with it at all . There is a perfect construction of acoustic and electric parts of this album . Aqualung is truly the best album Jethro Tull has ever created .	1
I enjoy listening to this CD . It has a lot to offer . AQUALUNG and LOCOMOTIVE BREATH are classics from the early seventies which are still mainstays of FM radio . Ian Anderson , who is the song-writer , singer , flautist , heart and soul of JETHRO TULL created a classic rock 'n roll experience with this album . His cleverness is everywhere on this CD . The AQUALUNG vocal effect was employed by Maynard on the Tool AENIMA release . Anderson makes a strong argument that the flute can be used as an effective heavy metal instrument . He matches it against accoustic guitars , heavy riffs , and even a choral arrangement . The place where Anderson 's creative brilliance really shines , though , is in his choice of topic . No other artist has achieved such commercial success while at the same time singing such controversial songs . By asserting his views of organized religion forcefully and unadorned , he infuses this collection with a reason for being . The arguments are not new . Basically , Ian Anderson 's polemic is that religion institutionalized loses its relevance for the individual . This is essentially the same argument of King Hezekiah when he busted up the Bronze Serpant built by Moses . The novelty of the argument matters less than the fact that it is one which compels the listener . It comforts those who feel disaffected by organized religion and it aggitates its proponents . While neither understands that the point is to develop a personal spirituality regardless of whether you are inside or outside of an English Church . Superb song-writing , competent musicians and an incendiary argument have helped to make this CD a timeless classic . If you are interested in the music of the early seventies or would like to excite the vicar ; D , this CD will be interesting to you .	1
The pro-God anti organized religion album always stirred me . Ironically if it were recorded today their would be religious groups notably Catholics in an uproar . Ian wrote the references so cleverly that he is a genius . `` God 's not the God you wind-up on Sunday 's '' Brilliant !	1
Most people consider Aqualung Jethro Tull 's best album ever . I have most of Tull 's records , and I must say , it 's really tough to deside . But I will say that this is definately one of the best , if not THE best . It 's got lots of good classic songs , such as the title track , Cross-Eyed Mary , My God , and Locomotive Breath . Ian Anderson is so awesome , he 's one of the best musicians ever and his lyrics are intelligent and really make you think . It helps if you can relate to his thoughts ( one of the reasons I like Tull alot ) . On this album he questions organized religion , something that I too have many doubts in . While my parents go to church on Sunday I crank up Aqualung ! If you enjoy classic rock , metal , hell , any kind of rock , this one 's for you .	1
Although not my favorite Jethro Tull album ( that would be & quot ; Thick as a Brick & quot ; ) , it is still and excellent album . It has a lot of great songs , I personally like all of them except & quot ; Slipstream & quot ; , and the added tracks are great . I really like & quot ; Lick Your Fingers Clean & quot ; , although it 's a little rough around the edges . The Ian Anderson interview is interesting too . If you want to get into Jethro Tull , this is an excellent place to start .	1
I have been searching for an acceptable recording of Aqualung since the dawn of the CD era . It seems that the source tapes must be short on sound level . This is the best yet , and you can hear the title cut in all of its glory , but you will need a hi-end stereo to appreciate it . This IS the best version of Aqualung now available ( or previously ) .	1
I remember the day well ... I was on a group tour of the Northeastern U.S. during the summer of 1984 ( 13 years after the release of this album ) with a bunch of other teenagers when my friend Ned started talking about this amazing group , Jethro Tull , whose lead instrumentalist and ringleader was a flautist . Hmmm ... sounded interesting , but I was not prepared for the musical adventure I was about to embark on.The album he had me listen to was this Aqualung album . Two things struck me about this album initially . The first was that this album just flat out rocked out , if you get my drift . At the same time , the heavy numbers were extremely well tempered by incredibly beautiful , soft , acoustic gems that were peppered throughout the album . It was also kind of nice to find out who was behind that famous & quot ; Aqualung & quot ; riff - I think everyone had heard that coming from some radio or another as they grew up in the '70s or even the early '80s ( especially if family members listened to classic rock stations ) , but to those who were musically uneducated at the time ( such as myself ) it was quite a revelation ... But I digress ... Not only was this an awesome example of amazing musicality within a rock context , it was a very interesting message that the lyrics presented ... and that centers on the idea that religion , as an idea and the ideas presented in religion ( at least in the Christian context , in the case of this album ) are good things , but they get corrupted by the institutions that propagate religion ... The album struck a chord with being in tune with my personal philosophy ... Favorite songs include ( among those that really rock ) - & quot ; Aqualung & quot ; , & quot ; Cross-eyed Mary & quot ; , & quot ; My God & quot ; , & quot ; Locomotive Breath & quot ; and & quot ; Wind-Up & quot ; . Favorite songs ( acoustic gems ) include - & quot ; Cheap Day Return & quot ; , & quot ; Slipstream & quot ; and the Renaissance fair styled song & quot ; Mother Goose & quot ; .To sum up : Ian Anderson writes amazing songs on this album - I do n't think there 's a bad one in the bunch . He plays a great flute ( although he 's actually gotten much better over time ) and a terrific acoustic guitar . The other musicians in the band are in top form - Martin Barre ( lead guitar ) plays with fire ; John Evan ( piano ) plays wonderfully throughout as does the drummer Clive Bunker and the bassist Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond . This album is one of the highlights in Jethro Tull 's storied history , providing an ominous toned album with a serious religious theme , but making it absolutely delicious to listen to at the same time , and therefore highly accessible . I highly recommend this album ... another in the category of ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO ANY SERIOUS ROCK MUSIC COLLECTOR ! ! !	1
& quot ; Aqualung & quot ; is , quite simply , Jethro Tull 's masterpiece . The combination of hard-driving jazz-rock ( & quot ; Hymn 43 , & quot ; & quot ; Locomotive Breath , & quot ; and the title track are classics ) with stately British folk-rock makes for a very rewarding listen . Ian Anderson & amp ; Co. were one of the most distinctive sounds on the British scene , and & quot ; Aqualung & quot ; is , for all intents and purposes , their & quot ; greatest hits & quot ; and & quot ; best of & quot ; in one compact studio release . The lyrics may have been pretentious , but the music is just plain great .	1
`` Aqualung '' would turn out to be Jethro Tull 's biggest studio album of their career . It contains the band 's two huge classic rock anthems `` Locomotive Breath '' and the title track `` Aqualung '' that probably get as much airplay today on classic rock radio as they did back when they were released . The album was a bit of a transition for Tull . Their previous stuff had been mainly blues based , while this album moved the band in a more progressive / arena rock direction . Guitarist Martin Barre really comes to the fore front on this one and creates some of his all time best work . Ian Anderson begins to introduce his acoustic / folk leanings as well which would become an even bigger part of the overall Tull sound on later albums like `` Songs From The Wood '' . The album is divided into two halves . The first have entitled `` Aqualung '' are songs themed around homelessness and general down and out characters of Aqualung himself and others like Cross Eyed Mary . The second half of the album entitled `` My God '' mostly concerns religion and Ian Anderson 's reaction to it . The album is not really conceptual ( especially when compared to later albums like `` Thick As A Brick '' ) , but has these central themes running through them . Many consider this disc their all time classic . For me I think that the band did better albums , but this certainly ranks up near the top . For a beginner looking to explore Tull I would think this would be an excellent place to start . One quick word on the recording , early Tull albums was not recorded very well . This re-master is better , but it is still not what I would consider great from an audio perspective .	1
AQUALUNG was the first of three concept albums released by Jethro Tull in the early Seventies . [ The other two were 1972 's THICK AS A BRICK and 1973 's A PASSION PLAY . ] The eleven songs on the original album loosely center around the concept that believing in the teachings of the church ( specifically the Church of England ) and believing in God are not the same thing . Listen to the repeated refrain from `` Wind Up '' : `` I do n't believe you/You had the whole damn thing all wrong/He 's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays . `` But , to tell the truth , this is my favorite Jethro Tull album because of the songs , the melodies , the incorporation of English folk ; not because of the preachings of flautist/singer Ian Anderson , who wrote all of the songs . [ Note : Anderson 's first wife Jennie is credited with co-writing the lyrics to the title track . ] There are delicate acoustic numbers like `` Cheap Day Return '' and `` Mother Goose , '' as well as the harder rocking FM radio standards like the title track , `` Cross-Eyed Mary '' and `` Locomotive Breath . '' The album also yielded the group 's first U.S. charting single when `` Hymn 43 '' reached No . 91.This edition also includes a number of bonus tracks . First , there is `` Lick Your Fingers Clean '' ( a song originally planned for inclusion on the album , but was n't released until 1988 's box set 20 YEARS OF JETHRO TULL ) and a quad version of `` Wind Up , '' then a nearly 14-minute interview with Ian Anderson about the album ( among other things , he talks about the number of overdubs `` Locomotive Breath '' required before getting the right sound ) . This is followed by three BBC radio broadcasts dating from 1968-69 , `` Song for Jeffrey , '' `` Fat Man '' and the instrumental `` Bouree . '' This is the definitive Jethro Tull album ESSENTIAL	1
This album is a must buy for any person that likes tounge in cheek British rock , from any era . The best songs - that is , if you 're too cheap to buy the album and want to download them , are -- Aqualung , Locomotive Breath , Cross-Eyed Mary , and My God.Peace out .	1
Dull , Overated , Short , boring , lyrically stupid , full of filler , and definitely NOT a Rock Classic . I was tricked into buying this scum by the masses of reviewers who hailed this as `` One of the Greatest Classic Rock Albums of All-Time ! '' . Well , I 'd heard Aqualung on the radio and thought that that was a good song , so what was to lose ? Well , my money ! Surprisingly to me , Aqualung turned out to be 1 of the only 2 good songs on this album ! Fair warning to all potential buyers , if you buy this expecting this album to be a `` Rock '' album , you 'll be disappointed ! What you ACTUALLY are getting is a combination of blues and jazz , with almost no guitar and an over-emphasis on the flute . THE FLUTE ! Granted , if you are a fan of any of those musical styles that I just mentioned , you will LOVE this album ! Although , if you 're not , like me , you will HATE this album ! After rocking with the song Aqualung , Jethro Tull then plunges into suicide by playing 7 straight songs that are simply a flute with some backup drums ! Finally , we get to the other good song Hymn 43 , which is a radio staple and happens to be the only one with a guitar all throughout the song ! Note that I 'm reviewing the Aqualung without the extra tracks , but even if they are good it 's simply not enough to make up for the rest of the album . I thought I would fall asleep during the misery that is My God and Wind-Up , which drag on for 7 and 6 minutes respectfully . Jethro Tull never tries inventiveness or originality , as all the songs are typical folk songs with tinges of jazz and blues , with hardly any vocals and mostly just flute solos ! Also , the lyrics are childishly stupid , and are some of the worst I 've ever heard . Since the album does n't include the lyrics , simply download some of Aqualung 's songs of the net and read them ! They never fail to get a laugh out of you ! And seriously folks , out of 11 songs , you only get 5 songs that are over 4 minutes , with the rest ( Excluding Hymn 43 ) being just boring filler that takes up space ! While Led Zeppelin and America manage to do good and even great folk/rock , Jethro Tull has never impressed me at all . This CD is really overated , and it 's saddening to look at all the good reviews . If you 're a fan of Rock , you wo n't like this . If you 're a fan of folk , jazz , blues , or play a flute you will like this . Otherwise , this CD will simply bore you to sleep . Good for K5 teachers trying to find a way to get the kids to go to sleep at nap time ! Also , if you listen to `` Aqualung '' , the guitar riff is casually ripped off of Black Sabbath 's `` War Pigs '' ! That really angers me that one of only a few good songs on this album is n't even original ! ( ... ) Thanks for reading !	1
Honestly . One of my favorites . Nat King Cole 's voice is recorded so well that it seems his spirit has entered the room when it come on . The orchestra is beautiful ( am I the only one that hears a distinct similarity between the intro to the title track and the intro to Fripp and Eno & quot ; Wind on Water & quot ; from Eveing Star ? ) , and every song takes you farther away from the tensions of every day life . This is an album from the late fifties , but it seems like its from the future . I ca n't explain the way this CD draws me into it , all I know is that its up there with Tomita & quot ; The Planets & quot ; , Tangerine Dream & quot ; Rubicon & quot ; , King Crimson & quot ; Larks Tounges in Aspic & quot ; , and Ravi Shankar & quot ; Ragas and Talas & quot ; as personal favorites .	1
I never got to hear Tom Donahue , since I was only a baby at the time , and was on the opposite side of the country anyway . Based on the aural evidence presented on this CD , he seems to have been a pretty cool guy . This is not one of his actual shows , but rather & quot ; airchecks & quot ; from some of his broadcasts , with songs he might have played inserted . Some of the songs are actually introduced by name , but obviously they were limted as to what songs they were able to license . The CD opens with Tom mentioning that one of the songs he had just played was & quot ; Come Together & quot ; by the Beatles , but of course they were n't able to license that song . One of my favorite parts is when Tom says & quot ; Here 's the Youngbloods 'Darkness , Darkness ' , and I 'm looking forward to the day I can hear this in stereo , cause it must be unreal. & quot ; Then the song procedes to play , and it actually is in stereo . This CD is a fascinating time capsule , and if you are a fan of underground radio from the late '60s - early '70s , or just curious to find out about it , you should find this CD .	1
Anyone who enjoyed listening to the Zombies in the 1960 's will enjoy this CD . Very good recording of the group 's most popular hits .	1
I had this on cassette tape when I was a kid , and played the hell out of it . It 's a bit dated today , but still inspired , and still gets my blood pumping .	1
This cd takes me back to a time when my friends dad had an actual Hi Fi player . They were just new at the time , but did they ever sound great . The type of music during this era was exactly as it is on this cd . First off this has a great sound . The songs are very exotic , early 60s type lounge . & quot ; Route 66 & quot ; takes me right out on the highway and into the desert . & quot ; Once in a While & quot ; really expoits the stereo picture as it was definitely just coming out at that time . The theme from the Honeymooners , Sunset Strip , Wow ... ... Martinis and early 60s furniture , bamboo chairs , and wall lamps all come to mind when listening to this cd . Definitely an odd , likeable collection of rare gems . It will standout in your collection .	1
I bought this CD for `` So Rare '' by Jimmy Dorsey , which does not get any air play and deserves so much to be a classic , and I bought it for Martin Denny 's exotic `` Quiet Village . '' These two songs alone are worth the price of the CD.I really do n't know why this album is entitled `` Music for a Bachelor 's Den , '' and I am a bachelor and have a den . I have n't liked `` Like Young '' by Linda Lawson after many listenings . It 's just rritating to hear lyrics written in teen slang . But the `` Theme from 'Route 66 ' '' by Nelson Riddle makes me want to be out on the highway . And `` Yellow Bird '' is not meant for lounging in one 's den necessarily .	1
& quot ; Raiders Of The Lost Ark & quot ; has always been one of my favorite action/adventure movies along with & quot ; Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom & quot ; and & quot ; Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade & quot ; . I like those movies because I am a fan of Indiana Jones and because Harrison Ford is one one of my favorite actors . And since I liked the music from the movie so much , I decided to get the soundtrack to add to my Indiana Jones collection.The music is excellent ! One moment it can be soft and haunting or it could be loud and exciting . & quot ; The Raiders March & quot ; is a great one and of course , everyone is familiar with the song . It 's also a good example of loud and exciting . An example of a dark and haunting track is the next one & quot ; Main Title : South America 1936 & quot ; . That song is also great and it is played at the very beginning of the movie . The whole album is amazing and I will never forget the musioc.This CD also has a booklet that has a lot of information about how the movie was done . It includes notes from Steven Spielberg and John Williams , it tells a little bit about the story . There are also sketches and photographs from the movie . So , if you are thinking of buying this soundtrack then I would also suggest that you take some time to look through the notes.If your a fan of Indiana Jones , John Williams , or you enjoyed the movie than this CD might be worthwile .	1
Yet another masterpiece by Williams . This soundtrack gives the best demonstration of his capability to harmonize music and film . With previosly unreleased material the listener gets a complete spectrum of the motion picture score . From the dynamic pulsing beats of the Desert Chase , the atmospheric tones of the Idol 's Temple to the memorable theme in The Raiders March . Once you 've heard it you wont ever forget it and I find myself whistling it now and then.The twenty-four page booklet that comes with the CD is so fat that it does n't fit into the case very well . It 's FULL of extras that include behind the scene clips , story-board sketches and comments from Williams and Spielberg . But the real gem is the music critiques by Lukas Kendall . He goes through each track explaining the music piece and the movie scene it accompanies . This is quite amusing and any one who is a fan of the movie or of John Williams will take pleasure in reading it . All in all it has a seamless way of giving the score its due credit . I could n't say it any better myself and suggest that you get it and read it on your own.This soundtrack is great and I highly recommend it for those who throughly enjoy the work of Williams and/or the Indiana Jones films . The booklet 's insight reflect the passion that made the film the classic that it is . Making the soundtrack that much more priceless .	1
I might get ripped for this review , but i honestly did not enjoy this DVD at all . I bought it after reading all the reviews on this site . Did not really know JB before so i approached it with an open mind . I do n't like his overexaggerated singing much , he seems to try to somewhat copy Marc Bolan ( personal opinion ) and as for craftsmanship on the instrument he seems adequate at best . The other guys look bored and i got the impression the only time they enjoyed themselves was during the heavier songs like 'kick out the jams ' . The only song i liked was the last one 'hallelujah ' but even that dragged out too much . A redeeming factor was that i aquired the DVD for a bargain and got almost all my money back when i traded it in at a different shop .	-1
The main impression I come away from this performance with is one of elderly females attempting to play young characters . Julia Varaday looks as if she were in her late sixties , and Anna Tomowa-Sintow , her late seventies.Kathleen Battle does n't look so old , but she has pitch problems.Even Samuel Ramey sounds much older than the Don should be .	-1
At this time , we all should know what a teen movie is.That predictable pink and stupid piece of ... art.But , Hey ! , i 'm not saying all teen movies are bad , but this one it is.High School , Ryan ( Shane West ) is in love with the most popular girl , called Ashley.Her boyfriend ( Chris ) is in love with Shane 's best friend , Maggie ( Marla Sokoloff ) .So they help each other to get what they want , whatever it takes.The acting is good , specially by Shane West.They all do good the stupid high school kid rol.This movie has some funny moments , like the Titanic parody in the schooll prom.Or the girls locker room , and some more.But what i did n't like was MARLA.She 's so bad acting and her character was so stupid , I mean , who is like her in real life.Sorry , did n't mean to offen you.Well , let 's wait for the next teen movie and let 's see the differences , hope to be better than this one .	-1
I was hoping this would be a decent video about potty training . It jumps around too much from character to character and from process to process . Addresses washing hands before it addresses using the potty which it called a toilet and let 's face it few kids / parents call it a toilet so that is another thing that irritated me . I have always hated that shadow chick , and she is really annoying in this series . And the `` potty time '' song with silloute stick figures is just plain stupid . There was only one redeeming scene in the actual bathroom with the little brown bear , but the rest of this was total [ ... ] . It is going in the next yard sale .	-1
Music Scene was supposed to be about the music of the time . Of course , it was . But , it was also about a political attitude and seems to have had its genesis in the perspective embodied in the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour . The show contained a lot of anti-Nixon political humor . Irrespective of a viewer 's political positions , whether one is liberal , radical , moderate or conservative , the problem here is that the humor is just not funny as delivered . Both Bob Hope and David Steinberg employed politically-oriented quips in their approach to humor . Perhaps some find this funny . If you do , fine . I find it boring . This show and its companion , volume 2 , are worth watching if you were not alive at that time and want to examine a thick slice of the culture . My comments pertain to both volumes.As fun viewing , the show is a failure . It does not work , even as nostalgia . It 's difficult to feel nostalgic listening to David Crosby implying the world would be a better place without oil companies . Nothing like living on a commune ! There is a vague emptiness I feel in watching these shows . Perhaps it 's because I wanted another Hullabaloo or Shindig , both of which were filled with convincing performances , great dancing and excitement . They made me smile . This show has an entirely different atmosphere . To use a term from that era , `` it 's a downer . '' Aside from the alleged humor , the performances often fall flat . One notable exception is Neil Diamond 's delivery of Holly Holy.If you are curious about a facet of the culture and music of 1969-70 , the show is worth viewing . If , however , you want an enjoyable music and comedy viewing experience , I 'd recommend the Dean Martin Variety Show as an alternative purchase . You wo n't stop smiling .	-1
I do not know how one can rate a dvd not released until March ? ? ? ? ? ? I have the limed Issue of Peter Pan It Is a awesome collectable copy.Now all we have are remakes of all our best Disney dvds.To make more money for disney.And their 30.0000 Factories all over the world .	-1
I expect this akin to heresy but I did n't much like this film . I never saw it as a kid but was certainly put off when I saw the iconic characters in their actual ( animated ) performances.Peter Pan is a bit of a punk , -- certainly not a role model for any child.Tinkerbell is downright malicious . The mermaids are n't much better.The positive is that the voice actors do an incredible job . Truly perfect performances throughout.The negative is that the script itself makes Never-Never Land seem like a dysfunctional playground . Maybe that 's the point , as I 've not read the book this is based upon , but it does n't fit well in my mind of a Disney classic , especially one that formed a major pillar upon which the entire Disney franchise was based upon .	-1
The theatrical release had a GREAT Johnny Winter performance of 'Big Town Blues ' , one of my favorites . I bought this after reading about all the 'extra ' footage..stupid me , I never imagined that would mean =deleting= the -best- footage ... Johnny 's gone !	-1
A particular Elvis fan favorite ? C'mon ! I 'm a huge Elvis fan , but this lousy film is in no way better than his previous films , except for the aspect of eye candy for the guys ... in the form of Ann Margret . She is definitely the star of this movie , and it 's quite obvious that the director purposely exploited Margret 's beautiful face and figure to overcompensate for the terrible script . It starts off interesting enough , albeit quite corny in places ( especially in the songs ) , but I expected that and accepted it for what it was . However , the story just gets weaker and weaker , until the end where the time span between the climax and the end of the movie is about 30 seconds . And absolutely no twists or turns in the plot to make it interesting ... just blah , the end . Just an awful movie , sorry.I really like Jailhouse House and King Creole -- those were great flicks , and not just compared to Elvis 's other movies . Even Blue Hawaii was much better than Viva Las Vegas . 4-1/2 stars as an overall rating ? ? ? Unbelievable . I guess all 4-1/2 stars go to Ann-Margret rather than the movie in general . If you want to salivate over a young , hot Ann-Margret , I recommend this movie . If you want an overall good movie , you wo n't find it here .	-1
They took one of the finest animated movies ever created and dredged up this for a sequel . Truly awful , and an insult to the creators of & quot ; Secret of NIMH & quot ; and anyone who loves it.Buy the original instead .	-1
The music is OK , but the purpose of the CD goes unfulfilled . I tried it many nights and got nothing at all from it . Probably a good way to make money , though .	-1
I concur with the negative opinions already expressed.First the positives : beautiful music , Wagnerian with a lyrical twist.The negatives : first off : maybe I 'm spoiled , but in this day there is no reason for an opera DVD NOT to have subtitles ( I hope the double negative makes sense ) . The fact that it is sung in English is no excuse , especially when Rusalka or the Princess is going full-bore in some big ensemble . ( Loud sopranos are more difficult to understand than loud male voices . ) I understood maybe one-third of the libretto . Given the heavy reinterpretation given this staging , the listener needs all the clues he/she can have . Fortunately , the Met Opera web site had a synopsis that filled in some holes . That 's one star off there.Secondly , the production makes hash of the story . While some of the negative comments of one of my fellow reviewers seems to me to be nitpicking , the general thrust seems to be valid : there is no way to integrate the story , what you see on stage , and what you hear.In the first place , if I had n't read the blurb on the DVD case ( one or two sentences long ) outlining the Freudian interpretation , there is no way to see it in the staging . The story interprets the staging , not the other way around.In the second place , based on this Freudian view , the ending makes no sense . Are we to believe that Rusalka should have never grown up ? Or , are we to say that all men are jerks , all women are ... , and that `` coming of age '' sexually will transform women into demonic seductresses who will inevitably kill men ? Huh ? ? ? ? ! ! ! That leads to my third criticism of the staging : a fairy story only works AS A FAIRY STORY . Since Tolkien ( Lord of the Rings ) is all the rage right now ( January 2004 ) , let me invoke him : to allegorize a fairy tale is to kill it . One must let the mythic archetypes stand on their own , speaking their own truth , telling their own story.The mis-staging costs another star.Generally , we have a four star DVD here , but these errors , 4-2 = 2 stars.P . S. In checking around on the web for more info on this work , I 've learned that there is a new DVD of Rusalka with Renee Fleming in the title role . Unfortunately , at the time of this writing it is only available in UK . Hopefully we can get it soon . Wait for it .	-1
I just finished watching this DVD . IT SUCKS ! I thought it was the TV Special . It was Alice Cooper 's concert for the album . The video is bad . So is the audio . The cover says it 's `` REMASTERED '' . If this is remastered . I 'd hate to see the original . If you 're looking for the actual TV Special , look for the one that is under 120 minutes AND does not include his hits from the previous years as this disc does . SHAME ON RHINO FOR GIVING US THIS CRAP !	-1
I will keep this review short & amp ; sweet ! ! The content of this DVD is AWESOME ( music & amp ; videos ) , while the DVD itself sucks ! ! I hate DVDs that are mono-layered ! ! In other words , you have to turn the DVD to see another half of material ! ! Why everything was n't on a single sided DVD is beyond me because it is n't impossible with only 106 minutes of content ! ! Get this used or extremely cheap on Ebay ! ! !	-1
After DIO Sabbath with ozzy singing is crap , he ca n't do it anymore . To think this was uspposed to be his final show and it wase n't that great . Zack Wylde ruins all the classics with his `` ehhhh '' twang instead of playing the damn songs . I hate his playing . Over all not worth the price .	-1
Until a DVD is released with footage from the Randy Rhodes era I could care less about ANYTHING else that 's released on OZZY . There may be a good song here and there ( & not to bash Zack , Jake E. & whoever else ) but to me Ozzy without Randy is irrelevant . This , of course , excludes Sabbath . I have a VHS of the `` After Hours show '' , excellent video but only mono sound , so I would LOVE a professional 5.1 or 6.1 release of it . I also have several bootleg concert VHSs and in at least one of them ( Japan - Budokan I think ) professional cameras can be seen . So the footage is out there.Ozzy ... what 's the problem ? ?	-1
There are many Celine Dion songs that I like . When I borrowed this DVD from my mother , I watched eagerly as she sang many of these favourites including & quot ; If You Asked Me To & quot ; and & quot ; Think Twice & quot ; . Straight away I thought how fantastic her voice was , and could n't believe that her performances sounded just like the recorded versions . Something puzzled me when I read the tracklist on the back cover and only one song had & quot ; Live & quot ; written after it ( & quot ; When I Fall in Love & quot ; ) . I figured that it must be a typo since the whole DVD was a live concert . Well , apparently not ! This pseudo concert is nothing more that Celine lip-syncing - quite shameful when you think about it . The only live song being the one just noted.If her voice is really as good as people claim , then why does she need to lip-synch ? Why even bother putting on the show ? We may as well all just listen to her CD 's at home ! I now wonder if her voice is manipulated in the studio to make it sound so good on record.Overall , a very disappointing DVD . Not a real concert at all/	-1
Man , is this guy boring ! I bought this dvd for all the great reviews , but was very disappointed . My mind dwelled off after two songs , and at number four I was doing something else . Sorry folks !	-1
Do yourself a favor . Get Red Hot Chili Peppers - Live at Slane Castle instead .	-1
I have reviewed 5 Beethoven DVDs . Yes the recording is old ... .but ca n't imagine why video is so poor . The real problem is we buy these great masterpieces to experience the orchestra and not the conductor . We do n't buy operas to watch the conductor nearly full time . I would agree there is little cinematography going on here ... .which seems criminal with such an important piece . I am nervous to get any Karajan piano or violin concertos les they not focus on the performer . I have a solution in Beethoven 's masterpiece . Get the recent Blu-ray Vienna performance with Thielmann conducting in glorious 1080p DTS high definition . You will always judge every classical DVD by this performance ... .especially the direction and cinematography and of course picture and sound quality .	-1
The thing that sucks about this DVD is how it 's cut , I mean it will cut off right in the middle of the song . It gets really annoying ... but it does have the videos of & quot ; Breakdown & quot ; and & quot ; The Roof & quot ; 2 of Mariah 's best videos .	-1
If youre getting this for ELP or the doors then youre gon na be disappointed . They cut them out of the movie . The doors first song on the movie is `` When the musics over , '' its cut about 2 minutes into the performance . The other performance , `` The End '' is in its entirety . ELP 's performance , ( which is the highlight of the festival and the movie ) is about 2 minutes long . You get to see them right when they start and then it cuts away to the end of their performance . So if youre wanting this movie to see ELP 's historic `` debut '' performance then forget it , youre gon na have to wait for it to come out later . If it ever does . The rest of the performances are pretty much ... The Who is terrible and you get to really see which bands were for real and which ones were n't . The best bands are cut out and the worst are all over the place . So , its your call . As far as the rest of it , its mostly some guy whining , ( concert promoter ) about why he 's losing money , and some good scenes of hippies . So if you dont care about the music so much and want to see hippies and freaks as they really were , then its worth a look , otherwise forget it .	-1
Joe Satriani is capable of much more . I think this album along with the first one proves that Joe just ca n't write actual rock songs ( outside of his solo stuff ) that are more than just mediocre . Everything is just so bland and average . I wish he would go back to doing Surfing with the Alien type music . He was so great and inspired back then . Anyway , I know people here do n't like the comparison , but the new Van Halen Album `` A Different Kind of Truth '' absolutely destroys this waste of time . I hope CF changes things a lot for their next album . I will keep buying them , but I 'm starting to lose faith that they will come out with anything decent in their current form . I do think , however , the drummer is really good , and that shows on this album .	-1
No words to desribe this atrocity ( boring ) of music ! Please see my review for the first Chickenfoot because this one is basically the same .	-1
I 'm a total Satch fan , but this release sounded overall phoned in . The singing/screaming n ' yelling just overdone and out of place too often.. maybe the next one will be better.. The first release had at least a good handful of tunes that were superstar slamming..	-1
What I 'd like to know is what the guys in the band were saying to each other when they were going over the final mix-down . It could n't have been `` Check out that guitar solo ! '' or `` This song is incredible ! '' or `` Guys , we really outdid ourselves this time ! Great work , everybody ! `` This was simply one of the worst compilations of `` rock '' music I have ever heard . The riffs are boring ! The lyrics are boring ! The music is boring ! This album is garbage . There is n't one single memorable hook or lyric on it . It was a total and complete waste of money ! They should have named the album `` Apocalyptic Sleeping Pill. '' Clank ! Clank ! Clank ! ( That was the sound of the CD smacking the sides of the trash can ) .	-1
Long-time Rush fan here ( 30+ years ) , beginning with the first album and continuing on . Regrettably , I have to say this release is GOD AWFUL . It just goes from bad to worse . For the life of me I can not understand all of these high reviews . For me , I find the songwriting to be extremely poor , not a memorable tune here . The guitar work is unimaginative and very average . I did n't dig Geddy 's singing either -- he seems unable to write and deliver a good hook or melody . The quality of the recording stinks too . By today 's standards ( and those of yesteryear ) this release is a complete an utter loser.Sorry guys , but this is THE WORST CD I have heard in years . I want my money back ! ! ! ! !	-1
While technically stunning in concept and execution , the music is surprisingly empty - none of it reached me . Surprising , as that 's a rare occurance for Rush . There just is n't anything that remained in my mind ( or soul ) after a couple listens . Disappointing .	-1
I remember while most teenagers in the mid to late 90 's were listening to pop , rap , country , or crappy alternative stuff that was apssing for rock , I was listening to bands teens 10 and 20 years prior were listening to , Scorpions , Motley Crue , Led Zeppelin , Rush , ACDC to name just a few , but all bands you know and many you could probably guess . Rush happened to be one of my favorites out of the lot . My picks for best and worst albums would differ greatly from typical Rush fans , but regardless of album I could at least find enjoyment in half the album , if not the whole thing . This caused some troubles with some of the 70 's stuff which only had 4 or 6 songs , but hey . 2112 is an amazing album.Unfortunately this album just did n't grab me . For starters the production was a little too muddy , though I could overlook that with better songs . And that 's where this album really falls flat . The song writing is just ok at best . There 's nothing to capture one 's attention with most of them . They are n't really bad or anything , they 're just there . You have Caravan which started the album off to a decent note , but that being the first single , had I known , would have worried me as it 's only a decent song . Halo Effect is by far my favorite song on here . I love the acoustic guitars , and the rest of the band puts in a solid effort , beautiful song . Garden had nice acoustic guitars as well , but I think I was hoping for more reading how much others like this song . It 's still decent though.The album feels like a bunch of ideas they decided must go into the album without thought to how they 'd work together . One song has this random bluesy acoustic guitar piece which sounds really cool and all , but really does n't fit the song and just comes from out of nowhere , though probably the best part of that song . The vocal melodies are flat out boring and uninspiring . The guitar riffs , mostly are the same , though there are a few stand out riffs to be found . Headlong Flight has a great riff and awesome verses , setting up to be a great fast paced rocker , however the chorus which is n't that great completely changes the pace , and not in a way that works . The song gets ridiculously slow . I get songs can change pace and like many songs which do this , but this particular song it did n't work . Bu2b or whatever had the same problem . The verses were kind of groove rock and the chorus got all fast , in a way that did n't work for me.The main problem is this album is forgettable . I 've had to listen to it several times even to remember a lot of the songs , and even now I can only remember parts of some of them . I should n't have to listen to an album 15 times for something to grow on me . There should be a few songs which stand out imediately and there were n't , just a couple that later grew on me . It seems when Rush tries to put out an album of more than 8 or 9 actual songs , not counting instrumentals , they lose focus . If there 's another album in them I really hope they take their time with it and really focus on the songs rather than just slapping every idea they have together and hoping it fits . These guys are better than this.Overall this album felt like it was just all over the place with almost nothing worth coming back for . If you 're a Rush fanatic you 'll enjoy it . If you like Rush , but accept that not all their work is gold you may want to listen to it first , and if you like it then buy it .	-1
Ah ! Brian Regan , the bastian of clean comedy in America whether he 's family friendly , or not . The question of clean comedy vs dirty comedy and right and wrong is n't what goes on in my head and I pity those who think it 's about that ( and I know there are more than a few in his audience ) . There are funny comedians on both sides of the fence and Regan is squeaky clean which makes me look at him differently . Kevin James is largely clean and others are clean and lame , but what 's wrong with having a few jokes that do n't fly with little kids and when was stand-up comedy about universal appeal or understanding ? Taking these things into account I understand where Regan is coming from being from a middle class Protestant household with history in Mennonite . He strays from anything that would be impolite , crass , rude , or unappealing to anyone within earshot because the most impressionable and sheltering audiences run at the first sign of dissent , not to mention a dangerous tone of voice . This results in his comedy being akin to clown shoes , a prop that serves no purpose in the service of comedy . To others more accustomed to personalized comedy it comes off as less than honest even when he talks about himself or his family . To me , he 's not funny at all . Even comedians I ca n't relate to are funnier . It just seems that he boxes himself in , rather than being himself and in the process he ca n't reach profound comedy , or entertaining humor at all outside of this sheltered audience . If you 're an adult and you like Regan I have no interest in hearing your tastes apart from him , he 's that bad to me on this cd . This started it all and I 've seen his specials on TV thinking he must pick something funny off of the road and he 's always terrible , worse even . To those who love comedy and like to see clean done well , stay away from this man , he 's killing the game .	-1
That 's right , I said it . I love this album , and yet I still give it two stars . Let me explain why.I am rating this album as I would rate any legitimate album . I do this because I understand that Shatner was being completely serious about this album , and the dramatic interpretations of the two songs/poems/monologues fused together are supposed to symbolize the duality of man , and blah , blah , blah . I get all of that.But still , the album is horrendous . As you listen to it , you can not help but firmly believe that Shatner thinks he 's pulling off some great artistic feat with this album . However , he is wrong . Horribly wrong . The arrangement of each `` song '' is sub-par , the backing band of studio musicians on the album has no life , and then there 's Shatner himself . With his trademark delivery , Shatner leaves his indelible mark all over every track , and that 's really not such a good thing.This album would be utterly forgettable , if not for the fact that it is such a train wreck that it is an absolute must-have . Let me write that again in bold for the folks that may have skipped over this review : THIS ALBUM WOULD BE UTTERLY FORGETTABLE , IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS SUCH A TRAIN WRECK THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST-HAVE . I actually bought this CD as a British import twelve years ago for twenty bucks , long before it was in print on CD in the States , and even now , when I could have bought it for half the price , it is still worth every penny I paid for it all those years ago.You see , whenever I 'm feeling blue , I pop The Shatner into my CD player , and everything gets a little bit better . It never fails to bring a smile to my face , especially Mr. Tambourine Man and A Very Good Year.Honestly , this CD is glorious in it 's sheer awfulness . It is so good on such a low level that it has forced me to create a new word to fully describe it : Shatnerrific . You can not go wrong buying this CD . Trust me on this one . It 's my favorite music purchase ever . No , seriously . *Ever* ...	-1
This CD is without a doubt one of top 100 worst recordings of the 20th Century - and in that sense it 's a classic . Mel Brooks could n't attempt this . I have listened to 100 's of CD 's in my lifetime . I have never heard anything this bad.It 's a tour-de-force of horrible singing , banal melodrama , mindless `` poetry '' and shameless , unmerited conceit.I do n't buy the line that this was all an inside joke on the part of Bill Shatner . That 's just Trekkie spin . What you have here is one of the most blatant examples of a hyper-inflated Hollywood ego making a complete public fool of itself . If a normal person did anything like this , on the morning after they would seriously contemplate hara-kiri.Shatner 's vocal theatrics are a mockery of the acting profession - enough to make a person laugh themselves into a hernia or lose whatever they ate during the last 18 hours - except that the joke is on him . He actually thinks he is amazing even the angels with his talent . But no . His rendition of `` Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds '' probably earned him a 600 year stint in that part of purgatory reserved for airport lounge singers.All said , this CD is so terrible that it has one redeeming quality - it would make an excellent white elephant gift next Christmas .	-1
First - I love David Gilmour ... and believe he was more the 'sound ' of Pink Floyd than Roger . Upon reading reviews of this DVD `` David Gilmour in Concert 2002 '' , I bought it over the more expensive Royal Albert Hall DVD . Mistake . This one , though a quality performance , is not `` Pink Floyd re-visited '' and has ZERO songs from his first two solid albums from back in the 80s ( David Gilmour and About Face ) . It is a bunch of slow , 'On an Island ' type songs from I do n't know where and multiple versions of PF songs that all began to sound the same ... I had to fast forward several times . The redeeming feature of this DVD is the Extras . The DVD is 'only ' $ 10 , but I do n't see myself ever watching it again so ... not worth the money .	-1
When I saw this DVD I bought it without reading too much about it - shame on me . I love Pink Floyd and David 's solo work . In the endless debate of Roger Waters vs. David Gilmour my vote is always 110 % in favor of David Gilmour . From the front cover it was obvious that it would be scaled down a bit but I did n't expect it to be as scaled down as it is . David talks to the audience a little here and there which is nice . The bad part about it , however , is that he speaks so softly that you ca n't hear anything he says without turning up the volume quite a bit . I would guess that the music is played at twice the volume as his voice when he speaks to the audience.The intro sets the stage for what is to come : a very , very slow version of `` Shine On You Crazy Diamonds '' which is played again later in the set at more of a pace that Pink Floyd fans are used to . There are a couple times during the set when David plugs in the electric guitar for a guitar solo but throughout the set I found myself wanting to turn it off in favor of watching the `` Pulse '' dvd instead.Overall I was very disappointed and if it were easier and possible I would return it for something else . I watched about half of the concert before falling asleep a couple nights ago and sadly have very little interest in even finishing it . It pains me to rate anything by David Gilmour or Pink Floyd so low but for the benefit of others I rated it how I honestly feel .	-1
A good mixture of concert and short movie footage ! They were both visual and sound stimulating . Very good stuff that you will have to watch to believe in what I am trying to say .	-1
Are you people insane ? This is horrible , the music is good yes but the footage is bad and it 's hard to watch unless you 're high . The fantasy scenes are just boring and you 're thinking okay that 's nice now get back to the concert footage . Zeppelin fans should n't waste time with this , instead you should check out their other concert dvd because it 's way better than this .	-1
If you already own the DVD of this concert do not bother to buy this BLU RAY disc , the sound do not improve a bit . The sound on the regular DVD is the same , the picture quality arguably is a bit better . This is far from true HD Sound ... NOT RECOMMENDED .	-1
I must have seen this movie 20 times at the local theatre . Friday and Saturday nights at midnight they 'd play Rock n Roll movies . I have never been able to stay awake through the whole movie . I thought at the time it was because we were staying up past midnight to watch it and we were just to tired to make it to the end . So when I picked up the DVD and brought it home after not seeing it for so many years I thought & quot ; I 'm finally gon na be able to see this movie from start to finish & quot ; . I still fell asleep . This movie has not aged well . I LOVE ZEP . But this movie reminds me too much of Spinal Tap . The dream sequences ... ... ... Why are the there ? The band looks very bored . They also seem to take this whole 'rock star ' persona way to seriously . Spinal Tap was a spoof . This was not and looks like one . Long live Zep ... ... ... ..but you do n't need this DVD in your collection .	-1
First of all ... this is not a reveiw of the actual movie . Or pehaps it is . This has nothing to do with the sound quality , which is very , VERY GOOD ! This has to do with the DVD version ( and maybe the actual movie , although I do n't remember noticing it while watching it at numerous mid-nite showings so many many years ago ) . This is not my opinion ... .THIS IS FACT ! ! I am a guitar player ( for nearly 40 years ) , as well as a dabbler on the keys . If you are a musician , you must have noticed it . The sound is NOT ... .I SAY THE SOUND IS NOT IN-SYNC WITH THE VIDEO ! What amatuer let this slide by . There are many places where this is noticible . You can 's miss it . Plant bellowing out a howl ( like during RnR ) , yet for a split second , the mic is still near his waist ... it 's not anywhere near his mouth . I thought that this was just an overdub . But no because during the intro to Stairway , Page ( my beloved guitar GOD himself ) is doing his little riff on the 6 of his EDS and ... .my gosh people , the sound and video are no where near in-synch with each other . There are many other moments just like this . I ca n't believe Page let this thru the out door ( pardon the pun ) . I enjoy this concert . I do n't believe it deserves the bad rap it has recieved over the past 25-30 years or so . If you like live albums that have been totally redone in the studio , try Rush 's Exit ... Stage Left or Show of Hands . Live albums were ( I say WERE ) meant to be made in the raw ! ... mistakes and all . And there are many of them ( LEAVE THEM IN ... THIS IS LIVE BABY ) . Musically I rate this as a ( LIVE album ) a 5 star PLUS ! BUT THE AWFUL PRODUCTION , AS WELL AS THE NUMEROUS PLANT CROTCH SHOTS ARE A TERRIBLE DISTRACTION ... .1/2 star .	-1
After reading the reviews of the poor picture quality , I am wondering , is it worth getting the 2-disc outrageously priced set ? What is on the second disc ? I still have my VHS but heard they sunk up the stereo audio from the `` Bonfire '' Box and when it switches to spoken word in interviews , the audio is drastically reduced ? Help out another Bon fan ! Thanks	-1
I agree with the other reviewer that this is the best Giselle I have ever seen . The second act , one of the peaks of European culture , is perfection in this version : bathed in moonlight , the young maidens dead before marriage , dance a surreal accompaniment to the tragic love affair of the two principals . The whole hallucinatory effect is supported by the marvelous music of Adolphe Adam : the quintessence of banality . the acme of vacuity , but perfection in this context . An experience to view and review time and again . Utterly divine . I want to givbe it five stars but the Amazon site is defective on my computer and will only accept one for some reason .	-1
... but KISS actually hit it with Crazy Nights . Three videos from this album are three to many . If you own this I hope it was a gift , otherwise you were ...	-1
The quality of the VHS release is far superior to the DVD available in 2009 . The DVD is washed out . The VHS has much better color and image-focus.The content ? For me , this movie can be watched many more times than Help or Hard Days Night . Listening to the entire audio is fun too .	-1
I have everything that the Beatles ever put out on vinyl and yes , I own a copy of each of their films . That being said . The movie was filmed in Black and white and recolored , its broadcast on the BBC at premier , I believe was also black and white which was a total waste as the color aspect of the film is lost and hence its a snore fest.Everyone is so strung out or post trip that really its a total shambles as far as any perceived plot . The only scene that gave me a laugh was of John shovelling spaghetti on a plate . Otherwise , the music scenes of I am the Walrus and The Fool on the Hill were a total waste even if you had dropped a blotter to relate.I rarely post really really negative reviews , but in all honesty , save your money , this sucks in a supremely quantum fashion . It should be a one star , I gave it 2 because I love their music so much . Sure , everyone had taken acid or done drugs , thats not the issue . This is a rambling directionless film directed and edited in some futile hope that you get it and in reality there nothing to get , everyone basically trips their nads off and you have to see the genius in it . I dont.Even under the guise of Pop culture or pseudo surrealism , this is a big can of suck . I am upset on 2 levels , 1 ) I cant ever get the time back I wasted in my life watching this and 2 ) its just so very poorly made.Part of me wishes I could give negative stars . One Caveat , it is still better than Ishtar , and on Ishtar , I will say the only positive thing I could recall was that the movie was shown in an air conditioned room .	-1
The quality of this dvd is terrible . The movie is great having seen it in much better quality on the BBC . Not even an official release makes this a clear sign to stay away from this dvd . Wait a few more years for the offical release from Apple and when it is digitally remastered .	-1
Those who read this review are , no doubt , familiar with every word , note , and film frame of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR . In short , the DVD transfer is horrible . Granted , the original 16mm film was not a professional job either , but this DVD appears as if it was derived from a very poor copy of the Beatles ' film.I have seen MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR in many formats . Years ago I found a 16mm film copy in the library . I borrowed this print several times . The the picture was very clear , but the sound was poor . Later I bought a VHS copy through MEDIA . The original VHS copy was about the same quality as the film , except that it was convenient to play on a video cassette recorder . Still later I bought a `` remastered digitally enhanced '' VHS copy . The picture was about the same as previous editions , but the sound was greatly improved.Recently I bought the DVD release . I was somewhat concerned that the DVD did not display the Apple Logo , but I had heard that this film drifted into the public domain a few years ago . I was sadly disappointed at the quality of the DVD . Nothing was done to improve this copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR . The color is washed out , picture is grainy , and the sound is worse than the original 16mm film . About the only benefit of the DVD is that enjoys the semi-permanence of being on DVD and you can jump from chapter to chapter.As for the film itself , this was the Beatles first attempt -- outside of some of their music promos -- at making a film . It was designed to be for television , so it was captured on 16mm color film . The plot is simple : The Beatles and friends load onto a bus to take a sight-seeing tour of England . These tours were standard fare for Brits in the late 1960s . Along the way the passengers and crew of the bus encounter some odd scenery and situations . In between there are some great Beatles musical numbers.Okay , the film itself is not Oscar material . It is more like something you would expect from someone showing off a new home movie/video camera . However , it is classic Beatles . There was not much of a script for this movie and John , George , Paul and Ringo all took part in the production . Apparently all four Beatles were involved in the editing , though never at the same time . As such , the film took on conflicting directions depending on who was in the editing room . Paul even slipped in his solo `` Fool on the Hill '' promo from Southern France.We have all heard the legend . This film bombed on British television . It was broadcast in black and white . Later it was rebroadcast in color in a bad time slot . Worse yet , the film was blown up to 35mm and premiered in theaters . Still , it heralded the creation of Apple . All four Beatles would be involved in numerous other film projects and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was good experience.If you do not already have a VHS copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR , I recommend that you wait for Apple to re-release a restored copy . On the other hand , the DVD is affordable .	-1
I was so excited when I heard that there was going to be a Police concert DVD and I did not hesistate to buy it once it came out . I watched it immediately and it was a real let down . The people who filmed and edited this concert must have been drunk or stupid because they definitely did not capture the concert like they should have . First of all , what 's with all the shots of the audience ? The shot of the girl dancing during `` Message In A Bottle '' does not make sense at all , the shots of the audience grooving during `` Wrapped Around Your Finger '' are pointless , the shots of those weirdos waving to the camera during `` De Do Do Do , De Da Da Da '' are dumb , and the shot of some teenager dancing real fast during one of the last songs makes me want to go back in time and break the cameras that were used to film the audience . Okay , there should be maybe some shots of an audience for a concert DVD but 98 % of the focus should always be on the musicians . Next , why are there almost no shots of Sting playing the bass ? Did the camera people forget that he was the bassist of the Police as well as the lead singer ? The camera only seems to be interested in his head . The guy is an excellent bass player and the directors for some reason chose to ignore that . Only on the multi angle tracks along with a few others can you see Sting playing the bass . Another extremely annoying factor about the camera work is that the backing singers get way too much camera time . Even when they are not actually singing , they are still shown . Why would the directors and editors choose to show the backing singers dancing instead of the band playing ? I do n't get it . Other crazy choices for the filming include that stupid strobe effect on `` Spirits In The Material World '' and that slow motion thing on `` Tea In The Sahara . '' It 's a shame that such a great band has a concert DVD consisting of garbage . I only give it 2 stars for the sound ( great sound ) , the set list , and the multi angle tracks . Otherwise I would not give it any stars . Someone needs to come out with a much better Police concert DVD that is filmed the way it should be . I 'm sure there is other footage that exists . Otherwise Sting , Andy , and Stewart need to put the band back together so they could film some shows . Wishful thinking , I know . I hope the three of them are just as angry about this DVD as I am . Save your money or buy it used for $ 5 if it 's even worth that much .	-1
My toddler loves the other three WDW sing-along videos ( Campout , Beach Party and Flik ) . I rented this from the library and it seemed promising at first , but she lost interest by the 3rd song and went back to asking for Beach Party.As for me , I was born and raised in Orlando and went to Walt Disney World at LEAST twice a year from 1973-2003 . I am a Disney fanatic and I love the theme parks . And a lot of adults wrote positive reviews here about this video . So I figured there was no way I would n't enjoy this , but I have to say I really did n't ! It was ... hmmm ... well , tacky . It did n't bring back 'fond memories ' of my trips ; instead it seemed like a bad late night infomercial for some little rinky-dink attraction . This might partly be because it 's for Disneyland and not the Magic Kingdom , but they are n't THAT different . It seemed like its creators were so determined to make it seem like `` The Happiest Place on Earth '' that everything was WAY overdone , and everyone including the 'guests ' were overacting to the EXTREME for the video . It was clearly made in the late 80s or early 90s so the people looked goofier than Goofy . It would be great if Disney would do an updated , modern version of this and make it classier.Also - be aware there is a Haunted Mansion scene that is n't appropriate for kids under 5 .	-1
I first wanted to give this only one star . I saw it at a party when I was a little bit drunk and thought it was rather fun . But then I watched it again and could not call this movie anything but garbage . Reason for 2 stars : Its Zappa , nice guitar solo in `` Magic fingers '' , the naked lady playing with her boobs , and ... ehmm..cant think of more .	-1
he is neither here ... ..IMHO ... .if you want to enjoy some music related to & # 34 ; groupies & # 34 ; and the pursuit of & # 34 ; Zappaness & # 34 ; , get the album that was recorded live a the Fillmore East in 1971 . Hysterical and poignant , Zappa at his best !	-1
We were getting geared up for the Winwood - Clapton tour last year and thought it would be nice to check Traffic out live . I wish I would have saved the money as this was just terrible in every aspect - poor audio , poor video and a completely un-inspired and low on talent ( at the time ) Steve Winwood . Catch him later on as he actually could play additional riffs on his keyboard . this was embarrasing for anyone who thinks they remember Traffic , minus Dave Mason , who WAS the heart of that band . Sorry , Jim Capaldi .	-1
This is a great concert . The problem is the way it was filmed . The concert was shot using film . Whenever the camera passes in front of one of the stage lights it leaves a huge streak across the picture that lasts for a few frames . Really annoying .	-1
While the sets are detailed and impressive , the production lacks `` atmosphere '' . everything seems as it should but there is a clinical quality about it which makes it all a bit dull . Add to that an overly melodramatic performance that border on being comical.Worst of all is the utter poor video quality of the DVD . look elsewhere if your in search of aida for your dvd/bluray library .	-1
Eurotrash is generally applied as a term by US commentators to criticise adversely European Regietheater productions , We in Europe think of Eurotrash as signifying vulgarity , over blown , ostentatious show . As such this Aida is a prime example of Eurotrash . What is Aida about ? What does it have to say to us NOW ? Verdi 's seriousness of intent is lost in a sea of literalness , ridiculousness and vulgarity . Opera for those who believe opera is a show , without meaning for the 21st Century . This great work deserves the seriousness of attention we apply to Shakespeare . This is a totally empty spectacle with posturing puppets ( who can sing , albeit well ! )	-1
I thought this was going to be a concert . Too much talk , travel footage and very little music .	-1
Right off the bat the cover is n't even a shot of Jimi At Berkeley and its all downhill after that . I have several close up slides of the second show that could have been used . Why the estate passes on their vault of Hendrix filmed material and releases this is beyond me . Bring out the Royal Albert Hall , Atlanta Pop , Stockholm 69 , PLEASE . This latest release will not win too many fans . The estate has had 20 odd years to `` get it together '' and except for the box sets along with Isle of Wight and Woodstock , has failed miserably . Come on McDermott you were once a collector and fan . What Up ?	-1
The concert is very good . But the DVD is a region 2 DVD and I live in the USA . Wo n't play . I sent it back for a refund .	-1
I saw it second run - maybe in 1972.It might be a well made film . The music may be tremendous.Once I saw Hell 's Angels kill on film , it was not about the music or about the quality of the film . You see in the early seventies , I was tired of seeing death . We just had years of Viet Nam on network news . I did not wan na see any more.Now , we do not see the reality of war . We do see massive amounts of gore in commercial film . Too many people are used to see death in the multiplex or on cable . I avoid those films .	-1
Not this DVD , Video or whattever it 's on nowadays again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It 's a documentary of a concert that went wrong , due to the Stones hiring The Hells Angels as security ! ! ! Now , How exciting can that be ? ? ! ! ! ! The Stones start playing , they have to stop , they start again , stop again , and so on , and so on.A good video ? Hell no ! Stones trying to cash in again ? Definetely !	-1
I borrowed this DVD from my local library , I was taken a back with the quality of this DVD , it looks like a crap video that is a shambles , The audio is reasonable in 5.1 plus the Doco is just ok , but the concert must be the worst vision I have seen on a DVD , How can David Bowie be happy with this visual display of inferior quality ? , I get cheesed off with having good AV gear to have to run this type of crap , and that 's what it is , CRAP ! ! I have videos that come up 100 % better , Why produce DVDs that dont qualify for this technology ? it '' s not the first and it wo n't be the last , DVD producers please do n't bother putting visual crap out on DVD , your transfers are unworthy of modern technology , if the Masters do n't scrub up for transfer forget it , although a lot of people cant see any difference , so be it .	-1
I had high hopes for this video as I love Hank Williams and think he was one of the last and best authentic country music people ( unlike the plastic , blow dry , plastic surgerized men and women faking it in Nashville today ) . Country music today has been declawed and de # @ % % @ # , as has Latino music - all in the name of money and Clear Channel radio programming formats . I wish I could agree that Sneezy does a good Hank but I found his performance to be only vaguely reminiscent of our boy . Sneezy does n't look like Hank except from a distance . His voice does n't sound like Hank to me . His singing lacks Hank 's straight from the heart charm , pain , and joy . The film is a bore and is cheaply filmed . If you can catch any of Hank 's filmed appearances , you will see how he just lights up a stage . A disappointment .	-1
This was a huge disappointment . This & # 34 ; Sneezy & # 34 ; really was n't up to the role . I 'm sure Hank Jr. or Alan Jackson or Travis Tritt ... any number of people could have done a much better job . He has no singing voice either ... a total loss ... I would n't recommend this to anyone ... .very poor .	-1
This is a barely adequate production of the great Mozart Opera.The spare stage settings create little of the `` Singspiel '' magic that this opera requires.Franciso Araiza is uninspiring as Tamino but other members of the cast are generally good - Kathleen Battle is appropriately girlish as Pamina , Kurt Moll provides some gravitas as Sarastro , and Manfred Hemm provides some energy and humour as Papageno.This production never springs to life and after a while one just sits there feeling bored.Sound and picture quality are OK .	-1
I just got this . I 'm a huge Black Sabbath fan as well as a Dio fan . I thought there would be a lot of good stuff from that period.There was some , but not enough.Most of it was interviews from people I did n't know were in the band.Part 1 of the Black Sabbath story was awsome . This part falls far short .	-1
I love Moody Blues , but did not enjoy watching this concert on my 55 '' Sony TV , because the quality was worse than VHS . I am really surprised that the production company used cheap cameras and use cheap editing equipment . The post production was finished using linear editing system , everything looks pixelated . If this would have been filmed 50 years ago , I would say its OK. As far as fans , they are still enjoying it , that 's why there are so many 5 star reviews .	-1
We know the boys were giving it their bloody all , based on everything we 've read about their farewell . Unfortunately , this production is nearly ruined by terrible sound , echoing all over the place , and then the abysmal camera work , which reaches a frustrating nadir when the stoned cameraman goes absolutely berserk with the zoom apparatus , wanking that thing for all it 's worth in an apparent attempt to simulate an LSD trip ( ? ) ( and , my god , the editor left it in ! ) Other than that the camera is content to crawl up the nostrils of the trio or examine their dental work.That being said , the interviews are rather amusing , with the lads innocently talking gear and technique .	-1
Much of what I could contribute has already been said about this DVD . The editors even had Clapton change from a 335 to a Firebird in the middle of a solo . I knew he was good , but seriously folks ! ! In spite of all the drawbacks , it is the most complete record we have of a Cream concert in a large venue . However , there is room for hope ! PLEASE , if anyone out there with the wherewithall will listen . Please record all nights of the upcoming Albert Hall series of concerts and release a box DVD set including every performance , plus rehearsal footage in a pristine , unaltered form using state of the art recording equipment ! ! This is the one and only way out of this disaster . What do you say ? we 're listening ... ... ... and waiting ... and listening .	-1
Cream was a great band . Their importance and influence in the rock world ( and jazz and blues , too ) ca n't be over-stated . I love these guys . Having said that , I must warn anybody who is n't aware of this movie - that it is one of the most horrible botch jobs in the history of rock documentaries . I think everybody from the director to the camera to the sound must have been awfully stoned . If you want to see a movie featuing Jack Bruce 's acne scars with psych-ay-dell-ik sperm overlays crowding the frame , and almost unlistenable muddled sound in the background , then this film is for you . Or perhaps you 'd like to see the camera zoom in and out on Clapton 's nose to the movment of his wah-wah pedal.I read in an interview that Clapton was so incensed when he saw this botch of a movie that he actually went looking for tony palmer . I can only hope he found him and soundly kicked his ass.The only plus are the interviews with Clapton and Baker . Baker comes across as incredibly stupid ( which he most certainly is n't ) , but it 's funnier than hell . And his drumming speaks for itself .	-1
this sounds terrible.does n't look too well either.the 2005 version is all one might need , it covers it all with passion and grace.time is fair .	-1
This DVD is strictly for fans of rock comedy , and fans of Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons who masqueraded as KISS from 1983- 1996 . I refer to these 13 years as the embarrassing years . The DVD clearly highlights how a 1970 's Super group became a parody of itself.Prior to watching Konfidential and Xtreme ... . make sure you watch Spinal Tap.Ace Frehley - No RegretsIn Ace 's book No Regrets he alleges that Gene Simmons is sex addict and that everyone who has worked with Gene in the past 25 years has either been fired or quit . Ace has the last laugh as he cites that KISS became Spinal Tap after his departure.Video 's : The video 's from 1983 - 1995 clearly tell the Spinal Tap story . I watched them in the way that one watches a horrific car accident . For Ace and Peter fans , this is the first `` official '' DVD whereby Paul , but mainly Gene , criticize them . Gene 's vulgarity really comes across in this DVD with lines like - `` she had an opening and I had a stiff proposition . '' Gene thinks this is quite funny as he pauses for dramatic effect.Spinal Tap - in that movie that band has a drummer problem whereas KISS has a lead guitar problemPaul and Gene puts Ace down and then proceeds to criticize ALL the other lead guitarists.Vinnie Vincent - Gene alleges that Vinnie quote `` hung himself as he was handed the keys to the kingdom. `` I do n't know what happended with Vinnie Vincent as Gene avoids any detail.Mark St John - Gene cites that Mark St John is a `` musician '' who plays too many notes . Anyway ... .. Mark St John 's hand blew up to the size of a watermelon on the eve of a European tour . He was dumped for Bruce Kulick.The 1996 re-union has NOT yet occurred . The DVD ends with Bruce Kulick in the band . .1 Star out of 5 ... .. due to the Vintage Footage AND the fact that Paul admits that Ace was a valuable contributor to the band.Prior to the KISS-ology DVD 's I would have recommended it for the vintage clips from 1974 - 1977 . As you can now view these clips on the Second KISSology DVD , there is absolutely NO reason to own this . I bought it by accident just prior to the release of The Second Coming DVD . More fool me . If you can borrow it from a book or video library do so .	-1
... but it just seems to me that $ $ $ $ is the driving force behind baby boomer , but particularly Beatles , reissues . This has never been released on video , to my knowledge , so it is an event . And it 's nice to get the bonus stuff . But I think the pricetag is out of line , priced too high just because they know they can get it.It just seems a shameless ripoff ( kinda like gas prices ) . I mean , these guys all donated their time , played for no pay , to benefit a country in need . This kind of greedy , self-serving pricing seems at horrible odds with the original intent of the concert itself . People say this was the Live Aid template . The Live Aid DVD came out last March , a 4 DVD set that is priced at half of what this set is.Something 's terribly wrong here .	-1
Sorry , but this has to be a dissenting opinion . As some of the other reviewers have noted , `` Superman and the Mole Men '' was later edited into a two-part episode for the George Reeves TV program , now rechristened as `` The Unknown People . '' Sorry , folks , but in this case the `` edited for TV '' version is a distinct improvement and for one reason : THE MUSIC ! The score used in the original movie is a pallid , third-rate job that does nothing to advance the action or to support the eerie , `` film noir '' feel of the camera work . But when the film was mixed down for presentation on TV , the show 's producers had the genius to replace the film 's soundtrack with some of the scariest , most vivid background scores then available . ( As a matter of fact , this weird and wonderful music - used over and over again as background music throughout the first , black-and -white season of the 1950 's `` Adventures of Superman '' TV show - has been helpfully collected on CD by the Varese-Sarabande label . You can order it right here , at Amazon.com ! The Adventures of Superman : Original Television Soundtrack ( 1950s TV Series ) ) Anyone who gets to know `` Superman and the Mole Men '' only through the original theatrical release with its substandard , tepid musical score will have no idea of how good the film really is , or understand how the effective use of great background music can turn a third-rate movie into a very good film . Luckily for everyone , the DVD release of the first season of 'The Adventures of Superman ' made both TV re-mix and original theatrical version of 'Mole Men ' available for comparison.Adventures of Superman : The Complete First SeasonTrust me , after seeing the TV re-mix , you 'll never want to watch the theatrical release again !	-1
By 1968 Julie Andrews was one of the most-loved performers of stage and screen , the original Eliza Doolittle of Broadway 's MY FAIR LADY , a Best Actress Oscar winner for MARY POPPINS , and the star of film version of THE SOUND OF MUSIC -- a movie that was so profitable Hollywood wags dubbed it `` The Sound of Money . '' 20th Century Fox wasted little time in developing a new property for their new star , and ( possibly under the influence of FUNNY GIRL , the great stage success that was set to film at about the same time ) reached back in time to tell the story of a theatrical legend : Gertrude Lawrence.It seemed like a winner . Gertrude Lawrence ( 1902-1952 ) was known as `` The Toast of Two Continents '' in an era when the term had an almost literal meaning , and the highs and lows of her extremely public private life were almost as dramatic as her career . Operating with an incredibly large budget and under the direction of Robert Wise , the bio-pic STAR ! seemed to have everything : lavish sets , incredible costumes , a truly great collection of songs , an epic running time , and -- of course -- Julie Andrews . What more could you want ? Well , an interesting movie would be nice.STAR ! opened with tremendous fanfare in 1968 and proved an instant fiasco . All the earnings of THE SOUND OF MUSIC were wiped out seemingly overnight , and with bankruptcy staring it in the face 20th Century Fox cut the film from three to two hours and rushed the film into general release as THOSE WERE THE HAPPY TIMES . As a result , the film holds the dubious distinction of being the only major Hollywood film to completely tank twice in major theatrical release.At the time , much of the film 's failure was laid at the feet of Julie Andrews . Gertrude Lawrence , her remarkable career , and her high-flying lifestyle were still well-recalled in 1968 , and Julie Andrews simply did not look , walk , talk , sing , or in any way , shape or form bear any resemblance to her . Seen today , however , this seems an unfair accusation ; it is very evident that the project was never intended as a recreation of Lawrence , and Julie Andrews is actually quite good within the very tight limitations imposed upon her . The real problem is the script , which goes nowhere at a slow crawl . Indeed , the single most dramatic event in the entire story is Lawrence 's financial bankruptcy ! Yes , you can enjoy the sights and sounds of STAR ! But the story is beyond boring : it makes you feel that you 're sinking slowly to the bottom of a sea of Jello . The DVD has been criticized for leaving out the few minutes of intermission material that accompanied the original release ; frankly , I ca n't see this as anything more than a mercy , for the less time spent here the better . As for the bonuses , they are okay -- which is to say that they are actually more interesting than the film itself . I 'll be generous and give it two stars for production values and musical numbers . But unless you are a diehard Julie Andrews fan , do yourself a favor and give STAR ! a miss.GFT , Amazon Reviewer	-1
Weather its a French Poodle or a mangy mutt . Star may be a French Poodle , but its still a dog . I dont understand all the raves for this film . Its easy to see why it tanked in 68 and I dont understand its cult following today . Yes , Julie ( miscast ) , is beautiful , sings well , oodles of production numbers ( way too many ) ; the clothes ! But where 's the story ? Star put the final nail in the coffin for road show pictures . A curiousity piece for those wondering what that era was like . But not a good example of it . Lawrence deserved better .	-1
Anybody that has been at , or perhaps should I say 'in ' , a santana concert certainly must remember it 's the atmosphere that whafts around the stadium that perhaps increases the heartbeat rather than just the music . I was concerned when I bought this disc that Carlos may just be doing a 'sell out ' or try to shove some non classic music down my throat.I was right , on both counts , sure he squeezed four of his best and clsssics into the middle of his concert with 'Black Magic W , Gypsy Queen , Oye Como Va ' , and 'Samba ' while the rest of the disc is jam packed with 14 ho hummers ... ..In my mind the standard for classic super group DVD 's still has to be Fleetwood Mack 's 'The Dance ' DVD ... ... You have to be a real hard core Santana fan and put up with his antics to enjoy this Santana DVD ... ...	-1
... the audio is EXTREMELY compressed . Not at all what you expect from DVD technology .	-1
The original run time for this movie is 92 minutes , but this 25th anniversary version is 89 minutes , yet no scenes are cut . How can this be ? Simply , the movie has been `` sped up '' by 4 % , which is what happens when movies are put on video in Europe due the difference in frame rate . It looks like what the geniuses who released this DVD did was , take the 4 % faster overseas version ( meaning the audio pitch is higher ) , and simply use that without first trying to `` reconvert '' it back to our system to get the correct time/speed . But wait , this is equally lame , we should n't need to convert from a previously converted format , as the U.S. format `` is '' the original format.Bottom line , this release is not any kind of remaster , it was simply stolen from a European release that was n't even that good . The best quality DVD version ever released for this movie ( to date of this review ) was the German release , the quality will blow you away . The only drawbacks for viewing in the U.S. is , you would need a multi-format DVD player for playback ( though your PC drive will work ) , and , you would have the 4 % speed hike . Most people wo n't notice the speed increase , but in music it is more noticeable.Get the German DVD if you can , it has both 2.0 and 5.1 audio , and pristine video quality in true widescreen . And it has the originally UNEDITED audio . Wonder if Lion 's Gate will actually do it right for the Blu-Ray release . ***** AMENDED FOR BLU-RAY REVIEW , READ BELOW : DO NOT waste your money on the U.S. blu-ray release , Lionsgate dropped the ball again , the quality is awful : colors are faded , and there is so much grain it makes no sense ... .the good news is , the German blu-ray on the Concorde label looks like it was made yesterday , and that is no exaggeration ... the colors will blow you away , but even better is the clarity and detail , it 's jaw dropping , even the background forest scenes are razor sharp . AND THERE IS NO GRAIN . And , Blu-ray high definiton video does n't have the 4 % speed issues that standard definiton DVD 's have . Also , The German Blu-ray is region free , so it will play on U.S Blu-ray players , except for the extras , which will not play at all as they are standard defintion.Below are the links for the German Blu-ray , and the German 3D version of the Blu-ray ; to help navigate through the german language , I found it helpful to match the pages with same U.S. amazon pages to see what options I needed to use to buy it : http : //www.amazon.de/letzte-Einhorn-Blu-ray-Arthur-Rankin/dp/B005FUO7D6/ref=sr_1_3 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1364742928 & sr ; =8-3http : //www.amazon.de/Einhorn-Version-magnetischem-3D-Wackelbild-Blu-ray/dp/B0094M6DTC/ref=sr_1_5 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1364742928 & sr ; =8-5	-1
The Last Unicorn is one of my favorite animated films of all time and I have waited years for this movie to be released on DVD . The soundtrack is wonderful too , and I listen to it often . You can imagine how excited I was when I got the Amazon notification that it would finally be available , so the movie itself gets 5 stars but this edition gets 1 star and deserves nothing more . This has to be the absolute worse picture quality I have ever seen on a DVD ... heck the VHS copy has to be better than this . The sound quality is terrible too , sounding almost like a record , and there are absolutely no extras . Not to mention that the movie was only released in full screen , but I could have dealt with that had the rest of the DVD been done right . Artisan/FHE did such a shoddy job with this DVD that I will be very careful when picking up anything else from them in the future . I tried to return my copy , but of course since the seal was broken , they could do nothing about it so I resold it online and have ordered a no region copy of the German release , which looks and sounds great ! I recommend anyone wanting this movie to consider that for themselves . Maybe Artisan/FHE will take the hint and actually give us some credit by releasing a version of The Last Unicorn worth paying for .	-1
This is the poorest excuse for a video ! What 's the Temptations without David Ruffin , Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams ? This video breaks my heart . I 'm truly heartbroken !	-1
Elvis Presley 's 68 Comeback Special is a poor concert . Many songs are turned into medley 's ( who only wants to hear a partial song ? ) . Also Elvis 's performance just is n't anygood , and the setlist leaves a lot to be desired . Not enough big hits , and I hate the gospel medley , awful !	-1
OK , let 's get this out of the way , the ELVIS ( '68 Comeback ) is the finest TV special ever presented on American television . So why the 1 star ? The editing in this version of the show is appalling , such lazy dilettantes . Every time there is a cut from one scene to another there is a still shot that moves from left to right and then the action resumes . It is grating . The show cuts from sit down performance to stand up and back and forth , all edits being telegraphed with the aforementioned still shot , stop and go routine , it is a real hack job.I own the 74 minute version put out 15 years ago and the editing follows the original broadcast . When they can , they put in extra footage at the appropriate time ( sit down is added to sit down performance , standup to standup so there is a continuous flow ) . The edits can be made from scene to scene and the original fade to black for the commercials are maintained . In addition they edited out Blue Christmas for crying out loud , what 's up with that ? Also on the cutting room floor is the little funky rhythm guitar part that immediately follows the intro Guitar Man and the audience clapping , hey remember the part where Elvis gives that sly smile and says , `` I think I 'll put a strap on this and stand up '' ? , remember his deadpan delivery of `` Man I just work here '' , Good thing for your memory ` cause it 's gone , cut out in favor of those imaginative edits.For the record to edit from scene to scene , if the action ca n't be done smoothly , you can always insert an audience shot and then back to Elvis , it 's called ` editing ' , people . The picture and sound are otherwise fabulous , it looks the same as the BOX set that I also own , I was hoping to get a version of the performance with extra black leather footage , but I was assuming the editing would be handled by professionals who would try to maintain the spirit , look , and vitality of the original while adding to the show . They ended up subtracting from the overall viewing pleasure . By editing out the Elvis dialog , they 've removed the soul of the presentation , the special was all about getting Elvis back in front of a live microphone but also to humanize him , show his gifted sense of humor . What a drag .	-1
We have nearly one dozen ELMO DVD 's for our toddlers ; this is their Least favorite and by far my worst as well . Very above their heads as far as content , wherease the ELMO 'S WORLD DVD 's cater to little kids and their like and dislikes . The Noodle Brothers are a real favorite and they do n't even make an appearance in this one ! The singing and dancing is fine if you 're looking for a `` Broadway '' show but for plain educational fun and games , this is not the one to buy ... stick with any and all ELMO 's WORLD tapes/dvd 's .	-1
I finished watching THE SECRET OF NIMH . Do n't worry : their secret is safe with me . By the end of the movie , I still had no idea what NIMH is . I assume it 's some nasty lab that does nasty things to rats to make them intelligent . But they also seem to be exterminators . And unless I dozed off and missed it , they never explained what the letters N.I.M.H . stand for . They 're written in upper-case letters , so probably they stand for something.The only characters I found remotely interesting were the owl , the cat and the crow . ( I did like the kid calling the crow a turkey ; that was cute . ) It was a delight to hear John Carradine 's voice again . He must have been at death 's door when that was made . Dom DeLuise was fun . Elizabeth Hartman , whoever she is , had no personality whatsoever . She came across as a total wimp . Just at the point where she might have developed into someone interesting , the movie ended very abruptly with the two crows forming patterns in the sky with their string . Huh ? Did they run out of film at that point ? Or money ? Anyway , the watercolor backgrounds were pretty.There are many things in the movie that I though were unsuitable for kids , and the pacing is so slow and meandering that I ca n't imagine kids being interested . However , that 's only my opinion .	-1
Awful CD . Aerosmith are one of the most overplayed and overratedrock bands of all time behind the even worse , AC/DC . The singerjust screams , this is n't music , this is just noise . I mean theonly good song is Janie 's Got a Gun , everyelse spit . This musicis trash , throw it away and do n't buy it again.Get Your Wings is all you need from this overrated band .	-1
This disaster epitomizes all that is wrong with corporate sellout rock music . Aerosmith is responsible for some of the greatest rock of the 70s , but here they hired some professional writers and set a torch to their storied legacy . Crazy , Amazing , Crying , Blind Man - each is rewrite of the other and they all belong on a Cher album . Seriously . They have nothing to do with rock n roll . Aerosmith had a FEW decent tracks from this time period ( FINE , Young Lust , The Other Side , geez I 'll even say that What It Takes was ok for a ballad ) , but the rest of this album is pure schmaltzy vegas pablum . Man , even the cover looks like it was whipped together in 3 minutes . And come on - how stupid is the title ? `` Big Ones , get it ? Har har har '' . Hey , if you know these songs and you love 'em , then more power to you and have fun with this album . Anyone else who wants to expereince the real Aerosmith should start with Rocks . Aerosmith : No shame .	-1
The foursome got in trouble doing this movie . The slapstick group was n't that funny in this film . Guns do n't belong in a Monkee 's movie .	-1
Okay . Let me get the contradiction started . I love the artists , the selections are interesting , and the performances top-notch . So why am I giving the DVD two stars ? Keith Jarrett 's annoying habits . Jarrett accompanies his own piano-playing by humming and snorting his improvisations . Imagine a Warner Brothers cartoon version of a bee humming a song , and you get the idea . I 'll be the first to admit that I found ( find ? ) the late Glenn Gould 's audible humming on all his recordings more than a little charming . But Glenn was more subtle - and in key , something Jarrett can not quite accomplish . All the positive things the other reviewers have said are on the money . There is a lot that is good about this performance/DVD . But I question whether their hearing ( or system ) is up to par if they can ignore this serious shortcoming . I 've tried several times since I received my copy in the mail to sit down and enjoy this recording . But this annoyance is too much to bear .	-1
it could have been funny without the use of vulgar language but the comedian used a lot of cursing and foul words as a crutch to make his comedy . what a pity . the use of foul language means you do n't trust your talents in making people laugh .	-1
Bland ramblings . It seemed funny at the time . . .and the times have changed . Try another disc and forget this one .	-1
1 star is to dull but five are to hot- maybe not=and comon will this review make or break your decision ? ? Oh then buy it . what they dont tell you is its 2 discs 1 is mostly post waters stuff and the other is mostly DSOTM , It sounds great and if your worried about how it looks then maybe you should be wasting your money on a music DVD Im sure you dont need me to tell you about The Pink Floyd sound as they were formerly called .	-1
What a great show in 1994 ! I can hardly wait for the DVD to come out 12 years after the show . Maybe that will be 14 years after ... or later than that.Pulse ( Doctor ... there 's no pulse ! ) is just so disappointing by its absence . Amazon , EMI , Pink ( gray ) Floyd just are n't satisfying the fans . We are being played with.All in all its just so disappointing .	-1
Why people buy this ? I dont know.This is a bad dvd.Buy Roger Waters dvd `` in the flesh '' ; best music dvd ever.Dont buy PULSE dvd . This is fake dvd . The first part is some new stuff from pink floyd ( extr bad ) The second part ( like tribute band ) WARNING ! ! ! ! ! DONT BUY	-1
Mariah Carey has long been looked at as one of my idols . I thought how she was doing something that she loved and did n't worry about having to & quot ; lip sync & quot ; , due to the fact she has a marvelous voice . I was wrong . Mariah Carey was obviously & quot ; lip syncing & quot ; in this video . All of the songs sound just as they did when they were released . I begining to think she has lost her confidence .	-1
I 'm not the sort to give things a bad review because it is 'cool and trendy ' . Way too old for that . But I have to say that I am glad I checked this video out at the rental store before buying.Really it 's quite bad . Not that the dancing is n't phenomenal ( Michael rules ! ) , but it lacks soul . Hubby and I like Celtic music -- old `` Shepherd 's Hey '' fans -- and we get to see Celtic dancing locally ( though amateur ) and we both found this video disappointing.The principal problem is the 'homogenization ' of the singing . It is sort of Celtic music for elevators . The second problem is the Flamenco dancer . Having seen a top rank group from Spain at Wolftrap , I have to say that this lady has got no 'attitude ' and the music ... . please , do n't get me started.Two Stars . Could have used a plot . Could have used some 'edge ' to both the singing and dancing . Lots of people adore this video but if you are a fan of traditional Irish dance and song , you might want to rent first .	-1
This is dated material . I prefer the later dvd 's like Bridges to Babylon . I rented this a went thru it in about 15 minutes . Not a keeper .	-1
Want to have nightmares ? Well , then get this DVD.What was the Lyon Ballet thinking of ? ? ? ? ? Copellia is a very gentle , charming wisp of a ballet . A light touch is essential . Delibes score is light and delicious.All of that goes into the trash can . Much of the music is cut , this version of the `` ballet '' is set in a seedy urban setting.There is almost no dancing . Swanhilda hardly exists except todo some quasi-ballet moves in combat boots while munching an apple.The horror really begins in act 2 . Dr Copellius is able to produce a never ending series of Coppelias , they emerge froma movie projector . All have red dresses , spike heels , and blondwigs . They seem to be both male and female underneath the oppressive costuming . And that 's pretty much where the `` concept runs out of steam . There is a little more perfunctory action , instead of Swanhilda doing some of the doll specialty dances , Dr Coppelius and Franz do them instead . Why ? What did this gentle ballet do to deserve this ?	-1
Pairing Elvis Presley with Nancy Sinatra may have sounded good on paper , but there is no chemistry on celluloid . In all fairness , not even Ann-Margret could have redeemed `` Speedway . '' There are a few good songs ( especially Elvis ' classic `` Let Yourself Go '' ) and the stock-car footage is fairly enjoyable . Otherwise , strictly Formula One . Released in June 1968 , `` Speedway '' gave little indication of the triumphant Presley comeback just around the corner .	-1
I did not like this video at all . I expected to see a good documentary full of rare and hit videos , and all we get to see is lengthy interviews and the bee gees showing their homes . The best part is when we see the group singing Massachusetts in the sixties , if only for less than 15 seconds . Thats all !	-1
Fleetwood Mac , unless you are a true fan , really puts on a senseless , energy-drained show here that you 'll sicken of faster than a can of Gummie Worms at the State Fair . And State Fairs , indeed , are where this group ought to be playing ; right next to Whitesnake and Rick Springfield and the demolition derby and blue ribbon goats.Buckingham gets his ya-yas out a couple times on lead guitar , but other than that , the ladies sound old , the bass player John just stands there ( like he has for his entire career ) . Christine still looks youthful ; an unsung MaryAnne next to Stevie 's more often photographed Ginger . Christine remains a comely British school marm ready to spank your wrists for looking up her skirt , so that 's one redeeming feature . Yet that small pleasure is offset by Mick 's still googly eyes and the 1980s vest . Thanks for putting a camera right by Mick so that I can get scared out of my easy chair every time he stares those cue balls at the camera ; nice touch for Halloween.I wish I could say that Fleetwood Mac are rockers , but alas , they are little more than Lawrence Welk on steroids . Sure , Do n't Stop pushes the metronome to 40 mph from Fleetwood Mac 's usual school zone 20 mph pace , but seriously rip-snortin ' rock and roll this just ai n't , brothers and sisters . No matter how much Dolby 5.1 Surround and DVD fog-filtered quality you throw at this show , the music remains elevator quality drivel . The passge of time has , in my opinion , shown the Mac 's music to be thinner than the veils around Stevie 's midsection paunch.Pass on it .	-1
I like this band a lot , but this DVD is a rip off . The sound is muffled and absolutely horrible . The footage is ok , but I could n't get past the sound problems . I would definitely stick with the live cannibalism DVD .	-1
Clearly , the producers of this DVD meant to mislead . The cover of the DVD shows the original album cover suggesting that it is a visual equivalent of the album . Please read the cover carefully . It is a quickly put together documentary of the times surrounding the making of the album . Too much time is taken up showning closeups of the of photographic stills that are already on the original album cover and liners.Much time is spent describing the breakup of the relationships.Some of the new performances of the classic songs are again , quickly put together and does n't provide additional insights.Hastily produced DVD with a misleading cover to cash in on unsuspecting fans .	-1
I bought this hoping that the promised songs on the back of the box would be the videos or `` promotional short '' versions songs I had seen on the internet . They were floating around Windows Media player when they were promoting the re-release of Rumours with extras and demos . They were indeed the cuts I was looking for : Fleetwood Mac jamming live versions Rhiannon , You Make Loving Fun , and Dreams . Filmed in 16mm on what looks like their touring stage running through impressive live renditions of these tunes , I yelped with joy that I had these chestnuts on DVD . Unfortunately , on this disc they are present as small samples of the various songs , and cut down to about 30 seconds each . More than enough to tease the viewer but not enough to satisfy . Apparently the producers of this documentary felt that we would be happy to sit through lots of inerview segments on the making of Rumours , but not fantastic footage made at the time of Mac playing the songs . Having seen them , I now realize what a great band they are ( and were ) live , but I wish they hadnt snipped down these awesome videos for this release . Dangit .	-1
Please release something better than this on DVD . ANYTHING ! ! ! !	-1
We bought this DVD for five bucks , and I think we paid for the entire production . My son is eleven , and he enjoyed the book . Of course adjustments are made for teleplays , like the removal of a character or a changed ending , but it was so laughably awful in acting , costume , script and overall production values , that we were never frightened , and we only laughed in sheet derision . Avoid at any cost . My nine-year-old daughter says , `` I 've seen cartoons scarier than this ! ''	-1
& quot ; Yessongs & quot ; is basically a very poor film of a great band in a good concert . If you are a Yes fan , you will probably want to view & quot ; Yessongs , & quot ; especially if you never saw the band live . I saw the band live about 5 years after this concert was filmed , and not much had changed . More of a light show , more keyboards for Wakeman , more great tunes , but basically the show was unchanged. & quot ; Yessongs & quot ; opens up with ( a somewhat slower version than the studio version of ) & quot ; I 've Seen All Good People. & quot ; It 's a good start to the concert , featuring the skills of all of the members . Jon Anderson 's unique voice , although not captured as well here as on any of their albums , comes through as well as the sound quality will allow . Chris Squire 's bass work and vocals show why he was an integral part of the group . Wakeman has a few good moments , but mostly is hidden behind his huge sequined cape . The show really belongs to Steve Howe and his incredible guitar work . Especially during the first half of the concert , Howe is the primary focus . Here we see one of the most talented and overlooked guitarists of the 1970 's . Most of the music itself is very good , except for the & quot ; Wives of Henry VIII & quot ; which is all Wakeman . Part of what made Yes great was the uniqueness of their sound , the feeling that they were playing music from another world . The sounds were great , but they were ahead of where the video/audio technology was at that time . In the year 2001 , we are used to well-produced video , great effects , and digital audio . Unfortunately , none of these elements are present in & quot ; Yessongs. & quot ; I would really like to find out if the band was filmed in their later years with a better video/audio set-up . Until then , the best way to experience Yes is to put on one of their CD 's , sit back , and close your eyes ...	-1
I was really disappointed in this . First it is only 74 minutes long . YES played in 1972 for about 3 hours when you saw them . This video has crappy sound and visuals . You get about four songs taken out of a concert and that has no context . A real rip off .	-1
Disclaimer : my copy is region B and not purchased through Amazon , but rather through an Australian retail outlet . That said , I am staggered at the asking price for this sub-par Blu-ray on this website and I must agree with the other two reviewers . The 5.1 mix is very disappointing , I think I got more out of it by using the ProLogic ll setting on my Pioneer receiver . I ca n't even access the `` restored mono mix '' , the disk case actually says that it is NOT included , despite the included 2012 trailer stating that it IS on the disk . What a selling point - here 's what your disk DOES N'T have on it ! ! On the doco Steve Howe says that the mix on the film was done brilliantly but this sounds like it was played back in an aircraft hangar and re-recorded by a bootlegger . As for the video , the trailer shows the film to be in 16:9 but clearly that 's not how it plays back . I suspect it is just cropped anyway so we probably are n't missing anything , but to the manufacturers , do n't mislead people , please . I ca n't comment on accessible video resolution as I do n't have a HD television . The film restoration was n't too bad , I know that there was n't much lighting to work with and this is probably as good as it gets.In conclusion , fair enough that you ca n't make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear but as consumers we deserve to be given more honest information about what we are buying . Marginally better video than the original , and a botched surround mix is hardly anything to get excited about in a marketing campaign , and Howe , Squires and Dean wasted their time making the doco . Another annoyed fan .	-1
Muti 's performance is acceptably & quot ; Mozartian & quot ; - and the singers do justice to the roles . The production is what one might call & quot ; opera house standard. & quot ; However , the video rendition is atrocious - perhaps the translation from European to American video standards was & quot ; too much & quot ; - the images are & quot ; jumpy & quot ; and erratic- it 's distracting in the extreme . Turn off the monitor and listen to the performance .	-1
The main attraction of this DVD is the chance you do n't get these days - to see Domingo not on vocal autopilot . Behrens may not be Tebaldi but she was a fine actress and Tosca gave her a chance to shine . The problem is MacNeil 's vocally threadbare Scarpia . By this stage his & quot ; singing & quot ; was simply terrible ( pitch problems , dry sound , no legato phrasing ) . Several other baritones would have been a far better choice but , then , most Met & quot ; old timers & quot ; know that backstage politics has far more to do with casting than talent . A better choice is the Kabaivanska/Domingo/Milnes video . Wait for it to come to DVD .	-1
This is a reissue of Prime Cuts with bonus material on a 2nd disc . The first disc/edition was good but Alice speaks of the original band as if they were dead , not bothering to include them in this retrospective except in the 3rd person . The 2nd disc on the reissue seems to rectify this by adding new footage of the original band being interviewed , or does it ? ? ? To view the 2nd disc material you need to play some stupid snakes and ladders game by rolling some on screen dice with your remote buttons . This is absolutely insane and is an absolute nightmare . I just want to watch the damn video ! ! ! There are a few tips on various on line Alice Cooper fan web sites on how to bypass some of this madness but if your DVD player is not configured like the tips require , you 're out of luck.I was trying to time the dice rolls and chapter skipping on my remote and I could hear my DVD tray spinning and agonizing trying to keep up with my remote . I just want to see the video ! ! ! Well my expensive DVD/Player/Recorder broke . Trying to make this stupid game work broke my DVD player/recorder.Maybe the conspiracy stories of Alice and his manager trying to erase the history of the original band is true . `` OK we 'll give em some interviews with the old band but just let em try and view it . Evil laughter ... ha ha ha ha ha ! ! ! ''	-1
Mara Zampieri , is the worst singer I have ever heard on the La Scala stage in a Dvd production . I am not being bitter and spiteful , she simply ruins it . I have watched the show with freinds , and we have to stop , because Zampieri seems like a bad joke . The tone is very very thin and shrill . The vibrato has no vibration , wooden with no roundness . The singing is sharp here and flat there , and in most incidental singing there is no spin at all . I can barely watch aby of it , and It spoils a great production . What is really weird , is that she is a first class actress , and and creates a fabulous picture of Minnie ... oh wellTo proceed , Juan Pons is a fabuous Rance . His Rance has a bit of Tonio in him . Big , ugly deformed , lonely , and sympathetic . This is not your gun slinging , tobacco chewig rance , this is your selfish , hurt and twisted rance . I always enjoy Pons and his charachterizations and his yelly and unique voice.Domingo owns this part , and will own it until he finally retires ( he has not yet taken it from his rep and it will most likley be the last Italian verismo part he gives up . ) His tone is just a strong as it was 9 years ago and one year later , and there is little to say . His the great ramirez head to toe.I could not help notice that between the two dvd Fanciullas this one seems to have the weaker supporting cast , but that is mere speculationIf you are buying this production , dont say you were n't warned about Zampieri .	-1
This is a Rossini serious opera and it is subject to the usual problems of long arias accompanied by little action . This makes it hard to make the production visually interesting during these long arias . The scenery and acting seem okay and sort of in style , but the basic plot is of little interest . What this means is that if the opera production is to succeed , the singing must be superb and arresting . Ellen ( June Anderson ) sings adequately though with some annoying repetitive mannerisms . Her lover Malcolm ( Martine Dupuy ) , a cross dressing mezzosoprano role , is really quite good . But what has kept me from watching the whole opera is the horrible male singing . These three singers ( two tenors and a baritone ) epitomize all that can be done to discredit opera . They bellow , wobble out of control and ignore the pitches to be sung ( I think ) so that there is no sense of a vocal line . I simply ca n't watch the whole opera and will surely donate this DVD to someone who just wants to know how the plot unfolds .	-1
What a disappointment ! The very first DVD that I decide to buy is a complete stinker . The video quality is marginal , like a copy of an old videotape . The sound quality is terrible : ranging the gamut from muffled to slightly distorted vocals because of a too-loud transfer . But that 's not the worst of it ... after you suffer through it all and think you 're finally going to enjoy the last video which is & quot ; Sweet Dreams ( Are Made Of This ) & quot ; , they start rolling credits over the video ! Would it have killed them to wait three minutes for the video to end before rolling the credits ! Obviously a rush job designed to make a quick buck , this deserves to be left on the shelf ! ( Fortunately , I was able to return it and bought Gloria Estefan 's & quot ; Do n't Stop ! & quot ; instead . Although the music 's of a different style , it shows exactly how a music DVD *should* be put together : crisp video and audio , and lots of extras . )	-1
This concert dvd is so awful it 's almost comical . I ca n't believe all the positive reviews . A good portion of the concert is simply close up photos of Stevie when she was n't in a stupor . Why do you think the producer of this video did that ... there 's a good reason because she was in very tough shape during this time.I 'm guessing Stevie previewed this dvd & decided it was time to clean up her act .	-1
Just watched this and I had to laugh at how mediocre this performance was . For all the windmills and other gyrations by Pete Townshend the music doesnt rock very hard . Keith Moon looks bored and Daltrys vocals are flat . If this is one of their greatest shows they are very overrated .	-1
Did not like this at all . I have heard some of their stuff and thought I would try a concert . I would not go to see them . Picture quality is poor too !	-1
Dear GunsN'Roses fans , I exchanged this DVD and the 2nd copy had the same problem as the first . The audio has these high and low points . The volume on a few of the videos went from the volume I had my television set on , then it went down to a lower volume on it 's own , then back up . It 's a shame because I would really like to have these videos on DVD , however I will be returning this 2nd copy and demanding a full refund . If you bought a copy of this DVD and the audio is n't messed up , hang onto it because you 're lucky . I did notice after the fact that there are some other reviews from people that had the same problem with their copy . So buy at your own risk. ( ... ) : Exchanged once again because refund was refused . Same problem with 3rd copy . DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM ! ! Save yourself the trouble , time and money .	-1
Of course I buy every Jimi Hendrix record , dvd , etc but when it comes down to Rainbow Bridge I start to get frustrated at a film that could have been good but really was not ... ... ... .The rumor has it the Rainbow Bridge concert was supposly stolen from the directors and now does not have its place in full format . This Rainbow Bridge really does not deserve to put Hendrix on the cover the reason they have him on the cover is to take your money . I bought this being very excited to see Hendrix on the cover ! Wow I thought this Maui concert would be good until the long movie came to the end their was uncomplete hendrix material.As soon as the concert beings Hendrix starts with Hey Baby the vocals sound really bad and it seems like the recordings is really garbled sound quality wise . Then hendrix plays Foxy Lady which is really bad . Then their is all uncomplete material includings a short minute of Red House , and more ! ! ! ! ! I was really disapointed having to got put through 125 minutes of hippies really no story ! ! ! ! The DVD is similar to the VHS I have both ... ... the DVD has better picture quality . But I really think this DVD is a way to take your money like I said before im sorry because I really love all of the hendrix dvd 's but this one really is bad both in and out . Dont let the cover fool you !	-1
Metallica did this specific show to film for a video , so did they choke or what ? Most of the renditions on this video are lackluster and butchered . And what the is the deal with them only play two and a half minutes of `` Master of Puppets '' . The band does do better on the second have of the show , but 50 % , even 60 % effort is unacceptable , especially for a video.Pros : The second half of the show is much better than the first . It is still Metallica live.Cons : They sure did choke or something because some of the songs are brutal and almost painful to watch.Final Thoughts : Save your money and buy `` Live Sh*t Binge and Purge '' or `` Cliff 'Em All '' , both of which feature far better performances unless you need to have all of Metallica 's videos .	-1
RIP Lou . I always loved this concert . But there is two different versions of the dvd this one and one by lightyear . If this is the one the sound is muffled all the way through . I do n't know where they got their source from . And on top of it they cut out some of Lou 's dialogue when he does Dirty Harry for instance . I found on you tube a dvd transfer that 's the lightyear one but it was not uploaded with 720p . But the sound is better and the dialogue is intact . So this whole situation is just messed up . But a awesome concert . As Lou said at the end that was short and delicious . The video in HIFI is the best way to go anyway it was videotaped for this format and is more sharp in picture and sound.FRANKLY THESE VERSIONS ARE ON A LOT OF COPIES I THINK THEY ARE BOOTLEGS .	-1
The voices are OK , but there 's no feeling like in the previous concerts , and i do n't feel completely satistied after each viewing . The medleys are the best , and the production below the Eiffel Tower looks awesome.My problem after seeing this was the edition . The opening is so cold and unatractive , and everything goes so fast , that i lose the attention , altough the arias are interesting ... Good concert , but looks unatractive .	-1
Already purchased DVD , same quality ... This under the title blu ray is misleading . Either converted it fully to HD both video and audio or do n't bother with it at all.SD Blu Ray = Half Job .	-1
I have the SD version of this concert . I bought this DVD because I am an avid Bee Gees fan . However , when I read the cover on the DVD , it read , SD BluRay ... .what is THAT ? What it is is BS ... The label reads that it is enhanced SD ... what is THAT ? In short ... if you have the SD version of this concert , DO NOT BUY THIS..You will find that it is a waste of your money ... Yes , it does add DTS ... ... ..but let me tell you this ... .I push my music through 5,000 dollars worth of Klipsch and Marantz surround equipment , and I ca n't tell a bit of difference in the audio from the 5.1 that is on the SD DVD , and the supposed DTS on this one ... The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 0 stars is that it IS the BEE GEES , and it is a magnificent concert..	-1
Why 5.1 sound on an audiance recording ? The performance is not bad however to fully enjoy Yes you need quality sound and this DVD has none.Do n't waste your money on this DVD .	-1
for nostalgia freaks only , I could barely sit through this , parasitic use of a brand name to sell amateurish 'product ' .	-1
Awful ... .poor recording ... poor concert ... uninspired ... razor deep ... the worst thing to come out of Philadelphia since those choking Eagles ... for Danschamdroza and the like ... shame on the company that produced and sold this ... prog robbers .	-1
Well another one of my first dvd purchases ... I found this concert very poor ... it did nothing for me ... the sound quality was poor , The set on stage was quite good but lacked the final sparkle , Janet 's performance was glitzy ... but sadly something was missing ... my advice is puchase Janet 's later DVDS ...	-1
I must have missed it but this was an area 2 version , the seller agreed to take it back .	-1
My favorite opera . The greatest music . Excellent singing and orchestra and conduction . I already have the superb B & ouml ; hm / Fischer-Dieskau / Janowitz / Mathis / Prey / Troyanos recording if that is all I want . But opera is also a VISUAL medium . This production : the scenography dull , the wardrobe prosaic , and the fourth act a total turn off . It is supposed to take place in a garden , not in what looks like a bunch of falling pier supports . Might as well have filmed it on a garbage dump .	-1
We want a high quality DVD performance with Dave ! ! ! This DVD is crap .	-1
This movie features ( most of ) the soundtrack of the best recording of Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk available . The film which was ( twenty odd years later ) slapped on top of that brilliant sound recording , served little other purpose than as a vehicle for once-locally-famous Czech soft porn actress and media-slag ( Hrubesova ) .It 's so tacky and has such a cheesy video-look that it makes the sound recording seem mediocre , where taken on its own , it 's brilliant . Shostakovich 's opera includes some violence and sex which does appear on stage in live performances . In this film it looks like some sort of pseudo-artsy and highly unbelievable soft porn flick . To give an example , the fat woman who gets raped ( they show it with dim warm lighting ) acts like she is being tickled with a feather , which is not the idea that the score portrays . There are also a lot of very '90 's looking men with really the sort of buffed symetrical appearance you get from working in a gym , and not the rugged look you 'd have among people who perform manual labour all day . Or in the bedroom scene with Katerina and Sergei - their textbook writhings allow embarrasing glimpses at the one part of Sergei which should ( judging by Hrubesova 's movement ) be most 'involved ' , but which we clearly see in an entirely different condition and nowhere near where it would have to be to cause the effect she is displaying . You can also see a little piece of cloth between them sometimes , when clearly nothing of that sort is meant to be there . Fair enough , the cloth is there even if you do n't see it , but the fact that all this is shown makes their 'beast with two backs ' act seem ridiculous and insulting . It 's actually a matter of bad editing ( and bad taste ) . It does n't add up , and even absent-mindedly making little mental notes of these inconsistencies is a somewhat unpleasant experience , again , especially because what the music itself conveys is so clearly real.As another viewer with me said , 'if they 're going to be so literal in showing them at it , they should at least have edited out the bit of cloth between them ' . This paradox of it being too literal and too fake at once applies not just to the sex scenes , but to the whole film in general . It 's rather insulting really in how fake it is . The film as a whole is just so cheap and lacks the tight and oppressive atmosphere of the score.The CD of the complete opera is available from amazon.com and I can not recommend it highly enough . Vishnevskaya is miraculous , and the conducting by her husband Rostropovich ( both personal friends of the composer ) is inspired . Rostropovich and Shostakovich studied composition together , and although not all of Rostropovich 's recordings of Shostakovich are first rate , this is the definitive ( and most alive ) rendition . It probably always will be . Buy the CD , and pass up on the DVD .	-1
I have to tell I really liked this show , but Neil Geraldo 's guitar sounds like it 's on the Moon ... you cant hear it . Since I am big fan of Neil and a player myself , I found this VERY dissapointing . It really takes away from an otherwise great show . Unfortunatley , this one wont see much playing time . I advise you to steer clear .	-1
the show starts with an incredible performance of war pigs . unbelievable ! everybody - ozzy , geezer , ward and iommi - are in great form ! the next song is nib . just when tony iommi breaks into the immortal solo , that 's the time these freaks to insert an interview ! i was speechless , my heart was in my friggin hand and every known expletive spewing from my mouth - the m* % $ # r f # $ % ^rs ... likewise it is with every song that follows.what must have been a truly great show is ruined in this dvd ! this is one of the moments you wish something like the texas chainsaw massacre happened in these stupid music companies !	-1
They cut songs in half to fit in interviews . How annoying and egotistic of the editors who probably thought it was cool editing technique . Lame	-1
After Clapton Unplugged expectations were high and the recording of the Live at Madison Square show was unable to capture the energy of the artists and the audience , making much of the DVD dull and boring . One of the few highlights for me was the appearance of Bob Dylan toward the end of the show . I am not sure who decided to bring Mary Blige on stage - she has neither class nor talent . Her act does not fit and takes away from an already borderline production . Die hard Clapton fans may want to wait for a big sale on this DVD .	-1
I am sure that all the performances except a few songs were lip-synched . I think she actually sang only `` Wishing you were somehow here again '' , `` Music of the Night '' and `` Time to Say Good-bye '' . You will notice it easily if you compare the difference of the sound between those three and others . Obviously , lip-synched songs sounded very weak lacking `` her spirit '' . `` Deliver Me '' is a clear example . It even made me laugh . ( Look at the choir who do n't seem like as skillful as Ms. Brightman in lip-synching ! ) What a disappoinment ! ! ! I do n't understand why she chose that way . Maybe she is too old to actually sing many songs in a row before audience without technical support . Ms. Brightman , I do n't want to see your appearance , stage manner or dancing . I just want to see you sing with your passion communicating spiritually with the audience . If you ca n't sing , simply quit singing , please ...	-1
Sigh ... About a half of the video clips were too offensive for me to finish watching . I did hate to see the scenes of lesbian and gay things as well as meaningless sex-oriented ones . And another half were too boring to keep watching . Some clips are like watching only one still image from the beginning to the end ( for example , `` One More Try '' and `` A Different Corner '' ) . Can you imagine how boring it would be ? I bought this with some expectation because I was a fan of his , but now I `` declare '' I am no longer his fan . If you do n't want to be like me , I recommend you to stick to only CDs . I think this is for crazy fans only.P.S . Avoid this dvd if you do n't want to store another trash in your house .	-1
Blinding-fast edition , absolutely no concert footage , audio interviews with band member only.. man , this is a mess of a DVD taht will give you no pleasure at all , even being a KISS fanatic.Sad ...	-1
How can a product like this have an average review rating of 4.5 stars is beyond my grasp . I like KISS , but this DVD adds absolutely nothing to their filmography . I wodner who had the `` smart '' idea of making a video withoune one single complete live song here ... . Who had the `` bright '' idea of making such a fast edition , where you can not focus at one point for more than half-a-second ! ! ! ! Oh , Lord , this could have been a great tribute , the definitive tribute to their reunion but , as it is , it seems just another cheap KISS merchandise ...	-1
VH1 Divas Live 99\As I read the reviews from customers , I decided not to buy . I have the oroginal , recorded from the original broadcast . There are amazing performances ! I read in the reviews that many of the performances are edited badly . I want to see and hear Whitney do the songs from the album 'My Love is your Love ' . Also , Bobby Brown comes onstage at the end ( ? ) of Whitneys performance , and they burst into a quick `` Who Dat ' from JT Money ! Fun , and well , hilarious , too . There are real gems..one of a kind perfomace on the origianl broadcast . That is what makes a live DVDworth it . Like any of the Amy Winehouse concert films I own . Raw , live , like beng there . Too bad . Got ta pass on this one . Thank you to those of us who review products .	-1
This is one of the most amazingly disappointing cds I have ever bought.I have been a Dan fan almost since the inception . While the sound of this anemic collection of tunes is Steely Dan , all the wit and brilliance that once gave this band its unique appeal is gone . There are no soaring insturmental solos , no polished satiric lyrics . While the additude of ripe debauchery that this band espoused in ts early work appears rakish on one still in youth , the very over indulgent lifestyle celibrated by this band has dulled the razor sharp neural edge that made them so outstanding . The cd is dull and witless , not quite a stinker but almost .	-1
I hate to trot out the `` what happened ? '' cliche but what happened ? Fagen used to be able to write songs . This is a collection of grooves with indescriminate words tacked on and thus is indistinguishable from his last solo album and will probably be indistinguishable from the next Steely Dan album . Ca n't Buy a Thrill and Katy Lied were collections of superlative songs performed by exciting musicians . Two Against Nature is Donald and Walter cooly jamming for 45 minutes , or an hour . Who knows ; I stopped paying attention after about ten minutes .	-1
Steely Dan 's numerous lineups in the seventies contained some of the finest musicians of the day . This has n't changed . The musicianship on this album is nothing short of perfect ... a little too perfect for my taste . The performances here are so flawless , they completely eclipse the heart and honesty that makes good music what it is . Long gone are the warm analog days of & quot ; The Royal Scam & quot ; and & quot ; Aja & quot ; . Instead , Fagan and Becker supply us with this super-refined , stark white vision of an album.Now , you 're probably saying & quot ; Yeah , but are the songs any good ? & quot ; Not really ... Dan used to be great because they mixed jazz and rock so perfectly . I mean I literally marvel over some of the chord changes on those old albums . They always managed to throw in a hook where you least expected it too . that 's what made them great . Now , the songs are too muddled in brainy insincerity that they just kind of glide past you . I loved Fagan 's & quot ; Nightfly & quot ; and & quot ; Kamakiriad & quot ; . This album just does n't touch me like any of their older stuff . I miss the good old days ...	-1
Steely Dan sounds great on CD but is boring to watch on DVD as there is not much stage presence . I will stick to their CD 's which are great and not any DVD 's . They also omited their best songs like : School , Rikki..This one is not a keeper .	-1
I listened to this album fairly frequently ( and quite liked it ) when I was about 17 , then lost it within a year . I bought it again many years later , listened to it once , and have never played it since . It 's awful.It 's frankly difficult to imagine a worse example of navel-gazing erected into such a pompous , self-impressed musical monument . Nearly every song on this album expresses bland ( and unexplained ) angst as though it were an Apocalypse . One can see how it appeals to either adolescents or not very bright people who are self-persuaded that they have 'problems ' of some profundity . ( There 's even a track entitled 'Goodbye Cruel World ' and a song beginning with the line 'I wan na go home ' . ) Leaving aside the triteness of the concept of an emotional 'wall ' built around the supposedly tortured individual , consider how the idea itself is explored : When we grew up and went to schoolThere were certain teachers who wouldHurt the children in any way they could . [ from 'The Happiest Days of our Lives ' ] Is there anyone who *hasn't* had that experience ? It 's one thing to explore a shallow theme , another entirely to do so in bad lyrics . Then the teenager goes home from school and enters an Oedipal world whereMother 's gon na make all your nightmares come true.Mother 's gon na put all her fears into you.Mother 's gon na keep you right here under her wing.She wont let you fly , but she might let you sing . [ from 'Mother ' ] Lyrics that basically punch you in the face with their ideas are not really intended for thinking people . A self-pitying thirteen-year old asked to write some doggrell about their own feelings of adolescent angst might , for example , have scribbled the following lines on the bus to school : I 've got wild staring eyes.And I 've got a strong urge to fly.But I got nowhere to fly to . [ from 'Nobody home ' ] Feeling sorry for yourself , as George C. Scott once remarked , is the most popular indoor sport : it rarely makes for artistic greatness , however . And here the listener is being asked to choke on two whole jars of it.Some of the songs are of such absurd brevity as to leave the listener with a cheated feeling ; others are inexplicably bookended by random fragments of dialogue or puzzling sound effects . It 's a mess , in short . But so myopic and self-impressed were the Floyds that the album underwent the fate of being reworked into a bloviated motion picture and an even more pompous concert in Berlin . All of this could have been avoided had the artists had any of the introspection that this album so plainly pretends to wear on its sleeve .	-1
In the development of rock , this album reached a new nadir , and believe me , it had lots of competion from Led Zepplin , Yes , Free , and all the other stadium fodder . Where did all the excitement go ? The creation and release of rythmic tension which had been rock 's signature ? Instead we find lyrics with a pretension to depth , and which are in fact staggeringly banal . We find music of leaden obviousness . The antidotes ? Dylan , Neil Young , The Band , The Clash , The Sex Pistols . You know , music with a pulse , instead of musical necrophilia .	-1
i say the inside art to the duble LD and it sc ared me . the music didn ; t help . why do bnands like being so scary ?	-1
This is Patrick O'Hearn 's first solo CD . It comes from 1985 . It is only 32 minutes long . The sound quality is excellent.This is one of those new age albums from the mid-eighties that took advantage of the new digital and CD technologies . It has a great dynamic range and beautiful sonic quatity.Like most of the early new age work , this is all about the sonic qualities and making beautiful sounds . It is not about the compositions . Like many new age albums , this is just repeated sounds ; very beautiful sounds ; but no cohesive composition . I find it to be repetitive and boring.There are some interesting parts to the CD , and track 6 is very good throughout . This whole CD might be OK as background music.Patrick O'Hearn got his start with playing bass for Frank Zappa . He was then in Group 87 with Mark Isham ( who plays trumpet on this CD ) . After that , he struck it big with Missing Persons , featuring 3 other musicians who used to play for Zappa .	-1
I bought & quot ; Lily on the Beach & quot ; when it was first released WAAAAYY back in '89 , and I could feel ( and hear ) old age creeping in . Not on me , but the & quot ; band & quot ; . & quot ; Lily & quot ; sounded like a couple savvy computer geeks slapped together some formulations ( or whatever the hell it 's called when you & quot ; write & quot ; music on computer ) and sneezed out some sounds to sell.I looked at the credits . Only one piece was over five minutes . The cover was some unimaginative scanner imageing . I listened . Only three tracks stood out for me ; the title track , & quot ; Mount Shasta & quot ; and & quot ; Long Island Sunset & quot ; . This cringeing pessimism crept up on me after buying & quot ; Optical Race & quot ; the previous year . However , & quot ; Race & quot ; WALLOWED in depth and vision compared to this . My sadness deepened . I knew there would be no more credits for actual synthesizers and drums . ( Things one must actually touch in unison and have character ) I knew from that moment on I would have to look elsewhere for memerable , visionary music , and I did .	-1
An unlistenable production . Leo 's voice is a limited tool ; used well , as on `` Louise '' , `` Sonora 's Death Row '' , and `` Rings '' , ( among many others ) he delivers world class performances . Used like this , he gives me the willies . Listen to as much of Track 9 as the sample gives you . That is church Christmas pageant quality . Ow.Much of this sounds cribbed from other of his performances . If I had any interest I might find the sources , but really , I suffered through it twice because I only review music after a minimum of two full listens . There will never be a third.And what 's up with that organ ? Whoa , like far out man , that was groovy ! At least it 's short ... ...	-1
First mistake : This is a VOCAL album by one of the world 's greatest instrumentalists.Second error : Leo 's `` singing '' is n't actually all that bad , but he recites on some tracks , tells stories on others , and those are even less interesting than the serious attempts to sing.Third wrong turn : Seven of the ten tracks simply are not compelling . His guitar never goes wrong , but the vocalizing or speaking detracts from that.In his favor : The opening track , `` Running Up the Stairs '' is not bad , and if it were the lone vocal on an otherwise instrumental CD , could have been a wonderful accent piece , in the way that `` Pamela Brown '' was on an early release on Capitol decades ago.Also in his favor : The best minutes on the CD come when he does Johnny Cash 's `` I Still Miss Someone . '' In fact , if he had chosen a dozen Cash songs as a tribute disc , Leo might have had a real winner back in '91 . His limited voice seems to go well with Johnny 's lyric style.My verdict : Even if you love Leo 's playing , as I have since the '70 's , and do n't mind his occasional singing , as I do n't , this item can be skipped . There are so many Kottke recordings that are really worth owning , especially the ones made before this one . Save your funds for those .	-1
`` Famous Blue Raincoat '' instantly became one of my favorite albums of all time ( I bought it at the same time as `` A Capella '' by Rundgren from which `` Pretending to Care '' from `` Hunter '' came ) and have hoped to recapture that magic in another album by Warnes . From reading the reviews here , I thought `` Hunter '' would be that album . Not . I ca n't imagine any album short of Air Supply that sounds more dated . Warnes sounds fine , but the material and production sounds dated even for the 1990s , especially in the first half with sappy keyboard work and drum tracks abounding . Even the fab Rundgren tune , so passionate and pained on `` A Capella '' becomes an empty shell of a tune on this go round.Please someone , save me . Point me to the Warnes album that will catch me up again ...	-1
In high school `` Stroke You Up '' was the jam , so I went downtown and bought the cassette . Let me tell you something : It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring . Even `` Stroke You Up '' became unbearable to listen to . No funk , no groove- just lukewarm soul . That was the first *and* the last time I listened to `` Changing Faces . '' The two chicks who made up `` Changing Faces '' had airy , monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all . Even the album cover looked boring . These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all . Skip this at all costs and get Zhane .	-1
everything in 94 ' sounded like this , decent bass beats , usual bragging lyrics , yay , hiphop ...	-1
Ever since i first heard of Renaissance I knew i 'd more than likely love the band ; proggy stuff fronted by a female singer with lots of medieval overtones ? Check . And sure enough , when I finally heard Renaissance by way of 'Turn Of The Cards ' I knew I had to buy the album eventually . Just a stellar piece of progressive rock.Where the problem arises is that in my haste to purchase the album , I made the mistake of assuming the logical fallacy of chronological snobbery . Namely , I ignored the previous editions being offered as I assumed that such copies ( made around '94 ) would n't be exactly remastered . So , under this assumption , I bought this edition which was published in 2006 , which I felt would probably be adequate in sound quality ( I avoided the mini-LP version that was also listed because I tend to never touch any of my cds that are housed in those ) . At anyrate when I finally got the cd in from Amazon I was absolutely appalled to see what my $ 12 had gone towards.The front looked fine enough , but the back gave me my first indication that there was something wrong afoot with this edition ; along the bottom was in big red letters : oldies dot com . Annoying I thought , but whatever . However , when I finally opened the cd itself there , ATTACHED to what should have been a cd booklet ( which actually was only 1 double sided page with the artwork on the front & band on the back ) was a mail-in service form for oldies dot com . This might have been fine had it been an advert that you could throw away , but it was melded together with the cd artwork itself and I actually had to cut it out to be rid of it . It was also around this time that I noticed that in the bottom left corner of backside insert ( behind the cd ) was a HOLE in the insert itself.A HOLE.I 've worked in the used cd industry myself as it turns out and cds with a hole-punch in the back insert generally mean a promotional copy/other such thing and that you should n't buy it back for anything close to full value . Now I recognized that same HOLE in my NEWLY PURCHASED CD . Needless to say I am at a total loss and absolutely DO NOT RECOMMEND this edition in any way/shape/form . Had I not already opened the box/cd & had thrown away everything else , I would be shipping this back to Amazon.Coincidentally , the mail-order insert I cut out said towards the top , `` Collectibles Records is the largest and fastest growing independent reissue label in the US '' For the sake of music lovers everywhere I hope not and would encourage any true lover of music to avoid ANYTHING put out by Collectible Records/oldies dot com like the Plague .	-1
An obvious attempt at cashing in on the name of a once proud , creative , interesting classic American psych band . Doug Ingle , always the lead singer/principal songwriter is absent entirely leaving those duties in the incapable hands ( mostly ) of guitarist Erik Braun . What do we get , horrible vocals , occassinal out of tune guitar and the most laughably bad songs ever written ( Check out & quot ; Searchin'Circles & quot ; ) . Sounds nothing like Iron Butterfly ; more like a talentless hippie kid Deadhead wannabee concoction.Possibly one of the worst records ever made .	-1
total waste of money only purchased because a friend said it was a good album but it is crap all their other albums are great and worth purchasing I think there were a couple of songs that were good . OK white room is a great song but the price of this album does n't justify purchasing this and i grew up in this era .	-1
This album is wat too bluesy . I do n't understand Eric Clapton 's diabloical obsession with the blues . The blues is silly and outdated . So is this album . There are a couple of standout tracks , but most of it is just psychedelic blues . GIBBERISH ! That 's what most of this is ! GIBBERISH ! Who cares whether the blues dummy feels free or not ? I for one , do not .	-1
... Look , I grew up in the Midwest in the 1970s and '80s and I heard a lot of this junk growing up , both from musical mentors and on `` classic rock '' radio and I am SO HEARTILY SICK OF JIM MORRISON AND THE DOORS . The guy was such a total weenie . Since when is getting so drunk that you fall of the stage a great moral virtue ? And what a preening , self-centered gasbag ! Of all the great hippie-era 'Sixties bands , the Doors are perhaps the least deserving of their legendary status ... They had a couple of volcanic , primal early hits but the Doors catalog as a whole is so boring and bloated . Skip ahead to 1976 and crank up the Ramones : now *that's* real rock rebellion ! ( Axton )	-1
This is NOT the original recording . It has been remixed . Bad idea . I do n't understand why the Doors albums were remastered in 1999 , but only released in the US in that box set . The '99 remasters sounded great . But now they 're remixed ? ? I think even the average listener would be able to tell that something just does n't sound right here . It is n't the same classic recordings you 're used to hearing.Now , why am I against the remixes ? Well , for one , it opens the door to reinterpretation . I mean , why not get a whole host of remixers for the project ? You could have today 's top DJs remixing classic albums from every era . You could buy the Timbaland version of Light My Fire for when you want that combination of Jim Morrison and super sexy deep club beats . Why not just put the raw tracks on DVD audio and let the listener `` remix '' for themselves ? Maybe you could get some guest musicians to add tracks to the original recordings . I mean , maybe what LA Woman really needs is a Slash guitar solo . Or how about getting Napalm Death to add some crunchy heaviness to Roadhouse Blues ? Do you get the point ? If you start rearranging the past , where do you stop ? And now these remixed CDs are taking the place of the original catalog , so new listeners will be hearing something totally different than what we originally heard and fell in love with . Classics are classics for a reason . Remastering for higher fidelity is one thing , but remixing , rearranging , and reinterpreting are quite another .	-1
How anyone could fail to see how funny this band were beats me . The fact that their funniness was unintentional , and that they took themselves seriously makes it so much more relishable . Truly moronic lyrics and highly erratic muscianship , and on top of that Morrisons wobbly tenor . The highlight is the howlingly funny The End , it needs a Mike Myers to really do it justice . One of the most hilariously overblown , psuedo , pieces of nonsense to come out of a 60 's recording studio , and oh boy did it have some competition . A collectors item for those who have a taste for kitsch .	-1
... this album demonstrates what happens when a public school education meets hallicinogens . `` The End '' is a mindless rant that would n't make the cut on `` The Wiggles '' , and `` The Crystal Ship '' is Cha-chi on pot ! ! ! The 60 's were a whacked-out era , and this piece of solid gold crap is a time-machine to the scene of the crime . If I really wanted a good laugh , I would have bought `` Minnie Pearl does Devo '' , but at least then I would have known what I was getting . This album offers no such luxury ! ! !	-1
One of the common credentials the Doors often have heaped upon them is that they were the serious , dark , poetic version of their light , fluffy fellow 60 's Californian hippie pop acts like the Mamas and the Papas . This is to their credit , but it is an endorsement that still fails to account for , much less exonerate the boys for the fact that they were just another sad facet of the hippie fad.If we examine some of the Doors most prominent and unfortunately least appealing features , we will find a very bland , monotonous , predictable , and last but not least , pretentious band . The excessive feature of the organ often sounds like an underpaid Church accompanist finally reaching breakdown and leading a mutiny of one against the house of God . Krieger 's penchant for small , twangy lead guitar riffs in virtually every Door 's song is perhaps a little less annoying but still makes a mockery out of hyperbolic claims Doors enthusiasts often make about their place in history . But all of this pales in comparision to the pseudo-intellectual bleatings of a rock and roll idol whose rocky road to success ended in a French bathtub . `` Light My Fire '' could have potentially been a classic of the 60 's era , of which there are many . In spite of its daft lyrics , the really baffoonish way of rhyming things like `` liar '' and `` higher '' , it had the makings of a decent little ditty . The emphasis there is on `` little '' . Instead , it was expanded , bloated beyond all proportion to its actual merit with Ray Manzarek 's obnoxious , sedating organ . This is an excellent example of the quality of the recalcitrant Church accompanist quality I mentioned earlier that Manzarek 's playing exhibits . After what feels like at least a couple of days , but in reality is more like 2 minutes of this tired self indulgence , one gets the feeling that there 's only one other organ Manzarek abuses this gratuitously . Unfortunately , the boys are n't finished . They have more excess , more indulgent trash to heap upon this rapidly gathering pile of refuse in the form of Krieger 's customary and by now obligatory tiny twangs . God , this guy is awful . Like Manazerk 's mischievous meddling of the organ keys , Krieger 's turn in the spotlight is all too long and very , very unwelcomed . Finally after approximately 5 minutes of musical noodling , Morrison returns to recite lines that were poor the first time around , again.Jim and the boys continue to drag their collective knuckles in the mire on the wimpy , moronic `` Crystal Ship '' . With lyrics that appear to have been scrawled by an acne riddled junior high school student in haste to complete a poetry assignment and music that would not sound out of place on an elevator , this is the kind of song that most people would be personally embarrassed to have written , much less record and release . `` Break On Through '' has familiar organ tinkering from Manzarek . Not just familiar in the sense that it 's the kind of rubbish his grubby fingers are always immersed in , but also due to the nagging suspicion one has that this has been done somewhere before in the 1950 's and immortalized in a 1980 's Pee Wee Herman movie of all places . `` Tequila ! `` , if that helps . Aside from its sad derivative sound , it contains some characteristically pretentious attempts at `` poetry '' by Jimbo before he himself proceeds to inflict the most damage on his credibility by shrieking the idiotic line `` everybody loves my baby ! '' over and over , seemingly ad infinitum.Perhaps the real tip of the hat should go to `` The End '' . More pseudo poetry from Morrison . It 's clearly an effort to shock and unsettle listeners . It 's not only embarrassing drivel masquerading as poetry , but it 's not even original in the aspects that are supposed to be the most shocking . The killer , awaking before dawn proceeds to kill his father and make love to his mother . Although maybe the average Doors fan is unaware of this ( can they even read ? ) but this is a concept that is of course directly lifted from Sophocles . It should be noted that Morrison 's ambition was to be taken seriously as a poet and not just a rock and roll star , but his `` poetry '' was routinely derided and dismissed by critics . Anyone asking why need only listen to the 11 plus minutes of the tedious , pseudo-shockfest of `` The End '' .The only good thing about the above track is that it does mark the end of a very pitiful listening experience . Jim Morrison to his credit , went through all of the rapid stages that accompany many of the most exaggerated rock stars in the space of just a few years . He hit his commercial and `` artistic '' ( sic ) peak and was regarded as a sex symbol . Within a few years however , he had become dumpy , bedraggled , and clearly out of ideas . He then died embarrassingly , a sad drug related death of a burned out case . It took Elvis two decades , Morrison did it in about four years . Live fast indeed.On a footnote , I visited Paris recently and had the chance to see the cemetery in Montmartre where Sartre and Beckett are buried . I did wonder about the whereabouts of Morrison , but he is buried in the Eastern part of the city and we were staying in the North . Suffice to say , neither of us could be bothered to make the trek .	-1
cOMEON- AN ALBUMthis GREAT-no one is going to read all the accurate 5 star reviews- would you ? me either . list the 8 great Debute albums and this will be listed on most . I wonder what universe this would not be considered great- not a universe I would want to be in . If you REALLY need to be convinced read all the 5 star reviews .	-1
Masterpiece ? How ? Ok , ok ... .They did save the best for last , `` Riders on the Storm '' - without a doubt , a time-capsule classic , thru and thru , with a relevatory electric piano keeping it a-flow . Even the embarrassingly peurile phrase `` dog with a bone '' works in the arrangement . Listening at home in 1972 , over the intercome system me and my Dad installed in our Weehawken , N.J. , home , I was floored . Do n't know why I did not buy the single . Maybe being broke as a cinderblock is a clue ... .. My Mom brought me a vanilla cupcake and a cup of coffee and my 21 year old psyche explored the local solar system , tour guide , old , drunk Jim.Unfortunately , with the exception of the hot cover of John Lee Hooker `` Crawling King Snake '' , most of `` Hyacinth House '' , and tentative tributes to Jimmy Reed and Bo Diddley and Tony Joe White , we were presented with a real dud , lyrically ridiculous and musically monotonous.I have been taking singing lessons ( not that anyone asked ) and was surprised to discover that Jim Morrison sings `` correctly '' . Whatever went wrong , on L.A. WOMAN his *expression* remains the same throughout.Excuse me ... on the finale track , he reaches out and grabs the torch just before it hits the ground and is extinquished . [ review based upon early reissue on CD ] .	-1
I was disapointed in the mix of the entire DVD Audio disk . Who ever did it should of call the engineers who worked on ELP 'S Brain Sallad Surgery . The mix is flat and Jims vocals need more than just the center channel speaker . I also feel the sub channel was left out in the remix of this great recording . If you want to hear great L.A. Woman recording BUY A TURN TABLE AND THE LP VERSION OF L.A. WOMAN .	-1
It 's now very well known that the labelling on this disc is deceptive - it was NOT taken from the original analog master tape , but from a second generation copy and DAT . Sonically , it is not bad , but not anywhere close to the earlier gold CD from the now defunct DCC . Not enough of an upgrade over the last Capitol remaster to be worthwhile .	-1
Or did the 60s generation suffer from horrible taste in music ? I do n't know . All I know is that I 've had this album since the 3rd grade when I was into fairly simple music like the Beatles , and even then I found Pet Sounds unappealing . It simply has nothing to it.Every time I hear someone praise this album , it seems as if they focus on its & quot ; great production. & quot ; This is something that I 've never understood . Great production ? Britney Spears albums have great production . The Backstreet Boys have great production . Does that make their work any more bearable ? I do n't think so.When I look for music I want it to have at least one of two things:1 ) Soul ... I want the musicians to put true emotion into their work . Jazz for example.2 ) Smarts ... I want to hear songs/albums made by thoughtful and talented people who do something musically/lyrically that just blows me away . Pink Floyd/Radiohead/Autechre for example.Pet Sounds has neither . It 's full of bland harmonizing by guys that could barely swim . The tracks do nothing daring and most of the songs were written with outside help . That 's never a good sign . Another bad sign is the army of session musicians that the group hired . I 've yet to see a quality album put out by musical mercenaries.If you 're going to waste your money , at least waste it on real music . And if your set on buying Pet Sounds , I 'll dig out my old copy and give you a bargain . It 's one of my oldest CDs , but it looks like it 's brand new . I doubt that you 'll play it any more than I did . At least I hope you do n't .	-1
It is mind boggling all the hype surrounding this badly overrated CD . I like many of the Beach Boys big hits but this CD just does n't cut it . On the version I borrowed , out of sixteen songs only the four lead tracks-Would n't It Be Nice , Caroline No , God Only Knows , and Sloop John B are of high quality . I Know There 's An Answer , Here Today , and You Still Believe In Me are slightly captivating among the remaining songs . The problem here at least to my ears is that the songs all have a similar arrangement . Not slow and romantic like Surfer Girl or Warmth of The Sun or fast and jumpy like Fun Fun Fun and Surfin ' USA . Its all mid-paced and kind of spacey with a strong lack of ooomph and too many special effects.It boggles the mind how one television broadcast ranked this CD as the third greatest rock n roll album of all time . Geeze Louise , this album barely even rocks ! There is a strong lack of guitar presence throughout this collection and way too many special ef ! fects . It trudges along like a sluggish snail and you can hardly wait for it to end . The harmonies all sound the same after a while and Brian hogs most of the lead vocals . The lyrics may have some special meanings but that 's based on the fact that you have not fallen asleep listening to the music . How anyone can compare this to even the weakest of Beatles records is ludicrous.In my opinion , stick with a good compilation of the Beach Boys . California Girls , Help Me Rhonda , I Get Around , and other early hits will always remain classics and keep any party hopping . I have three of them and they all work fine . However , when Brian Wilson attempted to get too deep and stray away from grooving surfer rhythms , the result is a stony bore . Borrow it from a friend but save your money as this music just does not cut the mustard .	-1
Never heard of emSomeone said they were good so I brought this.Thought ok but , where are the tunes.U2 's latest album is better and more inspirational.It should be listened to by millions , this is n't music just noise.I ca n't understand why it 's rated ? All the songs sound the sameThe singer , forgot his name , got no emotion , I think that guy from Good Charlotte is good , and is one of the all time greats.Also Celine Dion , is the mistress of love songs , buy her greatest hits for true greatness.U2 How to Dismantle an Atom Bomb a must buy album.So is Rumours by Fleetwood Mac.I think this is only for the mentally ill , or sort of things to play to interrigate people.I think the Spice Girls are inspriational truely the greatest pop group ever `` Zig-A-Zig-A '' what genius.Also what about Steps and S Club 7 , genius's.Also bananarama , brilliant ! ! ! ! This is popREAL POPThis album is noiseGive me Celine Dion any day ! ! ! P.S.The E stands for Expert ! ! !	-1
It 's a crying shame when one of the great classics of 70 's rock is treated so shabbily like this . This mlps version should really have been an improvement over the previous releases ; instead , we get poor quality cardboard shoddily put together albeit with an insert containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese . There are 6 bonus tracks of alternative versions of the main tracks but what 's the point when the sound quality is so very desperately poor ? If you are going to pay so much more for an album to get you to `` upgrade '' from your present copy , I 'd demand a much better product that what we have here . I guess I could forgive the sub-standand mini-lp replica sleeve design but I definitely can not forgive the very poor sound quality for the kind of price these guys are asking for . My advice is to wait for a much better remastered version to come out and to give this one a wide berth.Content-wise , these tracks represent some of the best work ever done from the early 70s . When you have both Paul McCartney and George Harrison taking an interest in your work let alone Todd Rundgren producing as well , it 's safe to say that you 're on to something big and that 's exactly what this album represents . From the brilliant slide guitar work of Harrison on my favourite album track `` Day After Day '' to the soulful and beautiful opening track `` Take It All '' you get track after track of simply good songwriting . No fillers on this baby at all and it still sounds as enjoyable today as it did all those years ago.Let 's hope the powers that be get their act together and head back to the drawing board to bring us an mlps version that is worthy of the album . I wait with bated breath ... .	-1
did they have to mess up a great thing . As the previous reviewers stated , this is NOT a CD version of the original . It 's getting nearly impossible to find `` original '' vinyl recordings on CD anymore . `` They '' have to add bonus tracks , re-mix , etc , etc . Too bad that those that never had the opportunity to hear the originals will never experience how great they were ( unless they can find a copy on vinyl ) .	-1
This is the WORST sounding CD i have ever heard , HANDS DOWN ! ! What 's with these other reviews that the audiophile freaks say is sounding good on this cd ? Even Ian himself has admitted there is no good master of Aqualung available anywhere . The original master was destroyed and an inferior master was used . This album was recorded in an old church turned into a studio where the sound and acoustics were terrible . Led Zeppelin had the same studio except a smaller room which made the sound better and more intimate . I have to turn my cd player up all the way on volume just to hear it . Ian himself says this is not one of their better releases in their day . Stand Up and Benefit blow this away . Not to say there is n't great songs on this release if only you could hear them . What a shame NONE of the Jethro Tull catalog has been remastered properly . I guess i 'll try the Tull blu-spec cd and see how that sounds .	-1
Aqualung is a true classic album . I disappointed The sound quality , is the same of 1997 version , say print on CD : `` Digital Remasters 1997 Toshiba-EMI Japan . The CD was released in 2003 with the same sound of 1997 version . The package is beautiful , in gatefold mini Lp , with lyrics and a Aqualung cart . Maybe in future , the Remasters quality for this album be better than this , a classic album can may a better treatment.Unless you want a collectors item ... .do n't waste your time if your looking for a better sounding cd .	-1
Oh lookie ! ! ! ! It 's yet another release from marketing genius Ian Anderson ! MY GOD . How many different versions of your albums do we need sir ? Jethro Tull used to be my favorite band , but after surviving the past decade with no new music from the band , and an ever increasing array of remixed , remastered , redone versions of the same old crap , I 've had enough.What 's next ? The Norwegian version of `` Passion Play '' ? I can hardly wait !	-1
Compared to the other Ultra Lounge CDs in the series , `` Music for a Bachelor 's Den '' is likely more what people were listening to @ the time , rather than the uniquely unusual pieces found on the other ones . The album starts , though , with a few `` cool '' versions of `` Once In a While '' ( a bongo variation by Terry Snyder ) & Arthur Lyman 's take on `` Love for Sale '' ( xylophone-lounge ) . One mistake here , though , is Jackie Gleason 's `` Melancholy Serenade '' mistakenly titled 'Theme from the Honeymooners ' . As another reviewer pointed out , this may be possibly more melodic but is no 'Honeymooners ' . It is actually Gleason 's theme for his live self-titled variety show of the early 50s , where the 'The Honeymooners ' was popularized . But it 's David Rose 's `` Sunset Strip '' and Jimmy Dorsey 's `` So Rare '' that really tear it up on this album , both very hot , hot , hot ! The 50s standards adapted from film and TV , `` Moonglow and Love Theme from 'Picnic ' '' , `` Around the World in 80 Days '' , & `` Theme from 'Route 66 ' '' not only push you right into that period , giving one a taste of what was actually popular at the time , but are probably some of the most entertaining and listenable pieces from these mediums . I , myself , have always had a big thing for all three . `` Like Young '' , a bit of a `` beat '' tune , is possibly best sung , as it is here by Linda Lawson . `` Moritat ( A Theme from The Threepenny Opera ) '' is one of my favorites , though ( popularly known as `` Mack the Knife '' ) , here an instrumental piece . This really illustrates the resurgence of the old music hall rag-piano sound of the late 50s-60s , perfectly complimenting this version .	-1
The best Sammy CD ? Are you kidding ? I just spent $ 30 to hear a truncated ( albeit totally swinging ) & quot ; Come back to me & quot ; . And & quot ; The Witch is dead ? & quot ; You 'd need to be a complete ding-dong if you ca n't find a better way to honour this man 's legend . A waste o ' time and money.Invest , instead , in & quot ; Live at the Cocoanut Grove & quot ; and truly experience just what Sam is all about . This cat swings with the best of them and , when he 's loose , he 's better than you can possibly imagine .	-1
It 's been a long time since I purchased this Soundtrack ( ? ) Album and since then I 've p # # sed-off about the lack of what 's so good about the movie not being on this album . Where 's all the tricky piano interludes including the jazz club gigs and Jeff 's ( of course it 's not really his ) solo stuff and the brothers singing Sweet Sixteen . But the worst of all is the total lack of Michelle 's singing . From her audition and that incredible More Than You Know to her debut and Ten Cents a Dance to the montage of Ca n't Take My Eyes Off of You to the big time and The Look of Love . Where are they ? For that matter where 's Michelle 's album . Singers always want to be actors and actors be singers . This has got to be the first case of an actor who did n't want to be a singer and the real irony is this one 's got a voice , one of soul and character.So anyway , soundtrack albums usually are from the movie and rather than shorten the numbers they extended full versions and seldom leave you longing for what 's not there . This is a very big exception . There appears to be material that 's not from the original soundtrack . If I 'm mistaken , shoot me , but I do n't remember some of this stuff and it certainly was n't what I was buying this CD to hear . It 's sorta like the photo on the album , nice picture but it 's not in the movie.The two star rating is n't for the quality of the material on the album , it 's for not filling the standard requirements of a soundtrack album . It leaves much to be desired .	-1
There are only two vocals by michelle pfeiffer ! Where are the others ? If it is advertised as the original motion picture sound track , then include the complete recording.Otherwise state that it is not complete . I found that out after receiving the CD and reading the inside cover.Of course , the music on it is great , but had i known about this , i would , definitely , not have ordered it .	-1
When this came out , it was a revelation to me . Listening to it now , after several years , well -- -it makes me feel ill . It 's almost the same effect as ingesting way too much saccarine . Pass .	-1
After the fiery and complex `` Inside Out '' , this was a huge disappointment . This band was NOT Lacking for musicianship but it left something to be desired as far as consistency sometimes . After 2 high quality releases like `` Eye of The Beholder '' and `` Inside Out '' , Chick again went the commercial borderline smooth-jazz route ( a lot like `` Light Years '' ) , allowing some bits of teeth to show but not much . The songs are rather forgettable , cookie-cutter fuzak , and `` 99 Flavors '' gets downright cheesy ( after all , it was originally a demo for a then new Yamaha keyboard that Chick wrote ) . The last cut shows bits of the fiery EB but that 's it , just bits over a rather formulaic composition.Skip this one , too much technology and calculation , not enough soul .	-1
You know how most people will say either they do n't dream ( which , by the way , is NOT true ) or else they ca n't remember them ; well , this album is one dream you DO N'T want to remember ! I totally discount ALL reviewers that have not intensely listened to the entire catolouge of the group they 're reviewing ( but , of course , there are exceptions ) . I own the entire Spyro Gyra ( SG ) catolouge ; accordingly , my individual ratings are based on the recording at hand , considering the group 's entire catologue , not just one or two other albums . How on earth can anyone say something is `` the greatest '' when they have an incomplete basis for making such a ridiculous claim ! Music is subjective . All opinions I assert are my honest evaluations based on my likes and dislikes , as well as the group 's total output.This being the case , this is not a very good album.First : if you 'd told me the group was gathering people like the Tower Of Power Horns , Will Lee , and Lani Groves -- I 'd have thought we 'd be in for one terrific recording . Well , these folks are on this cd , and , to say the least , the way they are used here is TOTALLY disappointing ! And while I generally love Alex Ligertwood 's vocals ( especially his work with Santana ! ) , they just do n't work here . In fact , both vocal inclusions seem silly and totally out of place.Second : the recording seems to have no idea of what it wants to say or where it wants to go . Most songs are not written by Jay , and perhaps this has something to do with it.Third : aimless , general tunes , out of place vocals , lame and silly Jamaican/Caribbean/Reggae-like numbers are completely out of charcater for SG , and they are a rather embarrassing inclusion here , IMHO.On the brighter side -- Birks Law ( written by Jay ) is a decent tune.In conclusion , this is one of the weaker efforts by what I consider a great group . I have been an ardent fan and follower of the group since their inception . I have seen them live many times . I admire Jay and his work . I generally like most SG songs . But ( and it hurts me to say this ) this is just not a very good album . There are much better SG albums available , and I would advise staying away from this recording until , at least , you 've sampled many other SG albums.Thanks for reading my reivew ! Rock on !	-1
By the time this CD came out I had already been a fan of the Rippingtons for eight years . Obviously , those who reviewed this before me were n't very familiar with their earlier works . I was terribly disappointed with most of this ! ! ! This CD does have it 's moments ... .Girl With The Indigo Eyes , Native Sons Of A Distant Land , and True Companion . Overall , I felt that it was their first flop ! ! ! I just know that they can do better than this because all of their previous disks were better .	-1
I bought this compact disc for the David Buskin song it is not the original at all . The only way to get the original is vinyl only . I wish they would release it on compact disc .	-1
Michael W. Smith is , undeniably , the most successful Christian musician ever . But his third album unfortunately lacked the timeless elements of his first two ( and fourth ) albums . At the time of its release , THE BIG PICTURE was very big . We loved it and could n't get enough of it ( that is , until we finally had enough ) . It was one of those contemporary Christian albums that had a lot of hype and had not trouble living up to the hype . But it lacked the potential to maintain the audience 's interest as the artist matured and especially as the audience matured ( the target audience was clearly young teenagers -- more on this later ) .The majority of these songs though quite good in their own way were mostly what one may call fad songs . There 's nothing here that is similar to the musical style in PROJECT , 2 , or even I2 ( EYE ) . This was clearly Michael W. Smith 's attempt had a little bit of edgey , fast-paced rock 'n ' roll . And it worked at the time . ( David Meece did something very similar with his album 7 . ) THE BIG PICTURE boasted a more daring Smitty as well : one who was not afraid to tackle the what , at the time , were pretty tough and taboo issues . `` Old Enough to Know '' dealt with a young lady 's struggle in the areas of peer pressure regarding sexuality ; `` The Last Letter '' addressed the theme of suicide , which became quite an ordeal among teens in the 80s ; and `` Goin ' Through the Motions '' addressed general peer pressure among young people in general . The messages contained in these songs were positive , uplifting , and fortunately , very effective . But as this music was written for me and my generation when we were around the ages of 12-17 years old , we have now outgrown it . We may , to a much lesser extent , deal with some of these issues ; but as we are now in our late 20s and 30s , we deal with altogether different issues . And though there 's now a new generation of 12-17-year-olds dealing with the aforementioned problems , they 're going to seek out help in more contemporary music . ( I hope the music will have the same good advice as this one had . ) But very few , if any , will look for that kind of guidance from a 20 year old Christian rock album.The first four songs on here are memorable , nostalgic , and overall enjoyable . `` Rocketown '' is the only one which I would say has `` timeless '' appeal . The `` Bonus Track 1 '' is a very short piano-only piece which is somewhat reminiscent of one of Elton John 's more classic melodies . I wish that piece had been longer like the two instrumental pieces on his album , 2.Both Michael W. Smith 's previous album as well as his next album were far superiour to this one .	-1
The only song I like on this album is Secret Ambition . The other songs are very slow . For sure his worst album yet .	-1
Is not as I expected not anointed one from The Lord Jesus Christ.But in my point of view he need to do more to put his music on high level .	-1
Tear Down These Walls was Billy Ocean 's final run at chart success . The album features one of the most reviled songs from the 80 's , `` Get Outta My Dreams , Get Into My Car '' . It generally makes the list for worst songs from the 80 's , but it is a little harsh as the song has a fun , innocent charm that seems to be missing from most songs these days . It made its way to number one and it was the last time Mr . Ocean had a top ten single . He became a casualty of the grunge movement in the early 90 's as most 80 's stars who were perceived to be soft met up with a similar chart demise .	-1
this disc is okay but it does n't show the talent & amp ; depth of this man.from 76-82 he was grooving.then he came stateside and was watered down.this set hardly does the man justice.he is a very talented artist who deserves better .	-1
With this album Sam 's career tumbled , which is understandable , because basically all songs are weak . You can get into the Full Force song `` Hurt me '' , but already the lyrics are n't convincing . `` Another night '' or `` Spirit of America '' are rather boring songs stressing on hits like Madonna 's `` Justify my love '' and American enthusiasm . Not convincing	-1
Should have been called disappointment , BDP is no PE . KRS1 's ` knowledge ' is really no more than Nation Of Islam rhetoric , not so cleverly put to music . KRS1 was always more ` preacher ' than ` teacher ' , inviting obedience rather than introspection . Here , in ` Ya Strugglin ' he adds homophobia to his cannon of hates .	-1
I got nothin but love for kid rock ( as a matter of fact , i think he 's so fine ! ) and so much respect for his music , i think all his CDs rock ... except this one . There 's just way too much rap and barely any southern rock , rock and all of his other genres he mixes in his CDs . Im not a big fan of white rap b/c the white rock and the black rap but i do like his rap in all his other CDs . If you 're thinking about buying this album- I HIGHLY recommend you buy `` DEVIL WITHOUT A CAUSE '' , `` KID ROCK '' , or `` COCKY '' . Those are my favorite Kid Rock albums .	-1
This CD was in poor shape alot of skipping alot of scratches on it . I know the music is good on this cd i have it on cassette tape .	-1
He ca n't sing or act . I do n't have time to go into depth on this one ; just skip it .	-1
Please understand that the meagerly two stars does not reflect the quality of the music itself . The songs are good -- the material on this album ranks among Trout 's finest , I think -- but the sound quality is TERRIBLE ! ! ! I was in disbelief when I looked on the credits and saw that three or four people were actually involved in the production and engineering of this album . I literally thought at first that Trout and his band had recorded this themselves home-made . It makes my stereo sound like a transistor radio -- some songs do n't even sound like they were recorded in stereo ! No bass -- and too much blasted high end ! ( his guitar tone has too much of that tinny high end on some of his other albums , too . ) Given that this album was recorded only about ten years ago , it 's inexcusable to release a CD of this quality , sound-wise.I 'm glad Walter came back with more releases later that apparently utilized technology invented in the last forty years !	-1
Shaquille O'Neal raps about as well as he shoots free throws . Most of the songs here are pretty boring . A lot of guest rappers were brought in , but they do n't help much . The only song that is above average is & quot ; Biological Did n't Bother & quot ; , which is a love song to Shaq 's stepfather . It 's actually pretty touching , believe it or not . I did n't like this CD that much , but Shaq 's fans are free to disagree with me .	-1
When I heard the song & quot ; Flood & quot ; on Christian radio , I instantly fell in love with it . A year later when I heard it on mainstream radio , I knew I had to buy this album . Ugh..I 'm sorry I did . & quot ; Flood & quot ; is the *only* reason to buy this album ; the rest of the songs do n't even measure up to it 's greatness ( in fact , they are quite boring . ) So , if you really love the song & quot ; Flood & quot ; , get this CD . Otherwise , skip it .	-1
An extremely unremarkalbe album with literally NO memorable or catchy songs - which is quite rare for Too Short . Simply put , do not buy this , even for the Too Short lover . Not horrible , just BORING and nothing like his previous efforts .	-1
Im sorry but a tribe called quest 's `` beats rhymes & life '' is wack and so is atcq coz dey are boring and their beats ai n't good at all . Their single dey had `` stressed out '' is lame as hell . Dont support dese lamez .	-1
When this album came out I ran and bought it because it 's Tribe . When I listened to the album I was dissapointed . The beats were corny and the lyrics were wack . The album sounds like it was rushed . There is only 1 good track on the entire album and that 's it .	-1
I ca n't believe I actually liked these guys when they first came out . This CD is full of really bad pop songs , most of which have boring lyrics , bad programming and annoying vocals . I have given this album a chance , and they failed . Nothing like some other GOOD pop albums I own.PS : Sorry guys . At least I did n't give it one star !	-1
Klick on buy used if you want this cd , i personaly em not a Backstreet Boys fan , my cousin gave me this cd , she sayd i cann sell it so i em .This cd was bought in Germany .I also em selling their cd single from germany Quite playing games with my heart .	-1
The Only Reason I gave this C.D a chance was because my Girlfriend Happens to love these Moronic disgraces of Music . 4 songs on this 12 song album were Decent ! the rest Were shoddy Production and too Poppy . & quot ; quit Playing Games with my heart & quot ; a great song has an rnB feel to it . & quot ; As long as you love me & quot ; Great Lyrics and the groove is catchy ! . & quot ; all i have to give & quot ; fairly decent i have to be in the mood to listen to it . & quot ; everybody & quot ; the only reason i like this damn song is because i saw the video so many times i have the lyrics imbedded in my brain . The rest suck . Im sorry But after Artist like & quot ; Prince & quot ; , & quot ; Stevie Wonder & quot ; , & quot ; Michael Jackson & quot ; Paved the way for these young swill Merchants . You think Anyone Would make good music . Well These Puppets for the record companies Suck no Punn intended . if you like this kind of music go listen to Savage Garden at least they have Talent . these morons do n't and Im out !	-1
Talent-Less in every sense of the word.The music is Dated New Jack & amp ; The vocals are plain boring.all of their music is Formula.Avoid at all costs.just like all the other boy bands .	-1
I did n't like this album that much . Only songs i liked are The MC , Step Into A World , A Friend , Ca n't Stop Wo n't Stop . Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i do n't know why he tried to do a rock song . Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS . The songs were too short on this album also .	-1
Joe has a good voice but overall the material comes across as Low-Budget R.Kelly .	-1
Oh man is this bad . What else can I say .	-1
now , i now that i am going to tick off more than a few people with his one , but , oh well ... after the first jars album , i was really looking forward to this after hearing the ep . i got it and i was truly dissapointed . it reminds me of dire straits or duran duran ( something of that nature -- the whole 80 's rock vibe ) . anyway , the songs & quot ; crazy times & quot ; and & quot ; frail & quot ; stand out . the rest of the tracks are just crap . whatever happened to the band that wrote achingly beautiful acoustic ballads ? sure , they changed , but was it for the better ? my bet is that it was n't . get the first cd . it is much better .	-1
This is not upbeat stuff . Amidst the depressing and self pitying lyrics is some interesting music . In an era when you are lucky to have 3 worthy songs on an album , Plumbs self titled album has 5 that are worth a listen musically . Keep the razor blades away from teenage girls in your home if your going to buy this one.I am not a teenage girl , so I ca n't tell if these lyrics will send girls into the abyss or pull them away from the edge of it . As I said , musically there are 5 interesting songs , but I do n't see anyone getting lifted up with any of this music.As a parent , I would say check out the lyrics at your favorite lyric website before buying . Make sure they are OK . I bought this based on a recommendation for my 11 year old daughter , but did not give it to her .	-1
Finally Tupac Shakur has came down from cloud 9 , only this has happened after Tupac Shakur has actually visited cloud 9 ( Heaven ) . This double LP sounds more like a compilation of 2Pac 's early work , most tracks were made around the times of `` 2Pacalypse Now '' and `` Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z ... '' , and it shows . Although Tupac ( as always ) comes with it lyrically ( for the most part ) , this album - like his old albums , suffers from poor production . But this LP is still a solid buy , it is just below average overall as an LP . Records like `` Do 4 Me '' and `` I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto ( remix ) '' , alone are an overwhleming excuse to buy this album .	-1
If you repeat these words you must suck worst then this.Come on heads diss this crap make it get 1 star they suck .	-1
THIS IS MY FIRST CD THAT I BOUGHT FROM TWINKIE AND I MUST SAY THAT ITS REALLY ALL THAT GREAT ITS OK BUT ITS NOT AWESOME LIKE HER OTHERS CD ARE . TRUST ME I LISTEN TO A LOT OF GOSPEL MUSIC AND THIS CD IS NOT GOOD . SO SAVE YOUR MONEY	-1
I AM DISAPPOINTED OF THIS CD BECAUSE FRED HAMMOND AND RFC IS OFF THE CHAIN BUT THIS CD IS NOT . I REALLY WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT BECUASE THEY HAVE DONE BETTER AND THIS CD IS A WASTE OF MONEY . IF YOU STILL WANT TO BUY IT THEN YOU CAN BUT I REALLY DIDNT LIKE IT . THERE WERE SOME SONGS THAT ARE GOOD BUT THE REST ARE WEAK	-1
Just because one has the name does n't mean one willbe happy with another Christmas CD . Folks , spend iton his other CD 's , but preview it first !	-1
Terrible the only sound that was good was the machine turning off . If it was free it would have costto much	-1
Seems like every one I know who enjoys Punk rock absolutely loves this band . Well I dont . I downloaded a few of there songs and they sounded like bubble gum Punk with emoy vocals . This was a few years ago . Just a little while ago a bought a great peace punk comp that included the above band . In fact it had the aboves title track Die for the government which I hear is there best song on the album . I being the opened minded Indivudual I am listened to this track several times . After the several listenings I concluded that anti-flag were a bunch of fashion punks who read some chomsky and decided to make a album . The song is terrible and insults my intelligence and my belief as a socialist . I can see it now Republicans are going to point there crooked fingers at this albums lyric sheet and laugh at the modern liberal youth.In final words . Punk is dead and Antiflag dances on its graveIf you want real punk please look up Crass , Dead kennedys , Black Flag , Doa , etcPeace	-1
I 've been a huge fan of the McGarrigles since the 1980s , and if CDs could wear out , my copies of their debut album and Love Over and Over would have worn out long ago . Alas , their last album before Kate 's death was disappointing - as in , I copied 3 songs from it and resold the CD within a few weeks . Purely in terms of sound quality , Matapedia is great , but the inspired , witty , sometimes poignant lyrics of their earlier albums are missing , so these supremely gifted songwriters were obviously past their peak . For the record , the 3 songs that were & # 34 ; keepers & # 34 ; are The Biker Song , Talk About It , and Jacques et Gilles . The use of a celesta on The Biker Song made me wonder : Why does n't this amazing little instrument get used more often in pop music ? Jacques et Gilles is a bit on the PC/preachy side , but the melody is fine . Talk About it has some of the delightful & # 34 ; bounce & # 34 ; from some of their earlier albums , as in the songs Love Over and over and Kiss and Say Goodbye.Not bad , but disappointing - a sort of generic pop/folkie album that is not in the same class as the sisters ' earlier albums .	-1
I personally think there is no real defending this album . Rt is right that this is a flat out bad album . Restless Highway sounds good at first but it really is a poorly constructed song . Do n't Let a Thief Steal Into Your Heart is a good song but not on this release . The band that backs Thompson up here is more of a country-rock band which does not fit at all . Plus , there is a lot of filler . Sweet Surrender , Layla and Pavanne are all throwaways . The only song of any significance is House of Cards and by the time it arrives , one has given up on the album entirely.Overall , this felt like a quickly rushed album that really does n't need to be heard except for die-hard Thompson fans ( like the ones reading this review ) . This release can be found on cassette but do n't expect much . I guess no artist can be perfect as , in my opinion , this is the only flat out bad album he ever released .	-1
I heard all these bad reviews from the other reviewers and I was n't sure I should buy this , but my friend convinced me I should . I 'm not sure why everyone hates this book . I mean , it is kind of dumb , but it 's OK .	-1
I know this guy is supposed to be some kind of saint , but this CD left me cold . If Drake ca n't be bothered to show a little emotion on this , he should n't have bothered to record it .	-1
What a pleasant surpise we have here . Susannah has a great voice ! Susannah sure does sing beautifully on this cd.The real problem I have with this cd is in the instrumentation . Whoever the musical director was for this project should be fired . This is a jazz cd , but that does n't mean that the music on this cd should n't have some melody to it . On most the songs there was no true melody . Susannah needs a new band . Susannah has too much talent to waste on projects like this.I currently own all of the S.M . catalog and would like to say that there are other cds by Susannah that are much better than this cd.Recommendation : I can not recommend this cd .	-1
I make no bones about it , I 'm not on the band wagon of the `` Manze Craze '' going around the past few years . These Bach Violin Concertos ( and previous recordings ) show Andrew Manze to obviously be a violinist of extreme technical ability as far as negotiating complex passages , however what he has in complex passages work he is lacking in flowing melodic line , solid intonation , smooth articulation and beauty of sound . His playing often sounds scratchy , awkward and uneven . The tone he emits from his instrument is not attractive and his phrasing sounds unnatural.Let 's look at the A minor concerto in detail and compare it to Jaap Schroder/Academy of Ancient Music/Christopher Hogwood 's recording on Decca 400 080 ( IDN 3259140008026 Out-of-print ) or ( A Minor Concerto on Uni/L'Oiseau-Lyre - # 43326 ASIN : B000004CYD and E Major Concerto on Pgd/L'Oiseau-Lyre - # 448178 ASIN : B000004CYP ) .Let 's talk about the engineering of the recording , first . When the A minor recording first started I was struck by the boxy closed-in sound of the Manze recording and it 's lack of high overtones from the baroque violins . The prominence of the Manze 's violin overpowers the orchestra . On the other hand , Schroder 's recording is much better balanced with a really nice ambiance to the recording with a decay time of about 2 seconds , perfect . Schroder 's recording has the nice high bright silky overtones which the original instruments should have.For the performance , Manze shows uneven articulation and wavering intonation that is not enjoyable to listen to . Also , there is a lack of what I would call buoyancy to the Manze recording . Schroder has a command of the music with solid intonation combined with smooth articulation . Schroder 's fast movements are buoyant and soaring when needed . While listening to the slow movement of the Schroder recording , I was lulled into ecstasy . Manze , on the other hand takes the slow movement too slow and his tone is uneven during long notes . In one instance he reaches a high note and there is a definite slide up into the note that is very irritating.As a side note , another alternate recording that is almost as good if not as good in it 's own way as the Schroder recording is the one by Elizabeth Wallfisch on Virgin Records - # 61558 ( ASIN : B00000J2PS ) .All in all , the Manze recording of Bach 's Violin Concertos makes for an unsatisfying listening experience . You would be much better off with the Schroder or Wallfisch recording .	-1
I bought this cd because one of my friends liked them and I figured that there was a reason why . So I picked it up , thinking that Lagwaggon would rule and stuff . Nope . This album is just bad music . Sure Angry Days is listenable , and the remake of Bad Moon Rising is novel , but other then that , save your money . I hear that newer Lagwaggon stuff is good . But I 've been scorn for life from this cd .	-1
So i go and buy this tape ... What a joke while the lyrics are good . The music is horrible ... Mabey i 've gone crazy but , this cd sucks	-1
Well everyone gave this great reviews honestly I do n't see whats so special about it . No punk , this is not punk at all . I like the beats , but the songs do n't have that certain punkishness to them.Maybe it 's just cuz I 've been spoiled by Greenday , and Offspring , stuff like that , which is true punk . Man , I could of sworn I heard this on the easy listening station , haha .	-1
The songs on here are really good , but the recording quality sounds like balls ! ! It sounds like they play the guitars using the neck pickup the whole time ! You can hardly make out the chords/notes most of the time ! It 's very annoying after a while . This is one of their earlier albums so I do n't expect it to sound amazing . But like I said , the songs are great in typical Gim me Gim me fashion . Must have for a gim me gim me fan , but I would get blowing in the wind or love their country first if you 're new to the Gim me Gimmes .	-1
This CD is the only Jones CD that covers her entire career , but is dubbed from disc and sounds appalling . Although restricted to her All Platinum recordings , the 'Your Precious Love & quot ; collection is at least taken from original tapes , although recording quality is not perfect.Followers of the deep soul movement of the early '70s will definitely find the late Ms. Jones to their taste .	-1
Using `` Golden Classics '' as a selling point for this CD is REALLY stretching things ... .A LOT ! OK , so two or three of the 14 cuts on this release may have made it on Your Hit Parade , it 's pretty safe to say the remaining cuts never even got a cardboard sales award ! It is rumored that The Beatles were inspired by Anita 's hit recording of the `` Music Man '' gem , `` Till There Was You '' to cut their own version of the song . `` Paper Roses '' is probably the single record Bryant is best remembered for ... but even this record has been overshadowed by Marie Osmond 's hit cover some years later , which pretty much made Anita 's recording stale and forgotten . After a string of modestly selling albums for Columbia , the label dumped her long before her well known hate crusade against gays , indicating her career was in trouble years before she claimed political adversaries had derailed it . Her last album for Columbia was a pathetic dud of a love theme album that really showcased Anita 's failing vocal abilities along with cornpone arrangements that would put a monkey infused with gallons of Starbucks to sleep . At that time , and sadly , the singer 's voice was becoming dark , leathery and unappealing with a drastic loss of range long before its time . But on she forged with the sacred label Word out of Wacco , Texas . It seemed like a solid home for the often sacred singer , but Anita 's output with the label lacked inspiration and all their efforts paled in comparison to her sacred releases with Columbia ( especially the pop-inspriational Columbia album , `` I Beleive '' ) . Certainly the most embarassing release of her entire career was a lack-luster , unspired live religious album with Word which was released not long before they showed her the door ( most likely due to massive compliants from record buyers offended by Bryant 's hate crusades , along with dismal record sales and that failing voice ) . On this live recording , the singer offered unending testimonies about how she was grand enough to lead her flocks to The Lord if they bought her records and books ... it was obvious that Anita now believed The Lord was an employee of Anita Bryant ministries ... the time left on the LP consisted of poorly performed & darkly arranged sacred tunes . Along her career path , Bryant managed to write a long series of books for religious publishers mostly offering Anita 's guidence on how to have a perfect family like her 's . However , even her most ardent supporters jumped off The Good Gospel Ship Anita Bryant , after she dumped her first husband , the father of her children and the co-subject of her happy family sagas . One of the last straws for her public was an outlandish , interview Anita Bryant actually granted with Playboy magazine ... where she discussed everything from her political crusades to her orgasims . To top it all , reports have surfaced that one of Anita 's sons has been outted as being gay . With a career that nose-dived into financial ruin and a failing voice , bankruptcies were not far away via theaters Bryant and her latest husband established in places like Branson , Missouri and Pidgeon Forge , Tennesse , that went bottoms-up , while Anita prayed with casts & employees , guarenteeing the Lord 's blessing on everyone that stuck with her ... she would secretly 'get out of Dodge ' , leaving a few ticket holders in the lurch , and bilking employess and fellow performers out of back pay , including one of her loyal fan club members . Many believe it was actually her failing career , including being dumped by Columbia Records , that prompted MS Bryant to try to jump start her failing career with her ugly policical crusade , rather than any kind of religious conviction . Finding work almost non-existance in this new century , and finding she was n't welcome in several states due to bankruptcies , MS Bryant is reviving `` Anita Bryant Ministeries '' online in a desperate and sadly pathetic attempt at financial survival ... I ca n't help but wonder if she 's seeking a new Playboy interview to bring things full circle ! Unlike everyother artist that was popualr when Bryant enjoyed her biggest success , there has been no interest or demand in issuing her recorded material on CD 's ... with this one exception .	-1
I was quite disappointed upon receiving my copy of this CD after seeing all the 5 star ratings given by other users . The only real standout tracks are the two commonly heard on radio - Green Eyed Lady and Do n't Call Us , We 'll Call You . The rest of both albums are mired in marginal production , sophomoric lyrics and way too much instrumental `` noodling . '' As a keyboardist , I longed to hear more of the great B-3 organ work shown on Green Eyed Lady , but by and large it 's absent . Another minor disappointment is the drumming on these albums , too many flashy attempts at fills and not enough solid groove . Compare Aerosmith 's classic version of Train Kept A Rollin to the lame instrumental version here . I found myself skipping ahead looking for something worth comparing to the two above mentioned tracks and never found it .	-1
I had high hopes for this `` reunion '' album , what with core members Brooker/Trower/Reid/Fischer on board . What made PH one of the best and most unique bands of the late 60s and early 70s was Brooker 's voice and elegant piano , soulful organ work by Chris Copping or Matthew Fischer , Reid 's quirky and often enigmatic or humorous lyrics , a unique talent for blending rock with classical music , and restrained but tasteful guitar work from Trower and his successors in interest after he left the band to go solo . Other than Brooker 's voice , all of those components are missing here . The songs suffer from a similarity in sound/tempo/theme such that you are basically listening to one long song throughout the 12 cuts . I do n't know why Trower or Fischer even came on board , as they are denied soloing and their contributions are buried in a wall of sound type of production that is rife with synthesizers and what sounds like drum machines and which is better suited for disco or techno outings . The songs are mostly `` power pop '' ballads that should have been relegated to the Steve Perry chapter of Journey . Stick with Broken Barricades , Grand Hotel or the band 's other classic outings , and avoid this sad chapter in their career . I blame the producer , not the band , as he shares song credits on many of the tunes on this enterprise .	-1
Puuhlease ! It 's cute but why would you want to waste your time with a second-rate Depeche Mode wannabe synth pop group ? If you want the real deal , check out some early Depeche Mode and Duran Duran .	-1
Back when I was a lad ( well , more of a lad than I am now ) I really dug this record . Every note that Maynard James Keenan sang , roared or bellowed would resonate deeply within mine angst-ridden teenage bosom and his vitriol and rage were as milk and honey to my tortured soul.But that was about five years ago and now I 'm one of those pretentious , artistic types who go in for jaded , circumlocutory reviews such as this one . The point being , of course , that I 'm just too damned relaxed to really enjoy this record.Opiate is not a particularly bad extended player . Certain things can be said in its favour , viz. : i . The rhythm section churns out a particularly violent , plangent undertow upon which Adam Jones wreaks his edgy guitar havoc and the aforementioned Keenan wails and yowls in his heavy-duty tones.ii . The songs that were recorded live , namely Cold And Ugly And Jerk-Off , apart from being downright scary in their thunderous venting of spleen , resonate with uncommon clarity and cohesion.iii . The record is free from the overproduced bombast of Aenima and the too-lengthy psych-outs on Undertow.These things said , however , for me this record is , well , too angry . There 's precious little respite from the ranting and raving and , despite the record 's comparative brevity , by its end I 'm inevitably left feeling a little drained from it all and I ca n't help thinking that perhaps Maynard James should stop being such a negative Nellie .	-1
Your a tool if you like tool ... First of all , i dont know what posses kids to wear korn t-shirts , mudvayne t-shirts to real extreme real concers in the first place ? ! Tool 's music is just plain horrible , boring , unspering , no-talent and is not difirent then your paparoach , korn , avril , & the list goes on & on ! For good talented music do not search for tool or any nu-metal band or cd in the first place -- go else or better ? Search my music and maiby you 'll learn about talent music .	-1
Mediocre at best , but `` Undertow '' is far superior to Tool 's later work . Torture victims from future albums will say : `` Wow ! There are actually songs on this one ! `` I enjoyed some of it , and I would sell it to a store when I wanted to be rid of it , whereas I would chuck `` Aenima '' out the window of my car on the interstate and shout ... as it spun away . I guess that 's a good thing .	-1
This debut from Tool is overrated and is not as interesting as their other albums . The songs and vocals drag on in a repetetive and way and the is little going on to keep me listening.However , tracks like prison sex , sober and bottom are the best they have written - these display more dynamics and variation . Another strong point is that there are no `` filler '' segments like on `` aenima '' between tracks to distract you .	-1
I love Big Star , but ca n't stomach this album . Why someone would want to listen to this and not the originals escapes me . I guess the sound is edgier , more driving , but ultimately you listen to Big Star for the awesome songs . Yet , the voices here are so distracting ( the Posies are too mellodramatic , and Chilton ca n't save the set ) it pretty much wrecks it . Too bad , but I guess they had to prove it could be done .	-1
I was pretty disappointed with this CD . The band sounded really sloppy and much of the show drags . However , that could be blamed on lack of preparation because this was a reunion concert . They seem to be striving for a Badfinger/Wings sound but fall far short of their lofty goals . The two most memorable songs here are both covers ... Marc Bolan 's `` Baby Strange '' and Todd Rundgren 's `` Slut '' . That 's a pretty good indicator of how weak their own material is.I have yet to get the whole Big Star mystique . I saw them last year at Little Steven 's Garage Fest and they were one of the very few low points . My son felt exactly the same way .	-1
I bought this on the recommendation of a friend , and I wish I would have borrowed it from him first . I will admit , there are 2 or 3 good songs on here , but even those are too artsy and weird , and it is n't an organic weird , it sounds forced . I think , personally , that if you do n't like at least 75 % of a CD within the first couple of listens , it is n't worth it . I 've listened to this about 100 times trying to let it grow on me , but I still think it is not that good .	-1
If you went back into the late 90's/early 00 's and asked me what my favorite bands were , I would have gladly answered Tool and Rage Against the Machine . Back then , I thought both bands were such musically-brilliant , insightful bands because of the fact that they were marketed as bands that were heavy metal yet were insightful and thought-provoking , and being the gullable kid I was due to my lack of knowledge of underground music at the time , I ate them both up like hotcakes . For the last seven years or so , I 've been neck-deep in underground metal and industrial bands , and to say that I 've burned my bridges to Tool and RATM would be an understatement . Rather , it would be more appropriate to say that I hijacked a TOS-1 Buratino flamethrower tank and not only decimated said bridges with the tank 's massive thermobaric rocket payload , but also decimated any nearby engineering firms that could have rebuilt those bridges to said alt-metal bands . Okay , enough of my rambling , on to reviewing Tool 's `` Aenima . `` Listening to this album as an adult , I ca n't help but get infuriated by it . This album infuriates me because aside from sounding so drab for being a `` heavy '' rock band , it totally reeks of dishonesty for the fact that it 's marketed as an intelligent slab of music yet it tightly-clings to such juvenille aesthetics that do n't gel at all with aesthetics that are supposed to be `` higher class . '' Even if the juvenille lyrics in some songs are supposed to be ironic humor , it did n't work because I 'm not laughing.MUSICIANS/MUSICIANSHIPWhile many of the musicians here have some instrumental talent by themselves , they do n't win much points from me because they do n't craft much music on this album that I actually like.Maynard James Keenan is an extremely overrated singer . His vocalwork is one of the main reasons why I hate this album , since his vocals usually are either really bad `` anguished '' singing or pseudo-aggressive yelling , in which both styles would be right at home with your run-of-the-mill 90 's nu-metal ( or alternative metal for those who demand euphamisms ) or Nine Inch Nails album ( yuck ) .His songwriting is n't impressive at all , either . So much of his lyrics on this album are like what you 'd read from an angry high schooler 's notebook who 's in an introductory philosophy class , so it 's like a mix of bad , angsty poetry and pseudo-intellectual ramblings . Some songs like `` Fourty Six and Two '' and `` Third Eye '' exemplify the pseudo-intellectual lyrics , while songs like `` Hooker With a Penis '' ( brilliant song title ) have lyrics as if they were yanked straight out of an angry 15 year-old 's mouth.Adam Jones is a guitarist that has skill ( though is inferior to the likes of Chuck Schuldiner and Ron Jarzombek ) , but a lot of what he 's made on this album is really flat and uninspired . The only song where any of his riffs and solos sound like there 's some energy in them are in `` Third Eye , '' while it seems like the rest are just grunge/nu-metal riffs played in an `` artsy '' manner or flat , simplified progressive rock riffs with an occasional polyrhythm . Most of the solos are n't that good , either , since so many of them sound like half-baked , goofy `` feedback '' solos you 'd hear from Tom Morello ( another painfully overrated guitarist ) .Justin Chancellor 's bass is interesting in areas , though nothing that really grabbed my attention . If it counts for anything , at least his bass is more audible in this album than most rock albums out there.Danny Carey is a drummer that 's been showered with tons of praise . Now he is a skilled drummer , but skill with an instrument does n't mean they automatically can make interesting songs . True , in a lot of the songs on this album , Carey does some neat , technical stuff with his skins , but they ca n't save the songs for the fact that so many of them are either boring or downright irritating.SONGSThe only song on this album I 'd say is promising is `` Third Eye . '' In fact , I 'd say that for the most part , it shows that when pressed , Tool 's rhythm section can come up with dynamic , interesting music ( especially since this one clocks in at 14 minutes ) . However , it gets ruined with Maynard 's lousy vocalwork , especially when he screams out `` Prying open my third eye ! ! `` .The `` hit '' songs like `` Stinkfist '' and `` Aenima '' are examples of the grunge/nu-metal songs with an `` artsy '' glaze applied to them , and boy do they sound annoying . They honestly do n't sound much different ( or much better ) than the typical grunge/nu-metal gunk infesting the mainstream at the time this album came out.Other songs like `` Push1t '' and `` Eulogy '' are examples of trying-too-hard-yet-flat progressive-rock with the occasional `` heavy '' moments on this album , and when I 'm not chuckling at Maynard 's attempts to come off as a deep thinker , I 'm usually wallowing in boredom over how bloodless most of them feel.There 's filler tracks like `` Message to Harry Manback , '' `` Intermission , '' and `` Die Eeir Von Satan '' that add next to nothing in terms of musical quality , in that they only pad out the running length of the album.PRODUCTIONThe production quality on this album is n't bad , since all the vocals , guitars , bass , and drums come in rather clear . However , like with all music , good sound quality ca n't save lousy music.FINAL WORDDespite all the heavy marketing and hype from the likes of MTV and Tool fans , this album is NOT a progressive metal masterpiece that will stretch your mind and change your life.If you 're looking for some actual metal albums that have brilliant musicianship , innovative ideas , creativity , or thoughtful lyrics ( or a combination of any ) , I strongly suggest you invest your time and money on these albums instead ( and yes , I 've listened to and own all of these ) : Death : `` Human '' Cynic : `` Focus '' Pestilence : `` Spheres '' Phantasmagory : `` Odd Sounds '' Atheist : `` Piece of Time '' Spastic Ink : `` Ink Complete '' Blotted Science : `` The Machinations of Dementia '' Gordian Knot : `` S/T '' Bunkur : `` Bludgeon '' Neurosis : `` Souls at Zero '' Godflesh : `` Pure '' Blut Aus Nord : `` MoRT '' Pan.Thy.Monium : `` Khaooohs '' Meshuggah : `` Destroy Erase Improve '' Do n't be surprised that if you get engrossed in any of the above albums and own a copy of Tool 's `` Aenima , '' that you find yourself getting rid of said Tool album .	-1
if you do n't like this band and worship the members as gods , you are an inferior being and for that i look down my nose at you even though i 'm only fifteen like i know what the hell i 'm talking about . the benevolent reverend maynard told me to be myself and open my mind to new ideas so i snub people who have different opinions from me . tool are the most amazing , intellectual , spiritual , aesthetically pleasing sonic experience i 've ever had and because of that , i 'm in a class all my own and ca n't be touched . nevermind the fact that aenima has gone platinum and everyone else who owns it thinks the same exact thing . i 'm still my own person and i 'm still better than you because tool are gods . you can come crawling back to me when you 've realized the musical genious and sonic voyage that is tool , and only then will i treat you as an equal . i 'm open minded . i listen to tool.has anyone else had this experience when talking to a tool fan ? they have this single-minded ferocity similar to that of a born-again christian or a member of the 'holy rollers ' . it 's weird.anyway , as for the music , i like the songs eulogy , message to harry manback , hooker with a penis , intermission and die eier von satan . i 'd like the rest if i had n't heard the singles a million times and if the rest did n't get so boring . it just kind of goes on and on , and is n't really as layered as you may be lead to believe by these reviews . BUT this is a fine album for just about everybody . you might as well buy it if you have n't already . whether you like it or not , this album/band is pretty influencial for a lot of bands , even though pretty much all of them [ stink ] ( just about every radioband after '96 or however long it took a band to get together and make an album after listening to aenima , alice in chains , and nirvana . ) i think the fact that this band has a weird cult-like following should say something too . i liked this when i was in high school ( about the time it came out ) , but then i moved on to other kinds of music that have more going on . i 'm past my tool phase.i saw them live too . they sound great , they 're very tight ( not as in 'phat ' , as in they play together exceptionally well ) . the show is great . they dont do much on stage and it helps immensely if you 're high on something . but as for the MUSIC ... only if you like it . the new show is mostly lateralus . i hated lateralus so i hated the show . lateralus was EMPTY and BORING . yeah i said 'empty ' . nothing special . nice visuals from time to time .	-1
Sorry - did n't get it . Liked Undertow & Lateralus thoOverall , Tool 's overrated .	-1
I was listening to a metal radio station and the DJ was talking about how awesome Tool were so I downloaded this album to check them out . WOW . They 're awful . `` Pretentious '' and `` tedious '' would sum up this album . The only cool thing is the computerized vocals . All of the musicians , especially the drummer , sound like they just came out of their first instrument lesson . Horrid musicianship . Skip this lame poser metal and listen to 30 Seconds To Mars , new Metallica , Staind , System Of A Down , etc .	-1
This is probably one of the most overrated albums of modern times . Tool are not bad musicians but they tend to make a mess of albums - and this is their biggest mess of their career . Of the 15 tracks only 8 are songs while the rest is senseless filler segments sandwiched in between songs.Aenima actually starts well and the first songs show some progression from their debut . However the first filler starts on track 4 and here the album turns into an extremely difficult and frustrating experience . The other songs are n't as strong as you again struggle with more filler . Things pickup with & quot ; jimmy & quot ; and the title track before the entire album drowns in endless filler and noise.Had Tool stuck to the no-nonsence format of their debut we may have had a good album.Critics and fans will equate this to genious but these people are the first to be fooled by gimicks and concepts that often mask musical blandness .	-1
Killing Joke 's mix of heavy metal and melodic pop hooks fuel & quot ; Democracy & quot ; into a confused , rather bland set of songs that seem a mix of '70s 'Boston ' , 80 's 'The Cult ' , and 90 's grunge , never identifying itself as the dark post punk distinctive Brit sound Killing Joke is alleged to be , but instead revealing a swirl of many hard rock ideas unfortunately anchored in an '80s time capsule where the beat goes on and on but never seems to get anywhere . The songs too often use the same formula of a grunting hard-edged vocal transforming into a lighter melodic sing-song soft core voice with vibrating 'Cult ' guitars and repetitious , thump , thump , bang , bang , drums that clumsily combine punk with melody . They seem capable of more and a good Producer could have trimmed the clutter and the repetition in a more pronounced vision of social politics , which seems to be the aim here .	-1
After loving their last two albums , I was grossly dissappointed by Democracy . It sounds too dense , too ponderous , and too boring to be considered a four star CD . If you really want to listen to a good representation of Killing Joke , buy Fire Dances or Extremities . Avoid this one as your first taste of Killing Joke . You might not come back for more	-1
Unfortunately there are not many of my Rock n Roll favorites on this . In choosing this cd there was not the possibility to see the list of songs . Had I seen the list , I probably would not have purchased this cd	-1
`` The Man Who Sold the World '' is an album that established a reputation -- David Bowie , pop songster and pyschedelic folkster , did a dramatic about-face and reinvented himself as a dark metal rocker . In 2006 , this sort of reinvention of Bowie is something that was expected , but in 1970 , this must have been rather unexpected . Influencing this change was no doubt the presecne of guitar hero Mick Ronson , whose embracing of distortion and feedback made this entirely possible . The results of this change , quite honestly , are a lot more mixed then most Bowie fans would lead you to believe -- `` The Man Who Sold the World '' has been elevated to cult status and truthfully it 's not that the album is bad per se , it 's just that it 's not particularly exciting.Bowie lets us know right away that things have changed -- `` Width of a Circle '' is an extended cut drenched in feedback and distorted guitars with a galloping bassline ( played by producer Tony Visconti ) and a rambling vocal from Bowie . No doubt it woke a lot of people up as to the change of direction , and it proves to be a decent number . But Bowie seems incapable of really sustaining this and seems unsure how to integrate it into his idiom -- `` All the Madmen '' starts as a bleak acoustic ballad before overdriven guitars and a downright irritating synth line get in the way , `` After All '' ends up being a dull Lou Reedish ballad , and many of the metalish pieces are pretty much unmemorable ( `` She Shook Me Cold '' , the lyrically fantastic `` Running Gun Blues '' ) . The album closes on a high note , with the bizarre folk/metal fusion title track ( made famous decades later by Nirvana 's performance of it on MTV ) and the fractured , paranoid , and downright bizarre metal churn of `` The Superman '' , but the album is a bit too inconsistent to be a completely satisfying listen.There 's enough on here to make it worth a pickup for those exploring Bowie 's catalog , but he 'd do siginificantly better work in the very near future . This one is more a curiosity .	-1
I never cared much for this album and I doubt I ever will . Fame and Young americans are standout tracks but the rest of the songs just sound too much alike . When listened to them seperately they 're enjoyable enough , but played one after the other they become a bit of a drag . Bowie 's voacal delivery on this album is admirable though , it 's just a shame most of his songwriting is not .	-1
Still wondering why I bought this ... .Well recorded but not quite what I was expecting.Maybe you will like it more .	-1
You only need to ask yourself one question . Had Yoko Ono not been married to John Lennon , would any of this ever have seen the light of day ? Maybe one other ... .what does it tell you when a 5 CD box set hits the bargain bins ?	-1
Candy says stop stealing Lou Reed 's lyrics.I must admit to liking `` Buena , '' but this album , with its horns and airport bar vocals , is cheese city . This album is for the Adult Alternative crowd . That 's not entirely true . It 's for ironic indie kids with Adult Alternative souls.Shronk !	-1
This album is so terrible , it does not deserve the Sugar name . If you are thinking of this as your first Sugar album , I 'd strongly recommend Copper Blue , and Beaster over this one . Every song sounds the same , it is poorly produced , and it is a frustratingly uninspired effort .	-1
Despite some good songs , like the dynamic opener & quot ; Honey White & quot ; , the intriguing & quot ; Radar & quot ; or the well-crafted & quot ; All Your Way & quot ; , this record is not very convincing or solid . Morphine have a style of their own , that ` s undeniable , yet this release is too depressing , tiresome and unengaging . The peculiar use of sax in their songs is one of the band ` s trademarks , still I think they overuse it and the result ends up being repetitive and forgettable . & quot ; Yes & quot ; combines indie rock , blues , lo-fi and jazz in a somewhat innovative way , Mark Sandman ` s voice is interesting and strong and the band is professional , yet this album is average as a whole . The filler songs outweight the good moments , delivering an uneven record.Not the best around .	-1
Based on what I 'd heard and read about this record , I was expecting something really special . But unfortunately , this comes off as pretty tepid early `` alternative/college rock . '' It reminds me of stuff like Gang of Four , the Minutemen , a less abrasive Saccharine Trust etc . In 1981 this might have stood out . Today it just sounds dated . To me , truly classic music does n't ever sound dated ... or at least not to this degree . You can find great music from any period and era that sounds fresh decades later . That does n't describe this , unfortunately .	-1
Could be heard as pretty , but comes across as pretty dumbed-down instead . The playing , songwriting , singing , etc . all feel rather amateurish even if their hearts may be somewhere around right place ( which is probably why the band got many people to enjoy these compositions ) .	-1
There are exactly one and one-half excellent songs on here , and even when the music is finally on , the lyrics are so trite it nearly completely ruins the moment . For heaven 's sakes , the best song on here sings about Twinkies , you guys . Come on ! ! ! I do n't know what all the fives are all about in the other reviews here , but it bugs me . These people live in a different universe than myself.Do n't get me wrong , this is not a bad CD . It 's not terrible . It 's OK , in fact . But I was sucked into blowing fifteen dollars on it via the same blowhard unfathomable propaganda that appears in these other reviews here : Yep , one time I read in some or other indie music magazine that was raving about the old `` Galaxie 500 '' ; and , for goodness sake , to this day , I am baffled . For this was not a great group , folks . Not by a long shot . They were n't bad , but they were n't good either . Gim me a break .	-1
JOHN LENNON had many sides to his personality . What we have on full display here is John The Artist , Avant-Garde John and John The Cynic . Its is the last trait of Lennon 's personality that most intrigues me . His foul tempered rants at the world are legendary . I was not convinced by his peace 'n love act . This particular album can only be John at his most cynical- convinced that Beatles fans would buy anything that the guys put out there , even if it was a 30 minute sound collage of John changing TV stations , banging away on a piano and shouting out the odd phrase . This is nothing that anyone with a 4-track and a microphone could n't do themselves in no time at all . Surprisingly though , the effect does become strangely hypnotic after a while . That is until Yoko opens her mouth . Her tiresome shrill , bleating voice threatened to burst my eardrums on more than one occasion , and rendered the whole thing virtually unlistenable at some points . If it was n't for Yoko , I could see myself listening to this again- if I was in a particular mood . But the idea of again sitting through 30 minutes of Yoko aimlessly embarrassing herself does not appeal , personally . Worth owing as a curio , and a must for Beatles die-hards , Two Virgins could have been an interesting release if it was n't for Ono . I 've heard her screaming and wailing on other recordings , and given the right environment it can work ( kind of ) but here it is unforgivable . More ( in ) famous for THAT album cover , than for what is actually on the record , Two Virgins is n't a disaster , but it is n't particularly interesting either . Some forty years after it was released , it all just sounds a little silly .	-1
Well , unless you are a hardcore collector like myself ( had it originally on vinyl all those years ago ) , stay clear of this album . If you want to hear noise that you & your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself , then forget this album & make your own noise . The best track on the album is the bonus track . That tells you that this album has nothing to do with Beatles music . I give it one star for being terrible & one star for the packaging ; - ) . Search Judemac Forever '' on msn .	-1
The cover just makes me vomit , lennon and ono , two horrible persons naked ... and people actually bought this cr*p ? ? ? This does n't even have musical value . JUst like the thing you do in the bathroom	-1
It is bad to hear yoko but to see all of her to ... ... ... ... ... ... .. HO NO YOKO ONO .	-1
John & Yoko are nothing more than complete idiots . I do n't know what in the world those two were thinking , but I 'm not impressed . They made themselves look really stupid . I think it 's garbage . 'Nuff said .	-1
Beatle John 's first solo album was a collaboration with soon-to-be-wife Yoko Ono ( an avant-garde , conceptional artist whom he met while attending one of her exhibits in 1966 ) . Obviously , she must have re-kindled Lennon 's art-school passions as he would eventually divorce then-wife Cynthia in November of '68 , subsequently marry Yoko , and thus carry on a solo career that would play off her influence just as Yoko 's solo career would play of his influence . Their love for each other , for art , and for their unique musical vision complimented each other perfectly ( or , at the very least , inspired their various interests ) . The initial indication of this `` new partnership '' was found on The Beatles ' `` WHITE ALBUM '' with the track `` Revolution 9 '' : a bizarre but intriguing sound collage that is in itself as apocalyptic as `` SGT . PEPPER 'S '' own climatic `` A Day In The Life '' ( though coming from an entirely different direction ) . `` TWO VIRGINS '' builds upon `` Revolution 9 '' 's audio explorations . It is simply a half-hour piece of `` non-music '' music : a weird yet humorous ( at one point , after Yoko chortles a scream , you can hear John comment : `` That 's right , dear . Spit it out ! '' ) pastiche of sound that gives an aural portrait of the couple at that time . Surprisingly , it has aged better than expected , and does n't seem so `` strange '' nearly forty years later . The first half is undoubtedly better conceived than the second : with a neat sounding bird call motif , unusual instrumental touches , and silly exchanges between John and Yoko . The second side is relatively bland except for the mock Gregorian chant coda . But the real test of a work like this ( since it is n't a genuine `` musical '' piece in the conventional sense ) must be based on its own terms as a document of sound art ( i.e . `` Is it engaging ? Does it hold your interest ? Does it stand up to repeated listenings ? Does it achieve what the author 's intended ? etc . ) Regardless of public opinion , `` TWO VIRGINS '' does not hold up as a collage . It is only intermittingly interesting , and does n't engage the listener or make one want to hear it over and over again . But the measure of its worth is easy to assimilate by comparison ( i.e . all thirty minutes of `` TWO VIRGINS '' is n't even half as good as all eight-plus minutes of Beatle John 's `` Revolution 9 '' ) . By far , the best thing about the whole project is the technical brilliance of the lo-fi production . The splicing , editing , and sound effects remains the strongest aspect of the LP ; and one wishes that John has continued to apply such techniques in a REAL musical setting . He could have rivaled Frank Zappa in that department.As for the cover photo : the furor it caused upon release is legendary , but I think largely unwarranted . Lennon 's whole mindset at the time was to `` strip away '' all pretense in his music , art , and life . The sleeve only makes that visually clear ( whereas John and Yoko 's `` PLASTIC ONO BAND '' albums makes it aurally clear ) . But , as a whole , `` TWO VIRGINS '' is n't a success . I did n't find it worthless , but I also did n't find it to be worthwhile . The beautiful CD bonus track `` Remember Love '' certainly helps . HIGHEST POP ALBUM CHART POSITION : Number 124.NOTES FROM A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE : Christians may be appalled at the nude photos of John and Yoko , but I think less so if it were n't for the fact that 1 . They were n't married at the time it was recorded . 2 . They were still married to their respective spouses at the time it was recorded . 3 . They were committing adultery . The offense is compounded ( not alleviated ) by quoting Genesis Chapter 2 on the album cover . Yeah , it says `` And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed '' , but Adam and Eve WERE man and wife , not adulterous lovers ! The point is : if you 're going to quote The Bible to back up your moral position , then for goodness sakes at least play by the rules according to the verses you 're quoting or your argument will end up being made redundant and without merit . But because of the photo , the personal history behind it , and for one garbled f-word Lennon spouts off toward the end of part one : from a Christian moral perspective the album would rate *** ( CAUTIONARY ) .	-1
Unlistenable and without substance , it 's clear that Yoko is responsible for the majority of what appears on this disc . When it was first released , it was simply grating and annoying noise . With the passage of time , it now seems silly as well .	-1
I 'm reviewing this only to average down the overall rating . The album is n't worth commenting on . It 's that bad .	-1
Shockingly bad , unlistenable . This is the end result when narcotics totally screw up your judgement and sense of reality . This should have never been released . I do n't understand why this is still in print , just because its Lennon ? If anybody else would have made this the master tapes would have been thrown in a dumpster . At least they could have put some sounds of them screwing at the end of Side B .	-1
This is not a good experimental album . My sister and I made better stuff using a guitar , a box of nails , some wooden sticks and a couple of pots and pans when we we 're about 10 years old . Play this album first and then listen to Revolution 9 on the White Album , and the latter seem like a masterpiece , both in production and ideas . You might want this because of the historic value ( or maybe because of the cover ? ) , but not for the & quot ; music & quot ; . I got my copy cheap , so I 'm not that dissapointed . For serious Beatles/Lennon/Ono-fans only ... and they are actually nude on the cover !	-1
Avant Garde ! Sound Art ! Give me a break ! ! ! ! This thing is complete , intolerable garbage ! I have very eclectic musical tastes , and listen to most anything , but this crap is absolutely painful to listen to . And maybe that 's the whole point . It is an outpouring of emotion and pain that followed Yoko 's tragic miscarriage , but to actually put this on CD and have people buy it , is a joke . The opening track , & quot ; Cambridge 1969 & quot ; is a 26 minute piece of intolerable pain , which features Yoko 's offkey screaming , accompanied by John trying to match the pitch of her screams with feedback from his guitar . If you can last the entire 26 minutes on this one , without going into a fit of rage and breaking something , you are a stronger person than I . Let 's face it -- -the only reason Yoko ever sold anything was because of her association with John Lennon . This is awful stuff .	-1
Hey . For half the price of this CD , I 'll send you a CD of myself and my wife repeating our names , reading stuff , making noises . I 'll even include a bonus disk of my flatulent toots . Maybe I 'll throw my cat in the washing machine and create another YUCKO song .	-1
John and Yoko scream at each other for almost half an hour . Yep.George Martin made the understatement of the millennium when he said , `` I 'm not so sure that Yoko was a good musical influence on John . `` John went from writing songs like `` All You Need Is Love , '' and , `` In My Life , '' to screeching with Yoko into a tape recorder . Avant Garde ? How about self-indulgent , no talent , lazy BS ?	-1
Neat stuff came in the lp , Do n't know about the cd . the lack of any songs and yoko doing her thing was pretty bad . If a fan buy it , If not stay away .	-1
There was a time in the mid-60s when I would have bought an album of the Beatles belching and farting just because it was by the Beatles . If only this solo outing by Lennon with new wife Yoko Ono were that good . This is the album the CIA should have used to get Manuel Noriega to surrender to authorities ! ( After listening to this release a couple times , you 'll be begging your local radio programmer to play & quot ; You Light Up My Life & quot ; ! ) I should have learned my lesson when I first bought Unfinished Music No . 2 : Life with the Lions ( best track : & quot ; Two Minute 's Silence & quot ; ) , but John was still my favorite Beatle and I gave him another chance . Big mistake . Is this album experimental ? Yes . Is it avant garde ? Yes . Is it music ? Hey , I 'd rather listen to the collected love songs of William Shatner . I 'm amazed Rykodisk went to the trouble of rereleasing an album that sold so poorly the first time around in 1969 . The only Lennon/Ono collaboration that worked was Double Fantasy . Stick with that one ; this is for completists only .	-1
I bought this CD when I was in college a few years back . I had bought the John Lennon Plastic Ono Band disc and wanted to get this one as they had been released as companion pieces . I knew it was avant garde music and was expecting that style when I bought it . After barely making it through the whole album I knew I had made a mistake in buying it . I tried listening to it several times again later , but Yoko 's voice is just plain irritating . As someone who owns more than twenty Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane CD 's ( from his avant garde period just before his death ) I can tell you this : Yoko Ono does not belong in that category . I do n't feel that screeching at the top of your lungs necessarily places you in the same category with some of the greatest free jazz innovators that ever lived . Her fans love to claim that those who `` do n't get it '' do n't understand free jazz or how this pre-dated the punk movement of the late 70's/early 80 's , which is a ridiculous claim . This collection of songs may be really obnoxious and over the top in terms of Yoko 's vocals , but does that make it some kind of pre-punk album ? I do n't think so . If I want to hear pre-punk innovators I will throw on Iggy and the Stooges , the Velvet Underground , or The MC5 , not this album . To me , the main difference between this and later punk music is that punk music is LISTENABLE . Richard Hell and the Voidoids , The Ramones , Gang of Four , The Damned , and many more all qualify as punk music and the difference is that I ENJOY listening to their music . In closing , I gave this disc two stars because the music itself is not bad . John Lennon 's guitar work is impressive on `` Why '' ( not that you can hear it too clearly under Yoko 's caterwauling ) and after all you do have half the Beatles playing on this . I do remember Ringo 's drum part being pretty cool on `` Greenfield Morning ... '' ; actually it would be a pretty good sample for somebody if they ever thought to listen to this . Despite the instrumental bright spots , I would n't recommend this album to anyone , except the masochists out there that enjoy it for some unknowable reason .	-1
This Album was released to accompany John 's LP of the same title . The Album covers are identical . The back of the sleeve shows pictures of John and Yoko when they were children . However , the similarities end at the album cover . John 's LP is a fine collection of introspective , soul-searching tunes that show you why he is without a single doubt the lyrical genius behind the Beatles . Yoko-san 's LP , on the other hand , is quite another story.There is no need to be kind . This CD contains nothing more than a collection of shouts , screams , and other assorted noises that I once thought were humanly impossible . Another words , this is simply a collection of noise.Having an open mind will not make this CD any better . Simply put : Noise is Noise , no matter who makes it . And , listening to noise too long gives one a headache . I listened to Yoko-san 's collection of muSICK on this CD . . . she gave me a bloody nose.I must admit , however , that this recording may have some value as a disciplinary tool -- & quot ; Behave yourself or you 'll have to endure 15 minutes of Yoko-san. & quot ; Yikes . . . That 's enough to make even the hardest of criminals go straight . However , other than an instrument of extreme discipline and torture , this CD has absolutely no musical value whatsoever.My recommendation is that you avoid this CD like the plague .	-1
cant beleive a genius like john would even associate his music with this asian goofballthis is not even close to art or music its just plain garbage and yoko is an idiot ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The primary reason so many people dislike Yoko Ono is that she is nearly devoid of musical talent , and this was the album that brought this fact home to the greatest number of people . There is nothing here even worth reviewing individually . Yoko 's albums would NEVER have been released if not for the Lennon connection , and much of Lennon 's output would not have been as lame as it is if not for the Ono influence . He gave her exposure , and she brought the level of his music down to a new low . A shame .	-1
I still get a kick out of people , who write 5 star reviews for this cd [ FLY ] . This is plain dreck ! ! ! People called her cutting edge back in the days and an avant-garde genius ! Give me a break already ! Her music [ if thats what you call it ] , is incoherent whines and screams , that make the listener want to shut it off after 15 seconds . Let 's face it , the only reason she was ever allowed to record at all , is because she had an important connection to the music industry . His name was John Lennon .	-1
I remember listening to this album upon its release 30 years ago . I thought perhaps time would mellow my negative opinion . So I listened again.Nope . It 's still annoying , pretentious , non-musical garbage . If not for the Lennon connection , this monstrosity would never have seen the light of day .	-1
Out of all the album covers Yoko has put out over the years , this is my favorite.The ancient splendor of the pyramids and Yoko as the mysterious Sphincter is so apropos .	-1
The album cover , the gun shots on the record , the disco single , the survival themes , etc. -- All done to sell the record and advance Yoko 's position , myth , status , and legend . Pathetic and disgraceful . This is not an artist experiencing a great catharsis after a trauma but a conniving , shrewd , calculating , stone-cold business person who is a master of media and image manipulation . If you enjoy pretentious , corny music produced by top notch studio cats forced to make something out of nothing , go ahead and buy this . If you want music with heart , soul , pain , loss , emotion , grief , triumphant and catharsis go listen to some George Jones records from the early 80s . I ca n't appreciate `` art '' when someone 's recording and marketing budget hovers in the millions .	-1
She must be . A bag full of cats being dragged down the road by a rusted out Ford pickup would be much more pleasing to the ear than the cacophonous drivel that tries to pass for her singing ability . Make it stop . For god 's sake , somebody please make it stop !	-1
Yes the Zappa-heads will be whining loudly after they read this : WOIIFTM is the most overrated disc in FZ 's catalog . The real masterpiece of this era ? ? ? Absolutely Free . AF has better songs , and the studio tricks are incorporated smoothly into the music . The tunes on WOIIFTM wear thin after about 2 listenings ( I mean c'mon ; how many times can you listen to `` Bow Tie Daddy '' or `` Flower Punk '' once you know the joke ? ? ? ? ) . If you want `` weird '' , go to Lumpy Gravy or Uncle Meat . If you must have this though , stay away from the Rykodisc versions with the `` new '' drum and bass tracks , they are horrible . Let the whining begin ! ! ! !	-1
I do n't get weird for the sake of weird , I do n't get people who hate the Beatles for being too good at what they did , and apparently I do n't get Zappa . This really does sound dated . Basically a hand full of musicians were still taken by the novelty of a modern ( relatively for `` 68 ) recording studio . Fake phone conversations , meaningless jibber spoken into a mic ( with lots of echo , that makes it so much more intriguing ) . Obviosly the cover and the eclectic collection of music ( when there was a bit ) was a spoof of the Beatles . Okay , so it 's a spoof . What about it ? It 's kinda like watching a comedy spoofing another movie for not being funny and forgetting to be funny itself . Basically , if your in one of those hip circles who insists that Sgt . Peppers is n't a great album ( which it is ) simply because it is overrated ( which it may be ) than you might possibly find this album amusing .	-1
The Mothers of Invention/Frank Zappa - We 're Only In It for the Money ( 1968 ) I simply can not believe how highly regarded this album is . It 's astounding to me that people proclaim it to be a first rate musical composition . Truly , the music on WE 'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY sounds like it belongs on a children 's TV show . A perverted children 's TV show not actually suited for children . There are elements of doo wop , ragtime and other old-fashioned sensibilities - it certainly does n't rock . It 's really sing-songy and really dorky . Yes , Zappa ridicules hippie culture with satire and he also criticizes mainstream society and police violence , but I do n't find any of it to be particularly clever . Just irritating . And smug . Most of the songs here amount to musical snippets that do n't last very long , which would be a blessing if they did n't immediately segue into yet another irritating song . Zappa 's singing ( or whoever else is doing it ) , when he 's not simply talking , is sometimes monotonous and off key.The thing I find most irritating is this attitude that comes across through the words and the music itself ( especially the way he uses the xylophone ) that seems to be saying it thinks that it 's the most funny , most clever thing ever made . Lines like , `` You paint your head/ Your mind is dead/ That 's yooOOOUU ... American womanhood ! '' are delivered with this `` nya-nya-nya-nya-boo-boo '' quality that actually makes me want to smack the singer . I admit that there are a few segments that have genuine merit from a musical perspective ( for example , the piano parts on `` Absolutely Free '' ) , but it hardly matters because the presentation is so atrocious . The music may be melodic at times but much of it is quite simplistic and repetitious . Some of the studio effects might sound kinda cool but in this context they just sound cheesy.Other annoying things about WE 'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY : Zappa 's engineer periodically whispers heavily-echoed narcissistic nonsense throughout the album ... croaking frog noises are often heard ... sped-up chipmunk voices ... backwards guitar and other effects that merely sound like a child goofing off in the studio . Whether or not all this is supposed to be some sort of aural commentary on psychedelic pretensions , such a notion certainly does n't make it worth listening to . This being Zappa , there 's some disgusting scatological `` humor '' to be found , both petulant and babyish . The song `` Let 's Make the Water Turn Black '' has lines like , `` wizzing and pasting and pooting through the day '' and , `` all the while on the shelf in the shed/ Kenny 's little creatures on display . '' `` Ronnie saves his ` noomies ' on a window in his room/ A marble to be seen/ dysentery green . '' If kiddie gross-out humor is your thing then Zappa is definitely for you.The album ends with `` The Chrome Plated Megaphone of Destiny , '' over six minutes of tuneless , utterly worthless musique concrete featuring a heavy dose of chipmunk laughter . Why WE 'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY has been called one of the greatest albums ever by sources like Rolling Stone magazine is completely beyond me . I 'm utterly baffled . Zappa actually made some good music and he was an incredible guitarist but I contend that this record is complete and utter trash.Rating : STAY AWAY	-1
I just recently gave this cd , or whatever it is , a listen and was amazed at the audacity of this man . While I agree with his take on the drug-induced 1960s , I was aghast at his pathetic lampooning of the Beatles-THE BEATLES . I feel that his mocking them might have a certain degree of validity had he been in the same musical league as John Lennon or Paul McCartney , but this clearly is not the case . It 's interesting how so many praise this amateur as if he were the music world 's second coming of Christ , when in fact , his music is so pathetically substandard .	-1
Sometime in the Mid-1980s as CDs were starting to kick in , Frank Zappa dug up what masters he could find of this album and his classic , & quot ; We 're Only In It for the Money , & quot ; and proceeded to literally re-mix the albums.While this was certainly his prerogative , somebody should have told him not to play with perfection.The excuse Zappa gave for re-mixing the tapes was that the bass and drum tracks were destroyed , so he had to re-record them . To do that he brought in current members of his band at the time and mixed their digitally-recorded instruments in with the analog-recorded masters.It sounded awful . He released it anyway.Suddenly , after a few years , the missing bass and drum tracks for & quot ; Money & quot ; mysteriously & quot ; turned up & quot ; and a mix similar to that of the original vinyl appeared on the market and is still available today.Not so for & quot ; Ruben and the Jets. & quot ; This remix is so sonically inferior to the original vinyl that I find it painful to listen to.It 's interesting to have , I guess , just to compare versions . There are obvious differences in some song lengths and arrangements ( & quot ; Deseri , & quot ; for example , ends before Ray Collins 's bizarre ad lib , & quot ; for cram and for dorssn , & quot ; can be heard ) , and some of the tunes just sound hollow.On the up side , this album contains what I 've always thought was Frank Zappa 's first really good guitar solo , the playout of the last song , & quot ; Stuff Up the Cracks. & quot ; Amazingly intense and totally out of the blue on a doo-wop album , it promised good things to come from Zappa , and he certainly delivered.Get this only after you 've heard the vinyl .	-1
que hacer con tantas grabaciones desperdiciadas por excesiva experimentacion o busqueda..que hacer con ensayos , improvisacion sin inspiracion ... .esto es lo que podemos escuchar en este album..ya se que muchos diran que son genialidades del maestro , que el oido comun no esta a su altura y que se yo ... yo soy de los que aman a zappa , pero tambien tengo oidos y el criterio musical suficiente para advertir un bodrio ... ya se que esta lowell george , que estan los mothers..y que ? ? esto no es una genialidad..es solo un paso en falso , una busqueda inconclusa..no busquemos explicaciones complejas a lo sencillo ... este disco es un rejunte de material , desprolijo , mediocre , irregular..solo dos canciones podrian reconocer este formato , lo demas son inspirados y sarcasticos titulos con ruido de fondo ... ..no lo disfracemos de arte incomprendido ... .nadie va a discutir la genialidad del gran frank zappa , pero como todos nosotros , fue humano y tambien la pifiaba , seamos honestos ... una obra para coleccionistas , nada mas..	-1
I think that the positive reviews of this album have more to do with the happy memories it brings some of the reviewers than its actual musical content . Listened to today , the humor is heavy-handed and unfunny , the skits are annoying , and Flo and Eddie are unbearably irritating , whether they 're singing or attempting to make jokes with a very snide and unpleasant Zappa . A self-satisfied , smug feeling of & quot ; Are n't we so clever , making fun of pop music ! & quot ; permeates this disc . It 's mean-spirited , snide and unfunny . I like a lot of Frank 's work , and when he was at his best he could be very funny . This is n't his best work . Most unforgivably , the Mothers sound very tame and rote , with valuable playing time surrendered to the tiresome Flo and Eddie , whose appeal eternally escapes me . I gave this a chance long ago and it has n't grown on me since . Give this a pass and get one of Frank 's classics instead , like & quot ; Hot Rats & quot ; or & quot ; Apostrophe. & quot ;	-1
When it comes to Zappa , I am a dissenter . His early stuff has its place in rock history ; `` Hot Rats '' is a minor landmark in jazz-rock fusion . After that , I find absolutely nothing to like about what he did . As satire , it 's half-baked ; as music , it 's just a conglomeration of pop junk ( ... ) that is supposed to make some kind of statement -- what , exactly , pray tell , would that be ? That pop music is dreck to be recycled in Zappa 's lab ? I do n't believe I have ever needed Frank Zappa to tell me that most pop music is worthless ; I knew that already . But pop music is worthless in a way that can sometimes approximate worth . Phil Spector 's productions would be an example . Phil Spector believed in what he was doing ; Frank Zappa did not . Zappa thought he was above popular music , a strange and lame attitude . The CD under review is often cited as one of his best efforts , merging `` jazz-rock '' `` sophistication '' with `` humor . '' I am no geek in some comic-book shop , and I do not find `` Going to Montana to find some dental floss '' funny . This is sophomoric , arid music for disengaged pseuds . Zappa 's libertarian `` satire '' is not a part of my world , and neither are his attempts at `` serious '' music -- half-digested Varese and Stravinsky and Ives . Three minutes of Captain Beefheart is worth all of Zappa 's catalog . Who was it who said that , for all Zappa knew about music , he lacked the talent to write a song as good as `` Louie Louie '' ?	-1
I bought Overnight Sensation under the impression that Frank Zappa was a witty satirist and an outstanding experimental guitarist . Only one song ( & quot ; I 'm the Slime & quot ; ) even relatively meets his reputation . The rest of the album consists of trashy , unamusing novelty songs ( & quot ; Dinah-Moe Hum & quot ; & quot ; Dirty Love & quot ; ) or tracks too senseless to even warrant that modest title ( & quot ; Fifty-Fifty & quot ; & quot ; Montana & quot ; ) . The guitar-playing is sublime , laid-back and funky . Unlike the songwriting , it is acceptable , but nothing any two-bit hack , leftover from the psychedelic movement could not do . Did I buy the wrong album ? Is Mr. Zappa really that overrated ?	-1
Just have to toss in my 2 pennies . This was one of my favorite records growing up -- I loved it . I was happy to learn it was coming out on CD , but the horrible , warbling , operatic vocals are terrible . ... Ruined ... ruined . Give it two stars only because of the memories of its former glory ...	-1
So far , Zappa 's most boring album in my collection to date . Starts out strong , then turns into a sophomoric snicker fest that no one but the artist would relate to . Uninvolved , musically speaking . Only worth borrowing from a friend for the title track and `` Catholic Girls '' , both of which can probably be found live in a better form , and hopefully around better material . After that , theres groupies , machine sex , and a world without music . Im sure The Master was trying to make a statement here , but in the end , youre not moved to care . You can almost tell Zappa knows its a tossoff . A three album tossoff , to boot .	-1
This CD has some great songs , and it also has some songs that just sound horrible . The bass drum sounds the same as the YAWYI CD , a notched low end EQ . That 's about all they did . I mean , some songs on here have the most annoying guitar sound , with really annoying compressed drums . Yuk , it is mostly a sonic mess , aside from horsie and stucco .	-1
The Zappa repertoire is almost universally good . I own EVERY ONE OF THEM ... all 74 releases . Yet try as I might , I can not manage to appreciate this one . It 's difficult to believe that someone who gave us such gems as Hot Rats , One Size Fits All , and Uncle Meat put something like this out the door.I 'm sure some folks enjoy Frank Zappa only for his biting satire . If so , you might appreciate this album . However , do not buy it for it 's musical content . It starts out nowhere , and stays there.There are those who will tell you that the material Frank recorded in his last 10-15 years falls well short of his previous work . I admit some disappointment that Frank chose to release live remakes of the old stuff instead of composing much new material . However , some of his best material was released during this period , and often the live music delivers a fresh perspective on what was already great . In addition , such gems as The Yellow Shark , Civilization Phase III , and the LSO series show that he could still deliver with the best of them if he wanted to.Unfortunately , this album is not a shining moment in music , but a chance for Frank to flip the symbolic finger to a few remaining ghosts . If you want satire , you CAN have it and music , too ( try & quot ; You Are What You Is & quot ; ) . This album , along with & quot ; Francesco Zappa , & quot ; is a rare display of self-indulgent tripe from someone who will otherwise be remembered as a master of late 20th-century music .	-1
Downright silly . Not interesting musically , technically or regarding sund quality . Only thing of erit is the liner notes . Do n't buy it unless you 're a completist ! ! ! I am , but I never listen to it .	-1
ShutUp'N Play yer Guitar was/is brilliant .This 'follow up ' is a failure .Whackerman is a great drummer for the Songs in the shows , but we 're missing the amazing effects Coliauta and Zappa got going on the earlier album . Thunes is a hopeless throb throughout . His tone is poor , unlike the bass sound on SUAPYG .Here , most of the solos are just 'snatches ' from songs . One or two nice moments , but they are isolated among a lot of plodding dross ( mainly Thunes ) . ... .. waaay tooo much coffee and cigarettes . BTW , maybe the ZappaFamilyTrust could handle the Hendrix catalogue too ?	-1
I am a big fan of Frank Zappa which is why I took the `` Sarcasm Can Only Go So Far '' review with a grain of salt . However , after buying and listening to this CD I can honestly say that that assesment was right on the money.Though I 'm a big fan of his , I found myself hoping this CD would get better after each track . The two stars are for the beautiful rendition of the jazz standard `` Stolen Moments '' and the following `` Murder By Numbers '' with Sting on guest vocals . In my opinion FZ 's `` Bongo Fury '' and `` Live In New York '' are much , much better live recordings than this one .	-1
Up until recently , I had no Elvis in my collection . He 's one of my 2nd tier artists , but I do like him . I 've just been holding off for all the other stuff I really , really want . As soon as I saw these new 'originals ' come out , the first thing I did was go out and buy the Rhino issues with all the bonus tracks as I assume they would dissappear in favor of these . Good move on my part . I really liked all the other stuff you got and they sounded all great . I bought Armed Forces , Get Happy , and Years ' Model . I had held off on Aim is True , mostly because I was not nearly as impressed with the bonus tracks as I was on the others . Also , geez , this album has got to be the most over played since Dark Side of the Moon . Needless to say I was thrilled when I found , the ALL NEW - NOT YET ON AMAZON - DELUXE ISSUE OF AIM IS TRUE . It contains extra outtakes not found on the Rhino issue , plus an entire 2nd disk of a 1977 live show and soundcheck . However , it did not contain the 'honky tonk ' demos that are on the Rhino issue . Now , keep in mind that this deluxe issue is put out by the same company that put out this new 'original ' as they call it , HIP-O/UNIVERSAL so I assume it sounds the same as the deluxe issue . I still have not heard the Rhino issue of this , however I had no problems at all with the sound of the other 3 CDs . This Hip-O issue is just awful . There is a lot of high-midrange/treble distortion in the recording . The demos on the Deluxe issue also have it which suggests something wrong . Add to this Watching the Detectives is particularly butchered as it suffers from that awful imbalence between the loud and quiet parts you get with bad mastering sometimes . The instruments and vocals all sound like they are in the background and the loud parts , like when it goes ' ... And They Shoot Shoot Shoot ... ' just jumps out at you real loud . It sucks something bad . However , the good news is that the bouus disk on this new deluxe issue has the entire LP live , except I 'm Not Angry . And - get this - the sound quality on the live stuff is far superior to the studio stuff , which tells you there is something wrong with this recroding . Keep in mind I am assuming this 'original ' sounds the same as my deluxe issue of this , as Hip-0 put out both . I sampled here and yes , I hear the mid-range distortion , even thru cheap head phones . I could n't get a sample of the Rhino issue , but I assume it 's far superior to this . I wonder if all the CDs in this series sound this bad . If so , I assume it 's going to be a long time before we see a decent issue unless Rhino comes to rescue . I am very seriously even considering buying the Rhino issue , even with all the duplication ( although I would get the Honky Tonk ' demos ) just to have a decent recording of this LP . Or maybe I 'll just listen to it live from now on on the bonus disk . Stay away from this issue . Get the Rhino . Buy the new deluxe only for the bonus live show . Only pay rock bottom .	-1
& quot ; Why Do n't You Love Me ( Like You Used to Do ? ) & quot ; and & quot ; How Much I 've Lied & quot ; -- the tunes that open and close this collection , respectively -- are bold , affecting interpretations ; but the ones that come between them are misguided , poorly performed horrors . The whole thing 's like bad sandwhich : tasty bread , but the middle 's just junk food ... .	-1
This record was probably the beginning of the end for Costello the conflicted song conqueror . Apparantly his television duet with George Jones ( the b-side Stranger in the House ) pumped a bit too much Nashville into his veins . The songs on this album , which have worked for countless other American singers , do n't gel with Costello 's voice or his band The Attractions ' style . Add hack production from country veteran Billy Sherrill and this compilation ends up completely disasterous . It 's a pity , because Costello was coming off such a huge record with & quot ; Imperial Bedroom & quot ; only to release this mess . Perhaps if Elvis had used a country band ala Clover ( from My Aim is True ) there 's a chance he may have been more insprired . But Englishmen simply can not & quot ; do & quot ; country , not even the gifted Declan MacManus . Besides , if he wanted to release a C & amp ; W record , he would have been better off using the excellent & quot ; King of America & quot ; to support this desire . That album , which featured Americans James Burton and Ron Tutt , contained all original material and displayed the flair and performance Costello seemingly always strives for . The & quot ; Almost Blue & quot ; outing is a muddy and boring mess . The reason I say this is Costello , when covering a tune , usually matches or betters the performance of the original artist . In each of these examples , he falls miserably short . Poorly planned and poorly executed , & quot ; Almost Blue & quot ; may serve as an adequate primer for the unsophisticated new wave listener unfamiliar with country , but for those who have heard the originals , it 's pretty painful . I think even Elvis Costello would have to agree with that assessment .	-1
Prior to this , Elvis Costello made a series of rock records of such brilliance as to inspire the pursuit of a musical career in many of those who heard them . This album is a slap in the face to those people as well as to authentic country music performers who come from places like Birmingham , Alabama instead of Birmingham , West Midlands . This is a narcissistic , self-indulgent musical vanity project of the worst kind - an idea as stupid as Loretta Lynn rapping or Sean Combs attempting to sing Ella Fitzgerald or Roberta Flack songs . The more you like his first records the more you 'll hate this one - do n't waste your money .	-1
I admit Elvis Costello 's body of work is horrible , but he does have one good song in his hole catalog and it 's on this album . `` The Only Flame In Town '' is by far his best song and is his only song that is worth mentioning to this date ( I ca n't see him writing anything in the future to change this ) , but this song is a keeper . Daryl Hall sings the backing vocals on this track which adds some talent to a otherwise untalented individual and song . Listen to this track and you will see that Evis Costello has at least one good tune .	-1
Take some stale puns and rehashed jokes that would n't have made the cut on Saturday Night Live , a guitarist who thinks playing fast is playing well , a second-rate band that ca n't decide if it 's rock or jazz , and you 've got Frank Zappa . He was a trailblazer for freedom of speech and I admire him for that . But if you want funny , try Loudon Wainwright .	-1
Sorry all you dudes who will flip over this but Using God 's name that way over and over is childish and ignorant ! Like the uneducated idiots that ca n't make a sentence without a foul word in it.Seriously guys its unintelligent ! ! !	-1
I ca n't do justice to this recording , because there are two considerations here : the performance and the principal work , of which this is the `` premier recording '' . How I looked forward to getting my hands on it ! And how crest-fallen I was when I actually heard it . I ca n't blame the performers ; they really try hard and the recording is stunningly life-like . But this review has to be advice to a buyer who has not heard this work.Bax 's Violin Concerto has not enjoyed much favour among either violinists or audiences . Unfortunately this can not put this down to mere prejudice . Anyone listening to the first 2 minutes of the work is instantly arrested by a glorious tapestry of orchestral colours and bold rhythms : but when the violin enters , it takes only another 2 minutes to realise that Bax seems not to have understood the violin as a concerto instrument . All the interest is focused on variety in the orchestra ; the violin goes mostly through the motions of playing figures ; and by the end of the first section ( entitled `` Overture '' ) we are wondering when it is going to have its moment in the sun with an equally splendid , melodious episode . It never comes . In fact , the violin has hardly anything really deep and meaningful to say throughout the whole composition . The work is notably poor in melodic invention , and the few we hear thrive predominantly on the orchestra 's instruments.Structurally the work is a catastrophe . The first movement is in three section that make a miniature concerto by themselves . But the sections are 3 episodes ; they do not add up to a coherent whole . It 's all very rhapsodic , glued together from disparate materials . The Ballad in the middle is so corny that one feels embarrassed . The last section is a poor shadow of the first . By then you have given up all hope of hearing the violin utter something important to justify its inclusion in this `` concerto '' .The other two movements give the appearance of being tacked on . Even now , in the slow movement , your hope for a lovely melody on the violin is disappointed . Nice pastel colours in the orchestra , as well as some tunefulness , but nothing worth writing home about for the soloist . Her `` melody '' is once again feeble , technical and repetitive , compared to the care lavished on the accompaniment.The final movement promises something spirited in its first bars ( like the very first entry of the violin in the first movement ) ; but yet again this exhausts itself in technical flurries within a minute ; yet again the violin plays only a subsidiary role as the proceedings unfold . Once you have heard her `` melody '' three times , it 's no longer melodious , but just a failed `` tune '' . Looking back over the whole , the frequent drafts on `` folksy '' irish tunes just do n't sit well in this over-elaborate and sumptuous orchestral score.Lydia Mordkovitch discharges her ungrateful duties as well as they permit . But the truth is , that for a fiddler there is nothing to love in this concerto . The fiddler is literally a hungry orphan looking at an immensely rich bill of fare for everyone else . In fact , one would have to say that in this `` violin '' concerto , the violin intrudes too much and spoils a symphonic poem that might have made a splendid half hour of music.The rest of the album - well , it 's a pity . It will probably be re-issued somewhere else , as this violin concerto also spoils another record where the attraction is the cello concerto .	-1
This Harris 3 could have been great , but is actually a total let-down as I will explain . The Chandos recording quality is lovely.The Detroit orchestra are clearly very good-much more polished than Alsop 's band . However the big problem is that Jarvi rushes through this wonderful piece like he has a pending hair appointment.He has no understanding of the melancholy which underlies this music ( which Bernstein fully understands ) .The first few minutes are just way too fast , and his very generalised phrasing washes over many details and subtleties of the score.Admittedly he is not bad at the latter part ie . the fugue and concluding section but the preceding pages make this version a no-no.Listen to him then to Mata or Alsop and you will see that I mean.I was really disappointed with this disc as it was a missed opportunity because of the orchestra.Alsop ( on Naxos ) and Mata ( Dorian ) have much better tempos and bring out well the details of the score . Alsop is great re . the actual interpretation . She phrases naturally and warmly and lets the music speak for itself unlike her teacher Bernstein in his later DG account where everything is just too weighty and molto expressivo-he almost plays it like Mahler 9 and it just does'nt work here ( I love Mahler by the way ) .The Ny Phil are of course great but everything is too overblown ( including the sound ) and the blowsy brass sound like they are trying to outdo each other . The problem is Alsop has the opposite problem-a regional orchestra that just do n't have the weight ( strings are thin ) or collective body to project this score.The orchestra just sounds too lightweight.If she had conducted the NY Phil or Detroit Orch . instead of the Colorado Orch ( good as they are ) her version would have been wonderful , although her Fugue is a bit too fast and light for my liking.Mata is also excellent with a better orchestra ( Dallas ) than Alsop 's and a 'classical ' reading , not overblown at all , which really does work for this music . Problem here is that Mata is just a bit too matter-of-fact and straitlaced for the first few minutes until the famous pastoral wispy strings bit ( you know the bit ! ) where it all takes off.In other words all of these 3 versions all are flawed ( though the Jarvi is by far the worst ) .As I said Bernstein 's later live version ( DG ) of 1985 is too overblown and bogged down , and thus the opposite to Jarvi.However-Bernstein 's conducting of the opening ( cellos ) is really beautiful and heartfelt and the best of all the versions I have heard.If only he had'nt gone just too 'emotional ' for the rest of it.Also the DG live recording is overblown and a bit lifeless ( probably cause of the audience ) . Readers may now think it strange I have n't mentioned what many consider the best version ! ie . Bernstein CBS recording of 1961.That 's because I have n't heard it ( its been on order for ages by the way ! ) I realise this may go to no . 1 in my estimation when I do hear it judging from reviews I have read.Hopefully it will as the others are not perfect at all . But I have heard the other versions above many times in order to come to a fair conclusion for this review . Mata wins ( just ) , with Alsop and Bernstein DG joint second , and Jarvi way behind ( only due to Jarvi himself not the orchestra ) .	-1
I have been a loyal fan of Steve Roach 's work since 1987 , when I discovered `` Dreamtime Return '' ( which I still consider his best recording -- ever ) , but `` Well of Souls '' is the exception to his otherwise brilliant explorations into the subconscious using carefully constructed musical waveforms and subsonic rhythms . This particular recording is utterly creepy , unearthly , macabre-something that malevolent spirits would relish . It is not for relaxing after a hard day , trying to feel better or 'enlightening the spirit . ' On the contrary , I found it quite disturbing , eerie and rife with bent pitches , like I had unknowingly been imprisoned in the dark areas of my mind -- areas that I cared not to revisit . `` Well of Souls '' put me in a state of complete apprehension , bordering somewhere between fear and a surreal sense of paranoia.I retained it for two years , hoping it would grow on me , but the fact is that I was relieved to have purged it from my collection . It has nothing to do with being faint hearted , it 's just that it 's void of melody and I ca n't use it for anything positive , like Roach 's other albums , that I use to unwind , relax and fall asleep . It reminded me of Robert Rich 's gloomy and preternatural `` Stalker , '' something else that did not have one positive melody or agreeable chord , only bent pitches and twisted notes that sounded like -- hell . I apologize if you might find that unhelpful , but I ca n't sugar coat this one.A good alternative to `` Well of Souls '' is an ambient collection called `` Inner Space '' volumes 1 and 2 , where you can get nearly 130 minutes of excellent ambience and electronica for only about $ 12.00 , along with `` Dreamtime Return '' ( 1987 ) , `` Desert Solitaire '' ( 1988 , performed with Kevin Braheny ) , or even `` On Ritual Ground '' ( 1990 , re-released in 2002 ) . `` Quiet Music '' ( 1988 ) would go so far as to pull me out of the `` Well of Souls '' while not shaking my consciousness to the core.It made me realize that not all places in the subconscious were meant to be explored . I do n't care how you feel about it , I was so glad just to get out of there . When you escape from hell , the rest of your life is all gravy.I do not look at or respond to comments , no offense .	-1
The audacity of these respected talented musicians to depict a cross falling off of a church is unbearable . That visual image speaks volumes toward what this project is about . 'Enigma ' passed off the same type of anti christian imagry on their first CD . 'Enigma ' who ? Yea right . You can find their dried carcass lying in a NYC drain sewer.What sort of sublime interludes lie buried below the threshold of perception on this CD ? Wave fronts of sound , subsonic rhythms . . . . blah blah blasphemy.We admired your music sir . Immersion : Three we 'Dream Factory ' dubbed you as the Mark Rothko of ambient music . Now we shall not tolerate you . We erase our accolades and dub you outcast in our Christian community.Specifically the cover art is a painting by a Michael McCullough titled `` Figures from the Ancestors '' . That is nebulous enough . But the image sure is direct . A church with its cross falling in the background while an ominous dark totem figure dominates the foreground . No need for further interpretation ? Then onto the back cover where said church stands without the cross .	-1
This is new ageish music : sound textures , & quot ; relaxing & quot ; , bells-and-whistles ( quite literally ) , etc . Common words used in titles are & quot ; sacred & quot ; , & quot ; forbidden & quot ; , & quot ; magical & quot ; , & quot ; beyond & quot ; , & quot ; esoteric & quot ; etc . In my humble opinion this is perfect music for airports or shopping malls ; which is not necessarily an insult . Is music aimed at calming you down when you 're anxious , putting you in a good mood to buy that particular pair of trousers , or making you a more & quot ; spiritual & quot ; person . It 's not music for the sake of music . Rather , it uses exotic effects to please the listener . The labels Projekt and Wyndham Hill are the champions of this approach . Maybe & quot ; ambient & quot ; music is a dangerous territory , where true innovators stand next to genre exploiters . Among the former I 'd put Riley , La Monte Young , Glass ( some of it ) , Reich , Tangerine Dreams , Eno , Aphex Twin , Future Sound of London , Autechre , mu-Ziq , Squarepusher ; among the latter an infinite number of would-be artists . Summing up , If you like any of the above artists or dislike kitch music , then do n't buy this set . If you like & quot ; Celestine 's Prophecy & quot ; , Gibran 's & quot ; Prophet & quot ; or any Wyndham/Projekt artist , then go for it .	-1
Lycia enjoys a small but devoted following . They employ a style of acoustic guitar and mellow keyboards layered harmonically with the beautiful vocals of Mike and Tara VanPortfleet . The effect is to produce haunting , pensive images and stories reminiscent of Dead Can Dance , or some of Pink Floyd 's early acoustic work . However , what I could n't get past was the total lack of percussion in their work . This is quiet , brooding music , but it barely seems to move at times . The advice I would give a 1st time shopper for their titles ? Listen carefully before you buy . Lycia is like a ghost ship that never leaves the port .	-1
I recently reviewed Kansas 1978 live album Two For The show calling it probably the best live album of all time . And with that pleasant rosy feeling and memory I came to buy Live At The Whisky . If Two For the Show is a candidate for the best of all time then one can only call Live At The Whisky a candidate for the worst . This is a truly awful live performance from a band once noted for great live performances.My main over-riding criticism , and one that is pertinent to every track on the album is pointed directly at Steve Walsh 's voice . Its gone , and not just slightly . He strains , squacks , croaks , grinds and makes himself painfully hoarse trying to reach notes in classic songs he can longer reach and indeed embarrassingly fails to reach upon trying on many occasions . And its painful to listen to how a once great singer has fallen , a long , long way . Walsh once had one of the greatest voices in rock - with Two For The Show proving he could sustain his incredible power and range during concerts and not just the studio . It 's very sad but true.My other main criticism is with the band 's performance itself and production . It 's a 'going through the motions ' performance from a band standing very much in the shadows of the once great spotlight they stood in . And its not helped by the fact that key band members Kerry Livgren and Robbie Steinhardt are missing , although Livgren does make a guest appearance at the very end for Carry On Wayward Son . In fact only a deteriorated Walsh , Williams and Ehart survive from the original line up.This album came as a great disappointment even though I should have suspected Walsh 's vocal ability was finished from his performance on In The Spirit Of Things ( see my review on this site ) .If you do n't own Two For The Show or the King Biscuit Flower Hour live recordings then get these instead , both are superior with Two For The Show being simply incredible . It should also be noted that the Live Dust In The Wind CD is just a cut down version of Live At The Whiskey with 2 tracks having been removed.Definitely one for hardcore completists.Recommendation to avoid .	-1
This stuff really swings . These are the original recordings . But , RCA has done such a crummy job trying to clean this material up , that it sounds like the band is down the hall , in a gymnasium .	-1
A decent little collection that features a talented artist with a pleasant voice.My only complaint is that I really did n't like her version of a 1964 Beatles ' classic . That was and remains one of my favorite songs and I was dismayed by her rendition of it . She is not in the same league as the Beatles , who are an unrivalled , nonpareil band . The Beatles are the best !	-1
During the mid to late seventies , Lou Rawls , the voice of cool smooth soul , bought us the hits of `` you 'll never find another love '' and `` lady love '' . I ca n't believe that out of the many Rawls discs on here , that there is not one compilation that contains both these hits , not even one of them . Big Red Cross for Curb / M C A / B M G ? . I guess the people responsible for his catalogue will score it better next time .	-1
It 's 1/6/06 -- Lou Rawls died today , and what a loss . I 'm sure many people will be visiting this site to order his music . AVOID THIS ALBUM ! If it were just titled `` Lou Rawls '' it would be fine . But to say this was his `` GREATEST HITS '' is a downright lie . It 's a good album ( anything with his voice would be ) , but do n't let the title fool you . Read everyone else 's comments and believe what they say . There are other great CDs here . This ai n't one of them .	-1
First off , this is a budget priced CD from Rawls ' early work ( no 70 's hits , ) which would be fine because it 's fairly cheap and has classics like `` Your Good Thing ... '' and `` Love is a Hurtin ' Thing . `` What absolutely can not be excused is the fact that neither `` Dead End Street '' nor it 's monologue are actually on this CD . This is despite the front cover , back cover , CD label and the liner notes ( TWICE ! ) Whatever label bosses were responsible for this rip-off should never work in the industry again . Period . Rawls deserves better .	-1
This CD features the original duo , but these are re-recordings of their songs , NOT the original sixties recordings . Do n't buy this unless you must have every recording the group ever made .	-1
This was an impulse purchase , and like other reviewers I 've been regretting my haste . Not only would my fellow reviewers have saved me the eight bucks I spent on this , I have an excellent source that would have warned me as well . I have a copy of Pat Downey 's THE GOLDEN AGE OF TOP 40 MUSIC ON COMPACT DISC . It 's already failry dated ( it was published in 1992 ) , but here 's what it has to say about UNCHAINED MELODY ( Curb 77381 ) : '' Unchained Melody '' : This is a rerecoding . `` You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' '' : This is the original . [ At least the book SAYS it is , but it obviously is not ! ] '' ( You 're My ) Soul and Inspiration '' : It does not say it is a rerecording , but it notes that it is 15 seconds longer than either the original 45 or LP version . [ However , it should be noted that it says this longer version also appears on the Verve VERY BEST OF and Rhino ANTHOLOGY collections as well . ] '' Ebb Tide '' : This is a rerecording . `` Just Once in My Life '' : This is a rerecording.Bottom line ? These are certainly competent renditions of some of The Righteous Brothers biggest hits . However , if you 're looking for the originals , save your money and look elsewhere .	-1
... and thank the good lord for that , because a little of this pap goes a lonnnnng way . I am always amazed when people talk about the 1950s being innocent times , or the 1960s , or the 1940s . Innocent ? Maybe we should instead say naive . Because only the 50s and 60s would buy into Dino 's & quot ; drunk 'n ' fun & quot ; act.With a contemporary ear , one can hear Dino 's & quot ; I do n't give a damn , & quot ; his & quot ; screw the fans , & quot ; his & quot ; I just do n't care. & quot ; We can hear all that now , and it is 100 % sickening .	-1
( dollar amount ) bucks for a cd is really cheap , right ? Well , that 's about what you will get . ( dollar amount ) bucks worth of re-makes . Giving it one star is one star too many . Okay , maybe it is n't all that bad , but the album should really be titled `` Best Remakes of Rick Nelson '' At least that way you will know what you are paying for . There is a positive side however . The cd will never wear out because it wo n't come out of the case more than once or twice .	-1
This is just a rip of JUDY AND LIZA AT THE LONDON PALLEDIUM.Buy the original concert it 's a lot more value for money .	-1
It is fair to say that the material contained on this album is pleasing enough to listen to , and maybe , in Brazil , these sides were local hits ( although this is doubtful ) , but the fact of the matter remains that it was not until Mendes put together Brazil'66 and put out albums on the A & M label that he actually had hit records ... To say the these are '' greatest hits '' is to be deliberately deceptive ... These are early sides , recorded when Mendes and his band were local artists..Sure , they sound similiar to his later , hit sides , but , afterall , it was essentially the same band with the same personel ... So if you actually remember any of these obscure sides , or if you are a Mendes completist , this is something that you will want to own , HOWEVER , if you are looking for the artist at his peak then fast-forward to BRAZIL'66 , and there you will find the real '' greatest hits '' ...	-1
I 'm a huge Hank Sr. fan . The political views you expressed on ESPN reflect extreme racist narrow minded stupidity on your part .

Well this is what I really expected . Not saying it 's bad , or good , but just too much lightweight for my blood . `` This Diamond Ring '' well it 's been overplayed , but still a good song , and even though Al Kooper did n't have Gary in mind when writing it it 's still a good version anyway . However , there 's some real trash on here , and `` Count Me In '' is at the top of the heap , and that 's not good , `` Clown '' is next , `` Sure Going To Miss Her '' , and `` Green Grass '' . However , `` Sealed With A Kiss '' was not a good version either . However , it 's not a good song anyway , but to put strings on it ; that made it worse . Now for some other good stuff `` My Heart 's Story '' is really good unfortunately , I only had a 30 second sample of the song , and then there 's the song I heard on AM radio in Honolulu , HI. , and it made me feel so cool in the convertible at age 23 , and that 's `` She 's Just My Style '' . That is a song that even if it was released a year later in 1967 I think it would still be excellent . I can just easily say that Gary had his father 's influence , and power for getting into show business , but I 'm not going to . Gary as far as I 'm concerned has the talent to make it on his own , and he 's proven it by his comeback in 1985 , and still going today , but I just wished he would rock it up a little more , and see what the other side of `` She 's Just My Style '' could be like .	-1
I agree with & quot ; KANDILICIOUS ' How can you possible have a & quot ; Best Of ' without & quot ; MISDEMEANOR & quot ; and & quot ; FOOLS PARADISE & quot ; . What were the people who produced this CD thinking ? Who are they trying to fool ? Anyone who grew up listening to the Sylver 's will know that this CD is not worth adding to their & quot ; Old School & quot ; collection .	-1
This CD is a bunch of remakes and not even very good ones ! I have no idea why Bob Welch would rerecord these great songs but this is the result . The sound is not good and his vocals are weak . Do not order this CD unless you are into disappointment because that 's what i got . I had no idea that this was a CD of remakes because the description does not indicate this . i played spinets of each song and then wanted to toss it in the trash.BAD BAD BAD ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
You have I hope read the other reviews on this CD `` Greatest Songs : Come and Get Your Love '' . These are not the versions of the songs by Redbone . It is not even Redbone so there is not much else to add except my one star ( and that I feel is being generous ) to this CD and suggest if you are looking for a greatest hits CD of Redbone to get instead `` The Essential Redbone . You can read my review on this in Amazon . Even thought that CD leaves a couple of Redbone 's best songs off it is still a great collection of their music that will please any fan of Redbone or be a good introduction to anyone not familiar with the group .	-1
Yes , a nice selection of songs , but the sound quality is no better than grotesque !	-1
COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER ! THIS CD ALMOST SUCKS ! BUT HOLD ON A MINUTE ! I ` M HER BIGGEST FAN , BUT THIS IS MY LEAST FAVORETE ALBUM BY HER !	-1
What you have here it the single most worst cd ever made.How someone thought it was a good idea to take Hank Sr. 's low-fi mono recordings , peel off his voice and put it in modern , digital stereo surrounding is beyond me.Imagine Hank Jr. singing a line , then a great guitar solo , then Hank III taking a vocal turn , then a guitar solo , then Hank Sr. coming in with vocals that seem to come off an lp that was found lying in the gravel somewhere at a flea market.It is beyond bad . Not a good idea , and nothing like & quot ; There 's a Tear in My Beer. & quot ;	-1
Granted this young woman displayed a great set of pipes on the single & quot ; Blue. & quot ; But who is responsible for the sappy song selection and over-the-top production that runs throughout this nauseating disc ? UGGHH ! ! !	-1
This was n't a good followup to Blue to me . It would have helped if LeAnn Rimes did n't sing too LOUD on this one ! While the emphasis is on inspirational songs , the music comes off as overproduced , overblown and LeAnn tries to pull off her own Celine Dion by overdoing it a third on most of the ballads.Even the remake of Debbie Boone 's overplayed You Light Up My Life comes off as limp . The listening performance comes off as as disturbing and misconceived , not inspiring at all as the album title wants you to believe . It 's like LeAnn was pressured to get a record out on the market after the massive success of Blue . Would have been better if she sang an album of new material instead back in 1997 .	-1
Is it just me or is there a studio problem with this album ? I can hear a jarring , screeching noise accompanying the music , especially with the `` The Rose '' track , which makes it impossible to appreciate an otherwise excellent album I 'm sure .	-1
They were never really good musicians and they did n't hang together very long . So it 's sort of a twist on the old joke Woody Allen uses at the end of Annie Hall -- Two woman in a restaurant complaining that the food tastes bad and one says , `` And the portions are so small . '' That 's the deal with Moby Grape . One of them was friends with Neil Young for a bit and one of them Marty Balin talked into being the drummer in the first incarnation of Jefferson Airplane ( he did n't play drums at the time and left Airplane to form the Grape ) . Sometimes the right collection of so-so musicians can create something better than the parts or the whole , it just sort sounds good ( Credence Clearwater Revival comes to mind , Crazy Horse with Neil Young ) but often it does n't despite even momentary brushes with fame ( Iron Butterfly , Vanilla Fudge , Moby Grape ) ; sometimes it 's just mediocrity with a hook.Jammin ' was the rage when these records were made and jammin ' was done way too often by way too many performers -- ultimately becoming a performance art parody of itself with 20 minute and longer drum solos by drummers much less proficient than , say , Ginger Baker ) . Worse , since the performers and the listeners often lacked the musical discipline of jazz or the musical background of say a good musician , chemical additives ( for the audience and the band ) were sometimes needed to get any wow from the music . So , if you might need to buy more than the record to enjoy the record -- not that I recommend this . Generally , these disks are a collection of not very good musicians with not very many good ideas , which they execute not very well.There were mostly , and most widely known in their day for the cover of their first album on which a casually flipped bird was airbrushed out by the record company , something everyone knew so the airbrushing actually heightened interest -- nowadays this is not such a daring prank and the photo is left without the airbrushing.Listen for the nostalgia if you can arrange the right circumstances . But even then , borrow from a friend or a streaming service unless you are an avid and eccentric collector .	-1
Country Joe and The Fish 's earlier albums - `` Electric Music For The Mind And Body '' & `` I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die '' - evidence a group that was capable of integrating an extraordinary hybrid of styles - from R & B ; through heavy blues , rock & roll , folk , eastern raga and the whole mixture of Bay Area influences of the time - to produce gloriously innovative music . And , while it was the jug-band protest of `` I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die '' and the funky R & B ; of `` Rock And Soul Music '' that captured the headlines through through their appearance at Woodstock , it 's the psychedelic masterpieces on these first two albums that makes them stand-out as a totally unique West Coast band.But then ... rather than developing the musical ideas and imagery of their earlier works , `` Together '' sees them lose the plot . With its concentration on social and political commentary - sometimes embarrassingly and in the case of Rock And Soul Music , the most played track on the album , unsuccessfully ( it was in fact a send-up of the R & B ; and Soul scene rather than a celebration of it ) - the resulting album is disjointed and , with the exception of `` Susan '' , devoid of the psychedelia that their repuation had been built on.As an extension of their jug-band roots it makes some sense but as an extension of the barrier-bending music on their earlier albums it fails . A great disappointment at the time and , with time , not much better .	-1
This mess of a collection has only one quality - it 's so short with most songs checking in at less than 2min 30s . This must be Evan 's relative who is involved because it sure ai n't him . British athlete Suzanne Dando showed more musical prowess than this cd of garage band scraps . Hate your friends - them send them this .	-1
Again this early work has little of its latter counterpart 's quality . My first taste of them was & quot ; Plaster Caster & quot ; and I remember feeling greatly underwhelmed . At this sounds like the a band who deserve an audience larger than just their friends and family . Of course it lacks Evan 's unifying vision that he could demonstate later . This copy includes a ruff n ready version of & quot ; Luka & quot ; live - as well as a short Dutch interview where Evan sounds like he has come home to meet your parents - with a bemused interviewer . It also includes & quot ; Mallo Cup & quot ; which would be a welcome part of his later set list .	-1
I had this on cassette a long time ago and sorta liked it , but Red Krayola did Transparent Radiation first ... .many moons before Spacemen 3. and The 13th Floor Elevators did Rollercoaster first ... .many moons before Spacemen 3 ... .The singer here is no Roky Erickson , but is instead an over-ego-ed Brit with a whiny voice who maybe wanted to re-live an era he was n't born into . Odd that some rather obscure American music was ripped off for this & # 34 ; outing & # 34 ; . I ca n't listen to this crap anymore ... .pure poseurs ...	-1
these guys think they are SO important , that everyone cares what they have to say . Well you know what , they are obsolete and did more bad than good , just like all of punk music ! all you whiny people should just stop buying hair gel and get a real job . Or go get London Calling instead of this mop bucket slop ! !	-1
The Dead Kennedy 's had a pretty stellar discography with the classics fresh fruit and In god we trust under their belts . THey were young , fresh , and were one of the most interesting bands in the hardcore scene ... and then Frankenchrist came out . Jello was always political on his albums but he had a sense of humor to it and some interesting music to go along with it , but frankenchrist , was little more than a series of speeches/rants with some boring guitar riffs behind it . While Jello does have some interesting things to say ... they are n't on this album . Everything is exageratted so much that you stop taking him very seriousley and almost start thinking of him as some unremarkable conspiricy theorist . All and all this is a hard listen . Five minute rants with ( on this album at least ) an uninteresting , washed up jam band backign them does n't make for good music.. it makes for a boring dissapointment from a previousley great band.. avoid this album and Bedtime for Democracy unless you are a fanatic . If not.. Stick with Fresh Fruit , Plastic Surgery Disasters/in god we trust , Live at the Deaf Club , and The b-sides collection give me convenience or give me death they are much more interesting listens .	-1
I 'm still a huge DK fan and originally bought this as an LP in 1987 . I bought it on cd because I 'm a completist . Try as I may , I hate Bedtime . The lyrics and playing are great , but it just does n't stand up to the other releases . I wonder if the legal stuff and a contract resulted in a rushed album . I listened to it again a couple days ago with fresh ears and still hate it . The others ( including the live one ) are still great and relevant though . If you are new to DK and are wondering what to buy , get Fresh Fruit or Plastic Surgery Disasters- both are great examples of what DK were about . Avoid Bedtime though .	-1
Kerplunk ! came after 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours , before Green Day hooked up w/ Reprise Records , so it 's gon na be low quality . The vocals on some of the songs are goofy and unprofessional sounding ( Best thing in Town being an example . Ca n't even understand Billie Joe ) . So , I would n't recommend buying it . Get a bootleg or download it , 'cause this is low quality , neglecfully put together stuff .	-1
Most of these are re-renditions of the originals . Most people shopping for a CD like this would know right away upon hearing the samples that this CD is not what they 're looking for.Who has produced CDs with ALL ORIGINAL recordings ? This CD deserves zero stars .	-1
If you 're looking for some of the best TV themes created-of some of the best shows ever-volume two is probably the NUMBER ONE volume to get . Veering away from the shows of the 70s is not a bad move ( have you heard the jazz fusion tracks of `` Emergency ! `` , `` Medical Center '' , & `` Police Woman '' ? Yeesh ! ) This one is still a mixed bag ( I mean , let 's face it , there are only so many listenable themes ) , but this one is unique in that it has a number of those themes that were sung ( mainly westerns , like Bat Masterson , Maverick , and Rawhide , with better lyrics and melodies than , say , The Flintstones or Gilligan 's Island 's ballads ) , some of the best jazz-oriented lounge pieces , which are easily amongst the best and most listenable TV themes of all time ( The Avengers , The Saint , Route 66 , Green Hornet , Peter Gunn , The Pink Panther , Bewitched , The Honeymooners , Jonny Quest ) , and a number of the most complimentary TV themes , pointed toward the show 's own premise , sometimes with sound effects to boot ( Daktari , Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea-you really feel as if you 're coasting the lower fathoms , Rat Patrol , Twelve O'Clock High-emitting the wild blue yonder , Hogan 's Heroes-scored to a german march ) . As far as the reviews stating that a good number of these are remakes , if you pay attention to the awkwardness of sound quality from piece to piece , it 's quite evident that most of these have that non-restored sound ( and why would recreations not be better dubbed ? ) , cancelling out those reviews . Also , for those who believe that `` Bewitched '' and others have been modified somewhat , this is not the reason behind the additional notes . Some of these are actually the original scores , before they were cut to their shorter versions . With this in mind , it 's quite evident that `` The Avengers '' and `` Bewitched '' themes are best in their original format , as a full scoring , and not the trunkated versions used for the show . However , I can see where I would have maybe thought the same thing if I had n't known this information .	-1
This album did nothing groundbreaking except for to bring industrial music to the masses , but then again , this is n't even really industrial music , its more industrial pop , and other groups like Ministry and Nitzer Ebb were helping popularize industrial before PHM even.Many people cite this as one of the first industrial albums to use guitars too but it 's not either , Ministry and The Revolting Cocks were doing that much better , for several years beforehand , and basically every other Wax Trax ! artist was doing industrial in general better than Trent did on this album . Most other industrial did n't contain nearly as many cliche and bland lyrics as PHM either.It 's not bad , but the rap on & quot ; Down In It & quot ; in unintentionally hilarious , & quot ; The Only Time & quot ; is laughably bad , & quot ; Head Like A Hole & quot ; is not the amazing , punch of a track many seem to think it is , and the production sounds often weak . It is also one of the best examples of ultra-melodramatic , cheeseball goth industrial-lite / synth-pop at times.A few tracks , ( & quot ; Sanctified & quot ; , & quot ; Terrible Lie & quot ; , & quot ; Sin & quot ; ( althought the single version of 'Sin ' is ten times better ) , & quot ; Kinda ... & quot ; and & quot ; Ringfinger & quot ; ) are great , but really this is n't any better than any Ministry , RevCo , Nitzer Ebb , Depecche Mode , Skinny Puppy , Meat Beat Manifesto or any other similar artists ' albums . Trent fails by a long shot to improve on or to surpass these obvious influences . And this album does n't really stand out above any if many other industrial albums in the 14 years before it 's release when it comes down to it.So buy it if you like industrial , buy it if you 're a fan , just do n't expect a whole heaping lot of greatness .	-1
I had a sabbatical from NIN since 95 or so , and only recently went back and gave everything of Trent 's a fresh listen . It 's amazing what the years can do ; & quot ; Pretty Hate Machine & quot ; sounds not so far removed from the minor-key boy band stuff . Very , very weak , poor lyrics and most of the production is farmed out to old studio pros instead of Reznor going at it himself like he does these days . Only tracks for me are & quot ; Head Like a Hole & quot ; and & quot ; Down in It , & quot ; both muscular examples of tech-rock . Out of all NIN I personally recommend & quot ; Broken & quot ; -- concise and to the point , never wears out its welcome .	-1
I 'm not giving this two stars because the music is bad . Quite the contrary , this is wonderful stuff . However , one mix is the same as the album , and the other two are on the American version of the Head Like a Hole single . And you want HLAH . You NEED HLAH , if you 're a fan of the good ol ' days when NIN were THE groundbreaking rock and roll band . So forget this , and immediately go get that .	-1
While Pretty Hate Machine is a great album , it did n't really present us with anything new and amazing , electronic music was what the 1980 's was all about . But it did mark the beginning of Trent Reznor 's rise to stardom . While I do n't feel Sin is one of the stronger tracks on Pretty Hate Machine it was n't an altogether bad single either . My only complain is the alternative mixes on here are poor and not that much different ( were they mixes he did after the fact or were they mixes that were in contention for making it on Pretty Hate Machine ? ) However the cover of Get Down Make Love is great and the sole reason I bought the single . However I can not give it more than 2 stars , especially looking ahead at Fixed and Further Down The Spiral ( yes the two remix albums ) and The Downward Spiral for that matter .	-1
Who cares about the 3 versions of Sin - you can hear the song on the album . Having said that I quite like the Queen cover Get Down Make Love mainly for the production values of Al Jourgensen ( yes he 's Hypo Luxa ) . It 's still interesting and although Trent 's vocals almost ruin the song - the song is saved due to Al 's top production skills ( something Trent could use a hand with )	-1
This is a tough single for me , as I think virtually every review of this points out -- really , its quite the weakest of the `` Pretty Hate Machine '' era Nine Inch Nails single , primarily because of how awful the `` Sin '' remixes are , but in the midst of this is the , `` Get Down Make Love '' .The `` Sin '' mixes first though , remixed by Adrian Sherwood and Keith LeBlanc , who did a fine job with `` Down In It '' , this song really does n't match their techno beat restructuring , and in fact the aggression of the song is pretty much swallowed up in a programmed beat and irritating synth effects . The short version at least has the good sense to be brief , the dub mix carries on for several minutes with samples of `` LIES '' and `` CONTROL '' lifted from the song -- essentially five minutes of ok beats and really irritating synths . The long version feels somewhat better but is more or less the short version with part of the dub version spliced in the middle of it . The three mixes as a whole are totally unengaging and can be skipped.But `` Get Down Make Love '' though , this is the great missing early Nine Inch Nails piece , produced by Al Jourgenson , Reznor takes a fantastic Queen song and restructures it into his own vision , staying true to the original but at the same time fully claiming it as his own . The result is tense , exciting , and extremely well done , and really is worth the price of the single.My rating however is on the whole product , and as a whole , there 's not much here , but that `` Get Down Make Love '' take is fantastic . If you 've got the albums , dig this up for that track alone .	-1
If you like songs that have the same structure , riffs , and subject matter , this album 's for you ! Not since AC/DC has a group been able to churn out the same song 12 times on an album , and the same album over and over . Many of the bands influenced by Sevendust are great , and they have a few gems here and there , but ultimately , it 's like Mexican food and Linkin Park . Same three ingredients , 20 or so ways of arranging them , slap a different name on it and WA-LA ! I 'm sure Clear Channel loves these guys .	-1
I just ca n't give this one a 3 . This CD drags through . Mind you , there are a few good songs but when you first knew them from Fun and Games you begin to miss the upbeat fun of this band . Add it to your collection if you are a Connell fan . You will get in a mood to hear this . But buy all the other CDs first .	-1
My banner headline says it all . The name of the album does n't even make any sense . If you do n't believe me , just listen to the ridiculous keyboard and organ effects on `` Spellbound ( by the devil ) '' , as well as all the other tracks for comic relief . You 'll find that to be their only merit .	-1
2 stars at best ! I really disliked this album for many good reasons . To name a few : 1 . It sounds like any other modern power metal band . 2 . It 's terribly cheesy . 3 . The songs are written poorly . If you want to hear a really bad song , listen to STONECOLD ! That 's garbage	-1
I hate Deicide because of the way they talk about Christ . They dis him through the whole CD . This CD is a waste of satanic , sacreligious , trash . Do n't get me wrong , I love death metal , but none of the ones I own put down God like that . I happen to be a born again Christian ( although I 'm a metalhead ) and I have never seen such lyrics like these . Anyone who listens to this needs to go to church BADLY ! Try something not so evil like Cannibal Corpse , Obituary , Morbid Angel or Napalm Death , but Deicide is a bunch of evil pathetic losers .	-1
This album is awful . This was LOA 's most blatant attempt at commercialism , but it does not work whatsoever . By this time in their career , Keith was disinterested and distraught and you heard it in his lack of effort . The album is jumbled with different styles generally not done well . Aside from the excellent Lead You Astray , this album is a poor attempt at too many styles of music .	-1
I did not like it the show on the cover was all right but I would count for something more when looking at metal a ( Merlin Manson )	-1
i remember when i first plugged it in , my ears were flooded with tedious and boring nu-metal . i thought the cd would be good because i had heard the song loco and thought it wasnt bad . well , thats the only good song on this album . and from about 5 listens , that song gets sh|tty . i have tried to like this album , i really have , but nothing happens . its boring and stupid . the lyrics are rediculous and the sound is boring . im surprised that ive had it this long without throwing it the window of the car . or , i should sell it to some sucker for twenty bucks and make a profit.do NOT buy this album . for you will feel sorry in the morning . i surely did . tedious , boring , juvenile , childish , untalented ... i could go on forever folks , so just look at the amount of stars i gave it . avoid it .	-1
If you like this , be SURE to check out Meshuggah , particularly the album Destroy Erase , Improve . Same sort of style with better vocals , tricky polyrhythms ( which make it more interesting ) and a better guitar sound . Those guys have the Machine-sound down pat . I guarantee you will like them better than Fear Factory unless the rhythm 's are too complex and it goes over you 're head . But that wo n't happen , right ? : )	-1
I bought Chaos A.D. and loved it . Loved the whole album and every song in it . Thats what I think makes a great CD is the quality of each songs regardless of lyrics . After listening through the album over about four times it is n't too bad . Some songs really stand out while others do n't . Dictatorshit does not fit in this CD , even though its awesome . Its more thrash style . I would recommend buying this if you want a different experience with listening to Sepultura .	-1
WAY TO SLOW . MAX TOOK THEM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION . THEY SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE PURE THRASH . MAX IS AN AWESOME SONG WRITER , BUT HE CHANGED IT UP TO MUCH ON THIS ALBUM . BUY BENEATH THE REMAINS AND ARISE .	-1
i guess they did what they thought was best . stripping down the killing machine that had brought them to artistic & probably financial freedom .paying homage to their brazilian heritage & in a way , i guess , thanking their people.i think they brought in a bunch of locals and stuff which is cool & i 'm sure it was fun recording it.but it gives it too friendly of a sound for my taste .	-1
And my last . This album sucks and sounds the same lyrically , musically and vocally as every other album before and after . Deicide are the AC/DC of death metal . Make so new fresh music for god 's or satan 's sake .	-1
CD SOUNDS LIKE ONE CONTINOUS SONG CD IS FULL OF HEAVY RIFFS , BUT EVEY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME	-1
These guys sound like they lost there Minds . Why listen to satanic Lies ? Jesus is the Real Deal . satan offers nothing but Garbled Lies . Jesus Died even for Glen Benton , even though He sings such Stupid Nonsense . Hopefully this Foolish Group with there insane Lyrics will wake up B4 it is to late.Do n't Buy any of this useless Junk . satan will Bow B4 Jesus one day , just like all of us will . Obey Jesus New Covenant Gospel , and 4get this satanic Stupidity.it deserves no Stars , but had to put 1 unfortunately .	-1
Type O Negative is probably THE most over rated & quot ; goth/metal & quot ; band out there . I heard that this band , and particularly , this album was amazing , but when I got it I was severely underwhelmed . The lyrics are nothing short of stupid ( Black No . 1 is about HAIR DYE ) , the melodies are bland , and the vocals sound like that guy from Crash Test Dummies . Avoid this .	-1
type o negative started out as a kind of hate metal thrash band with their debut `` slow , deep , and hard . '' they certainly sounded nothing like they do today , but their style back then was fun in a mean-spirited kind of way . they had a `` live '' album which was basically a rehash of their debut , and then they made `` bloody kisses . `` i guess you could call `` bloody kisses '' the precursor to modern type o negative . the general tone is there , the intense gothic elements , and peter steele 's vampiric moan . except that unlike their albums starting with `` october rust , '' this album is simply terrible . one good song does not a good album make . `` christian woman '' is the album 's sole good song . the rest contain varying amounts of stupidity and downright suck . `` black number one , '' despite being popular , is stupid . it 's basically a goth in-joke with idiotic lyrics . and the rest of the album gets worse as you go . minor highlights among the badness are `` we hate everyone '' which is funny for about ten seconds , and the occasional good musical bit among peter steele 's godawful lyrics . in fact , a few songs , like `` bloody kisses '' and `` too late frozen '' might have been better without the lyrics.i want to stress that type o negative is my favorite band . `` october rust '' is the best album in the world , and their most recent `` life is killing me '' is amazing as well . if you like the gloomy stupidity of goth stereotypes , then maybe you 'll get a kick out of this album , but if you actually want good music and lyrics to accompany the gothic undertones , then get type o 's later albums .	-1
Metalcore - the epitome of mainstream garbage that Americans love.Pass on this and move onto bands that matter ; such as Kreator , Death , Dismember or Suffocation .	-1
I ca n't help but laugh at these guys . Satanic and anti-religion bands are so out of date man . Anything satanic or anti-christianity these days is just corny . That being said , Deicide are a perfect example of this cheesy lyrical content . They try so hard to make themselves look/sound evil and brutal and I just find them complete idiots . To me , those who ca n't write songs , write about anti-christianity . Satanic and anti-religious lyrics are like the lowest form of songwriting ever . It is the most imitated lyrical theme , and still remains the lamest.Honestly , I can stand death metal ... Melodic death metal imparticular , but when I hear crap like Deicide and Cannibol Corpse , I get really offended over the fact they try to make music . I 'm very passionate about my music , especially metal , and when I hear these guys trying to be `` brutal '' and `` evil '' it turns out to be nothing but absolute crap .	-1
i had this cd many yrs ago . i received a double cd when i purchased this and come to find , a large majority of the interludes and bonus sides , are scratchy , skips and indecipherable . i just do n't know which song is going to be the next one to not understand . why ?	-1
Because suckers by it , quickly get bored by it , then try to sell it.Except there are more suckers than buyers.Gangsta indeed . Only an idiot thinks gangsta 's are good at making music.OK the dumbos who disagree can now press the `` not helpful '' button , and the smart people can , at least , consider what I 've written .	-1
ok ! ok ! lets be honest here ... those of you who bought this cd probably bought it for the same reason I did the song Gangsta 's Paradise but then thinking the other songs on the album were going to be good , so you decide to buy it play it and its not what you expected but still good but really different ! ! ! I call this cd my weirdo cd it 's well let me put it to you like this the song ( Gangsta 's Paradise ) is a veary ketchy song infact it was veary popular in it 's time but the other songs are not like this song witch make the cd well there just not so ketchy but i 'm going to let you in on some little truth i never knew Collio was the 1 that sang ( gangsta 's paradise ) I found out much later and to top it off he did the songs ( To Hot , Geto Highlites , and Slumin New ) . I never knew that ! ! ! Where have I been those to were great songs but I still like ( Gangsta 's Paradise ) better . So for the rating of this cd well it 's just I thought it would be more exciting and ketchy well ... basicly a bump in your ride cd but then thats just my opinion all else I can tell you is to buy it , and play it , see what you think . Ok ... if you really lke the song ( Gangsta 's Paradise ) alot then it 's a good buy but if you only like it a little then my advice is to go but somthing else but hey you never know you might just rate it a 5 well see ya ! ! !	-1
You really have the impression somehow that she ca n't sing . Also the songs do n't seem spectacular . It 's weak dancey stuff - like DJ Bobo and all those acts . This is really a no-go for me	-1
Last of the Misfits albumn with Danzig . Pretty much a total 180 for the band at that point . Not the 50 's pop/punk but more like trash/speed metal/ punk . If your into thrash/metal you 'll probably like this record but if you like LEGACY OF BRUTALITY and WALK AMONG US you 'll probably be turned off . Die Die My Darling , one of there best tracks , is on the albumn .	-1
I really do n't understand the ravishing reviews this album is getting . If there was a rating lower than 1 star , i would definitely give this album the absolute lowest rating . It 's not quite pop music , the lyrics and tiny bubble of reality presented fall far short of reaching any sense of sympathy or connection with any of the songs . I love human league , who have a clear goal , which are somewhat clubby synth pop songs with bad puns and overly rhymed choruses , but often very clever lyrics.Instead of this hard to follow , soul-less mess of confused styles which blend poorly and are poorly produced , with very unbalanced vocals and instrumentation , try any of the new , beautiful tech-pop new school electro bands : Freezepop- & quot ; forever & quot ; ( fluffy meaningless lyrics but catchy and cute ) , Nasa- & quot ; remembering the future & quot ; , Soviet-self-titled debut ( one of the best albums i 've heard in the last 5 years , any genre ) , ladytron- & quot ; 604 & quot ; , adult- & quot ; resuscitation & quot ; , fischerspooner- & quot ; emerge & quot ; ( otherwise known as & quot ; # 1 & quot ; ) , miss kitten and the hacker , felix da housecat , or even golden boy ( mediocre ) . not to mention that the last human league cd was brilliant , and also the last new order cd .	-1
I remember hearing the song & quot ; Do n't You Want Me & quot ; on the radio many times in 1982 . It was one of my favorite pop hits of the year . It 's catchy and exciting and just a great song in general . I bought this CD a few years later , and I was disapponnted to find out that the rest of the album is pretty much filler . Simply put , I do n't find any of the other songs to be appealing in any way at all . In fact , not only do I not find them appealing , but I actually find them to be mind numbing . The CD sounds like the kind of thing that somebody would force you to listen to if they were trying to brainwash you . I mean , geez ! Listen to the sound sample of the first song if you want to see what I mean . The guy 's voice sounds so mechanichal , almost as if it was computer generated . It 's as if they are trying to erase the contents of your brain so they can later take control of your mind . But I still love the song & quot ; Do n't You Want Me , & quot ; so I 'm giving this CD two stars instead of one . And by the way , if anybody here wants to hear a real genuinely true new wave/pop album where every song is outstanding and a sheer joy to listen to , then I strongly recommend that you get PARALLEL LINES by Blondie . It 's intelligent , fun , upbeat , humorous , and overall an excellent CD . And PARALLEL LINES sounds like it was made by real human beings who have genuine thoughts , feelings , and emotions , which is something that the DARE CD pretty much lacks .	-1
If you are a newcomer to Van Der Graaf , avoid this and it 's studio predecessor & quot ; The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome & quot ; . At this point Dave Jackson 's excellent sax disappears in favor of a particularly annoying violinist . This recording is raw , not particularly well mixed or performed . Peter Hammill called it a solo career after this .	-1
Looking at the reviews other amazon customers wrote about this album astounds me . So much so that I can grasp why wars break out and people generally disagree ; how can some find this pleasureable and others completely deplorable ? I do n't get it . At the time I bought this I was really into finding `` new '' artists and giving them a chance . `` Chameleon in the shadow '' and `` Silent Corner '' were very different from what I had been listening to , and after a couple weeks I found them to be rather engaging . I 've had `` Future Now '' for over a year and I still ca n't get into it , after listening to it today for probably the fifth time I do n't think I 'll wasted any more of my time with it .	-1
IF THIS WAS A STAE MENT BY T H E ONE WHO & # 34 ; WENT MISSING & # 34 ; IN 1994 -- OH THOSE PIECES -- A CHANCE.RACK EM UP YOMOLESS 2 MORE STARS===============2MILLION	-1
This album is poor . It is simply four untalented musicians getting a record deal with the help from the front woman 's fatherand recorded an album with half finished songs under their belt.the songwriting is poor . the musicianship is also bad and the sound overall really really bad . Courtney 's lyrics are often shallow and often does n't demonstrate anything . Her vocals are copying everything from other female artists . This just shows us that Courtney and her group could n't do a thing themselves so on later albums they would hire songwriters to write their albums . Overall a poor effort that should belong in the garbage instead on a shelf .	-1
I wanted to like this disc based upon the positive reviews that I was reading , but there were only 2 songs that I could finish listening to because of his & quot ; unusual voice & quot ; . The arrangements & amp ; lyrics are decent , but he makes Tom Waits sound like a real good singer .	-1
The most important works of Tangerine Dream were made early 70s . Those albums could be called 'ambient ' . But now they are trying to make melodical stuff and we can see that they ca n't compose at all . Themes on this album are too simple to entertain me . Also a sonic palette has nothing imaginative despite of synthesizer arsenal that is used . This is perhaps suitale for boring and unimaginative people .	-1
I 'd say this is a terrible album but the production is pretty good , so it gets one star . Poor Tony Banks , he just ca n't put out a solo album . I bought this album when it first came out way back in '79 hoping for an 'instrumental Genesis ' album . Wrong ! Forgettable songwriting , below-average vocals , and just kinda dull . I sold the album to the used record store in 1979 , now when I listen to the samples again 30 years on , well , it has n't gottten any better . Perhaps the 'Genesis brothers ' ( Tony & Mike ) should call up Ray Wilson and put out a progressive Genesis album ? Not gon na happen . If you 're looking for Genesis or ex-Genesis solo albums buy anything by Steve Hackett . As for Tony Banks , he 's an amazing player -- -with Genesis .	-1
Another pompous prog rocker with nothing to say , but does n't mind saying it ! this one is the least of all with no real playing skill , no improvisational ability , and an ear for saccharine melody almost as bad as band mate phil collins , I would call this album second hand smoke , or absbestos , : avoid exposure to all !	-1
This disc can still be found , with a fair bit of effort , in the neglected bin of an obscure cd/record store . Do n't bother making the effort though . Banks was always at his best as a collaborator , a member of the collective group . As a solo artist , he struggles too much to identify a clear musical identity . The fact that he hired such a lifeless , untalented vocalist , does n't help matters . To find Banks at his most creative listen to any of Genesis ' efforts prior to Steve Hackett leaving the band . Selling England by the Pound through Wind and Wuthering are in particular , oustanding recordings . A Curious Feeling is not among his better efforts . Give this one a pass ... Simon	-1
Despite having much the same sound as albums like & # 34 ; Wind and Wuthering & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; ... and then there were three ... & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; A Curious feeling & # 34 ; is a very flawed album from Tony Banks.Trawling through the dozen minus one tracks on offer , while there is definitely promise , and an eerie aura , the main thing that lacks throughout is the vocals . I would n't blame Kim Beacon ; rather , it seemed 'fashionable ' at the time for Genesis solo albums to bury guest vocalists under layers and layers of instrumentation . That said , I do n't think Kim 's AOR vocals fit in with the Genesis sound at all.Secondly , there are hardly any hooks or memorable moments on the vocal tracks . While there are some good instrumentals , such as & # 34 ; From The Undertow & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Forever Morning & # 34 ; and particularly & # 34 ; The Waters of Lethe & # 34 ; , the best song on the album , the lack of convincing vocal tracks and a lack of variety add to the sense of this being a poor album , and sometimes vene the best instrumental tracks here feel like a lot of noodling rather than any interesting song structure . For Genesis completists only .	-1
Flat and uninteresting . Music for house plants . Has the Genesis sound without any of the wit and musical hooks that made Genesis of that era so interesting to listen to . I can see why his solo musical career went nowhere .	-1
I just do n't get this album . It 's annoying , disjointed , and hard to listen to . Maybe it 's like Piers Anthony 's Macroscope - it will only work if you have a certain intelligence level . I guess I 'm not at that level ? I see people really love this one , but I ca n't stand it . If you are into Caravan or Camel , this album is nothing like those bands . I only gave it two stars because its better than all the one-star radio garbage . At least it 's interesting and different - just like Frank Zappa 's Jazz from Hell - and equally as difficult to listen to as the FZ album . I ebayed mine after giving it a serious chance.Just goes to show you how different people 's music tastes are . I love all those progressive bands from the 70 's , but this one is a real dog , in my opinion.And this is the one people wanted if they could have one album on a desert island ? Geez ... .	-1
Discovery is unquestionably a letdown compared to say , Five Miles Out . The problem is that Mike Oldfield does n't sound like he was in a very creative mood when writing down this stuff so the music more often than not lacks his likeable brand of worldly mystery/adventure we 've come to expect . `` The Lake '' takes Asian elements and ... they sound nice sure , but they 're also not very creatively written since the entire 12-minute piece is fairly predictable . Perhaps the culprit here is the mid 80 's when commercial music was in full force and Mike Oldfield was feeling the effects , but this song is almost entirely straight forward without any desire to really reach for the stars and , well , be creative ! The hints of Asian influences he utilized on past albums were usually subtle while the Irish ones were more upfront , and perhaps he should have kept that winning formula for Discovery . I was hoping for a dramatic , sweeping conclusion to finish off this song but ... it never comes . Oh sure , the final 2 minutes probably qualify as dramatic but the notes are n't really anything to scream or shout about . Even worse is that certain parts of the piece rip off `` The Gates of Delirium '' , a classic mid 70 's Yes song . Some of the instrumental chops feel like they were lifted from `` The Gates of Delirium '' and put on here.The title song is pure awful . Is that Paul Stanley of KISS fame singing ? Sure sounds like it . Actually he sounds like Graham Bonnet of late 70 's Rainbow fame . This song is *entirely* inappropriate for Oldfield 's true vision . `` To France '' has decent -though out of place- vocals courtesy of Maggie Reilly . She reminds me of Annie Haslam from the progressive rock band Renaissance but ... I normally differentiate Oldfield and Renaissance 's work so this does n't cut the mustard with me . `` Saved By a Bell '' ( unfortunately not the theme song to Saved BY the Bell , har ! ) No no NO ! This is generic pop/rock with no innovation whatsoever . Actually the cutesy vocals during the verse remind me of the Care Bears . Yes my friends , the CARE BEARS ! The chorus is actually pretty good , though.Hey , hold on ! `` Tricks of the Light '' is good ! Fast-paced early 80 's Moody Blues-like guitar playing . I like that period of the Moodies ! Occasional vocals from Maggie Reilly to boot . Quality vocals ! No , not what makes Oldfield awesome of course but enough to put a smile on my face . I could have sworn I heard a verse melody similar to the one in `` Poison Arrows '' at an earlier time . What song DOES this resemble ? Not a bad melody at any rate . `` Talk About Your Life '' is just as mellow and soft as `` Poison Arrows '' but with female vocals this time . The atmosphere is identical to Heart 's `` These Dreams '' , a popular 80 's song.Mike Oldfield is clearly a *thousand* times more adventurous and awesome than this . I strongly recommend skipping it . Why so many people are giving the album positive reviews makes my head itchy and confused .	-1
An odd album that never quite sat well with me , `` Op Zop Too Wah '' again finds Adrian Belew straining to combine the many elements of his career . I 've often felt his early albums were far too saturated in a David Byrne influence , and that the second batch ( after the '80s Crimson broke up ) was a distinct improvement , but drifting two far into pop . This one , recorded after the Double Trio King Crimson came together , is a strange one -- the songs themselves are interspersed with various brief snippets and musical thoughts , and even the most pop material on here has some sort of bizarre twist to it.If nothing else , it is a brave album -- Belew covers a ton of ground here , but that should n't come as a particular surprise.The record certainly starts off well enough -- the first half dozen tracks are all fantastic , from a blistering guitar solo traded with verses over brilliant percussion ( `` Of Bow and Drum '' ) , a goofy love song about a guitar ( `` Six String '' ) , a dark , haunting , and twisted love song ( `` All Her Love is Mine '' ) , and at least one piece that defies description in the slightest ( `` I Remember How to Forget '' ) with a couple little idea snippets . `` I Remember How to Forget '' is also quite famous for having been the song that King Crimson worked up but Belew pulled back from the band -- its a twisted , contorting song that probably would have done well on a Crimson record.Unfortuantely , after that , it kind of falls apart , the title track is ok but feels like it drags on forever , but other than that , some dull balladry ( `` Time Waits '' ) and a bunch of pieces that are either overlong ( `` High Wire Guitar '' ) , fall apart ( `` Modern Man Hurricane Blues '' ) or just fail to develop ( nearly all of it ) .Then again , some folks think this is a masterpiece -- I 'm giving it two stars simply for the beginning , but I 'd recommend checking out `` Here '' or `` Young Lions '' before this one if you 're new to Belew .	-1
nothing but chugga chugga beats , and exteremly repeative breakdowns and boring vocals , the worst of the worst when it comes to H.C. .	-1
This CD is virtually useless , as the remastering was done so HORRIBLY that the soft & medium volume passages pump loud/soft as though someone were randomly spinning the volume knobs up & down - completely ruining the music to the point of actually making my head hurt . The ENTIRE Remastered Supertramp series is the same way ( at least I know that so is 'Even in the Quietest Moments ' , 'Crisis What Crisis ' & 'Famous Last Words ' as I ordered them all at the same time ) - I had sooooo wanted to enjoy this music again , as my vinyl copies are now aging , and I had waited for remastered versions to bring Supertramp 's music back to life for me . Instead , some incompetent engineer tried to use a single-band compander noise reduction technique and literally stripped all of the musicality out of the softer passages , and muddled the rest as well . If you love Supertramp music like I do , PLEASE STAY AWAY from this & # 34 ; Remastered & # 34 ; series - the chop job was a crime ... Yes , the CRIME OF THE CENTURY ... and I had to return the entire series .	-1
I do n't know what was happening with music fans in 1973 , but there must 've been a low point in music history going on or something . Pink Floyd are without question the most overatted band EVER . I have listened to this album several times and tried to like it . But I ca n't , it stinks to be frank . Even the supposedly classic song `` Money '' . Is very annoying to listen to more than once , maybe its that unbearable sax solo or the off-key rhythm section and cash register sounds . But to me this album is very poor and vastly overatted	-1
Disclaimer : If rock , country , and [ c ] rap disappeared from the planet tomorrow , I would the happiest man on earth . There would be some loss , but I would be willing to sacrifice it for the general uplift in musical taste . Having said that , I do occasionally find something I like in the pop vein ( Steve Winwood , for example ) , but I have yet to find anything that I love because I 've never uncovered anything of musical substance . This mix of Dark Side of the Moon sure ai n't it . Having recently purchased an SACD player , I thought I would revisit this so-called classic . If nothing else , I could play it for friends.Thirty years ago , you could n't walk into a hi-fi store without hearing `` thump-thump , thump-thump , '' followed by two hundred clocks having simultaneous orgasmic releases . All that remains on this recording , but the simple , over-electronicized music still does nothing to move me . The sound effects are almost as annoying as those fuzzed , distorted , god-awful guitars that several generations have amazingly accepted as THE sound and will be able to point to in old age as the source of their deafness.I 'm sure just about everyone will disagree with the above opinions , but you can not disagree with what follows . The mix on this recording is dreadful . Like virtually all pop recordings , the engineer forgot that rock is VOCAL music and thus typically made the vocal lines so recessed within a wall of sound as to render lyrics unintelligible . It 's as if the band were playing in your ears but the singers are 30 feet away . Why this is standard practice in the pop field , I can not imagine . I also do n't much like sitting in the middle of the band and wished the instruments were all placed up front . Moreover , the sound is harsh and overbearing , and that is likely the fault of the mixing engineer , not the source material . While I have found in playing SACDs that I want to turn the volume up ( including electronic jazz ) , in this case I dived to turn it down.The Dark Side of the Moon will go onto my shelf and remain there until someone begs me to play it.P.S . There is a reason that Amazon sells some versions for $ 150 and this one so cheaply .	-1
If you are one of the billions of Pink Floyd fans , do not even bother to read any further . Just go to the NO button below and click . I 'm sorry , but this elevator music would make a great animal tranquilizer . I bought & quot ; The Wall & quot ; the same time I bought this one and it is a little better but there is no way in this world that this could be classified as & quot ; rock music & quot ; . I do n't normally review a cd unless I can give it 4 stars or better but in this case I will make an exception . The search continues ... .	-1
With the exceptions of The Great Gig In The Sky , Time , Us and them ( truly masterpieces ) the rest of the album never impressed me so much and will never do . The better things that I was talking about in the title of this review have been made by the Floyd themselves especially the overlooked MORE .	-1
Why is this album so overrated ? it 's not nearly as good as most of their other recordings . This is n't as much an essential as I 'd heard it to be . I would n't recommend buying it .	-1
Being a Pink Floyd fan , I have purchased every version of this album since it was released 30 years ago.By far the best version is the SQ Quadraphonic LP version , but as far as the stereo mix goes , the original UK Harvest CD ( made in Japan ) is still the high point.Ten years ago , the fine engineer Doug Sax made a valiant effort , but it is clear listening to that XXth Aniversary Edition CD that the original tapes no longer have the same dynamics they originally had ( magnetic analog storage slowly loses it quality ) .Nevertheless , I decided to give this new 30th Anniversary CD a try . I should mention here that this is only a review of the standard stereo tracks - I do n't yet have an SACD-capable player.However this release does n't make me want to run out and buy one . My worst fears have been realized as once again , the overall mix of the album has been lost in favor of & quot ; resolving power & quot ; , ie the ability to hear little details . The problem is that after applying techniques to bring out such details , the engineers have done nothing to restore the original mix of the album.The result is like a starving artist 's copy of a Rembrandt painting - it sounds something like Dark Side of the Moon , but when you hear the real thing , you realize that it is only a faded imitation.The problem is that few people these days have access to what it actually sounds like . Almost no one listens to their LP versions , and only a handful of people are lucky enough to own the original UK Harvest CD . Furthermore , it seems clear that the engineers of this 30th Anniversary Edition have n't listened to the original , either.Interestingly , the original engineer , Alan Parsons , asked to be involved in this 30th Anniversary Edition project , but was shut out . It would seem that future listeners suffer as a result.PS My qualifications : I am a California state certified Studio Recording Engineer . One of my instructors was the original engineer for the drum recordings for & quot ; Dark Side of the Moon & quot ; . I compared the 30th Anniversary Edition , XXth Anniversary Edition , and UK Harvest CDs using AKG K240 Studio Monitor headphones ( as used in many studio recording situations over the past 20-30 years ) .	-1
This disk simply does not stand the test of time . For example , the echo used on the Us and Them vocals is over produced . Also the song Great Gig in the Sky amounts to nothing more than a bunch of screaming and lacks any direction what so ever . The songs Brain Damage and Eclipse especially have lost its appeal . & quot ; All that you touch ... .. & quot ; seems dry and just lacking in anything thay can be taken seriously . During the & quot ; High School & quot ; days this was very stoney . But now it amounts to little more than overplayed FM dribble . This music simply tries to hard to & quot ; freak out & quot ; the listener . Real music that holds up after 30 years or so is usually not so overproduced , but instead has strong , straight forward song writing .	-1
Ranks as one of noisiest new vinyl records I have ever purchased . Obvious physical imperfections like fingerprints , scuffs , etc . I returned that copy . My 2nd copy had much less of the aforementioned , but still had a nasty tick once every revolution on Us and Them . That defect is in the pressing . Other audible ticks and pops as well . Terrible job . Guess I wo n't be buying Wish You Were Here and The Wall when they are released . What company pressed this ? I cleaned this record using a VPI 16.5 wet-vacuum cleaning machine with L'Art du Son cleaning fluid . It was played back on a VPI Scout turntable .	-1
Syd was pink floyd and this album is a cash cow , mainstream disgrace . Ca n't stand these PF fans who get all violent when you slag off at their music gods . The woman doing the backing vocals is appalling and annoying . I think people like this album because they feel they have to - sad really . Iggy is the real god and would blow them off the stage in a split second with the stooges . This music is not even good to fall asleep to with that wailing woman ... no stars ( if I could ) .	-1
This has to be one of the very WORST albums of ALL TIME . I would rather be forced to listen to every single moronic Ocean Colour Scene album than EVER EVER EVER have to listen to this pile of aimless something or other . IT GOES NOWHERE ! ! ! It is just one big pointless experiment in being 'cool ' or 'experimental ' , Scissor Sisters do a much better version of Comfortably Numb than 'the Floyd ' could ever hope to do ... and I guess they should have tried to record this big mess of an album . Total rubbish .	-1
I really tried to like this album . seen it on all the top album lists + how it was in the charts for a million years . i cant stand it . even tried listening to it every day for a couple of weeks to see if it needed to grow on me . well it did not . whats with all the sound effects ? ? ? ? ? clocks , running , cash registers , ect . oh , and that chick screaming for what seems to be hours . grew up + still love , beatles , stones , led , zep , hendrix ect but sorry to say , dont dig this album at all !	-1
I really detest Pink Floyd . This is one of the lousiest albums ever made in the history of rock music . I never liked Pink Floyd and I almost fell asleep one day when I heard this , this is just noise ! Anyone who likes them needs to see a doctor . This is just boring sleep music . Even Neil Young 's Greatest Hits has much better music than this . This has two of the lousiest songs ever like Us And Them and Time . Do n't make the mistake of buying this boring album , get any of these albums insted.METALLICARide The LightningLoadBlack AlbumMaster Of Puppets ...

I was never a big fan of Bernie Taupin 's lyrics , which is too bad because Elton himself is a great pianist and has a way with a melody too . Bernie 's lyrics positvely blow , however , and get in the way of Elton himself . Songs like the obnoxiously homophobic All the Young Girls Love Alice , racist and sexist Sweet Painted Lady , I 've Seen That Movie Too and This Song Has No Title have some of the worst lyrics ever . And some of the songs are awful even without the lyrics : the supremely annoying hit Bennie and the Jets , Roy Rogers , Social Disease , Ballad of Danny Bailey , I 've Seen That Movie Too ... Anyway , there are only five songs I do like on this album : Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding , Candle in the Wind , title track , Grey Seal and Saturday Night 's All Right for Fighting . But this is one thin album outside of those - I 'd recommend the self-titled record , Madman Across the Water and Do n't Shoot Me I 'm Only the Piano Player instead .	-1
The odd 2 cents worth : First off ... . the best thing about this release is certainly the live show . The sound quality and mix are good with the piano more prominent than in the original radio broadcast . All the performances are the unedited originals , though some of the intros are from other shows for some reason ( Candle ... , Danny Bailey ) . And conspicuously absent are the references to the state of Elton 's voice ( & # 34 ; I have a dreadful cold - but I will stumble my way through everything and we will all have a good time . That is guaranteed , I hope & # 34 ; ... . & # 34 ; We 're gon na do a song which you can help me out on 'cause I 've got a dodgy voice - and it 's called GYBR & # 34 ; ) . I guess they were hoping any first time listeners would n't notice . Hopefully they 'll get around to releasing the '74 Hammersmith show at some point - he 's certainly in better vocal shape for that one . And of course it would have been great to have heard some of the tunes that were undoubtedly on the set list that night which did n't make the broadcast . *Dreadful cold* notwithstanding , an hour and 40 min . is a bit short for an Elton gig , even for the early years.The DVD ... . ( oh boy ) ... . the version I taped off a formerly-entertaining cable music channel in '95 was considerably cut from the original showing , clocking in at about 52 min . And according to the note I had left with that copy , it was missing performances of Elderberry Wine , ... .Alice , and Crocodile Rock ( as well as more interviews ? ) . This would have been compared with the audio tape I had made from the 90 min . network showing in '73/'74 ( and whose location today is a bit of a mystery ) . So here we are in 2014 , and this eagerly awaited finally-on-digital version gives us a whopping ... . 45 min ? I could understand , for perhaps Elton 's personal reasons , the missing bits of commentary from his Mom , Dick James , or especially former manager John Reid , with whom there 'd been a bit of legal action awhile back . But the performance footage , etc . which must 've brought it all to at least 75 min . originally ? ... . major dropping of the ball . I guess it should n't be a surprise that there was no closed captioning , as well . Anyway ... The contemporary covers and extras disc : ... . there are just 3 of the covers that do anything for me - those by John Grant , Imelda May , and Zac Brown ( Ed Sheeran 's Candle ... needs to be slowed down quite a bit ) . And if we 're supposed to be shocked by Fall Out Boy 's & # 34 ; old man 's ... . than a barrel full of monkeys & # 34 ; line - well I just get struck by it 's *grammatical incorrectness* . I was hoping for more of a lasting impression from these , since 7 of the 9 were produced by singer/producer extraordinaire Peter Asher . Oh well . These tracks would 've been a good choice for an *exclusive bonus* disc at your favorite local retailer type-of-thing , as opposed to being part of the actual release . And speaking on behalf of those who have also been listening from the beginning , I think a better bonus inclusion would have been Davey Johnstone 's solo LP from '73 , Smiling Face , especially since it 's only cd release ( from '03 ) has been out of print for years now . It 's got Elton 's harmonium on one track , Nigel , Dee , and Ray Cooper on much of the rest , and was produced by Gus Dudgeon . ( Recently added my thoughts to it 's amazon listing , where you can pay upwards of $ 100 for it if you 're so inclined ) . As for the bonus tracks portion ... . it 's a real head-scratcher as to why they would be compelled to include Whenever You 're Ready fading in and out from 2 other tracks as it was heard on the Lady Samantha compilation - especially since it 's been re-released properly on at least 3 other collections ( Rare Masters , to be Continued , and the '95 release of Do n't Shoot Me ) . It 's here because it was originally on the b-side of Saturday ... ( along with Jack Rabbit ) , but without the fades , of course . And Philadelphia Freedom and Pinball Wizard ... . what the ? ? ... . they were both about a year and a half from seeing the light of day , with Caribou in the interim . Relevance ? Aside from the Grey Seal demo , the only gem here for me is the acoustic Candle ... . Now that 's good stuff ... . did n't they have any other options as far as remixes , alternate takes , etc ? How 'bout some *backing track only* action on Love Lies Bleeding , or Bennie and the Jets without the studio-added *live concert* track ? I know the *new* mix of Candle ... was on the 30th Ann . edition as well - I did n't spring for that one since I 'd already gotten the DVD from that set separately . ( Which reminds me - if anyone happens to know what the running time on that DVD is , I 'd appreciate it if you 'd pass that along . Just wondering if they made any cuts to that one as well ) .The book : ... . the other saving grace of the set ( besides the concert , that is ) ... . lots of good visual stuff - picture sleeves , articles , costumes etc. , and an essay I do n't need a magnifying glass to read . The only thing it could 've used is some more info on the cover art/artist ( Ian Beck - apparently still working these days ) .Which brings me to the album itself ... . kind of a moot point , paradoxically enough . Have n't actually listened to it yet . The one copy I got on cd over the years is the MFSL release , so I do n't expect there to be any noticeable improvement here regarding sound quality . And another reason I did n't go for the 30th Ann . release was that I 've never been interested in the whole *5.1 audio* thing , since most of my listening is done with headphones and I do n't expect to grow another 3.1 ears anytime soon . ( Must 've been a reason Quadrophonic did n't catch on back then ) . So all in all I 'd like to give this whole kit and kaboodle a 5 out of 10 , but since 1/2 stars are n't an option it has to be a 2 , based on the chopping up of the film and on what the covers/ bonus disc could have been . But for those of you who are nowhere near receiving your AARP card , have no previous recollection of the Bryan Forbes film , and are more inclined to want to listen to acts that can make the pop charts in the 21st century ... . by all means ignore 90 % of this and enjoy .	-1
I have become an avid fan of SACD 's in a short time . I have an SACD player with all the cords , the right receiver , and all the speakers . I have Pink Floyd , many of the Dylan remasters , the Police and even Elton John . The incredible clarity and experience of SACD 's has me buying them just for the experience of the sound , it 's that good . I recently purchased the Who - Tommy almost solely based on the fact it was an SACD . The sound is probably on par with Elton John 's Yellow Brick Road , and right up there with the Pink Floyd . although it 's more akin to the early Dylan efforts in some aspects , mono in stereo ? For that alone it 's cool.Yet , it 's really hard to believe this album has gotten the amount of kudu 's it has over the 30 plus years it 's been in existence . I mean , yeah , Keith Mooon 's drumming is pretty wild but listening to it on SACD seems to be about the only way to really enjoy this album at all . So much of it is awkward and lacking in confidence . Who 's Next absolutely blows it out of the water within the Rock n ' Roll pantheon . I sort of wish rock history would be able to discern great works from some of these pretentious albums that continue to be considered important . And this comes from a fan of the Kinks , including Arthur and Village Green . At least those seem to have some sort of pastoral themes that continues to be an important theme in western art . But a blind guy playing Pong ? It does n't really have any resonance ... Having said that , the album is of incredible audio quality . I would gladly pay another $ $ to get Who 's Next on SACD . Hopefully , we will see quite a few new releases this year ...	-1
What a let-down . The best Rush album in pristine 96khz 24bit resolution could have and SHOULD have been epic . Not so . It 's compressed , loud , and harsh in the high end . Hold on to your vinyl copies or try the Mobile Fidelity gold disc version of this classic . It 's still the best digital alternative if you can find it . I 'm giving this review a two-star for effort . Hopefully we 'll see more music in blu-ray high rez -- and done `` right '' for a change .	-1
Fellow musicians may admire their radiant technical abilities but , to most of us , Geddy Lee , Neil Peart and Alex Lifeson , better known as Rush , make a pretty hideous combination . Not only are Mr. Lee 's high-pitched vocals capable of startling every canine within a five mile-radiance of his revolting shriek , but his lyrics are some of the most pretentious , ridiculous and overtechnical blather in rock history . In the background , Mr. Peart and Mr. Lifeson meander on , spewing instrumentation that is as clean-cut and precise as one could hope , but does not have a drop of soul . A gratuitous layer of synthesizers completes this smooth , anti-septic product . Even Moving Pictures , their most accessible album ( that at least spares listeners the Ayn Rand garbage ) is an overglossed , hollow , lifeless creation . I may not know how to tune a guitar by ear or how to use a capo but I think I can tell that Rush is a ... band .	-1
The title says it all . Back in the High Life and Roll with It were vastly superior recordings with far better music .	-1
Black Sabbath once released a greatest hits album entitles 'We Sold Our Souls For Rock And Roll'.. This album should have been called 'We Sold Out To Play Some Kiddie Pop'.. ( do you take sugar.. one lump or two ? ) I guess in order to garner 'good recommendations ' for my review I could 'sell out ' ( like Def Leppard did ) and give this cd 5 stars , but then I would be doing you all a diservice ( which is exactly what Def Leppard did to their original fan base ) Fortunately one of my friends bought this when it was originally released , and saved me from wasting any of my money on it.This album and band rivals Krokus and the Blitz ( yeah I know Krokus was n't British ) as epitomizing the rapid decline of Metal and the death of the British Invasion . Over produced records , ripped blue jeans , made for video songs , big hair . By selling out , Def Leppard ushered in the Bon Jovi , Warrent , Poison , Winger ( now there 's a classic..LOL ) Cinderella hair band era . Who really cared if the music was any good as long as you looked good in spandex and did n't run out of hair spray..What really makes this album poor is it seems like Def Leppard forgot how to write songs in which you hear drums , vocals and guitars at the same time . Listen to the 'hits ' ( try typing that with a straight face ) off of this album.. For the most part whenever Elliot is singing all you hear is a drum beat and a few guitar chords . By this point in their careers Savage , Collon , Clark and the boys were more worried that they could clap their hands above their heads to the drum beat as Elliot swooned the ladies then they were about playing some kick @ $ $ jams.Go ahead listen to the album again and then compare it to the first two . Where are the guitars ? They are nowhere to be found . Metallic crunch ? What album were you listening to ? This is kiddie pop . It may be kiddie pop at its best , but it 's still kiddie pop.I gave this album 2 stars , only because as hard as it is to believe , Def Leppard went on to release even poorer albums.I do have one question to anyone who claims that this is the greatest album of all time . What runs through your head as you listen to Joe Elliot pleading to be dumped in Sugar . I know the women are thinking does he want Sweet and Low or granular , as for you males ... oh never mind..Oh yeah , and PLEASE , how could anyone have the nerve to compare ANYTHING on this album to Black Sabbath ... Good grief ...	-1
I was a fan of Leppard during their Pyromania era but this album is just more of beating a tired , dead , not that great to begin with horse . Not a whole lot to say other than this album sounds the same as every album from this era , not to good just popular .	-1
I 'm sorry but there 's like two great songs on here and the rest , to me , epitomizes everything that was wrong with eighties pop music . Overblown , pretentious , and painfully predictable . I ca n't believe I used to like these guys when I was a wee tot , and did n't even know that bands like the Replacements or Husker Du existed simply because they would n't play them on the radio . Oh well . Might as well get the greatest hits CD . It has & quot ; Rock of Ages & quot ; AND & quot ; Armageddon It & quot ; on it , so that 's cool . Oh and pick & quot ; Slippery When Wet & quot ; too . But that 's IT . No more mainstream pop ! I can only take so much of this & quot ; Rock On ! & quot ; schtick . You ?	-1
Def Leppard started out churning out pretty respectable metal that skirted the pop edge of the genre . On Through The Night and High And Dry laid a solid foundation for the excellent Pyromania , and it 's success on the pop charts apparently left a taste in the mouths of the Leps because that was obviously where they were headed with this lame followup . This was hands down the most awaited album and the biggest disappointment of the 80 's for me . Pop metal I can stand , but if I want squealy girly metal , I 'll listen to Poison or Vixen , maybe even Journey . The only Journey path that the Leps did n't follow on this was a tour bus video . Bad beyond belief .	-1
What a shame and a waste of money . The sound is so compressed on this remaster ( in the name of making the CD 's as loud as possible ) that the dynamics are simply lost . The music sounds so suppressed and lifeless , including the bonus B-sides . As a Def Leppard fan since 1981 , this is really disappointing . While Hysteria is not my favorite Def Lep album , it is still enjoyable , especially with the 4 main studio B-sides , but not on this remaster.When I first listened to the CD 's they seemed fuller with more low end . It seemed great ... at first . I started to wonder why I began listening to the remaster less and less over the last couple years . Then I dug out the original CD and CD singles . I realized how instruments that jumped out on the original now just all blend together on the remaster . Drum hits that popped out before are softened and now in the background along with every other peak . The definition is gone.A perfect example is the great ending of Women . On this remaster , nothing jumps out . It is no longer the awesome climatic end to the song that it is on the original.Even the B-sides are very adversely affected and not enjoyable at all like they are on previous CD single releases . Tear It Down is so much better on the promo CD of Women or the CD single and CDV single of Animal , which also has the full extended remix of Animal . On this deluxe set , the last section of remix is inexplicably missing . They simply cut it short.The drum intro to Ride Into the Sun sounds so dead . All the life is sucked out of it.Feel can be hard to describe or pinpoint , but the feel and excitement of albums are destroyed by this kind of mastering that has become the norm for new albums and reissues alike . That feeling that made you pump your fist to the original will eventually ( or immediately ) disappear with this version.It makes no difference how loud or full the CD sounds compared to the original . When they eliminate all of the peaks , the music overall loses its power . All of the accents are gone.Unfortunately , the record companies ( and sometimes the artists ) simply want their discs to be as loud as possible . The only way to do that is to compress the music by lowering the peaks and bringing up the valleys.If I posted this review when I first got this remaster it would have been as glowing as some of the other reviews here . It 's easy to think initially `` it 's bigger , fuller and louder '' but over time you 'll wonder why you just do n't enjoy it quite as much anymore . The punch is simply gone.Much if the time , the levels on this remaster are so maxed out that the level indicators on my CD player are all lit up to the max continuously for extended periods without moving up or down . You do n't need to be an audio engineer to realize that nothing can stand out then . Everything is just mushed together . The level indicators should move up and down throughout a song . If you remember the old cassette decks that had those meters , they always bounced up and down . That 's how it was in the recording studio when they recorded these tracks on the master tapes . That 's how it is on the original CD 's . The tracks had dynamics . This remaster has eliminated all of the dynamics of the originals . Parts of songs that used to be loud compared to other parts are relatively reduced in volume and there 's no longer those big contrasts.If you do n't believe it can be that bad , for a great example and side by side comparison , search YouTube for a video titled '' Loudness War is killing music '' ( not my video ) and you 'll see and hear what I 'm talking about comparing Dire Straits ' Money for Nothing original CD vs. the remastered CD . It is the exact same effect as on this remaster.Stick to the original CD and CD singles . It seems tempting to have all of this on 2CD 's , but it is a waste of money and useless when you ca n't enjoy the music.Here 's what to get instead : Hysteria -the Hysteria regular CD ( which is still in-print and has the original mastering as of now ) .The main B-sides : Tear it Down ( 87 mix ) - this is really killed and bland on the deluxe set , all the energy is sucked right out of this awesome track and the drums are completely buried . Get the '87 US Women promo CD , Animal '87 CD single or CD Video single . The Women promo often shows up on eBay.I Wan na Be Your Hero ( 87 mix ) -available on the Hysteria '87 CD single . This is another one of my favorite tracks that has been decimated . When the heavy part kicks in , it created so much energy . On the remaster , it just falls flat . The heavy part is n't loud enough compared to the mellow intro because everything is too maxed out.Ride Into the Sun ( 87 mix ) -also on the Hysteria CD single . This heavy song is also killed on the deluxe set . Compared to the CD single , the drums in the intro sound dead , like cardboard boxes being hit.Ring of Fire ( 87 mix ) - available on the Armageddon It '87 CD single.That 's all the really necessary and killer Hysteria B-sides . The extended mixes are ok for a listen or two , but they 're not better than the album mixes . Release Me is really a joke B-side with one of their roadies doing deliberately awful vocals . Joe does not do any lead vocals on it . The live stuff is ok , but not really necessary . If you really want the extended mixes or live tracks , they are all on various CD singles.Here 's some other compressed remasters I 've wasted money on that should be avoided . I listened to these for a long time before I realized what was missing from the music . This is by no means a complete list . More remasters these days are overly compressed than not . Simply , these are some of the ones that I own and am really glad I never ditched the original CD 's . These are albums that I love and do not just casually listen to : AC/DC : All Atlantic and Sony remastersAnthrax : Among the Living Deluxe Edition 2009 remaster CD/DVDBlack Sabbath : Ozzy years Black BoxDef Leppard : Pyromania Deluxe EditionHysteria Deluxe Edition ( ( I have n't bought the Adrenalize Deluxe , but given the compression of the other 2 above , I wo n't ) .Helloween : All Sanctuary deluxe remasters with bonus tracksIron Maiden : All 1998 remastersJourney : All 1996 and 2006 remastersMetallica : All the early CD 's that were secretly remastered ( they are not labeled as remasters ; any with `` EMI Ventues '' on the back tray insert are the recent pressings that are remastered ) Ozzy Osbourne : Every remaster including : Blizzard of Ozz 2010 remasterDiary of a Madman 2010 remaster and 2010 Legacy edition30th Anniversary box set remasters ( are the same as above ) All 2002 remasters : Blizzard , Diary , Bark , Tribute , No Rest , No More Tears , Ozzmosis , Ozzman ComethAll 1995 remasters ( not the worst , but still compressed ) : Blizzard , Diary , Speak , Bark , Ultimate , Tribute , No Rest , No More Tears , Live and Loud ( All that 's left for Ozzy are the original CD issues , which are the ones to get ) REO Speedwagon : Hi Infidelity Anniversary remasterSupertramp : Breakfast in America 2002 and 2010 remasters ( ca n't comment on the other titles ) .However , the Japan-only 2013 Platinum CD is simply stunning . It sounds three-dimensional and incredible . That is how a CD should sound and it has received accolades along with other Platinum releases that Universal has done in Japan . ( Note : if your CD player can not play CD-R 's , according to Universal , it wo n't play a Platinum disc ) .Van Halen : All 2000 remastersWhitesnake:1987 ( self-titled ) Deluxe Edition 2010 remaster CD/DVD1987 ( self-titled ) /Slip of the Tongue Axe Killer label 2000 remaster 2CDHere I Go Again The Whitesnake Collection 2CD of Slide/1987/SlipHope all of that helps . You have been warned . Do n't waste your money on this remaster . Get the originals if you really want to enjoy this music the way it should sound.If you think this remaster , or the other remasters listed above are great , like I used to , seriously just check out those eye ( and ear ) opening videos mentioned above .	-1
If you like over produced , slick MTV hair metalpop with band members who have strategically placed tears in their jeans this is for you . Me ? I 'll listen to Jane 's Addiction 's `` Nothing Shocking '' instead .	-1
This album , if I may be blunt about it , is a complete and utter flying dog turd . The big hype is the `` epic '' 20-and-a-half minute self-titled track . I wanted to take it safe and just hear it on Youtube before I considered buying . WOOOOOOOOW am I glad I did n't waste my money on this garbage ! Nothing stuck out at all , except for the whiny , annoyingly high-pitched vocals , and that I was completely wasting my time.Everyone I know on Yahoo ! Answers seems to rave Neil Peart 's `` superior drumming . '' Where the hell is it ? I do n't hear nuthin ' superior from ANY of the instruments . I did n't even bother to listen to the lyrics , knowing I 'd have to try and interpret what the horrendous singer was saying , and I did n't feel like listening . Apparently , it 's a buncha cheesy sci-fi crap anyway . I REALLY do n't see the inspiration for other prog-rock bands in Rush ( except maybe James LaBrie 's ear-piercing vocals for Dream Theater ) . Symphony X and the aforementioned Dream Theater blows these twats out of the water in terms of lyric writing , instrumental talent , and making good , interesting , and enjoyable 20-minute+ compositions .	-1
Nowhere near the audio quality of `` Moving Pictures '' and the 5.1 mix falls way short of my expectations . I would have liked some well timed & tastefully mixed surround trickery . Not worth the money spent .	-1
I am only reviewing the 5.1 surround mix and not the entire package . This mix is dreadful . Most of it consists of extra reverb in the rear channels . It reminds me of the sound you get when you flick the `` Simulated Surround '' button on your receiver . There was so much potential in remixing this title . Understanding that Rush is a trio would seem to be constrictive to mapping out a surround mix but their masterful use of overdubbing rhythm guitar and synth/keyboards lends itself to moving the sound palette to multiple channels . This new mix does n't even move Geddy 's voice to the center channel . So , if you are looking to purchase on the strength of it 's 5.1 surround mix ... ..do n't bother . The remastered stereo mix is a much more satisfying experience .	-1
Do n't get me wrong I like some of Wakeman 's other solo albums ( to some degree ) . His work in Yes and The Strawbs is still the best stuff he has done though . Well , after listening to this album again , after maybe 20 years , I can only ask myself one question : Is he embarrassed ? And people wonder why progressive rock is pretty much universally frowned upon .	-1
Con 17 a & ntilde ; os ( en 1977 ) compr & eacute ; este disco y me pareci & oacute ; una obra maestra . Wakeman era el mago de los teclados y de la composici & oacute ; n. Pod & iacute ; a codearse de t & uacute ; a t & uacute ; con cualquier compositor cl & aacute ; sico que se preciara . ! Qu & eacute ; ingenuo ! . Hac & iacute ; a lustros que no escuchaba este disco . El otro d & iacute ; a lo adquir & iacute ; en Cd y corr & iacute ; a recuperar esas maravillosas melod & iacute ; as . El resultado fu & eacute ; una frustraci & oacute ; n como hay pocas . Durante todos estos a & ntilde ; os he escuchado bastante m & uacute ; sica cl & aacute ; sica . La suficiente como para darme cuenta de que Wakeman es tan s & oacute ; lo un mal aprendiz de brujo . Es un correcto teclista , muy vistoso visualmente , pero poco m & aacute ; s. Compositivamente , esta obra es absolutamente vacua , pueril y grandilocuente . En el marco de Yes , Wakeman cumple su papel con mucha correcci & oacute ; n. Es un buen teclista para la media de lo que son los teclistas en el rock , pero fuera de ellos , sus intentos por convertirse en algo m & aacute ; s resultan pat & eacute ; ticos .	-1
Once again , a classic album falls victim to the idiotic modern trend of maxing everything out in the mix to create a muddled , lifeless sound . All the atmosphere and nuance of the original album is lost in this remaster ; Bullet the Blue Sky sounds especially awful . Stick with the original album .	-1
This album is god-awful . Bono is a whiny self-aggrandizing jerk and the Edge ca n't play a guitar to save his life . Of course , I could have written this review about any U2 album cause they are all of about the same caliber .	-1
The original CD itself is a 5-star IMO and one of my top 10 favorite albums/CD . However , I have listened to the LP ( bought in 1987 ) and original CD of this a many many times . When I put the remastered version from this box set I do n't hear much improvement . The DVD concert in Paris in 1987 is AMAZING ( That alone I would give a 5-star ) . I 'm not crazy about the documentary and will probably never watch it again . The videos are okay . The B-sides are cool and interesting . The book and essays is 5-star . The additional photos are filler IMO . I would have preferred to buy the DVD separately and save about $ 20 bucks . The box set is a must for U2 fans . My suggestion for people not sure about U2 , or not familiar with this era of U2 , borrow the DVD from a friend . One of the best live shows I have ever seen .	-1
Not very good . I 've read the reviews that give it glowing and detailed notions of why this is a greatest album ... .but I 've tried listening to it and ca n't see it . I bought an ipod U2 edition ( wanted the black and it looks cool ) and figured I better put some U2 on it . Only right , huh ? Well , I was a senior in high school when this album came out and it did n't click with my harder rock tendencies . Also thought those friends who praised it were overrating this a bit.Anyway I got the whole album and tried listening to it . More than a few times on the ipod ... .and my perception of the disc was correct , it 's boring and not well produced . Maybe I 'm missing something but I just do n't hear it . A recent article in USA Today about `` road songs '' quoted a reviewer of `` where the streets have no name '' as saying how the song lifts and inspires ... But how ? It 's probably the best track with the other single `` with our without you '' , but the rest of the album is just plain boring and uninspiring.I did also get Achtung Baby and REALLY like it . So this leads me to believe I 'm not simply bigoted toward U2 . The whole CD ( Actung Baby ) is great , not just the singles . Get that instead . I 've yet to explore the other titles but am willing . I now know that The Joshua Tree is overrated.Edit : And now have `` How to Dismantle ... '' and `` All That You Ca n't Leave ... '' BOTH beautiful and moving albums . Joshua just does n't do it for me .	-1
Back in '83 when we were wailing War over and over again in our dorm rooms and busy making party mix tapes featuring I Will Follow who would have thought U2 would ultimately turn into a massive marketing machine for remixed , remastered , and repackaged media product ? Well in the scheme of things I suppose this is fine since millions seem to love it and a goodly chunk of the proceeds are presumably funneled off to Africa 's needy . Between the merit of the product itself on the one hand and the prodigious effort and endless hype on the other , there is however , a colossal mis-match . There are 3 straight-forward reasons for this : 1 ) generally remasters are not worth it ( unless maybe , and that is just maybe , you have some pricey high end audio system or the production on the original release was utter rubbish ) , 2 ) U2 only has a very small handful of decent b-sides and 3 ) U2 is a terrible covers band.So if you would love to have U2 's essential albums and help the needy here is some sound advice : log into Amazon and order up used copies of the original issues of Boy , October , War , Under a Blood Red Sky , The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree used for pennies a piece plus $ 2.98 each for S & H . ; In fact the real beauty of U2 's reissue mania is precisely that you can now acquire all of their original issue studio albums on perfectly good quality CD for a vanishingly small sum of money . Now by not buying all of this other unnecessary stuff even a portion of what you have saved would make a respectable and much appreciated donation to your favorite charity .	-1
I agree with `` A Kids Review '' on the latest review on How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb . They are pretty boring . And this music makes you fall asleep . All the songs are bad ! ! Read that review and agree ! ! PS THE KID WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH ! !	-1

Kurt Cobain was a great poet , so I decided to write my review as a poem . Also , I 'm not going to give stars because I do n't think Kurt made music to get stars on Amazon , at least , not the Kurt I knew.KURT COBAIN ( Written on the 26th of August 2001 , in the early hours of the morning after listening to every single Nirvana album and getting high and then low . ) kurt cobainWhat kind of namewas thatfor a man with a brain ?

Growing up from the ages 12-15 and learning to play guitar , no other band could touch Metallica or Nirvana . I worshipped both bands , bought all albums , and learned all the songs on guitar . I thought I was on a different level than everyone else because I could play Smells Like Teen Spirit and Enter The Sandman . After the first few years of learning I started discovering other bands and other styles of music . Slowly but surely I waned myself off both bands and can say I have n't listened to a Nirvana or Metallica album in 10 years . While Nirvana changed the face of music , it did n't last long . Grunge was a fad like any other flavor of the month . Eventually , It died like most other genres do . Nirvana can be enjoyable , but the simplicity of the music I no longer find amazing at 26 years old . I ca n't relate to any of the lyrics and honestly Kurt Cobain was a terrible writer and guitar player . Some people seem to think his lyrics are deep and thought provoking . Honestly , he was a drug addict that chose to commit suicide . I can see a struggling teenager or guitarist enjoying Nirvana . But as I grew up I moved on to bigger and better music .	-1
it was a warm summers day when me could pal 'Jimmy Magee threw on the new fad which something called Nirvana . It most certainly had an impact in the old folks home . Jeekers what a fright ! For me it was the day that music died when Nirvana knocked off that nice boy Micheal J off the top of the album charts . A nasty wretched little album which only encourages those lazy alienated masses of people . For Aprils fools day we got it played in the old folks home over the intercome for a little petite joke . The shock of it saw off another 20 . Nirvana do have a little bit of potential indeed but they really need to channel their energies more towards where their strengths lie , which is of course alt-country . On a further note the murky production which garnered much attention for being innovative was not only influenced by the Pixies , but was outright stolen off Gary Barlow 's early Open Road sessions , whose delay saw it being released after Nevermind .	-1
Nirvana 's biggest , most popular hit , `` Smells Like Teen Spirit '' is a absolute rip-off of Love & Rockets song called `` No New Tale To Tell '' . So much , in fact , that if Nirvana were sued for plagiarizing , they would undoubtedly lose the fight . I 've read that a few have said that SLTS is a rip-off of the Pixies ' `` Debaser '' , but THAT rumour is just not true . The one about `` No New Tale To Tell '' IS infact true . Listen to `` No New Tale to Tell '' . The guitar riff used thoughout was stolen by Kurt Cobain and used in `` Rape Me '' as well . As for the songs off Nevermind -- They are the epitome of what Cobain hated ; glossy-sounding 80 's drum reverb effects were used ... the same effects Madonna and Wilson Phillips used in their 80 's pop schlop . Cobain could have at least caved in and admitted he never had any punk sensibilities , but instead he lied and claimed he still had the punk rock ethos despite the fact that he gave mainstream America what it wanted .	-1
First of all , Nirvana sucks . They were totally unoriginal and lame . They looked lame , they sounded lame and they were total dorks.Rock stars should look cool . For those of you that do n't know what this means , it means you should wear tight leather pants , lots of chains and shiny metal objects , and have tattoos on every exposed surface of your skin . Did Nirvana have any of this ? No.Rock stars should sound cool . That means that they should be able to screech long and loud like Axl or Robert Plant . They should play long and fast guitar solos ( like Megadeth ) , and they should sing about how much money they have and how many chicks they bang . At the very least , they should be able to brag about how great they are in song . Did Nirvana do any of these things ? No.Rock stars should be totally original too . Nirvana 's style was basically just cobbled together from bits and pieces of other bands that came before them , unlike true masters of rock like GnR , Megadeth or Metallica . Plus , their songs were simple and easy to play . Everyone knows that unless a song contains multiple key changes , minor chord progressions and syncopation , its total crap . Also , as I mentioned earlier , songs should have lots of guitar solos in them . Lots of them ! So you see , Nirvana was total crap . They sucked . They were n't even authentically poor . They were probably wealthy . If you listen to Nirvana then you are a total loser . Go buy something else . Go buy some Avril or some Good Charlotte . Better yet , go check out some classics like Van Halen ( Sammy Hagar era - I do n't think we have to get into that other dork and his pathetic shtik ) . Now there 's someone that knows how to take a guitar and make it go `` neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-diddly-diddly-doodley-doooooooooo ! ! ! ! ! `` .	-1
i firmly beleive that the only reason peopel like this band is because they were the first to do it . because it is talentless , it really is . the guy knew 3 chords , sang like a dying chicken , and wrote stupid , pity lyrics about being dumb and having no friends . if a band like this came out now , no one would care , if anything they 'd laugh at it .	-1
Do you still live with your parents ? Do you think that Kurt Cobain is a legend ? Can you play four chords on a guitar ? If you can answer yes to any of the above questions no doubt you agree that Nirvana 's Nevermind is a masterpiece and easily the best album ever created . Of course we all know that there is no better guitarist or vocalist than Cobain , in fact he was better than Hendrix , Stevie Ray Vaughan , and Eric Clapton rolled into one ; and Dave Grohl is obviously a better drummer than John Bonham or Neil Peart . But really , the song structures here are so complex that you 'd better be a master of your instrument to even try to play these songs . And oh my the lyrics , now I 'm not sure if anyone else will agree with me but I think Cobain was a better songwriter than the Lennon/McCartney team ever was . I mean how can you get any better than & quot ; with the lights out it 's less dangerous , here we are now entertain us ! & quot ; I would definitely say that Nirvana 's Nevermind is better than the Beatles White Album , Jimi Hendrix Band of Gypsies , The Doors 1st album , Yes ' Close to the Edge , Rush 's Moving Pictures , Pink Floyd 's Animals , or any Frank Zappa cd combined ...	-1
Nirvana is by far one of the most over rated bands of all time . Really after hearing how great this album was by everyone and their mother I was expecting it to be as great as a Beatles album . Finally when I heard it I had to stop the thing before I threw my cd player out a window . Sure Nirvana sounds great but the lyrics are almost childish . If you want some cd for some mindless fun go ahead and get it . & quot ; Smells like Teen Spirit & quot ; though is not the best song on the album .	-1
Remember when music required a melody and ( occasionally ) thought-provoking lyrics ? This is the album that changed all that .	-1
I fully expect a 0/50 helpful vote score.When Nevermind was released back in 1991 , its popularity stemmed not so much from the quality of its music as how different it was from a lot of what MTV was playing at the time . It was not Poison , Paula Abduhl , or New Kids On The Block , but rather a totally different style of rock music . Since Nirvana seemed to be one of the few bands of the time period that did n't care much about image or looks , they were automatically hailed as these modern rock saviors and to this day are considered one of the greatest rock bands of the nineties.Unfortunately , time did not treat the album too kindly as pretty much every mainstream rock band from Bush to Blink-182 owes at least a little to the album 's sound . And the fact of the matter is that when you look past the lack of make-up and hairspray , Nevermind is not that great an album.Part of its problem has to do with the lyrics themselves . Kurt Cobain 's lyrics were often very incoherant and almost randomly generated . This is just as well because most of them were just his whining about how horrible society treated him in the past . The song structures were n't much better with a lot of oversimplified riffs , merely adequate drumming , and all around lack of originality . That 's not to say there are n't a few high-points . In Bloom and Drain You are admittedly fun surf-rock songs , but two good songs out a total of twelve just does n't cut the mustard when better albums like Alice in Chains ' Facelift offer consistantly good music.In brief , I simply ca n't recommend this album to anybody other than fans of modern alternative music . And even that is a bit hard for me since most probably already own it . But if you 're looking for a good album from the grunge era , pick up AIC 's Dirt or Facelift instead . You will be glad you did .	-1
Nirvana 's debut album , `` In Utero '' was a complete disasterpiece and banned from the media for it 's blantant display of ripping off the more talented Puddle Of Mudd . You 'd think these guys would learn that copying superior bands is not the way to success , and that everyone hates you for doing so , but I guess these guys just ca n't get a clue . They are back with their most popular album , `` Nevermind '' . It immideantly created loads of controvery due to the fact that it had a naked baby on it ( something Puddle of Mudd had already done before with their album `` Come Clean '' . That 's just great ! First they rip off the sound of POM , now they 're ripping off the album covers too ! ) .This album was n't as successful as their debut , and they once again were banned from mainstream play , due to the fact that everyone thought Nirvana vocalist Kirk Konami was some kind of pedophile . So , if you are a die-hard fan of Puddle of Mudd and simply must have something similar before they release their next 5-star album , then get this imitation . But good luck finding it ... they successfully banned this thing in the United States .	-1
Ok , Im probably gon na get flamed here , but I dont care . I have never like Nirvana , nor will I ever like them . Kobain 's death was a tragic loss , I cared about him as a fellow human being , but never a musician . What else can I say about that . I grew up in the 70 's and 80 's , during the singer/songwriter time , and in the 80 's during the Punk , New Wave , Hairband time , so for me , when Nirvana came along with their NEO-PUNK anthems , I hated it all . They said that the GRUNGE MOVEMENT defined GEN X , well not for me . I rebuke that . Grunge killed everything else , which alot of you might think thats a good thing the Hairbands died , but I dont . The Gunge/NEO HIPPY scene of the early 90 's made me sick to my stomach ... .I was born in 67 , and my generation did not know a freaking thing about being hippies . Nirvana killed good music back then , as far as Im concerned , but hey , what is my opinion worth anyway . To each his own ... .	-1
OZZY OSBOURNE SAID YOU CA N'T KILL ROCK AND ROLL , WELL APPARENTLY HE WAS WRONG BECAUSE THIS CRAP BAND DID , NIRVANA SUCKS BIG TIME ... .THANKS FOR WRECKING ROCK AND ROLL.PISS POOR MUSIC..GRUNGE ROCK SUCKS ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .AND SO DO THE FANS THAT BUY IT..	-1
Forever called the most influential record of the nineties , I ca n't help but vomit upon hearing the failed attempt at music on this seminal grunge favorite . This is one of the worst records ever recorded . Kurt Cobain has the skill of a beginning guitar player , most of which have more . I could play this whole album after playing guitar for a month . I figured out Smells Like Teen Spirit the first couple of minutes I held a guitar in my hands . He sounds like he 's dying on these indecipherable and illogical lyrics . If I want to hear somebody scream , I can always pull out my Morbid Angel , and listen to David Vincent scream over Trey Azagtoth 's crushing talented guitar riffs . In other words , Nevermind is the worst album of all time . I found that it did make an attractive coaster though .	-1
This album is ok buts its kind of dull in places Its not the worst album in the world . Neither is it the best . The best album in the world is the Stones Exile on Main Street but hell , thats just my opinion and if you like Nevermind then good for you .	-1
IM SURE GLAD KURT COBAIN DIED ! WHOOOO ! LETS CELEBRATE 10 YEARS OF THE DEATH OF GRUNGE ! TEN MORE YEARS OF NO GRUNGE MUSIC WOULD BE SUPER ! HOPE U ROT IN HELL KURT COBAIN ! YOU 'D BE KISSING DAVE WILLIAMS ASS THERE ALONG WITH LAYNE STAYLEY '' S SWEET PATOOTEY !	-1
this was quite a bad album . there was no good riffs and the lyrics were awful ! i recommend you to find the nex one `` in utero '' . Kurt cobain is a great singer but this was n't his best work !	-1
First off I want to make this clear . I have every Album by Nirvana including the box set . I even dressed up as Kurt Cobain during my schools homecoming week.I want you to know that this band is up there with The Beatles and U2 as the most overrated band ever . Most of Kurt Cobain 's music sounds about as good as your alarm clock in the morning . The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because of Come as You Are ( the only good song off this album ) . Smells Like Teen Spirit is a terribly overrated song which should have left the radio over 10 years ago . The only reason this song is still around is because everyone feels sorrow for Kurt Cobain because of his suicide . If you want to listen to good Grunge music pick up Alice In Chains ' `` Dirt '' or Soundgarden 's `` Badmotorfinger '' . Nirvana had some all right material . I do like their later album `` In Utero '' . But this is bull . Nirvana is the band known to define grunge but there is so much better artists out there . here is my list of the best grunge bands.1 . Soundgarden2 . Alice In Chains ( my personal favorite but I have to hand it to Soundgarden ) .3 . Black Crowes4 . Pearl Jam5 . Nirvana ( honoralbe mentions are Meat Puppets , STP , and Samshing Pumpkins ) So you can say my review is not helpful but just remember I 'm not another fool dissing a band that I know nothing about . I probably know more about this band than you . But if insist on buying some Nirvana music pick up In Utero instead .	-1
Grunge ( thankfully ) died along with Kurt Cobain a decade ago . Did the stamping-out of hair metal really work to the world 's advantage ? In my opinion , hell no . The surfacing of grunge gave hundreds of talentless , undeserving people careers just because of their `` homeless chic '' look and persona . Grunge is all about image and nothing more . Would you call a band grunge if its members never wore flannel and jeans regularly and did n't have choppy guitar riffs ? No , you would n't . Now we 're subjected to grunge rip-off bands that include the likes of Smile Empty Soul and Three Days Grace because of the sh*t Kurt made popular . At least hair metal bands gave us something to rock and shout about . Take , for instance , Twisted Sister . They were an innovative , talented group of crossdresser metal musicians who sang about how those of us who are considered `` freaks '' do n't `` have to take it anymore '' ( meaning being put down for our straying from what society considers `` normal '' ) . What did Kurt have to rock and shout about ? Well , um , he had his own heroin addiction to whine about , and that was all . He also shouted about the Vanity Fair article that rightly portrayed him and his wife as the dope-shootin ' , child neglectin ' unfit parents they are . By the way , I should also mention that Kurt made death threats directed at the writer of said article because she let the world know the of Kurt and Courtney 's neglect of their child . So much for Kurt 's support for womens ' rights ! He repeately said he 'd bash her head in . He was such a f*ck up ! Nobody wants to hear about somebody else 's problems you ca n't relate to when you could hear about ones that you actually can ? No alienated teen out here can honestly relate to Kurt , because he was pushing 30 years old , and had more money than any of us will ever see in our lifetimes combined .	-1
While this is definately the best of Nirvana 's albums , it is *just* tolerable . I can not believe the praise this band has recieved , how can a band with so little talent get to be so popular and 'critically acclaimed ' ? Some of the praise they recieve is just absurd , 'The Beatles of our Generation ' ? Give me a break , the Beatles actually had a decent guitarist ( George Harrison ) , each of their records was a classic and they actually changed music for the BETTER . They also pushed new musical boundries and did n't recycle their own work over and over . What do we have to thank for after the grunge movement ? Just look at the corporate 'top 40 ' crap being shoved down our consumer throats . 'Badass ' rap , r & b ; ( those words have lost all meaning ) , bubblegum pop , generic punk rock and generally music that rides on image not actual talent . Music has no substance today , bands with real talent are few and far between . Thanks a lot Kurt , thanks a bunch.As for the actual content . The music is fairly simple , painful vocals ( nails on a chalkboard painful ) and rambling lyrics . A lyrical genius ? Since when does 'i dont care i dont care i dont care i dont mind i dont mind x 50 ' and 'A mulatto , an albino , a mosquito , my libido ' ( must have had his rhyming dictionary handy ) constitute as lyrical genius ? I 'm sure people are looking for meaning everywhere , so the lyrics are very 'meaningful ' to them . Simply throw the word 'god ' in , add a few 'teenage issues ' , play some repetitive guitar , screech like you are a hungry child in Africa , wear torn jeans and presto , you sound like Nirvana.Worst of all , this music makes you feel depressed . Who actually LIKES feeling depressed ? Do you really want to listen to someone crying about their 'teenage angst ' . Just look at Nirvana 's fans , i 'm not making generalisations here , but look at the people dancing in some of their film clips . One word comes to mind : zombies . Generic people with generic teen problems listening to generic music with no emotion , no expression whatsoever.Generic ... a word explaining all too well the music scene today .	-1
God , Nirvana have to be the most overrated band in existence . People obsess over Nirvana , but stop yourselves and think , aside from alright songwriting skills , what talent did Kurt Cobain really have ? he couldnt play guitar , my friend has played guitar for 6 months and can play almost every Nirvana song flawlessly . The riffs are simple and extremely repetitive , along with most of his lyrics , and he sounds like a dying camel when he sings . As for the other members- Dave Grohl is not a terrible drummer , but hes not great either , hes average at best . As for Novoselic , his bass lines are inaudible until Kurt starts whacking his guitar and screaming , and the song settles down again when hes done.The only reason Nirvana was revolutionary was because they were different . Metal and pop dominated the Tv and radio , which Kurt , unlike anybody else at the time , actively disliked . So , he formed a talentless band and practically revolutionized , if not created , grunge . The only reason so many people like Nirvana is because they havent heard of any of the other Seattle grunge bands , almost all of which are more talented than Nirvana . So Nirvana comes along , and all of a sudden it sucks to be a teenager and we need to throw away our hairspray and spandex and wear crappy flannel shirts and be depressed.In my opinion , Kurt killed himself because he soon realized what he had done . After Nirvana started a revolution in crappy music , hundreds of other bands were able to get record deals because they knew thats what the public wanted now , hence the birth of Green Day and pop punk . Green Day released Dookie , and soon hundreds of kids got interested in `` punk '' because they believed that was what punk was- catchy hooks and simple guitar riffs . Once Green Day got going , music was never the same again . The only metal still alive is classic metal bands making comebacks ( Megadeth , Iron Maiden ) and new underground VERY talented foreign metal bands ( Children of Bodom , In Flames ) . I believe if Kurt was still alive , even he would be crying because of what he had done to music . no longer do we have fun metal around , we have rap and terrible pop . thanks Nirvana . thanks alot.If youre debating whether to get this album , dont . by doing this you support a talentless revolution and instead of rebelling against todays music , you are simply buying right into what started it . Its a sad world in music right now , but at least we can live off the underground bands.As for the album itself : Smells Like Teen Spirit is the only alright song , as it has an infectius guitar riff , but Kurts crappy vocals muddle it . the rest of the songs have crappy simple and repetitive guitar riffs and sound like complete sh*t. not worth a dollar , but i was dumb enough to buy it .	-1
`` `` A person insults Pearl Jam and a person gets mad . Some people need to grow up . If a person does n't like pearl jam , they can say so . It 's their opinion '' And if a person does n't like Nirvana , they can just aswell state their opinion . Do n't be such an idiot and a hypocrite . Grow up.As for the Pearl Jam fan , I agree with him . If you think Nirvana is anywhere near Pearl Jam , you have bad taste in music .	-1
Oh please . Whomever keeps saying Pearl Jam is better than Nirvana needs to let up . Pearl Jam is worse than Nirvana , yet I despise both . They both sold out . Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet , and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major . Yet Kurt still did n't care to fufill what was asked of him . He had always been lazy , and Nevermind reflects that . It 's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi , and he refused to admit it . There 's no punk sensibility to it at all .	-1
If this was music ... let 's just say I 'm glad it 's not.Flash in the pan band with no real talent .	-1
What 's so big about these guys ? ? `` Appetite for Corruption '' is cool for fifteen year old boys who are just discovering hard rock music ... .and even most of them will outgrow it . This album does rock in spots , but I agree with an earlier reviewer who sagely claimed that this music is also quite predictable ... .and not very innovative , despite countless reviews that claim these guys breathed fresh commerical life and talent into late 80 's metal . My question is , by whose standards ? ? Sure the aura on `` Appetite for Consumption '' is a bit earthier than say , a Poison album , but is Axl Rose 's singing THAT much more inventive than any other screamer in the 80 's ? Slash was a talented axman , and Izzy was a great rhythm guitarist , but they were doing exactly what everybody else was doing back then , only with slightly better tunes . So was G 'n R the Second Coming of rock in roll in 1987 ? NOT TO ME ! ! The whole rock stardom thing also bugs me a bit . These guys had to brag all over about their over-indulging everywhere , just like that other joke of a band , Motley Crue . Real bands kept that kind of stuff on the low-down , completely hidden from public view . Axl Rose and Slash acted like they were the only ones in the world who ever got drunk on a daily basis ! ! Hey , I used to dig these guys hot and heavy , and not just this record . I owned all their crap , then eventually grew up . This album is like a quick fix of something addictive ; awesome for awhile , but eventually a drag and a nuisance , even a problem . For some reason , I always feel silly when listening to Guns 'N Roses , whether it 's this so-called `` masterpiece , '' or their later `` Use Your Dillusion '' guffaws.PEACE OUT , AXL FANS ! ! !	-1
wow how could they ever become popular . Oh i know why it is because of slash . now i must admit he is a great guitar player but i just dont get axl rose wath a bum . his voice is almost worse that the blink 182 singer ( almost ) . But seriosly has any body been listening to the same album i am i mean if it is i dont know what youre problem . I know the problem is that half of the people who reviewd this album havent even heard them . they just want to be cool so they go get the t-shirts from myrvens and pretend to like them so they can fit id . The other half are deaf , or have never heard real talent . over all dont get this album if you dont like a screechy voice that breaks glass blasted in your ear dont get it .	-1
First of all , in Axl Rose , we have one of the worst vocalists in the history of rock- indeed , when I listen to some of these songs ( such as `` It 's So Easy '' and `` Think About You '' ) I wonder why the hell anybody thought it 'd be a good idea to give this twerp the mic . He tries painfully hard to sound like a combination of Bon Scott and Johnny Rotten , and winds up completely missing the point- he does n't have an ounce of the former 's boozehound charisma or the latter 's seething menace . Instead , he comes off sounding like the whiney , egotistical , self-righteous blowhard that he is , attacking these songs with the kind of banshee screech usually reserved for drunken frat guy idiots at three in the morning . He 's annoying , repetitive , unoriginal , and moronic . Naturally , he thinks he 's a genius.The rest of the band is better- Bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Steven Adler make for a pretty good rhythm section . Besides , Duff has a really cool name . In addition , Izzy ( Stradlin ) and Slash are excellent guitarists- they have a way with face melting solos and jackhammer riffs . Too bad they were given such horrible songs to work with.I mean , what the hell is supposed to be so good about these songs ? I do n't even like the big 3 : `` Paradise City '' is annoyingly repetitive , with an incredibly dull chorus that spills into excruciatingly cheesy verses . It 's about as hard-rockin ' as your least favorite arena pop anthem , and its dated just as well ( i.e. , horribly ) . `` Welcome To The Jungle '' fares a bit better : Axl 's lyrics are pure bad boy posturing , but the riff is cool and there 's some real attitude to the whole thing . Still , it is n't that hard rock masterpiece that some see it as . And if you ask me , `` Sweet Child O ' Mine '' is an unbelievably overrated power ballad with a dull melody and some painfully insincere vocals.Those three tracks set the template- this album is full of labored , unoriginal sleaze rock ( `` Mr. Brownstone , '' `` Nightrain '' ) , dull hard rock workouts ( `` It 's So Easy , '' whose casual misogyny is more unintentionally funny than offensive ) , egotistical posturing ( `` Out Ta Get Me '' ) , and cheesy , laughably insincere balladry ( `` Think About You '' is excruciating where `` Sweet Child O ' Mine '' is merely annoying ) . `` You 're Crazy '' is pure fake sleaze , and `` Anything Goes '' is instantly forgettable.There are a few decent songs here- `` My Michelle '' is suitably tough and funky , and `` Rocket Queen '' has an okay chorus , even though those annoying sexual moans during the instrumental break make want to kill somebody . Still , even the best moments here are little more than mediocre . Plus , the whole thing has this really glitzy 80s production that 's just irritating as hell . This is absolute crap .	-1
Reality check.The Velvet Underground 's first album was released in 1967 - This album inspired everyone from David Bowie to the Clash to start playing music , and has proven to be much more influential than Appetite For Destruction.And if you think Appetite for Destruction is the best debut album of the last 20 years ... Reality check.Pearl Jam 's 'Ten ' was released in 1991 - Is almost every band on the radio trying to sound like Pearl Jam ? ( creed ; nickelback ; default , etc.. ) or Guns N Roses ? Exactly ... Best debut album of all time ? Not even close .	-1
Let me tell you something . This band was never `` cool '' , and just because they were a bit famous back in `` their day '' does n't mean they are good . Just because they got a couple of videos on MTV does n't mean they are worth jack now . Times change , and now MTV only plays GOOD rock music and these losers are nowhere to be seen . I 've never listened to this album but I can tell it sucks just from looking at pictures of the band . None of the rockers on TRL or the mall look like these guys so that means they must be bad . If you do n't look cool then you ca n't produce good music . That 's why Beethoven sucks . Thank god Nirvana saved music in the 90s .	-1
This album sucks ! ! ! There are some very mean dirty sexy drugsongs on this this is just as bad as Back in Black from ACDC.The only good songs on this would be the 3 big hits featuringWELCOME TO THE JUNGLE , PARADISE CITY , & SWEET CHILD O ' MINE.There are only 3 good obscure GNR songs such as IT 'S SO EASY , MR . BROWNSTONE , & 14 YEARS from Use Your Illusion 2 . Don'tbuy this , buy GNr Greatest Hits insted .	-1
Embrace , though arguably the first `` emo '' record as others have pointed out , is simply anoying . All aspects of the record ( vocally , musically , lyrically , and production wise ) are sub-par . Ian Mackaye , though boasting places in two stellar bands ( the now legendary Minor Threat and Fugazi , the latter my personal preference ) , does a horendous job handling the vocal patterns and lyrics on the album . Songs like `` Money '' and `` Do Not Consider Yourself Free '' read like scrapped Minor Threat lyrics far too pointless to be used , basic , ( even then ) cliched , pseudo-political rants ( against greed , government , etc. ) . Also , Mackaye 's voice does not suit the music at all , his monotone yell just sits there , not even melding with the music . He ca n't be called `` off-key '' simply because he does not even attempt to make any sort of recognizable notes . Musically , it is typical post-hardcore / muzak fare . Lame guitar riffs and repetitive drum lines ( save for a few choice moments in which the music can be mildly enjoyable , and even catchy to some extent ) . Fans who think Ian Mackaye can do no wrong would do well to pick this album up , same goes for collectors and completists , but for listeners of music , stay away from this album.3.5 / 10	-1
Lem me tell you something about the Fugazi 's . This is supposed to be their best record , so back in about 1991 I went to see 'em at my local college music venue which shall remain nameless , and has since been turned into an Arby 's . Why do these guys have to be so serious ? I know , I know you 're from washington d.c , where Bill Clinton was born , but that do n't mean you 's so much smarter than the audience in said club/Arby 's . On stage they was prattling on about how they did n't like how the crowd was so unruly . We 's unruly because we do n't have good jobs or much money from touring the country like you Fugazi 's do . So as punishment to their fans , they stopped playin ' after about 4 songs . It really did n't improve my attitude about their band or their music or washington dc .	-1
do n't waste your time with small minded rackets such as this . get London Calling instead . do n't cause yourself to be a gel haired idiot with no life and no brains .	-1
when i bought this i was n't expecting to hear boring instrumental music , and rollin 's beatneck poetry . Black Flag is a good band but their musicianship is n't very good , especially to put out instrumental songs . buy some of the others like First Four Years , My War , and Everything Went Black instead	-1
i dunno , one could say this was a progression from their Ramones - influenced hardcore beginnings , but i find it much less entertaining.with Greg Ginn 's `` noodling '' ( read : noise ) coupled with Henry Rollin 's poet aspirations , this just comes across as pretentious crap to me , especially listening today	-1
Well , as the title states , this was the beginning of the end of a once great band . Husker Du put out countless amazing records that epitomized hardcore/punk-ish emo/indie from around 1980 on . But on this one finally did a 180 and changed direction . A change that many of us did n't like . They still have their share of hardcore fans who like them but they still went down the tubes anyway you look at it.But anyone who truly loved what they did on LSR all the way through to New Day Rising would vomit in their mouth ( as I did ) after listening to this horrible sign of their catastrophic decline . This was the second one they put out in '85 and I guess being so prolific , internal struggles , and passing of time caused them to abandon who and what they once were.This album takes the poppiness leanings of New Day Rising to such a ( lack of ) ambitious slant that it sounds like REM or any other jangly pop band at the time played on the radio . Gone is the roughness , cheap production values , SPOT on the boards , affiliation with a real label SST , uniqueness , and devil may care attitude that made them Husker Du . But it was all sadly replaced by a radio friendly , mainstream , glossy , overproduced , sellout piece of garbage caricature of what they used to be . And it would only get worse on every record after this until they closed up shop after 'Warehouse ... By then their transformation into Britney Spears pop territory had been complet . On here they were almost half way there.If you know music and Husker DU like I do , buy Land Speed Record and everything else up to and including New Day Rising . Erase everything else they did afterwards from your memories . I know I have ; )	-1
I love husker du ... . this album is not . The guitar isdrowded out , bob 's screams suck and out of sync , singingsucks , sound quality sucks . The music is n't discernable.Its really sloppy , even for husker du . What is up the two track thing ? OK unique , but still ... you either have to wait or forward till you think is the next song . For a better mini album , go to metal circus . and this album:26 minutes , not good . ( ... ) . Not enjoyable .	-1
I bought this CD because KAISER is always mentioned in conjunction with GLENN PHILLIPS . Having fallen in love with the eccentric brilliance that is PHILLIPS , I expected something in the same vain . WRONG , VERY BLOODY WRONG ! ! ! ! ! The other reviews are obviously written by KAISER fans . I love the guitar and most forms of musik , but this is in no way a pleasure to listen to . If KAISER is a great ( or even good ) guitarist , he certainly does n't let me know with this CD . Some of the playing may be meritorious , but the song interpretations are horrid . The songs chosen are mostly horrid . The sound is horrid . Most of the playing sounds deliberatly different for differences sake . At no stage does it sound like the interpretation of a virtuoso guitarist . The covers range from cheese ( ODE TO BILLY JOE / MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE / ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW THEME ) to bizarre ( and almost unlistenable ) BEEFHEART interpretations.Breaking up these terrible covers with horrid , over distorted and totaly nonsensical solos does not make this musik interesting . It certainly does n't do it for me and raises protests from anyone I have subjected to this CD.I am not sure what form of musik you need to like to like this , maybe the soothing sounds of a jackhammer at 5 o'clock next to your bed . Playing some tracks on this CD at 5 o'clock would have an identical effect .	-1
I 'm a big fan of this Winter Solstice series , have all of them & most i rate 5 stars . i see other reviewers here like this cd for some of the reasons i dont like it , but that 's music . we all have different tastes.amyway , find the 4 vocals jarring , even though they are pleasant . i play Windham Hill CDs when i want a break from vocals.besides the vocal tracks , the instrumentals here are too divergent , steel drums , a little nutcracker , some solstice stuff & the first volume in the series where a few xmas carols creep in.so ure left with a Windham Hill CD with no focus . it 's not solstice , its not xmas , its not throughly meditative . it does sound like a random Windham Hill sampler which is fine for picking out the few good tunes , but given the high bar set by the other CDs in the series , this one is a letdown .	-1
I have Winter 's Solstice 1,2,3,5 and 6 , and I must say that this one does nothing for me . The originals in the Winter 's Solstice series were produced by Will Ackerman and really evoke the spirit of Christmas and winter time . The ones produced by Dawn Atkinson also keep that feeling alive and are great to listen to , but when I listen to this one ( produced - and some songs written by - Brian Keane ) , there is no real feeling that what I 'm hearing has much to do with the winter season at all . Some titles do stand out ( January Stars by George Winston , Snowfall by Liz Story ) but for the most part , you could put this CD on any old time of year and have some inobtrusive background dinner music . Really - what do titles such as Secret Places , Sonata for Two Clarinets , Winkus McGinkus , Yesterday 's Rain , The Clearness of Light , and Western Sky have to do with the objective of this sampler ? Other titles allude to a connection with the implications of the winter season - Joyful Times , Simple Praise , In the Winter 's Pale , Snow Dance - but they are not strong enough to carry the titled theme of this CD.I give it 2 stars as the recording quality and the musicianship are fine , but it 's an uninspiring compilation to listen to . If you want Christmas and/or winter inspiration , you have many other fine options in the series .	-1
Sadly , this Queen record is light years behind its predecessors . I was profoundly disappointed with this album upon it 's 1977 release . I could never bring myself to purchase it then as I was subject to it ad nauseam via indiscriminating peers and mainstream radio . I bought it a couple of years ago hoping with the passage of almost 30 years my stance would have softened . With the exception of 'All Dead ' and 'It 's Late ' this is a disposable record . Utter dreck . Actually 'Shear Heart Attack ' is OK too but nothing here stands up to their groundbreaking earlier work . They set the standard with NIGHT AT THE OPERA and any of their other releases from 73-76 . INNUENDO is also quite good . This one is abysmal . To say `` I hate it '' ( * ) is pretty extreme , however , simply saying `` I do n't like it '' ( ** ) does n't exactly express how little regard I have for this record . This is where one of my favorite bands simply lost it .	-1
Even though this is Queen 's best-selling album ( just 4,000 copies sold ) , it was NO match for the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack , which is the best-selling album before Michael Jackson 's `` Thriller ! '' Ignore classic rock nerds and chart geeks who will say otherwise . This album , by all accounts , is bad . Thanks .	-1
Many call this Queen 's worst album and labelled it as a `` disco '' album because some of the songs are in a style similar to that of their hit `` Another One Bites The Dust '' , a huge crossover rock/pop/disco/R & B ; hit in the U.S. Not all the material found here is disco or R & B ; but at least half the material is . I do have to give the band credit for trying something different but the timing for it was just all wrong and it ended up failing miserably . Out of all the disco/R & B ; numbers on this album the only one I really like a lot is `` Back Chat '' . That song happens to have been written by bass player John Deacon , who also wrote `` Bites The Dust '' . Perhaps the rest of the band should have left the writing of the R & B ; type material to John because the rest of the band 's efforts in that area left something to be desired . `` Dancer '' and `` Body Language '' ( a U.S. Top 20 hit strangely enough but then again I 've never heard it played on the radio so perhaps that ranking is misleading ) are especially pitiful . Not even the added guitars on the remixed version of `` Body Language '' can save it . `` Staying Power '' at least sounded somewhat better when they performed it live . The rest of the album contains more standard type Queen songs , of which the best tracks are the David Bowie collaboration `` Under Pressure '' , the rocking `` Put Out The Fire '' , and the ballad `` Las Palabras De Amor '' .Here is how I rated each song on a scale of 1 to 5:1 . Staying Power 2/52 . Dancer 1/53 . Back Chat 4/54 . Body Language 1/55 . Action This Day 3/56 . Put Out The Fire 4/57 . Life Is Real 2/58 . Calling All Girls 3/59 . Las Palabras De Amor 4/510 . Cool Cat 2/511 . Under Pressure 5/512 . Body Language ( Remix ) 1/5Overall this is one of Queen 's worst efforts but with Queen their worst efforts are better than a lot of other bands ' best efforts so if you know someone who owns a copy you might want to borrow it just for a listen since there are a few good tracks on here .	-1
What happened in 1980 that made a lot of good bands turn sour ? Disco ! Queen was a victim of the times and perhaps a horrible identity crisis . While Body Language still pops up on greatest hits packages , that track is not enough to warrant buying this album . Stick with Queen 's 70 's releases .	-1
Queens 's brand of catchy pop metal was hugely popular in the 70s , but now it all pretty much sounds the same . This album includes the singles ` Fat Bottom Girls ' and ` Bicycle Race ' , a dubious benefit . If you a casual fan , you probably would be best of with a greatest hits , there is nothing especially inspiring here .	-1
Queen do n't rock ! And A Night At the Opera is a perfect example of why not . Far too pretentious to be considered rock . Avoid !	-1
So many amazing bands that are still rocking the world today came from the 80 's : Poison , TS , Cinderella , GNR the list goes on . Some of the worst 80 's bands are also still around like Stryper . This band has no talent every song sounds like To Hell with the Devil ruined with lame vocals , half riffs and just crap lyrics . Avoid Strpyer if you like good rock/metal music .	-1
I must say this now and it will make my reviews ( or Stryper 's music ) more readable . I am not religious in any way and I am certainly not a Christian . I got into Stryper in the 80 's because I liked their ballads and some of the harder stuff from the other albums . I bought this AFTER I heard those . What I have noticed about their first two releases ( 'Soldiers Under Command ' being the other ) is the lyrics are way more religious . And most of the other songs are ballads . I do n't know if they figured out that appealing to a wider audience sells more records ( as in 'To Hell With The Devil ' & 'In God We Trust ' ) or just sold-out . Either way , I like their later stuff much better . That is not to say this is a bad album , whatsoever . It 's just not my type of music . I feel like I am being preached at . That is my fault for listening to the record . But on this one , they sound really low-budget . The only two songs I like here are `` You Know What To Do '' and the ultra-sappy ballad , `` My Love I 'll Always Show '' . I would recommend getting their 2 later 80 's albums , but if you are really into Christian hard rock , then check this out .	-1
Now Queen has a good sound , but this soundtrack does n't show that at all . In fact there is only one song on this album , the theme to Flash Gordon , which is played 18 times on this album and the song is n't that complex , so it grows old real fast . The only difference between songs is that there is movie clips laid down over the music . It is almost like the movie has been put on cd . And the music does n't sound like Queen , it has this wacky electronic sound to it . The only reason I gave it two stars is because the Flash Gordon remix ( the Final track ) is n't that bad , in fact it is sort of funny . Whoever mix it seemed like they had fun doing it . Besides that I would suggest staying away from this soundtrack , if you want a good Queen soundtrack , pick up the Highlander soundtrack ! !	-1
At the time of the release of `` The Works '' Queen were a band that was about as big as any band that ever recorded on the planet . They sold out huge stadiums all over the world ... save for the U.S. , and sold a butt-load of records ... save for U.S. What can I say , the U.S. can be remarkably shallow and trendy in it 's rock and roll , but hey , we invented it , so we do what we want . Rock and roll is an American invention which is kinda cool for me . Back to the album . After the lukewarm reception of `` hot space '' , which was incredibly underrated in the US , Queen went back to their comfortable position of writing good ol ' rock and roll ... .Queen style . The problem here is virtually all the songs miss their mark . Maybe by just a hair but `` The Works '' never comes close to any of the preceeding Queen efforts . Many songs sound contrived `` Tear it Up '' , `` Man on the Prowl '' , `` Hammer to Fall '' and a few are pretty good , `` Radio Ga-Ga '' , and `` It 's a Hard Life '' . Other such as `` Machines ... '' , and `` I want to break free '' , and `` Keep passing the open window '' sound more like album filler , which is NOT what the Queen legacy had produced so far . One problem the band rectified in latter efforts was the sole songwriter contributions of songs . After the mediocre , and the slighly worse `` A Kind of Magic '' , the band started sharing songwriting credits between them giving full credit to the band 's namesake . This showed a marked improvement in the quality of album songs ending their career on the remarable high notes of the slick `` The Miracle '' and the stunning `` Innuendo '' . This effort `` The Works '' is a low-water mark for the great band , but do n't fret , the times dictated radical changes in rock and roll , and the band never was reduced to rest on their laurels . Queen is one of rock 's all-time best bands , but `` The Works '' is not indicative of this fact .	-1
I set out to buy Live Magic determined to like it . I tried , I really did , to block out the scathing reports that I 've read here on this very page . Hell , I thought , it has a nice cover ; all my favourite songs ; a few tracks from Wembley ( the world 's best ever concert ) ; so it 's missing a bit of Bohemian Rhapsody ... well , it 's got nice liner pictures ( I was getting desperate at this point ) ... and it 's live ! All live albums are great ... and so it went on . In the end I plumped for it uneasily , turning down Jazz and Innuendo and suchlike . I realize now that it was a mistake of grotesque proportions . I mean the beginning 's all right but the only highlight after the first six songs is the expertly delivered HAMMER TO FALL , incidentally the only song on the album to have been taken from the Live at Wembley and the best song on the CD . WE WILL ROCK YOU , IS THIS THE WORLD WE CREATED and FRIENDS WILL BE FRIENDS have all been mercilessly edited so together they only represent about four and a half minutes playing time , and the powers that be at EMI have done themselves a big favour by cutting out , in their infinite wisdom , the infamous operatic BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY bit as well as about a half of WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS , i.e . a chorus and a verse . Either they were on an extremely tight budget or they failed to realise how important these things are to Queen fans worldwide . Or possibly both . On a lighter note , the songs worth listening to are , well , basically they 're the ones that have n't been cropped , like ONE VISION , employed as a sort of flamboyant intro , A KIND OF MAGIC featuring outstanding solos from all four members and an all-out team effort , UNDER PRESSURE , which is , needless to say , brilliant , and ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST , always a live favourite and an oppurtunity to get some rapport going between Freddie and the crowd , to go with HAMMER TO FALL . Actually TIE YOUR MOTHER DOWN , SEVEN SEAS OF RHYE and RADIO GA-GA have all been meddled with by the people of infinite resource and sagacity at the EMI headquarters but still preserve some majesty and turn out to be excellent songs after a few listenings . Well all right then , they 're all very good songs which just makes me even madder towards the Antichrists at the EMI HQ . Why , oh why , did they have to obliterate the operatic bit ? Is there a five-minute limit on all of the CD tracks ? Are they just stupid ? Am I babbling ? Should I stop writing garbage and proceed to the conclusion ? OK . I would advise you not to buy this album and instead go for Live At Wembley or Live Killers , unless you 're going for the whole hog and just have to get it . This is a compilation you do not need . Listening to perfectly good songs being hacked at shamelessly by supposed experts is more an ordeal than a live Queen experience . phantomslug has spoken . Let it be . Oh and , er , if you do n't mind clicking the & quot ; yes & quot ; button just underneath this review , that would be great ...	-1
This album would be pretty good , IF they did n't cut sections out of 12 of the 15 songs . What is up with that ? Do n't you think you could remove some of the lesser known songs and spare the good parts on songs that people usually buy the CD for . I mean , they cut the piano part out of & quot ; Bohemian Rhapsody & quot ; . I 'm surprised I did n't give them only 1 star for that stunt . Another big turn-off about this album is when my mom was in this room checking her e-mail while I was listening to the album , she was singing & quot ; I Want To Break Free & quot ; . I listen to a diverse selection of music , so of course , this could be expected sometimes . It still makes you feel upset , though . I guess I am trying to say that even though this music may be really cool to teenagers , such as myself , there is a big chance their parents will like it as well ( which may not be wanted ) . Oh well , it 's the music that counts . Queen is powered with guitar solos and awesome melodies . They are truly one of the greatest rock acts of all times . For that alone , I gave them 2 of 5 stars .	-1
Just got these . The disc surfaces are flawless . Played in my laptop , playback keeps hanging , freezing , pick a word . I think DRM is the reason .	-1
When Queen recorded `` Made in heaven '' , Freddie Mercury was literally dying , and he wanted to record as many songs as possible before he died . I believe sadness and nostalgic might blur the judgement regarding the value of this album , because it is not worth an average rating of 4.5 stars . That would be obvious when you compare `` Made in heaven '' with `` Sheer heart attack '' or `` News of the world '' just to name a few . Among the finer moments are the very good and emotional `` Mother love '' together with `` Too much love will kill you '' ( originally a Brian May solo effort ) but the overall impression is that time was running out and the band could not come up with enough good material so therefore , `` Made in heaven '' is an album of too many fillers or mediocre songs . Too bad , but that 's the truth according to me !	-1
I never could stand why Queen are classics ? ? They are awful and they suckand they certainly the most overrated band after Pink Floyd and before Pearl Jam . I just hate them..all their songs are lousy and put me to sleep especially horrible trash tunes like Bohemian Rhapsody , Fat Bottommeed Girls , and We Are The Champions . This may only contain the band 's single decent song which I always enjoyed We Will Rock You . I just wish that there was a star that was -30 and a 3 stars for We Will Rock You . Stay away from albums by Queen , Pink Floyd , Nirvana , Pearl Jam , and AC/DC who are trash and only meant for drug addicts ! Foreigner , Dire Straits , and Metallica are much , much better ! Get their albums insted .	-1
On this album you have a band with emerging talent and a lot of energy , but still trying to find themselves . At least one songs sounds like Foo Fighters , another sounds like Soul Asylum , etc . There IS some good writing on this album , and some of it grows on you over time , but for the most part it is not Fastball doing what they do best . This is them thinking they had to ROCK most of the time , and that is just not their strong point . They 're excellent when they calm down a bit ( not saying ballads , though they have some fine ones ) and write and sing great songs with great hooks and harmonies . I would love to hear them re-cut some of these songs with their knowledge of arrangements and recording techniques.If you are new to Fastball and like the Beatles and other great power pop I would save this album for last in filling out your collection . You should start with `` Little White Lies '' or `` All the Pain Money Can Buy '' instead . If , however , you 're young and full of hormonal energy or just prefer it loud and fast , with often hard-to-hear vocals , `` Make Your Mama Proud '' IS the place to start for you .	-1
Under the guidance of Hans Zimmer , John Powell created a melodramatic , sleek and thematic score for the movie Face/Off . Unfortunately for fans of the music , it 's not presented very well on this CD.Mosty , it 's just noise . Hardly any of it is exciting and all the best cues from the film are absent . The inclusion of a clip from 'Messiah ' in the first track is truly awesome , and a nice touch by Powell . With the exception of a couple of misjudged stingers Track 1 'Face On ' is the only one that is decent all the way through.Some of the track titles are stupidly named and give no clue as to what part of the film they occur in and most tracks are badly assembled suites of random parts of the movie . The music that booms during the Hummer/Airplane and speedboat chase is called 'Furniture ' on this CD ? What 's THAT supposed to mean ? Most Media Ventures scores released onto CD are this way . If the Face/Off score CD featured all the music from the movie ( about 80 minutes say ) in chronological order then it would have been a big hit . But it 's not . It 's arranged in randomly assorted suites with silly track names with the great music substituted for noise and sound effects . What were they thinking ? Take a look at this asinine track listing.1 . Face On ( 04:57 ) 2 . 80 Proof Rock ( 04:29 ) 3 . Furniture ( 07:12 ) 4 . The Golden Section Derma Lift ( 03:15 ) - What on Earth does this nonsense mean ? ? ? 5 . This Ridiculous Chin ( 06:51 ) 6 . No More Drugs For That Man ( 07:27 ) 7 . Hans ' Loft ( 03:37 ) 8 . Ready For The Big Ride , Bubba ( 03:54 ) Total runtime is 41 minutes and 42 seconds . Hollywood Records will never re-release this . As a subsidiary of Disney the score release falls under Intrada now , who are not keen on releasing anything by Media Ventures.Music as heard in the film 4/5Music as presented on this CD 1/5Overall 2/5	-1
This is a case in point about what was wrong with the 80 's , my least favorite decade musically . In the 70 's , you could trust a union of musicians of this magnitude to produce scorching , jaw dropping prog rock . But in the 80 's it only amounted to overproduced , manufactured for mass consumption , calculated FM corporate rock . There is nothing prog about Asia . Anyone who thinks this is prog needs to listen to these musicians in their better days of glory with UK , Yes , ELP , King Crimson . My opinion on this one will never change with time . File with GTR under 80 's bad idea supergroups .	-1
If this is not THE most over rated CD ever , then it is certainly a contender for the title . If it was n't for Cobain 's suicide , no one would care about Nirvana today . But , just like Jim Morrison has kept the Doors on the `` cult following '' list , Cobain 's death will keep everyone wanna-be emo child wistful of shooting themselves.As for the music , I could only say that shooting yourself does n't make someone a `` great writer '' or a `` great musician '' and Nirvana proves this though and though . On this particular CD , Cobain mumbles his way though at least 1/3 of the lyrics while making absolutely no sense during the other 2/3 that are intelligible . In one particular song he outright lies when he sings the lyrics `` no , I do n't have a gun '' ... and I think we all know now that he in fact did have a gun .	-1
When the Cure 's Robert Smith officially joined the Banshees as guitarist , I expected great things . Dazzle and Swimming Horses are the only decent songs on this album . A missed opportunity .	-1
Thought my attraction for a few Peter Gabriel songs scattered here and there would make me into and actual fan so I bought this anthology in hopes of understanding what he had to say . Nope . Like the most recent Dave Matthews and the DMB release ( Away from the World ) the messege is too disjointed to understand the sound or the message . Sorry . to each his own I guess	-1
Whitesnake were always an anomaly amongst rock ( ? ) bands . Most of the original WS were from 70s classic rock and heavy blues bands , and their early albums reflected this , but then the 80s hit and metal became trendy and fashionable , and WS reformed themselves to be the ultimate hair metal band . The band became a farce , with the only constant being David Coverdale , who then still had one of the best rock voices around , and a rotating band of musicians , all of whom were good , but combined made WS possibly the ugliest ( and the oldest ) hair metal bands around , which did nothing for their popularity.This is an OK album at the start of their downfall . If you really like mediocre 80s hair metal ballads this is for you , if you like blues-rock music pick their earlier albums .	-1
I 've given fair listenings to both this and ENGLISH SETTLEMENT . I wanted to like the stuff , but is Partridge trying to be the English boy-next-door or something ? The lyrics are clearly trying to be clever but the rhymes fall flat for me . And the music is trying to break through to some kind of originality , to add a dash of the progressive to the pop , but that fails too , goes nowhere . And that voice , ohhh ... like an early 80s New Wave Brit guy trying to say something alternately playful and serious but in that rounded , wry fashion that drags the notes . And why is he so ... happy ?	-1
When I was in love with this show , I saw it on Broadway . After the show , I said to myself & quot ; What would posess someone to write a show set in early 1800 's France and put modern music into it ? & quot ; That 's right : The French . Only the French would bastardize one of their tongue 's greatest works into a meaningless cornucopia of power ballads and failes attempts at pastiches . It is not funny , it is not moving , it is over blown , overrated , and truly a terrible show .	-1
I bought this CD thinking it was a newly released highlights CD of the Original London Cast CD with Colm Wilkinson , Patti LuPone , Michael Ball & amp ; Francis Ruffle . IT 'S NOT ! What a great way to get people to bye the CD . I really have n't listened to it because I was disgusted at the fact that I was lured into buying a CD under false pretences ! ( I did listen to some and it sounds like Kareoke music and Fantine was vocally weak . This is not a cast recording but a STUDIO RECORDING . ) I can tell you the actors who sing the parts though ( Something I would 've wanted to know before buying , but I did n't have that chance , so here it is . ) VALJEAN & amp ; JAVERT = John Curl , FANTINE & amp ; COSETTE = Lindsey Stafford Smith , MARIUS= Christopher Smith , ENJOLRAS= Adam Pinter , THENARIDIER=Julian Emery , M. THENARDIER= Catherine Watson.Uhhh , why have the same man sing 2 different parts . Okay , maybe I can see the same woman singing the mother and daughter , but the rivals ? Song List : AT THE END OF THE DAY , -- I DREAMED A DREAM , -- WHO AM I ? , -- FANTINE 'S DEATH , -- CONFRONTATION , -- MASTER OF THE HOUSE , -- STARS , -- ABC CAFE , -- RED AND BLACK , -- DO YOU HERE THE PEOPLE SING , -- A HEART FULL OF LOVESongs only from Act I of Les Miz ! Anyhow , the singers could turn out to be good for all I know , but I was just upset that it was n't what it said it was . Although it was n't listed as having Colm and Patti it did say & quot ; Original London Cast. & quot ; So , at least now you can purchase this CD fully aware that it 's not the London Cast ! : )	-1
This composer/performer is so overrated , and so banal and musically poor , that it is amazing anything at all was ever released in his name.Absolute tripe and horrible in all musical aspects .	-1
Berlin were a great band from the eighties , but this compilation is only worth two stars for having such a poor selection of tracks on it . The first three Berlin albums could easily cough up more songs than the 12 featured here , for example & quot ; Tell Me Why & quot ; and & quot ; Pleasure Victim & quot ; surely deserve to be aired again , as well as & quot ; When We Make Love & quot ; . It 's a good place to start , but I would recommend buying the first three albums instead if you can find them , because this CD is not really covering the & quot ; best of & quot ; Berlin	-1
Hey , I 've listened to most of their atrocious albums , and this one by far is the worst . It 's bad music , lousy singing , and totally offensive lyrics . Writing songs that put other people down is the lowest form of bigotry . So , Gen X , you think this is great rock music ? Listen to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and experience truly great rock music .	-1
`` Good boys do n't make rock'n'roll . Bad boys do . `` Guys , this album ca n't even be called rock . It 's just very bad quality smooth pop , that was SO unfortunate to put out `` One in a Million '' ( which only makes it worse ) .There a lot of GREAT rock albums out there . So , do yourself a favor and pass this record .	-1
I 'm not that excited , but it has at least one excellent song : `` Jelly roll '' . The rest is average heavy metal . Sometimes too frantic if you know what I mean .	-1
Man , what all those reviews below are talking about ? ! This album is nothing more than hair metal . And worst of all : hair metal coming at the end of the nineties , when all this stupid genre was falling apart ( Thanks God ! ) Just check the guys in the photos of the album ( Sykes , Franklin and Appice ) . They are dressed in the best Poison and Ratt way ! And about what riff you 're talking in & quot ; Riot & quot ; ? There 's only a resemblance of a riff , it 's sheer pop metal ! ! And talk about the drums sound of Carmine Appice . It 's that typical & quot ; digitalized & quot ; sound of that period , it seems a machine.I just do n't get so many praise for this album . It deservedly failed , not due to Geffen 's lack of promotion , but due to its sheer mediocrity .	-1
As usual with Audio Fidelity releases the sound is awfull . Compare this cd with the similar tracks on the Rhino 3 cd compilation-The Rhino beats it flat out . I do not know what Hoffman and Gray do with the rematering job other than their releases just sounds awfull . Flat , dull , veiled , compressed , like a thick blanket in front of the speakers.A complete waste of money to buy AF release of this album . A pity sins the music is very good .	-1
Asia 's Then & Now is basically a partial compilation album/studio EP with six hits and four previously unreleased recordings . & # 34 ; Days Like These & # 34 ; is the most notable new recording here which is on every Asia compilation and peaked at # 64 on the Billboard Hot 100 . & # 34 ; Prayin ' 4 a Miracle & # 34 ; was released as a single that did not chart at all but was played during the band 's 1990-91 tour ( with Pat Thrall filling in for Steve Howe on guitar during the tour ) . The other two new tracks : & # 34 ; Am I in Love ? & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Summer & # 34 ; are just there to fill the album . The previously released tracks here are an interesting mix of five top 30 charted singles in the US and & # 34 ; Voice of America & # 34 ; , more of a fan favorite from & # 34 ; Go. & # 34 ; There are many other hits that are missing here such as & # 34 ; Sole Survivor & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; The Heat Goes On & # 34 ; , and & # 34 ; Go & # 34 ; to name a few . What Asia should have really done was record a new studio album and then release a & # 34 ; greatest hits & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; best of & # 34 ; compilation since this album has such an unusual assortment of tracks . I 'd only buy this album if you are starting or completing an Asia vinyl collection . If you are looking to get all of the tracks on this album on CD , i 'd go for & # 34 ; Gold & # 34 ; as it includes all the studio recorded tracks from Asia in 1982-1990 . If you are looking for a single disc CD compilation i 'd pick up & # 34 ; The Definitive Collection & # 34 ; as it covers most of Asia 's charted singles and includes a 12 & # 34 ; remix of & # 34 ; Go & # 34 ; .	-1
Ok , I will start out by saying i am a HUGE Asia fan . Big Fan of Wetton . Very excited that they are back together and love their last 2 albums , Phoenix and Omega . I bought this in 1990 and was excited at that time they were back together . Disappointed no Howe , but was happy none the less . Wanted a full studio album but was happy with anything at the time.The album was designed to `` reintroduce '' the band and include 5 tracks from Asia and Alpha . Good Songs but would 've like to have seen Sole Survivor . The new included one song from Astra 5 years ealier , Voice of America - good song , but not new to Asia fans . Then 4 new tracks . DAys like These is a good track , very different from what they had done before ( wriiten by Steve Jones whomever that is ) . Prayin ' 4 a Miricle - co-written by David Cassidy - Nuff said i think . Not horrible but not great . Not to their standards in my opinion.Then it drops off a cliff with 2 songs that are just garbage . Left over from Astra and there is a reason they were left over . They suck . Am I In Love - sappy soft pathetic ballad that i ca n't even listen to straight through . Just bad . Then Summer ( Ca n't last too long ) . I mean WTF ? Who heard this and said lets put this on the record ? Fire him . This is an embarrassing track . I remember hearing this when i got it and thinking thats not good ( and i was dying for anything from these guys ) .If you want a best of buy either Gold or Heat of the Moment 1982-1990 , If you want tracks from Wetton/Downes not on Asia albums at the time , they released an album with a bunch of left oversWetton And Downes . Most are better than Am I in Love and Summer.This should be out of print .	-1
Only 2 songs worth putting on my IPOD - Heat of the Moment & Only Time Will Tell . The rest are awlful .	-1
let me explain the title of my review : the arrangements are gorgeous throughout : the nocturnal , mysterious atmosphere full of distant echoes , angelic organs , clear yet unobtrusive horns , incidental voices chiming in on the sidelines as in some sort of ecstasy - all this is maintained beautifully from one end of the album to the other , so the whole really works on two levels . On this level , you have a sort of soundtrack , or soothing lite rock at its absolute best . If you could take away Robbie 's singing ( and thereby effectively obliterate the actual songs within the arrangements ) , you 'd have terrific background music that might enchant you on a hot night when you just want to relax and think your thoughts without really paying attention to the music . And , of course , the musicianship is impeccable : after all , we have here the founder of The Band , and he does n't pick just anybody for his studio band.On the second level , we have the core songs , i.e. , what you would hear as a demo , if Robbie were singing accompanied only by his acoustic in his bedroom . Those are , with few exceptions , non-songs . Almost all follow a four-square beat that accommodates equally square lyric meter - you know what I mean : da-da-da-da-DUM/da-da-da-da-DUM . There is n't really much of any sort of melody there , it 's more of a sung narration on a couple of notes , which is why when a bit of originality kicks in , as in `` Go Back to Your Woods '' or `` What About Now , '' the listener is positively relieved , but the relief does n't last long . The non-melodies , in a very old-fashioned pop structure , struggle for a catchy chorus at the end of each stanza . The success of this aspiration is middling to none . The lyrics are not terribly good either , but in the light of who wrote them , they 're downright miserable . Robertson was one of the finest storytellers of the American heartland ( he is Canadian , but talent knows no borders ) , so for him to repeat , in the nineties , images that were stale folksy pooetry by the sixties , such as `` in this dusty little railroad town , where nothing ever changes while nothing remains the same '' is really sad . ( That line reminds me of something that would be a fitting voiceover for a fun thriller like `` U-Turn '' . ) The final song , `` Sign of the Rainbow , '' is the nail in the coffin . Overwrought and full of spiritual mumbo jumbo , it has Robbie falsettoing ( he should be strictly forbidden to do that ) and Aaron Neville singing his natural soprano to make matters worse . When you read the lyrics alone , it seems like with a bit of editing the whole thing should work - there is something there that almost sounds like a decent song - but it does n't work at all , and one is embarrassed for Robbie 's mother , who has apparently lost it and makes prophecies while pointing her cane at the sky . Again , there is no song to speak of . It 's vocal noodling with cringeworthy attempts at deep thoughts.And , unfortunately , there is ( sigh ) Robbie 's voice . Voices are always a love-it-or-leave-it proposition ( viz . Dylan ) , and some love Robbie 's voice , but I start out tolerating with ill grace his whispery efforts , and by the end of the album I have visions of nails on the blackboard . Why did n't he simply create a new band ? He effectively already has one playing here , he could have gotten a singer as well . But someone must have told him he could sing , although in the days of The Band he was wise enough not to put that theory to the test.I should mention that I like his first , eponymous solo album much more . It was n't fabulous , but it was better and less over the top lyrically than Storyville , and it produced one of my all-time favorite songs : `` Crazy River , '' a song possibly aided by the fact that Robbie plain talks for the better part of it , and he has a great talking baritone that would never let you imagine what happens when the man tries to sing . Both albums were highly praised by the critics ; whether they were sincere or just did n't want to shoot down the hopes of a once-great musician trying to have a second career , I do n't know , but I can not join them in their approval . This album is just not good .	-1
They claim this was remastered . If it was remastered , it was not from the original recordings . It carries the same flaw that has plagued every cd release of this album . Approximately 1.5 minutes into All Along The Watchtower , Andy sings , & quot ; All Along..Oohh & quot ; , and in the word & quot ; Along & quot ; , it sounds as if someone bumped into the reel . This flaw does not exist on my Original 1978 vinyl release on Virgin International . If you do not own this album on cd , then buy it . If you own it on cd , do n't bother .	-1
I bought this over ten years ago and listened to it heavily . I think I just wanted more and more XTC and was willing to reach back this far in their discography to hear some of it . I quickly grew tired of `` Go 2 '' because it was just so awkward ... and not in a positive way . They took their punk template and pushed it off an experimental cliff , making something that I think embarrasses even Partridge himself . Do n't get me wrong , I like it when musicians take chances . `` Apple Venus , Vol . 1 '' is a favorite of mine . Orchestral pop ... it 's great.I got rid of my copy of `` Go 2 '' years ago . Recently I thought `` man , I should n't have done that '' , and promptly got a used copy for myself again . After listening to it again all these years later , I realize why I did n't hang on to it . Laughable lyrics , strained vocal performances , limited dynamics , chintzy keyboards that sound like its trying to play sheet music turned upside-down , and - something I rarely associate with XTC - weak songs . With the exception of two or three songs , I feel embarrassed for the band . The worst thing you could do for a potential XTC fan is to point them to this album first . Yikes , it will scare them away.I highly recommend Partridge and Barry Andrews ' other band Monstrance and I look forward to hearing my first Shriekback album some day . This , though ? Ugh ... rough .	-1

There are some classics on this , and there are a lot of disasters , the production is shoddy at times and the extensive use of a piano is really ridiculous . The first five tracks up to & quot ; Knockin On Heavens Door & quot ; are good , especially & quot ; Civil War & quot ; . From there the album takes a downward spiral into inexcusable ineptitude , I mean , some of it is really really bad , & quot ; Get in the Ring & quot ; ? ? ? Come on ! The album recovers for & quot ; Estranged & quot ; and & quot ; You Could Be Mine & quot ; but finishes poorly with the god awful Vanilla Ice-like & quot ; My World & quot ; . You could tell they were trying to make a classic and were too careful and trying to be too perfect , Appetite For Destruction was a classic and it seemed carefree , but this ... oh dear.Combine this with the good stuff off of Use your Illusion I and you have a classic .	-1
Many great artists of the nineteen-sixties and seventies waned in the eighties , but how many released work so awful that their record label sued them because of it ? By the time Neil Young 's tenure with Geffen Records ( to whom he signed in the early eighties ) was complete , the record label had sued the singer/songwriter for three million dollars for making music `` unrepresentative of himself . '' Listening to Lucky Thirteen , a compilation that collects highlights ( and I use the term loosely ) from his Geffen years , one can understand Geffen 's frustration and disappointment at enduring consistently baffling creative decisions and sub par output from this usually outstanding artist.Throughout his time at Geffen , Mr. Young bounced from genre to genre , adopting many sounds completely atypical to his characteristic gruffness and solemnity , often sounding utterly ridiculous . His Geffen debut , 1982 's Trans , introduced `` Neil 2 , '' a peculiar musical entity who sang sci-fi inspired lyrics into a squeaky computer filter over hyperactive , Kraftwerk-ish synthesizers . Lucky Thirteen 's Trans tracks , `` Sample and Hold '' and `` Transformer Man , '' show Mr. Young 's compositional skills still intact ( The version of `` Transformer Man '' from his 1993 Unplugged album shows what a well-written song it truly is ) but that is difficult to appreciate through the dense coating of blaring electronic effects . After Trans came 1983 's Everybody 's Rockin ' , an outrageously silly album a zoot suit clad Mr. Young recorded with a rockabilly ensemble called the Shocking Pills . Thankfully , Lucky Thirteen spares listeners from any tracks from that monstrosity . Next came 1985 's Old Ways , a slow , mummbly country album stuffed with stereotypes of the genre . Just look at the song titles of Lucky Thirteen 's Old Ways tracks . `` Once an Angel . '' `` Where Is the Highway Tonight ? '' Ugh . Next came 1986 's Landing On Water , an album that bored listenors with its conformity to the lowest common denominator of the current new wave movement . One track , however , `` Hippie Dream , '' smartly included on Lucky Thirteen , rages with intense cynicism and grinding guitars reminiscent of Neil 1 . There was hope for more of the same when Mr. Young reunited with his on-again-off-again backing band , Crazy Horse on 1987 's Life . Unfortunately dated eighties-style production and an obvious lack of creative energy bogged the album down . Life did feature two stand-out tracks , however , the startling , current-event inspired songs , `` Mideast Vacation '' and `` Around the World , '' both of which are also high points on Lucky Thirteen . The compilations ' final song is not from any of Mr. Young 's Geffen releases , but the title track from This Note 's for You , an 1988 offering that marked his return to his former label , Reprise . Although , his second tenure at Reprise would see a return-to-form , Mr. Young still had one last experiment to get out of his system . For This Note 's for You , he teamed-up with a jazz group called The Bluenotes for an album of lumbering blues-rock . The effort was surprisingly pleasing ( Make enough seemingly random creative decisions and eventually one has to work out right ) . The title track features an excellent bluesy rhythm and lyrics that cleverly mock musicians ' product-endorsement deals.After This Note 's for You , Mr. Young released 1989 's Freedom , his stunning comeback record and went on to a period of creative prosperity that rivaled his classic output of the seventies . Unfortunately , his eighties work comprises a valley as deep as his peaks of the seventies and nineties are high . Lucky Thirteen stands as a decent crash coarse for fans enticed by work from his better days and curious about this peculiar stage in his career , but expect to be more bewildered and disillusioned than impressed . Lucky Thirteen is a thorough display of a great artist at his most outlandish , confusing and downright bad .	-1
I was disappointed with this . I was kind of hoping that they would get down to business , and do a real 70 's retro sounding album . I was put off by the slick produced `` Pump '' album from 1989 , and wanted to hear something on the lines of thier first album , or `` Get Your Wings '' , but here the songs were too weak , and most of them had way way too much harmonica on here . Songs like `` Fever '' , `` Eat The Rich '' , `` Cryin '' , and `` Crazy '' are just as bad as if the group ran thier nails down a blackboard . `` Amazing '' was a annoying ballad , and with that , and `` Crazy '' , and `` Cryin '' having Alicia Silverstone in them made me jealous as I 'm like : `` Why is it always the rich ones ? '' There was only one real good song on here , and that was the last one which was `` Boogey Man '' . I did go onto find out that this was during the time that the group was having a falling out with Geffen Records , and was tired of the record president causing trouble with the contract . This is why I 'm giving this 2 stars otherwise it would 've been less .	-1
2 1/2What sounded like their most polished and accessible album at the time has not seemed to have aged so well . Asides from the major hits that came from this disc , most of the album sounds like overproduced , underwritten 90 's blues-tinged arena rock .	-1
I give this 2 1/2 stars ... why ? ... well , the ballads are ultra cheesy , and there are about 5 of em ... and the songs that are n't ballads ... do n't rock at all , and really are just filler ... only a minute amount of tracks stand out ... & quot ; Eat the Rich & quot ; , & quot ; Shut up and Dance & quot ; , & quot ; Line Up & quot ; , & quot ; Livin ' on the Edge & quot ; stand out on the album ... ..	-1
I really enjoy the songs welcome to planet motherfu @ # er , thunder kiss '65 , black sunshine and soul crusher . The rest of the songs are `` filler '' they are boring and after soul crusher I turn the cd off . You also have to turn up the volume pretty loud because of bad production values . I do think that this cd will appeal to people who like thrash so give it a listen .	-1
Having been at one time obsessed with 1980s commercial music , I was rather late in buying Peter Gabriel 's `` Us '' given the amount I used to listen to his 1986 singles like `` Sledgehammer '' and `` Big Time '' . `` Us '' had received , it is true , some rather ordinary reviews in such magazines as Rolling Stone and among books like MusicHound , but I still felt in certain moods a little guilty of not owning the record when I had bought a great many less critically favoured ones.I had known well of the despairing singles `` Steam '' and `` Digging In The Dirt '' for many years beforehand for the simple reason of their being played a great deal on classic rock radio in my native Australia.However , it must be said that the singles - tearful and neither by any means easy to listen to nor possessing amazing vocal or emotional qualities - are totally unrepresentative of the rest of `` Us '' . Nevertheless , the rest of `` Us '' really is despairingly slow and shallow . The remaining songs basically consist of seemingly exotic rhythms carried through a slow , meandering synthesiser that never succeeds in having any impact upon a listener even if ( s ) he listens really closely . Rather , the songs typify what the eccentric Joe S. Harrington calls `` world muzak '' with their almost new-age type feel - they move less than anything I have heard from Enya.Gabriel 's lyrics appear to be analysis of a type so distant from a listener that one wonders if he really is not a professional scientist dealing with music . On earlier singles , he at least gave some impression of feeling - something `` Us '' never even dabbles in.On the whole , it is a pity I did not follow the advise of the sceptics about this album - but I rarely do if I think I MIGHT like something . To be avoided .	-1
Nothing can top ( for me ) the `` Superstition '' CD . This CD is OK , but ( for me ) does n't have the magic that SATB 's previous album did.Sad that this was SATB 's final album together ... .	-1
have the DVD of this show , great show but the CD doesnt have Joe Walsh ` s song , too bad or this would have been a better write up ... . Eagles were great in there hey day but its over now , pack it in guys ... .. should have done alot more of the oldies ... . new stuff aint cutting the mustard ... ...	-1
I appreciate Nirvana as the greatest band in 90 's and I will give 5 stars to all of their studio albums except Nevermind ( 4.5 ) . But for rock 's sake I can not forgive this unplugged one . Reason:1 . It 's a MTV show so it can not help being contrived.2 . Unplugged Nirvana sounds weird . I doubt anyone who favors their music will endure such a pretentious form of rock music.There are terrific acoustic/folk musicians but Nirvana is out of this league.3.This show is fake emotional and misleading . That 's why we got a lot of self-destructive whiners aka Post-grunge to ruin music . I guarantee all of them are inspired by this show . It is even worse than American Idol.One star for Krist 's accordion and introduction of Meat Puppets.If you want to know a real Nirvana , get Muddy Banks . 10/100 .	-1
When & quot ; It 's Five O'Clock Somewhere & quot ; starts it seems like it 's going to be a fine album . the first two songs are cool , but after that the cd just loses momentum and most of the songs are just boring . the good songs on this cd are neither can i , a bluesy song that starts slow but builds up , dime store rock , a hard rockin song , take it away , another decent rocker and back and forth again , a ballad with an amazing solo . those are the only songs worth listening to . Slash is a great guitarist but even he can not save this cd . also the singer is pretty bad , he just sounds like an Axl impersonator . The second snakepit cd is much better and i would reccomend that one , but do n't bother with this one .	-1
I bought this album and found it to be very disappointing . I listened to sample clips online and thought they sounded great especially 'Taffy ' . Then when I listened to the entire album I found it to be dull and flat . A couple catchy songs here and there but overall it was n't as good as I expected . I 'm taking my copy back to the used CD store . Lisa Loeb seems like a nice person but I can see why she was a one-hit-wonder . =/	-1
Do n't waste your time with this very disappointing CD . August and Everything After was truly a remarkable effort . Songs such as & quot ; Sullivan Street & quot ; , & quot ; Anna Begins & quot ; , and & quot ; Raining in Baltimore & quot ; are classics . Unfortunately , the band abandoned producer T Bone Burnett ( from August and Everything After ) , in exchange for another producer . The result is a jumbled mess of disjointed emotion and tuneless dirges . Perhaps their live album will be better . Adam , please bring back T Bone Burnett for your next studio CD .	-1
Maybe White Zombie owed their label another album and gave them this . Maybe they were doing some kind of scientific experiment to prove that people will buy anything . Maybe they do n't care enough about their fans to release new music . I do n't know what they were thinking , but I was very disappointed with this . Since I have both Devil Music and Astro Creep and love them , naturally I wanted to check this out . Thank God for the listening station at the music store . I did n't have to waste money on this , just time.In the event that you have n't heard this , there is no new music here . It is just remixes by different & quot ; artists. & quot ; Not one of the new versions of the songs are as good as the originals . Just check them out in concert , they play all the original versions . This album is a novelty for the die hard fan , or perhaps it is a good soundtrack for a bad acid trip . Either way , if you have to have it , there is still a copy at the music store that I refused to buy .	-1
When someone can play their instrument with precision or sing on key with technique , it is called `` polished , '' but when someone ca n't sing or play to save anyones life , it is called raw . What gives ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Most of Nirvanas music is good , but this is just plain awful.The only reason you should buy this is for the live tracks `` Anuerysam '' ( ca n't be bothered spelling it right ) and `` Polly '' some other berable tracks but some of the tracks are like listening to $ # $ # % Slipknot ! Avoid I would say .	-1
First off the Misfits broke up in '83 . Glenn Danzig , who wrote 98 percent of the music and 100 percent of the lyrics immediately started Samhain in 1983 . So if you want to hear more of the Misfits try listening to Samhain . Its a darker , slightly heavier version of the Misfits.However , a decade later after Danzig received mainstream attention and huge bands such as Metallica and Guns And Roses began covering Misfits songs they finally got the appreciation they rightfully deserved . This prompted long time Misfits bassist to cash in and claim he was the Misfits ! Granted , his guitarist and lil ' bro , Doyle ( who after a couple years quit and now jams with Danzig ) was in the Misfits for the last couple years so this did make it a sort of a reunion album . Either way , its not really the Misfits and the only reason this is any good is because they brought in some idiot named Michael Graves to write them some Misfits sounding songs and sing for them.As lame as Graves is he brought a couple good songs . The album 's intro , American Psycho , Hate The Living , and Dig Up Her Bones are pretty good songs . The rest is crappy , poorly written filler . A couple being completly terrible and embarrassing . Doyle 's guitar tone is great but that still does n't save this album from being crap . If they would n't have called this the Misfits it would have been more respectable but would suck nonetheless.Atleast Graves can sing and this has 3 or 4 good songs . Wait till you hear the Misfits after this `` reunion '' line-up quits . Really , really , effing terrible ! ! ! ! ! Still Graves is an idiot . Check out his interview on the Daily Show if you can . Its hillarious . Doyle 's guitar rules and he made up for some of his lameness by doing live Misfits sets with Danzig . Saw it live . It rules.But overall , this is mostly generic filler . The songs that are good are n't that great . I do like the intro and title track . If they would have released that as just a single it would have been ok. Avoid half these songs at all costs and listen to the original Misfits and Samhain first ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
i grew up with real misfits . so now you know where this is going . they didnt sell out ? yes , they did . its just as good ? no its not . there is some catchy stuff here , but this is not the misfits of old . they will never be what the misfits of old were . never . young people , you missed out- go buy some vinyl ( gasp ) and listen to the old misfits stuff if you wan na know why this band even had a chance . they are two bands you know- danzig , whoever.. it could have been something else , but is not . they will never be what the misfits were . never .	-1
After his previous marvellous group , the great John Squire release a terrible cd , with a group far from what he deserved . Apart from a couple of decent songs , neither his compositions are good . A pity	-1

After reading the reviews for this 1984 Eric Carmen bowl-bobber and those for his excellent 1975 debut , I 've come to the conclusion that AMAZON HAS LUMPED THEM ALL TOGETHER ! ! ! The original does n't deserve to be paired with this piece of trash . They 're two very different albums , one done before Eric began doing music for the prematurely comatose , one that was the start of the coma .	-1
Produced by Prefab Sprout mastermind Thomas Dolby , I bought `` Dog Eat Dog '' in the hope it might give a picture of a singer/songwriter whose earlier ( primary ! ) work I did not then believe I could appreciate.However , regardless of the beauty and delicacy he could bring to such hyper-literate masterpieces asSteve McQueenandJordan : The Comeback , here Dolby just appeared to be copying the tricks of his awful-sounding solo albums likeAstronauts & Heretics . Whilst Joni 's voice at first listen undoubtedly sounded palatable , after a while on such songs as `` Good Friends '' and `` Shiny Toys '' the production seems as mechanical as if Joni were making a generic techno ( ! ) album . The chorus of the acclaimed `` Impossible Dreamer '' sounds honestly no better today.Indeed , the amazing melodies of `` Song For Sharon '' and `` Shadows And Light '' that I have recently discovered are totally absent here , to be replaced by political ranting that really does place this album in the 1980s - and not really a time capsule when one considers the album only reached # 63 on Billboard . Rather , it is a once-great artist failing altogether to stick to her own game in a serious way.By this time , Joni Mitchell clearly had given way to such artists as Kate Bush , Mark Hollis ( of Talk Talk ) and Mary Margaret O'Hara . This album really is not required even if you 're an established fan . Go withHissing Of Summer LawnsandHejirainstead .	-1
I 'm a huge Joni fan . I have every one of her albums . I would put this one near the bottom of the list . The production is plastic , gimmicky . Electronic drum sounds , synthetic sounding reverb ... a desperate attempt to be contemporary . Thomas Dolby as a producer was a bad idea . He blinded me with circuit boards . The vocals are n't that great , or mixed well in relation to the music . Smoking damage beginning to show . The songs are wordy , awkward and unmusical . It simply is n't enjoyable in any way . Like a spoonful of castor oil . I appreciate the message Joni was attempting to convey , but she was out of her element , and it showed , bigtime . I like the cover , though .	-1
Done with Mirrors continues the Aerosmith tradition ( started with Draw the Line ) of bad albums with exactly one good song on them . In this case the one good song is the first one , called & quot ; Let the Music Do the Talking. & quot ; They borrowed a riff from & quot ; Draw the Line & quot ; for this song but it fit in nicely. & quot ; Gypsy & quot ; is not bad but a lot of the songs are embarassing , the work of forty year old men with nothing to say churning out a hard rock album.At its budget price I ca n't say to avoid this album but do n't expect an entire CD full of good songs . Think of it as a single with & quot ; Let the Music do the Talking & quot ; and a bunch of second-rate B sides .	-1
I have to say Done with Mirrors is a disappointment . Maybe the title has to do with the fact that trickery was used to make this album seem like a finished work . Seems like it was pretty hastily slabbed together . And while I do like the live , raw feel to the compositions , it does not make up for the fact that the songs are lacking personality , musically and lyrically . Nothing really stands out from the muffled blues-rock drone , despite a couple of moderately interesting tracks ( My Fist Your Face and The Hop ) . Seems rushed really , maybe trying to cash in on the hype of the band being back together again after 6 years apart . So , while I applaude the fact that little production and mix magic was used as in some of their more resent stuff , I ca n't quite accept the apparent lack of effort and enthusiam put forth . Barely got 39 minutes out of it , even with a rerecorded Perry solo and bonus track .	-1
This is Aerosmith 's worst album . Thankfully , it 's still listenable . There 's simply not any high points . If you to hear & quot ; let the music do the talking & quot ; you 're better off getting the Joe Perry Project version . After this album , the group cleaned up their act and starting making good albums again . All this album is the group trying desperately to capture the brilliance of their '70s masterpieces . They still have their signature sound but the songs just do n't cut it .	-1
Okay , Neil with synthesizers and drum machines . Strike anybody else as stupid ? Because this , along with Life , is the worst Neil Young album out there . The lyrics are frequently embarrassing ( I 've Got a Problem ; Hippy Dream ; Weight of the World ; Violent Side ; Drifter ) , and the aforementioned drum machines and such got on my nerves fast . There 's not a single song on this mess worth salvaging . Neil 's put out some great stuff , but this is n't an example of what he can do . There 's not even a memorable guitar solo thrown in . Skip over it .	-1
I own this c.d . because I own all of Neil 's albums ( and obviously enjoy most of them ) . I will probably continue to buy all of Neil 's releases , but , trust me : this one is an unqualified disaster . It 's as if he 'd just heard Kraftwerk 's Trans Europe Express and a Devo album and then wrote and released this an hour later in a lame attempt to be techno/modern . Try as I might , I just ca n't even give it 2 stars . I think the reviewer is probably correct who states that it 's so bad that you kind of admire the guts it took to put it out . Of course , this album was one of a few that was rumoured to be deliberately bad to get back at Geffen Records during a notorious contract battle . ( Lou Reed famously put out Metal Machine Music in the mid-70 's for similar reasons while contracted to RCA ; it remains the most unlistenable joke ever released ! )	-1
Neil Young in the late 70 's and through most of the 80 's was like Lou Reed ; even if the album was awful , there was at least one amazing track that is among that artist 's best work.Landing on Water is not really a great album , or even a good album . I do not begrudge an artist , especially Neil , experimenting and doing something atypical . I think one of the problems with this album was the production . Some of the songs probably would be better regarded if done by another band and not done with such a new-wave production style . I think if this album was done by Crazy Horse , or the Stray Gators , it would be a much better album . But on the flip side , I do n't think Neil has ever done any of these , or many of these songs in concert , since the initial tour to promote the album , so maybe he does n't feel that they 're a particularly strong bunch of songs.That being said , I think there are some great songs on this album , despite the production . `` Violent Side '' and `` Weight of the World '' are great , though the stand out track is `` Hippie Dream '' and I think it one of Neil 's best songs - ever . And one I 'd love to hear done by the Horse . I think that could be an amazing version . But , it is also one of the songs that fits the style of production.Basically , this album is for Neil completists , someone who likes a song or two from the album ( which is why I originally bought the album - I wanted to hear `` Hippie Dream . '' The song did receive a fair amount of airplay when the album came out . ) , or a really hardcore Neil nut . Not the first Neil CD to pick up if you 're new to Neil . Or , heck , probably not on the of the first fifteen CD 's to pick-up . Though , that is an interesting mental picture , some fourteen year old music nut : `` I want to check out Neil Young ; I 've heard great things about him . I 'll go on Amazon and buy the CD that is the lowest rating of all his CD 's ... ''	-1
Neil Young is a great song writer and I 'm a huge fan of his.But the only reason you would ever buy this album is so that you can brag to your firends and family that you own the worst album ever made.The irony in all of this is that I actually have far more respect for Young after listening to this garbage . It amazes me that he can do something so awful and then come right back and release albums like Harvest Moon and Ragged Glory.If you are just getting into Young 's music then do not buy this album until you have most ( if not all ) of the other albums he has done .	-1
I 'm afraid to say this is an uninspiring album . The single most glaring deficiency which it exhibits is the songwriters ' respective inabilities to develop a tune . As a result , it is very , very boring . The ballads sometimes have interesting lyrics , but they are all delivered in a flat monotone with very little variation in the music either. & quot ; Let 's Go & quot ; is easily the best song on the album , with a good start and a driving progression , but even this runs out of steam/ideas towards the end of the chorus ; as a result they have to tunelessly shout the title and some other words just so they can move on to the next verse . & quot ; Everybody have Fun Tonight & quot ; is not quite as good , but at least is much better than passable and its ending is a strong as its start . Other than & quot ; Hypnotise Me & quot ; , which is mildly clever , the rest are very , very weak.Oh , and & quot ; The World in which we Live & quot ; ends this mind-numbing collection . Seven long minutes where the song goes nowhere and they just have to chant the title as a 'climax ' . Oh dear . The most memorable thing about the song is the obscenities at the start of it , which are totally gratuitous , unnecessary and are just another example of the bells and whistles this band will pull out to try to revive the album despite their weak songwriting.One star is probably harsh ( I thought hard about this ) , but it is nonetheless difficult to give it two stars on the basis of two good songs out of eight . Very , very disappointing .	-1
I purchased this cd a few years back , but only got around to listening to it the other day . Why did I wait ? I do n't know . It was just filed away in my collection . When I finally got around to fishing it out , I expected no less than some great songs and cool guitar riffs . I was to be disappointed . One of the things that brings this record down is the 2 featured vocalists , John Miles and Chris Farlow . Both are competent vocalists , do n't get me wrong . Page should n't have let them write their own lyrics . I have never heard so many rock cliches on a single album . Most of the songs sound formulaic . Page sounds like he is bored . This cd gets a 2 star rating instead of one just for The Only One . This is a track that features Robert Plant on lead vocals . It is n't the greatest Plant/Page collaboration , but it is the one saving grace on the album .	-1
Jimmy Page is all over the guitar here , but the writing stinks . The vocals , the engineering that 's like driving nails into your ears -- I 'd rather hear two gerbils run up and down a Strat with a bent neck and strings about to snap.If you want latter day Jimmy Page , check out `` Live At The Greek '' with The Black Crowes as a backing band or his duos with Robert Plant . There 's a reason `` Outrider '' is selling for 3 1/2 bucks .	-1
Jimmy Page 's guitar playing on this album is pretty good . However , it was n't laid out pretty well . The vocal tracks on each songs were laid out very poorly . The instrumental tracks were pretty good . The vocalists on this record except Robert Plant were terrible . Robert Plant 's vocals on & quot ; The Only One & quot ; was n't at his best . Jason Bonham 's drumming were pretty good . He played pretty much the same technique his father , John Bonham did . The bassists on this record were n't very good either . Overall , this record is very disapointing . If you 're a true Led Zeppelin fan , you 'd be very disapointed with this record .	-1
This LP is even more lacking than their previous LP The Big Express . 1978-1983 were their best years as far as the writing , producing and lyric content . After their 1983 LP Mummer , they started to slide downhill considerably .	-1
One of the worst albums I 've ever heard . These guys start not one but two songs with the drumbeat from the song Saturday Night by the awful , awful band Bay City Rollers . S-A , T-U-R , D-A-Y , Night ! The playing is junior high school inept , the singing just passable . The songwriting might be impressive if it had been done by retards or monkeys , otherwise it just does n't cut it . I ca n't imagine what powerfully halucinogenic drug the other reviewers were smoking , but if it can make someone find any value in this amateurish mess of an album then I want some too . All the talent is in the singers hair . Seriously , these guys make the New York Dolls look like Berklee grads . Get any of their other albums before this one . Laughable .	-1
Ok , sorry for being so blunt , but this CD sucks from beginning to end ... .First , I remember loving 1 song by these guys back in the old days , growing up in the late 80s ... .The song was Thrashers from the Ultra-Violence album ... .I saw this CD on Amazon for $ 2.00 , so I figured I 'd see how they progressed over the years ... .The CD starts off hard , fast , and powerful ... .Ok , then after that 5 seconds of adrenalin ( literally , 5 seconds ) , these old guys apparently need a breather , because everything afterward is slow and powerless ( except MAYBE 2 mediocre songs at the end of the CD ) ... .In my opinion , Thrash is supposed to make you want to jump out into the middle of a moshpit and release all your adrenalin ... .Bang your head , pump your fists , and just go nutty ... .You will get none of that from this CD ... .The production quality is much greater than their stuff in the late 80s , but that 's most likely just because of cheaper technology ... .Ok , that 's the only positive I can think of about this CD ... .seriously ... .These guys do absolutely nothing original or exciting on this CD , no wild guitar playing , no fast powerful drum beats , absolutely nothing ... .It 's just crunchy guitar riff after crunchy guitar riff , switching up the pace from slow to slower and back to slow again with no apparent rhyme or reason to any of it ... .And the singer is by far , the worst part of this band ... .It seems he tries to sing , but has the most monotoned voice possible , and can not hold a note ... .He also sings with absolutely no passion at all ... .I am so glad I only paid $ 2.00 for this , any more and I 'd be demanding my money back ... .Stay away from this CD !	-1
Remember that wonderful program that used to be on MTV back when they actually played videos called The Headbangers Ball ? I and my friends used to love that show because it was the only time of the week when we could not only look forward to our favorite bands at the time but it was also a pretty good program to discover new music as well . Each of us really enjoyed `` discovering `` a new band . And we each made a real big deal about it when one of us found one . Warrior Soul was one of those bands.It was not a real glamorous moment . Sitting on the couch on a Saturday night after working some late night high school job at Target when with no advance warning , the ringing sonic anthem that is `` We Cry Out '' came through the television . I just sat there , listening , wishing I could be cranking this through the stereo instead of the mono speakers of the t.v . And what a video , it was SO cool . Never had I seen a video that was this dark and edgy in and around this time of primarily glam band familiarity . It made you feel were in some New York wasteland and yet it was made to be taken seriously and you did . After it was over my next thought was `` I hope none of the other guys are watching this because I wanted to be the one to `` claim '' Warrior Soul.As it turned out none of them did . The next day I picked up Last Decade Dead Century played it non-stop for however how long , and of course all my friends loved it as well and they got their own copies later that week . Last Decade was a major turning point for all of us in our musical growth at the time . This was the real deal . Kory if anything seemed completely legit and incredibly intelligent . We were n't used to learning about our social and political environments in our Rock N ' Roll . I suppose the last political album I was exposed to prior to Last Decade was Metallica 's And Justice For All ... , but Last Decade seemed a bit more real . Maybe it was because they were n't yet big name rock stars . Or maybe it was because Last Decade made you feel like you were hearing the reports from the front lines of hard times in real time . It also drugged us on `` Tripping On Ecstacy '' and dragged you through the darkest corners and seedy hang outs of `` Downtown '' . I remember our girlfriends being rather scared of this group . We could never play `` Four More Years '' all the way through before someone would freak out . I will admit , it is quite spooky and not exactly the one track I enjoyed listening to alone . The album comes to wonderful one , two , three , punch of `` Superpower Dreamland '' , `` Charlie 's Out Of Prison '' and `` Blown Away '' , with `` In Conclusion '' being up their with the best when it comes to a song that completely sums up what you the listener just soaked in for the past forty-five minutes.So I was astounded to find out just recently that the Geffen era Warrior Soul catalog was re-released last year ( 06 ) . It had been quite a long time since I kept any tabs on the band and what Kory had been up to , so I checked out the old website , only to be dircted to the newer and much better site . I was sorry to hear about the senseless tragedy that involved Mark Evans but was very happy to see that not only has Kory been busy with a new group called Dirty Rig but was actually touring as Warrior Soul in a new incarnate of the band . And then of course , Kory 's new label Escapi Music in what looks like a purchase from Geffen of Warrior Soul 's repertoire , re-mastered and re-released the catalog with live tracks added to each disc.Now I could be wrong , maybe Kory worked out some deal many years ago with Geffen on artistic control of his music and at some point Geffen may have just said `` Okay , we did what we could with this , here you go '' or something a lot more complicated than that to be sure . Either way , the irresponsible mess that is the re-mastered editions of the finest of Warrior Soul and those being Last Decade Dead Century , drugs , god and the new republic and Salutations From The Ghetto Nation are at best an embarrassment to an individual named Steve Kadison and at its worst a total dis-service to the fans of Warrior Soul . Blame can also be shared with Escapi Music , who decided to use copy protected compact discs for these editions . Be aware that of the three new re-masters I purchased , only Salutations worked in my car , and it did n't even work that well , it kept making these insidious snapping noises as it spun in the player . If you have a Macintosh forget about trying to play Last Decade on your computer because it wo n't work , but the other two did along with being able to play in my laptop PC . It did however make some really scary sounds while inside the computer that did not make me feel too safe about keeping it in there for very long . I tell you these copy protected cd 's are the next best thing to a defective product being sold as something that works . And now all three of these newly re-mastered discs have been made into interesting conversation pieces as beverage coasters.With that said however , you would n't want to upload or play the newly re-mastered Last Decade on your ipod anyways . It sounds terrible ! All three of the previously mentioned releases do play on my regular stereo cd player and this is where I had my chance to test drive the quality of the redux . Of the three , Last Decade was the least affected by the new process . The original was recorded and mixed rather low to begin with , so their was n't much more volume to pull out of these masters to begin with . Still , the sound that was pulled out for `` more emphasis '' is quite thin , the dense reverberating sound that was captured best on the original Geffen release was sorely compromised in favor of the re-mastered versions new motto of `` Let 's just make them louder '' .The live tracks tacked on at the end of the disc add further insult to the buying fans earache . Only unless you are listening to these live tracks through an analog cordless phone will you realize that you would be better off listening to an audience recording of The Beatles playing the Cavern Club in 1962.In Conclusion : I hope this review of the `` new '' Last Decade Dead Century helps out in your decision of whether of not to buy . I did , and I regretted it . I think the original 1990 release is far superior to the 2006 re-master . You however , may need to discover for yourself , and that 's all cool , just do so with what I discussed in mind and remember that these COPY PROTECTED compact discs MAY not work on your computer , car stereo or BOTH !	-1
This is a very meticulous album , dense riffs , faster than the speed of light drum fills , and dazzling ( faceless ) fretwork ( I ca n't keep my John Norums from my TNTs , from my King Diamonds , the solos are exceptional , but also pretty boring ) with some nice acoustic seances thrown in for good measure . You have to give Don credit for making such a European album his first time out as opposed to a Bon Jovi slice of Americana which was to be expected . What this does n't have are choruses that stick , Dokken 's greatest strength . This thing just goes by as a more than competent excercise in musics and not much more .	-1
Cher 's 1991 release Love Hurts is a mixed bag at best . The album boasts one surefire classic for Cher with & quot ; Save Up All Your Tears & quot ; , but the rest of the album is a different story . Her remakes of & quot ; Love Hurts & quot ; ( also covered on her 1975 STARS album ) and & quot ; A World Without Heroes & quot ; both start out strong , but fizzle out fast . I was never too much a fan of & quot ; Love And Understanding , & quot ; the albums top 20 hit . On this album , you can tell Cher is tiring of the & quot ; Geffen sound & quot ; from her s/t 1987 and Heart of Stone albums , but she does wan na end the trilogy as good as she can . Only problem is that the material just is n't that memorable . The final track & quot ; Who You Gon na Believe , & quot ; comes as a relieve because after going through so many bland tracks , you get rewarded with a fun rocker that could 've been a hit . The red hair cover ( which was just reissued by Geffen ) is worth the discounted price alone for this album .	-1
I was so excited to get this CD when it first came out and I was so disappointed . Nitzer Ebb has never been a deep & amp ; thoughtful band ( guns , guns , guns ) however you could always count on Nitzer ebb to do great on the dance floor . & quot ; I give to you & quot ; and & quot ; Family Man & quot ; were the only two decent songs on the whole disc and they are not that great . If you want to check out some great Nitzer Ebb I recommend you check out & quot ; Belief & quot ; and & quot ; That Total Age & quot ; .As a DJ this CD is worthless , I have never once had one song off this disc requested , nor would I play anything off it on my own .	-1
`` Nonsuch '' is one of those records that I think was doomed to failure -- having constructed ( with a little help from Todd Rundgren ) a thematic song cycle ( `` Skylarking '' ) and an album of perhaps the best pop music in two decades ( `` Oranges & Lemons '' ) , the bar was set pretty high for XTC , and in an attempt to reach it , they seemed to have overreached a bit . It 's not that the album is bad per se , it 's just so carefully arranged and produced to have lost the edge that made its predecessors so great.The band seems to have distilled themselves down to midtempo numbers , occasionally finding a bit of a driving electric sound ( opener `` The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead '' ) , but largely sticking to a quieter , balladry style , often primarily piano driven . Sometimes it works out quite nicely , the lovely , chirping staccato guitars on `` Humble Daisy '' provide ample support for a simply fantastic lead vocal by Andy Partridge , and certainly the lilting off-rhythm of `` Then She Appeared '' is downright captivating , but more likely than not , the pieces end up blending one into another as pretty much unmemorable pop songs that are inoffensive and ok but just not attention getting ( Colin Moulding 's `` My Bird Performs '' , Partridge 's `` The Disappointed '' ) . To cap things off , the album stretches over an hour long , and by the end of the record , even the more intriguing material ( `` The Ugly Underneath '' ) seems to blend in with the rest.It 's tough though , becaue none of it is particularly bad , and in fact , all sorts of neat stuff is going on throughout -- great three part harmonies ( Brian Wilson style with a falsetto over the top ) catch the ear on `` Dear Madam Barnum '' , `` Wrapped in Grey '' twists and turns every which way , `` War Dance '' features an intriguing clarinet opening that leads into a set of reeds providing support for Moulding 's venomous lyrics ... it goes on . In fact , with such detailed arrangements , everything 's guaranteed to be interesting in some regard , but what it lacks is that feeling of spontaneity and energy . One nice thing is that at least with this reissue and its remastered sound , you can make out the subtleties of the record nicely.Bottom line , there 's a lot better by XTC -- `` Nonsuch '' is an ok record , but they 've done a whole lot more .	-1
XTC - Nonsuch ( 1992 ) XTC started life as an arty New Wave band . Gradually a softer , syrupy , sometimes saccharine side of XTC developed , culminating in the brilliant , SERGENT PEPPER-esque SKYLARKING . The following album , ORANGES AND LEMONS , dove deeper into the psychedelic well with mixed results . NONSUCH followed , and at 17 tracks could be considered a double album like its predecessor . That saccharine side is fully indulged here , but as far as baroque pop goes , this is really tops . So it 's really just a question of taste as to whether or not you will like this album . And , with few exceptions , it offends my sensibilities ; I can hardly stand it . `` The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead '' kicks things off with an infectious big beat and a rockin ' pop song . Unfortunately , nothing on the rest of the album rocks like this . Some people who heard the single or saw the video ( which got tons of play on MTV ) and bought the album felt duped by this bait and switch . Not cool.Quite frankly , the rest of the album is just too twee , sing-songy and downright wimpy for my tastes . There 's undoubtedly some very good pop music on here if you like sweet , super-melodic songs that border on precious and sound like they belong on Sesame Street . One exception is the dreamy `` The Ugly Underneath '' which does bring back the big drums for at least part of the song . There are snippets of songs that I enjoy , but they 're usually ruined by some mushy , cloying melody with lyrics to match . XTC even get preachy on a few songs ( `` The Smartest Monkeys , '' `` Books Are Burning , '' `` War Dance '' ) and that 's not much of a turn-on either . I got this album when it came out and I never listen to it ( although I will listen to `` Peter Pumpkinhead '' whenever it comes on ) . No doubt there are many XTC fans out there who would poo-poo all over my review , but considering the preachiness , the rampant wimpiness and the bait and switch , I just ca n't rate NONSUCH any higher than two stars . Although technically very good music , most of it just turns my stomach.rating : not recommended	-1
Do n't listen to all these rave reviews . This is not great pop music by any stretch of the imagination . Dream All Day is good , but then you probably knew that back in 1993 . Nothing else on the album approaches the strength of that one song . The tracks on FOTB are okay as background music , but there is nothing that amazes you in terms of melody , lyrics , or creativity . If you want to listen to an under-appreciated 90s artist , pick upIn Reverseby Matthew Sweet . Now that 's some vastly underrated pop music right there . FOTB is average pop music for people without much of a sense of what great pop music is , but want to feel like they 're cool because they like a band from Seattle that has been `` criminally ignored '' by people who actually like to listen to something worth their time . Do n't buy the hype .	-1
Contrary to popular belief , the producers of this album actually hired the two dogs on the cover of this album to write and record this album because they had more talent than the real Nelson Brothers . What 's not to like ? The only reason I only gave it one star is because there were far better albums that came out the same year ...	-1
For four years , Beavis and Butt-head was a very popular show on MTV . But this album inspired by that show left me disappointed . Most of the rock bands on here come out with very disjointed and uninteresting songs . Some of their worst efforts in their careers and they do n't really rock that well . Even Megadeth 's song sounds so self-deprecating in some cases . Sir Mix-A-Lot 's redo of his song comes off as lame . And the Beavis and Butt-head number with Cher sounds silly and out of place . Come To Butt-head sounds corny . Only the Run-DMC song Bounce , and Aerosmith 's rocking Deuces are Wild stand out of this mess . The others sound like they were left on the cutting room floors in studios and that 's not good . Save your money on this sorry mess and buy something else !	-1
With the exception of a few standout tracks conveniently stored at the beginning , middle , and end of this generic indulgence , the incident reeks of moldy , old school hard rock homage . Fitting in shedding light on their `` Guns '' aspect , the `` Roses '' side ends up feeling rather cheated .	-1
Toni Childs ' first release , Union , was a breath of fresh air in an era when so much of mainstream women 's rock was just all the same ( how many Mariah Carries does one really need , after all ) . Toni 's deep and resonant voice came crashing through with sensitivity , power , and heat.Her sophomore effort , house of hope , was one in which the walls started to get rickity . Not the same power or sensitivity , but still some good stuff.This was the only one of her three major releases I simply threw away . It simply makes you want to pray for Toni 's healing , not for another release . It turns out , this appears to have been her last .	-1
I was looking up the worst LP 's I ever heard just for fun . I ca n't believe how many of the LP 's get high ratings . Only about 1 percent of the CD 's get a 1 rating from me , this one got a 1 which is to say it was hard to listen to the hole thing . I like the band but this was just bad .	-1
Do n't be fooled ! I know you 're thinking , & quot ; Well , I do n't know , they sound like they 're pretty weird , and this one is a bunch of covers of 60 's pop songs that I already know , so ... & quot ; No No NO ! Let me explain . What 's unusual about the Resdients is that they are unusual , NOT ugly . Their tunes are simple , accessible , and often quite beautiful . They are just oddly arranged.This album , believe it or not , is their LEAST accessible . They have made a collage of tiny shreds of many 60 's pop songs , interspersed some vague Hitler references , and a hell of a lot of just plain noise . The result is angry , violent , unpleasant . Not like them in virtually any other recording . I can almost guarantee : if this is your first foray into this group , you wo n't be back . Try & quot ; Not Available & quot ; , & quot ; Duck Stab & quot ; , or the & quot ; Commercial Album & quot ; first !	-1
When I bought this CD in 1990 , I bought it for Joey . What an incredible song ! At the time I had a friend who was dealing with alcoholism and having a very hard time . He and his girlfriend moved away , and I never heard from them again . When I heard Joey the first time , the words just cut me to the heart . Johnette turns in one hell of a vocal performance on Joey as well , especially for her limited vocal range . The rest of the album is a horrendous pile of ... . As an avid music fan and collector of 25 years and owner of well over 1,000 CD 's , I can honestly say that this was the biggest waste of money on a CD that I have ever made . I thought for sure that since Joey was such an awesome song , the rest of the album had to be at least & quot ; good & quot ; , boy was I wrong . There are a couple of fair attempts at songwriting , like the songs Caroline , Darkening of The Light , I Do n't Need A Hero , and Days and Days . But they are hardly worth buying the album for . Bloodletting is just a repetitive , stupid , senseless , sorry excuse of a song . The first time I heard Tomorrow Wendy , every hair on my body stood up ( and I 'm a hairy guy ) and I had chills go straight through me . It is the most blasphemous song I have ever heard in my life . I do n't know if Johnette is a satan worshiper or an atheist or what , but if I ever hear that song again it will be too soon . I could n't find the single of Joey , so I have kept the album all of these years just for it . I 've just found a couple of compilations with Joey on them , and as soon as I can get one , I 'm throwing this CD in the garbage . I 'm not even going to sell it to a used CD store because I would n't want anyone else to be subjected to this ... ! No wonder Joey was the one and only hit they ever had ! Save you money , time , and ears and get one of the compilations with Joey on it . Believe you me , you WILL NOT be sorry . I would 've given this CD 0 stars , except that you ca n't and also because Joey is that great !	-1
C'mon people this album SUCKS ! I love Sabbath and no I amnot one of those `` If it do n't have Ozzy it 's not Sabbathcrying kid '' but I just do not feel anything for this album.I like Martin , he is a very good singer and I feel The EternalIdol is a fantastic album . This however is flat too me.AnnoMundi and Valhalla are perhaps the best songs on here andthats sad for they are filler tunes at best.If you likeIommi solo projects than buy THE ETERNAL IDOL-HEADLESS CROSSand Seventh Star ( though Stranger to love makes me ill ) andstay away from this TURD.The fact Amazon does not sell thisanymore and you have to purchase from private dealers say'sit all . CAN YOU SEE ME-CAN YOU HEAR ME-CRYING BACK FOR MY5 BUCKS !	-1
'Tyr ' followed hot on the heels of 'Headless Cross ' . Unfortunately , 'Tyr ' also became the next step down on Black Sabbath 's fall from hard rock grace . This , like 'Headless Cross ' , is a concept album effort in the sense that it has as an archaic religious / mythological storytelling undercurrent in it . 'Anno Mundi ' opens the album and , to be fair to it , does an adequate job in terms of its power . There 's no speed metal or catchy guitar hooks present here but the song is saved by strong vocal input . 'The Lawmaker ' tries to pass as neo-Sabbath fast rocking but ca n't . Fortunately 'Jerusalem ' comes along just in time to keep the now-anxious listener from trying to put the CD back in its cellophane with ideas of going for the refund with the 'sorry ... it was the wrong one for him/her ( delete as applicable ) ' excuse . Even so , the second-rate 'Jerusalem ' and the slightly weaker power-trudger 'The Sabbath Stones ' ca n't save the album from what follows after them.No , quickie 'The Battle of Tyr ' is an innocent accomplice to 'Odin 's Court ' and 'Valhalla ' . Listen carefully for this is the sound of a band treading quicksand . If it was n't for the pretty warmth of the power ballad 'Feels Good To Me ' ( a weaker 'No Stranger To Love ' ) or the long , guitar-driven assault of speed metal original 'Heaven In Black ' , you 'd be left wondering how many tabs of LSD you 'd have to lick to become the head of a record label . 'Tyr ' is n't for casual fans and it is n't for hardcore fans , either . The only way to acquire it ( according to a theory I have ) is to either stumble upon it accidentally or to NEED it to fill in the LAST gaps of your VERY NEARLY COMPLETE Sab collection . Just be sure that you do n't find yourself in that first situation . It hurts to write this way about Black Sabbath but whether it hurts more than it must have hurt them to have been caught playing that way is an open-ended question . Has Iommi ever spoken openly about this album ? I have yet to find the evidence ... ..	-1
Aside from the classic , Hocus Pocus , and a few guitar licks in the last song , this is a really dull , derivative and unoriginal album . Not recommended .	-1
Forbidden in my opinion just was n't all that great , and even a majority of the die-hard Tony Martin-Sabbath fans skip over this one or just burn the one of two good tracks from the cd onto cassette or cdrs . First off , the production was horrible . The production alone kills off whatever power we might have heard coming out of Cozy Powell 's drum unit , who many say was Sabbath 's most talented skinsman . There ARE a few standout tracks like Rusty Angels , I Would Die For You , Kiss Of Death and Loser Gets It All . Other than that , moreso than not this is worth skipping over . Tony Martin has had far better vocal days as in the previous albums .	-1
Yeeeouch ! 'Forbidden ' contravenes so many of the fundamentals of Black Sabbathness that it comes dangerously close to being an outright flop . True ; as an album it bites and the cover art is just symptomatic of the fact that Iommi and company were n't taking the job as seriously as they should have been.Luckily , there 's strength in some of the tracks . 'Kiss of Death ' , 'Rusty Angels ' and 'Forbidden ' itself manage to raise the tone of an otherwise sub-mediocre album . It 's just too bad that 'The Illusion of Power ' kicks off the work . Awkward and unappealing , it 's small wonder that Iommi asked Ice T to throw his two cents in on the vocals.Perhaps the band were starting to buckle under the pressure of surviving in the mid-90 's post-grunge 'rock ' climate or maybe Iommi wanted to fool around with the last album they had to do to fulfill the contract with IRS . Whatever the reason , 'Forbidden ' is a dud . To boil it down to its good elements is to reduce it to a third of its size ( and that 's being generous ) . Sorry , but there is WAY too much put into either trying to play around with new approaches ( that do n't work ) or trying to sustain the formula that had worked so well for the group on 'Cross Purposes ' . Curiosly , although that album had preceded 'Forbidden ' by only a year , Black Sabbath just could n't come close to it.Only for completists . Thankfully , the strongest tracks , 'Kiss of Death ' and 'Guilty as Hell ' are available on the compilation 'The Sabbath Stones ' .	-1
the only song that i still play is I Wo n't Cry For You , this is why i still have the tape , this is a song that before the mp3 time i had to buy the tape for , Ice-T sukz on this album , he was on top of his game untill the mid 90s , many fans hate this cd just cause its called black sabbath if it was with another name it would had came out and gone without any one knowig of its existence .	-1
This CD is forbidden to listen , because it is forbidden the sad decline SABBATH went into after the OZzy / Dio days . How Iommi left this happen.. ?	-1
Lay down and avoid ! Forbidden is exactly that : should be forbidden to be played . The poor reviews are all justified . This is a case of product being turned loose that should not have seen the light of day . Martin 's voice is toast ; he sounds as if he 's in pain throughout , and not just from having to sing the naff lyrics . Iommi has sank `` into the void , '' as he seems not to have a fresh idea to help bring something which worth listening . Usually his trademark crunching riffs would be enough , but he 's lacking even those this time around . The riff to `` Shaking Off the Chains '' is cringe inducing , almost sounds like a defiant f-you to having to make this record . Two ballads , both laced with Geoff Nichols cheesy quasi-gothic keyboards , slow and depressing song structures , stink . I like Cozy 's drum intro ( even if simple ) to the blues rock of `` Sick and Tired . '' But that 's precisely it , the band sounds sick and tired by this point . The album did n't chart in the top 100 ( as predecessor Cross Purposes failed to as well ) , so Iommi knew it was time to close shop on this lineup . Time for new ideas ! Hard to believe the just one year later , although not released until 2004 ( really ! ? he shelved Dep but released Forbidden ? ? ! ! ) , he created The Dep Sessions with Glenn Hughes . Dep being of my fave later-day Iommi projects . Go Figure ...	-1
i bought this album brand new for only 7 or 8 bucks and i liketo think i got my moneys worth ! i really have no use for barelyany SABBATH album after BORN AGAIN , with the possible exceptionof THE ETERNAL IDOL , which definitely has some good songs on it ! FORBIDDEN has two very good things going for it ; the cover isprobably their funniest ever , right next to SABOTAGE ! I like thedrawing on it and how silly the band members look ! I also quitelike the opening track on it , ILLUSION OF POWER . Featuring aguest appearance by ICE T , this song has more character and per-sonality than any song they 'd done in a while . It also has TONYMARTIN 'S best vocal on it , along with another very powerfulguitar riff from IOMMI . The rest of this I could really do with-out ; it 's not that it 's really that bad , it 's just not that in-teresting , even tho ' the production is very good and loud . Mostof this is just standard TONY IOMMI heavy metal . nothing specialat all , tho ' the first track is great !	-1
I borrowed this from a friend and all I can say is that this compilation was disappointing . Are there good tracks ? Sure , there a few cool ones like BT 's Flaming June , Underworld 's Born Slippy , as well tracks by Fluke , Prodigy , the Crystal Method and maybe a couple more which I ca n't remember at the moment . The rest seemed annoying . I could n't believe no tracks by Juno Reactor were included here . Anyway , the track selection , in my view , was rather poor and they coud 've done much better .	-1
No offence , but David Hurwitz you need to get your ears checked.This is terrible , barenboim has no clue how to conduct ( interpretation ) Tchaikovsky ridiculus tempos , phrasing of the melodies is a joke , to overblown one moment to dull and dead the next , his romeo and juliet isnt much better and the chicago symphony iv never thought has the right sound for his music , barenboim with his 6th symphony is a little better but not much and teldecs sound is BAD TO.Get Ormandy 1960 version , Dutiot Montreal/decca , GREAT VERSION .	-1
Why did I buy this disc ? I know I 'm not a fan of Barenboim 's heavy-handed conducting , but I thought maybe it could work here . It does n't . I give it one star because it 's not as bad as his Mahler 5th . The Chicago Symphony is a great orchestra . They deserve a leader better than this .	-1
Here is a good test for anyone Bruckner-wise : what do you think of this performance ? The Berlin Philharmonic is superlative . The Teldec sound is excellent . There is no impatience from the podium . All well and good - yes ? This is a stinker . There are merits to Barenboim 's second Bruckner cycle ( 9 , 5 , & 1 ) but this ai n't one of them . There is no greater demonstration in discography that mere animation is not synonymous with life , or to quote the well known maxim from Mahler : the most important thing about music is not the notes . Who knows whether Barenboim was trying to ape Furtwangler on the night . I hope not : the latter 's good name should not be associated with this vacuity . For all the surface excellence , it is a genuine ` swing and miss ' . The opening movement makes all the right gestures but it manifestly fails to connect with anything ( the coda is as mystical as a bucket of fried chicken from Colonel Harland Sanders ) . The adagio is the ground-zero of this performance : twenty five minutes or so of empty rhetoric . The final two movements are bouncy enough - I suppose.I would love to organise a ` Dr Frankenstein Bake-Off ' between Daniel Barenboim and Lorin Maazel in the Bruckner 7th . Each of them would be provided with an Igor ( the Berlin Philharmonic or the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra - though LM has called upon the services of both in his two necrophillic traversals of this work [ Bruckner : 10 Symphonies & Bruckner : Symphony No . 7 ) . Assume that the sound engineers step up to the plate in both instances . I expect Maazel would prevail on the day as his rival can at least convey mere energy if nothing else . Whatever . Any of the three recordings should come with bolts on the sides of the cases to forewarn the public.Avaunt - thou unholy cadaver !	-1
I actually traded my copy of the vintage Beecham/Reiner & quot ; Tristan & quot ; with an Alabama gentleman , in exchange for this . After hearing this , I think I got the lesser end of the deal.. ! Ms Meier makes an unusual Isolde . I have not decided if she is really a soprano who also has nice rounded bottom end or a mezzo-soprano who can reach the high notes . Either way , her Isolde is not to my taste . I acknowledge her intelligent word-pointing and innate musicianship , but ultimately she lacks the vocal radiance and incandescence of the great Isoldes on record . Just hear her Liebestod and realize how much more effective it would sound with a proper soprano voice . In this ecstatic music , a proper Isolde will give the impression of a soul soaring impassionedly into a spiritual union with her Tristan . Instead , the low tones and lack of brightness in Meier 's mezzo makes this poor Isolde very earth-bound ! The rest of the cast is adequate , Jerusalem especially . I have not been a fan of Barenboim 's conducting forays , particularly his CSO/Erato efforts . Here , I will withhold the vitrol and just say that he makes a competent accompanist for the singers here but in no way does he rival the great recorded conductors ' command of Wagner 's score . Not Furtwangler , not Karajan , not Bohm , not Bernstein , not Beecham/Reiner , and certainly not Kleiber either . One only has to listen to the incessant presence of the brass in this Barenboim , to realize his lack for care for orchestral balance . This brassy balance makes the string-playing sound tinny and insignificant.In summary , this is a Tristan you can overlook if you plan to have only one great Tristan recording in your collection . The alternatives to this Barenboim are far more desirable .	-1
I wonder if Barenboim is n't being near-sighted as a Wagner conductors , someone who does n't apparently care if his singres can comfortably sing their parts . All that has ever mattered to him is getting `` his '' Ring cycle on to CD , along with everything else in the Wagner canon.This Tristan is typical of the results to be heard elsewhere : wayward conducting , excellent sound , great orchestral work , and embarrassing if earnest singing . Jerusalem and Meier , both noted soloists , are so overparted here it is n't even funny , but then , so are all the singers in every single Barenboim Wagner opera , with few exceptions . What a waste ...	-1
The only thing this film has going for it is its sentimental value . This film showcases some of the last great performances of the venerable Keith Moon . Both Moon 's fantastic drumming and Daltrey 's famous blood-curdling scream on `` Wo n't Get Fooled Again '' are classic pieces of rock history . The likes of which will never be seen again.Keith Moon was not only rock 's greatest drummer but he was also one of rock 's funny men . Moon always had a quick wit about him and you can see some of that in this film . Unfortunately , you do n't see enough of it.Aside from its sentimental value , `` The Kids Are Alright '' does n't have much going for it . The film is choppy and disjointed and its quality leaves something to be desired . If I did n't know better , I 'd say Jeff Stein put this film together in his garage.If you 're a true Who fan , you may want to rent this video for sentimental reasons . But even then , I 'd still be reluctant to rent or buy this movie because it 's a BIG disappointment .	-1
I have to open this review by asking why everyone who has reviewed this album is so obsessed with the fact that this band is straight-edge ? Anyone who even CARES whether or not the artists responsible for creating music use drugs or not has completely missed the point of music ( and perhaps the point of life in general ) .Now to get down to business . This album is only 15 minutes long and I still did n't need to listen to more then half of it to know its not worth my time . Let 's face it , the amazing guitar work of Tom Morello is the reason we all listen to Rage Against the Machine . Zack De La Rocha is cool and all , but it was Tom Morello that brought the skill to the table . This album is talentless , uninspired , [ and ] unoriginal ... Politics did not ruin Zack De La Rocha , and a song having some basis in politics is not any less `` emotional '' or `` real '' as these hardcore freaks would tell you ; in fact , in the case of Zack De La Rocha , an interest in politics gave his lyrics the intelligence they needed to be interesting . No Spiritual Surrender only interested me when I was laughing at Zack De La Rocha 's goofy past.If hardcore really was the `` best music scene '' around as one reviewer puts it , I 'd hate to see the worst . Grow a brain and try doing something original . Be your own person instead of being part of a `` music scene '' of bands that all sound like they could be created by the same person . And do n't bother listening to Inside Out , because it 's not worth your time .	-1
Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt is highly overrated . The songs released were pretty good but after all these years , this album is dated and annoying now . This disc is heavy in ska which is no longer popular , no wonder they had to change their sound after this album . Do n't Speak was a great ballad but after you hear it 30,000 times you get sick of it . The only track I still appreciate is Sunday Morning , great hook and chorus . This album is considered their masterpiece , but I 've heard better .	-1
I hate Gwen 's yelling , screeching vocals and all the songs accept for `` Do n't Speak . '' The dance/pop band Clueless does a decent cover of `` Spiderwebs , '' but it just sounds like a lot of noise by No doubt .	-1
No Doubt combines the pouty vocals of bleached-blond , obsessive poser Gwen Stephani and her three garage-band-quality sidemen . The music is pop-based pablum . The lyrics too , are utterly juvenile . They either deal with the priorities of a spoiled 13-year-old schoolgirl or refer to poor Gwen 's busted affair with Tony what's-his-name ( No Doubt 's Indian bass player ) . This is music for the pre-pubescent crowd , many of whom are fanatical fans of Gwen , the make-up queen . If you 're an adult and are looking for something with a semblance of sophistication , move on .	-1
I 'm a big John Cafferty fan . I saw them live back in 1984 at the height of their & quot ; fame & quot ; and was bowled over . It was easily one of the best concerts that I 've ever attended . That said , this album really leaves me cold , as did the entire Eddie II saga . A lukewarm movie and a stillborn soundtrack . How many times have you seen this recipe ? It 's tough to live through one lightning strike . Why tempt another ?	-1
& quot ; In 3-D & quot ; is n't really worth the money . If you 're into Weird Al , get either & quot ; Running With Scissors & quot ; or & quot ; Bad Hair Day & quot ; . If you want comdey , get Ray Stevens .	-1
It 's possible that someone out there might still find favor with the over-orchestrated , over-produced music here - the kind that was once commonly used in dentist 's offices and elevators to soothe the listener 's nerves . These days , while other retro music like Martin Denny can have an agreeably continental flair , Mantovani is just plain dull . This is music of the worst possible type : drained of personality and soul , where even the occasional more modern song ( mid sixties ) comes off as stilted . This kind of thing has long been replaced by easy-listening jazz ; not even the uncoolest of the Star Search generation would be caught dead with this in their closet.This kind of dreck gives you sympathy for the poor listener whose musical background is so impoverished as to make this music an option .	-1
I did n't like it plain and simple . Vocals and otherwise were simply unappealing .	-1
Despite all the rave , this is still just a piece of crap ... in a cage ? The music is pretty dang good but the vocalist is beyond gay and always has been ... let 's not forget he 's the guy who started Zwan ... ZWAN for god 's sake ! ! ! This man should not be revered as a rock legend ... or ANYTHING to do with rock for that matter . This is pure file 13 but the mass mind is too stupid to realize .	-1
Someone stated that this remaster `` is not a victim of the loudness wars . '' They could not be more wrong . One look at the waveforms reveals that it is loud and even contains clipping ! It is n't as loud as some recent masters , but it is still loud enough to not even come close to the dynamics of the original , and loud enough to clip . On first listen , many would think that it sounds clear , and this is where the deception lies . It may not have enough clipping to be audible to some , but what is audible is that it has a lack of dynamics . All those little soft then loud parts are just loud now and no change in volume . I have not heard the remastered vinyl , so I can not vouch for the quality of that release , but anyone who compared the original vinyl to this new cd remaster would be able to tell that it blows away this remaster . Hell , even the original cd blows this away . People who think this remaster sounds good are too jaded from hearing too many modern brickwalled releases to remember what real dynamics sound like . I have to give Corgan credit for the nice packaging and the bonus dvd , but the remaster itself is not worth owning if you have the original , and if you do n't have the original , I would recommend buying it instead . In conclusion , making an album louder and more distorted is not remastering , but sadly that is all that is done with most modern `` remasters . ''	-1
After the other good reviews , I was really disappointed . There are some good songs . But there are some really obnoxious songs too . Figure on half a CD 's worth of good music .	-1
Logos was recorded in 1982 , at a time when Tangerine Dream was having a second wind . The band had spent the 1970s creating monstrous ambient freak-outs , universe-sized abstract cosmic soundscapes that swirled and pulsed . They developed a formula whereby a giant synthesiser would produce a bouncing rhythmic sequence , and the band would improvise over the top of this with Mellotron , flute , guitar , and whatever came to hand . By the end of the 1970s this was wearing thin , and the bandmembers were growing tired of each other . There was a brief go at turning Tangerine Dream into a conventional prog-rock band , with drums and vocals , but by the early 1980s the group had adopted a modernistic , clean synth-rock sound.Like the rest of Tangerine Dream 's live albums , Logos consists of music comparable to but not otherwise heard on the group 's contemporary studio recordings . As I understand it , the music on Logos is only a small part of the band 's set from that night ; it is apparently the first five minutes of the evening 's concert followed by the last half hour . The odd thing is that it divides neatly into two halves , a good half and a dull , anonymous half . I 'll say up-front that I have heard Tangerine Dream live concerts from 1981 and 1984 ( on the band 's second bootleg box set , and on the official live album `` Poland ) , and I prefer them to Logos . They are conceptually similar , with the same basic sound , but they are moodier and more tasteful . Logos is nonetheless a frustrating album , because although it is mostly inferior to Poland , one section is very good , but not quite good enough to warrant buying the album.Still , on the positive side , it 's a very accessible record . People tend to love or hate Tangerine Dream 's epic space music of the 1970s , whereas Logos has mass appeal . It has notes and chords . It has tunes and basslines and drum machines , although the drum machines sound feeble and play feeble patterns . Compared to the same drum machines wielded by Kraftwerk or Throbbing Gristle , at the same time , Tangerine Dream 's drum programming in 1982 was perfunctory.The first few minutes are slow and atmospheric , but there is only so much a band can do with an ominous drone , and so most of the album is fairly animated , with blippy sequences and Casiotone drums . In general , Tangerine Dream fill a lot of space with soloing , which works in the first section , because there is a strong melody and a well-defined , melancholic mood . Later in the record the soloing is just dull . It 's notable that the solos on Poland - sometimes with guitar - were strong and interesting , whereas Logos sounds almost childish at times . One of the problems that faced Tangerine Dream , as they abandoned pure atmosphere in favour of melody , is that it is easy to tell when a melody is trite and simple , whereas pure atmosphere is abstract . The band 's abstract cosmic improvisations of the 1970s will not date , because they sound like nothing else from the period . On the other hand , a lot of Logos sounds like early-80s television soundtrack music , particularly the section from 36:00 onwards , which could easily have been used in one of the Police Academy films , perhaps to underscore a beach party . The final minutes strive for epic majesty , but fail badly . One of the best definitions of camp that I have read is that camp is `` failed seriousness '' , and this is often the case with Logos . The tasteless poppy bits undermine the moody , dramatic sections , turning them into the electronic equivalent of the `` Dragnet '' theme tune.The instruments sound old-fashioned . Kraftwerk 's synthesiser pop of the 1970s has dated , but it has dated in a charming way , whereas Logos puts me in mind of Blue Thunder and Airwolf and Knight Rider . Tangerine Dream had their pick of all the modern synthesizers of the early 1980s , and I suspect they did not take the time to sit back and ponder whether they liked PRESET 12 : FM CLUNK because it was good , or just because it was new . Perhaps I react this way because I was alive in the early 1980s . Perhaps people born in the 1990s will be stunned by this vintage electronic masterpiece . To be fair , the band might have simply had a bad night - the 1981 and 1984 concerts have not dated so badly , even the drum programming in the 1981 concert is superior.Still , back to Logos . The theme that comes in at about 20:00 is super . I first heard it on the soundtrack of the film The Keep , indeed it is the reason I bought the album . It is powerful , it sounds massive , you can hum it , you can tap your feet to it . It 's simple and hypnotic . It also sounds a bit like `` Bette Davis Eyes '' by Kim Carnes . It skirts very close to camp - the chords are almost too dramatic to take seriously - but I remember that it worked well in the film , and it is undeniably vivid.After that point the album has nothing much of interest . It reminds me of the incidental music from Legend , but less focussed . It also reminds me of Steve Hillage 's contemporary synth-pop album FOR TO NEXT , which had a whiff of Tangerine Dream about it . It was a dull , uninteresting album , but it pointed the way to greater things . Steve Hillage went on create System 7 , a band that made some excellent ambient music in the 1990s , whereas Tangerine Dream 's music nose-dived in quality as the 1980s continued . It was not inevitable that this would happen.Overall therefore I recommend you buy Poland instead . It 's a better Tangerine Dream live album , and a better album overall ; it is the band 's swan song . On the evidence of Logos it is hard to see why people remember Tangerine Dream , whereas Poland has something . Also , if you can get hold of the 1981 concert on the box set , do so - it 's almost as good as Poland , despite being three years older .	-1
This is the first of the Remasters I purchased , not because it 's my favorite or anything like that , but because I saw a good deal for it in the record store . I do n't really hear a whole lot of difference between this and the CD I bought years ago . I compared the two with headphones on and the only real difference I could tell is that it is louder . I guess I could have remastered this album myself with a turn of my volume knob . Maybe my ears are n't as trained as some other peoples , but that 's all I can tell . And then of course there is the editing of `` Star Star '' , which is a shame because it is one of the few songs on this album that I really like , the others being Heartbreaker and Angie . From what I 've read this was a mistake , as it was the version of the song originally released in the U.S. back in '73 , and they did n't mean to put that on this reissue , and that the mistake has been corrected on later pressings . This begs the question of how much care and painstaking remastering went into these albums if a mistake like this was made ? Clearly they were n't paying that much attention . It also makes me think that these two different versions need to be labeled , because in stores and on Amazon I have not been able to find edited and un-edited versions , I guess you just have to buy it and hope you get the right one . And before anybody says that editing a curse word is n't that big of a deal , the way it is done is very strange and really annoying . Had the word just been muffled or something it would n't have been nearly as bad , instead an edit of Mick 's voice comes in out of nowhere and is shouting over the word and you can hear both voices like a jumble of stupidity .	-1
Or , the Rolling Stones Audition Guitarists And Then Get The General Public To Pay For It . ( I woulda given the nod to Wayne Perkins . ) Only eight tracks , making this the shortest Stones album of the 1970s ; which would n't matter if those eight tracks were chock-filled with meaty goodness . Which , alas , they are not . We get two based entirely around simple soul grooves with minimal lyrics ( Hot Stuff and Hey Negrita ) ; a damp squib of a reggae cover ( Cherry Oh Baby ) ; two formulaic slabs of Stonesraunch , one good , one throwaway ( Hand Of Fate , Crazy Mama ) ; a rather touching country/soul ballad , Memory Motel ( which loses some of its appeal when you realise it 's about groupies ) ; the abomination that is Fool To Cry ; and a fantastic piece of cocktail jazz/Broadway showstopper in the form of Melody , completely unlike anything the band 's ever done and all the better for it -- Frank Sinatra shoulda done this one . It 's not the worst thing the Stones ever put out ; it 's just eminently forgettable . The band had almost reached their lowest point and a recovery would soon be in process .	-1
I have bought all of the Rolling Stones ' records at one time or another , and I just love their classic 60s and early 70s albums . But I did end up throwing two Stones CDs away the last time I went through my overstuffed CD shelves , and this was one of them . `` Black And Blue '' is a bland , sadly uninspired collection of mediocre funk , soul , reggae and pop-rock , and to me it is a stylistic experiment gone wrong , and probably the Stones ' most forgettable record . It is certainly a far cry from the tough rock and blues they played in the 60s and early 70s ( and in the 90s for that matter ) , and the only song worth notice , `` Memory Motel '' , can be found in a very fine rendition on the live `` No Security '' .This one is only for completists . Well , maybe not . I 'm a bit of a Stones completist myself , and I threw it away . I 'm not really sure who it 's for , then .	-1
I do have this album ( unfortunately ) . The 'Boys ' starting heading into uncharted waters without a compass on this one . They got away from what they were good at and tried a hand at reggae . Glad they didnt try it again , huh ? I ca n't think of one good song here and this is coming from a fan who saw them live in '65 . Too much 'after concert partying I guess ' . Time to hang it up THEN ! ! ! ! !	-1
The first time I heard Black And Blue it didnt catch me the way the other Rolling Stones albums did . I was really shocked how much their sound changed sounding reggae , disco , and funkish . But in all respects the jamming on the songs was extensive . Black And Blue was released in 1976 , this was the first album of Mick Taylor 's departure . The new axeman ( guitarist ) was Ron Wood . I think this album was good for two reasons the jams , and because their was the Rolling Stones . This is one of the worst !	-1
It does n't matter how many times it 's remastered only one descent song ( Shes So Cold ) and it 's repetitive enough to not want to listen to much ... I 'm glad I found the FLAC torrent for this and undercover 2009 remaster ... both I could live wthout ! !	-1
Very bad recording . Just another bunch of songs put together to sell based on the great fame of the band . Only for the die-hard fan .	-1
If you 're a ROLLING STONES completist , then you must buy this album . If yo & uacute ; wan na have only the cream of Stones , then this is the last album to buy . Simple as that .	-1
Contrived , convoluted , mechanical , etc . These guys went through the motions on this one . It sounds like it was recorded in a day . What an effort .	-1
Why , exactly , is `` Exile On Main Street '' supposed to be so great ? I read other reviews of this sprawling mess and saw words like `` nasty '' , `` edgy '' , and `` funky '' routinely used to describe it ... but seriously , folks , where on this album do you hear ANYTHING nasty or edgy ? The Stones played much better blues and country on `` Beggars Banquet '' , and they rocked far more convincingly on `` Let It Bleed '' . Their music had lost its bite by this point ( it was briefly resurrected on the 1983 single 'Undercover of the Night ' ) , and these songs make them sound like Brian Jones 's worst nightmare : a very white band doing a tired , almost Vegas-esque parody of roots music . 'Shine a Light ' epitomizes how far out of touch with their roots the Stones actually were in 1972 ; it 's a dreary , maudlin , cliche-ridden attempt at an anthem that falls flat on its face ( 'Salt of the Earth ' on `` Beggars Banquet '' , while also dripping with insincerity , is a better song in this vein ) . 'Rocks Off ' and 'Happy ' are good , breezy songs , and 'Tumbling Dice ' is okay . I can live without the remainder of `` Exile '' , however , and the argument that it would have been stronger as a stripped-down , single-disc release is really meaningless -- it still would be disappointingly flaccid when compared to the Stones ' earlier work . Where is this album 's 'Street Fighting Man ' or ' Gim me Shelter ' or 'Brown Sugar ' ? Nowhere . The fire is gone.Buy `` Exile '' if you must , but remember that it 's only been considered the `` best Stones album '' since the mid-nineties or so , just as the generally unremarkable `` Revolver '' is now touted by critics as the finest thing the Beatles ever created . It is inadvisable to buy into the critical mythology of rock music ; listen to the records and decide for yourself .	-1
joe fleckenstein here to give you his opion of this sucky band . they were sucky not half as good as led zepplin or metalica . Terrible muscianship blended in with mcjaggers whiny and awful voice . completely talentless utterly bnal trash . i would recomend this to you unless you enjoy going to the dentist . keith richards was a terrible guitarist . metalicas guitarist could play circles around him . you people who like stones dont know good guitar work . anyway terrible awful album avoid like the plaque .	-1
Like Sticky Fingers , I own this on a record , SACD and CD . This 2009 remaster was awful . Clipped in spots , way too loud.Save your money and look around for the 1994 Virgin remaster or buy it on a vinyl record .	-1
The Rolling Stones ' Exile On Mainstreet is the most absurdly overrated album in rock history . There is nothing overly special about this 1972 `` classic . '' The Stones effectively pilfered the styles of BB King or Buddy Guy and repeated the process eighteen times . Some tracks such as `` Torn and Frayed , '' `` Tumbling Dice '' and `` Happy '' are fine on their own but the album as a whole falls flat , weighed down by a tedious repetition of murky , southern draws and generic , unexciting blues riffs . It is a decent album when compared to those of lower ranking British blues bands such as Ten Years After or Herman 's Hermits but there are many more capable and radiant LPs in rock 's arsenal deserving of Exile 's rank in the classic album hierarchy .	-1
The Rolling Stones are one of the most lousiest and overrated bands of all time . They only made 2 decent albums in Some Girls , and Tattoo You . This has a few of the lousiest songs in Happy , and Tumbing Dice . Do n't buy this horrible album , go get Some Girls insted .	-1
Wow my friends , this is a total awful album . Mick Jagger is one of the crappiest singers of all time.and made some of their worstsongs ever in Brown Suger . Do n't even say a word about Green Day either ... say any word about Nirvana , Dire Straits , Foreigner , orGNR insted as they were the GREATEST ! ! ! ! ! ! Stop messing around with this crappy band and their awful albums and go with all 4 of them bands insted . STONES WILL ALWAYS SUCK ! ! ! !	-1
I agree with the previous posts that correctly note that the new mastering on this CD is much too loud , often bringing the music to near distortion levels . One need to simply compare the waveforms ( with any wave editor program ) of the 94 Virgin releases with the new remasters . The 94 remasters still leave room for the music to `` breath . '' The new remasters do n't breath at all ... they are in your face the whole time.Yes , you can hear sounds in these remasters you have n't heard before . And while that is sort of neat ( especially in the quieter passages ) , it 's simply because the volume level of the quieter sounds has been significantly increased ... while the louder parts have been limited to allow to bring everything to the brickwall without distorting . The end result is something the Stones never originally intended . In essence , it 's like some strange sort of remix of volume levels.And quite honestly , these remasters are painful on the ears . The lack of the dynamics of earlier issues means your ears are getting assaulted non-stop by artificially loud music . The problem is that when you remove the `` quiet '' from the music , you also essentially remove the `` loud . '' The new remasters ultimately lack the punch of the 94 Virgin issues and sound shrill in comparison ( even if the bass is indeed louder ) .The good news is that the 94 Virgin CDs should now start showing up used more frequently as fans dump them in the mistaken notion that they are getting better sound with the newest remasters . One should be able to build up a collection of 94 Virgin CDs rather cheaply as a result .	-1
Not better than TSMR.The Stones always seem to be copying someone , the fab four in the sixties bowie and the bee gees in the seventies.Though the stones are at their best when they try stuff like the discoish Miss You and the latter Emotional Rescue as well as the earlier acid stuff on TSMR , and forgot the stodgy R & amp ; R. Would have been good had they done a cover of All You Need is Love.They could have done a video with the Beatles sitting at THEIR feet.NOT ! This is an OK CD but if your not a Stones nut your better off with a compilation and that way you dont get any filler which the stones are notorious for.Try Hot Rocks , Rolled Gold or Rewind .	-1
Is `` No Spare Parts '' really from the Some Girls era ? It sounds more like the boys are cashing in on that hip-hop rhythm that 's been going around for the last few years . And if you do n't do n't know what I 'm talking about you have n't been listening to the current country and/or pop or you 're just too caught up in the sheep-dip to realize it , as it 's the same rhythm `` everybody '' is singing along to these days.Other than that these songs sound more like the non album b-sides from the Voodoo lounge era . In fact `` So Young '' was issued on the `` Out of Tears '' single along with another non- album track called , `` I 'm Gon na Drive '' ... ... .not that there 's anything wrong with that !	-1
was this a demo tape he packaged into a CD ? Sounds a bit limp .	-1
'Steel Wheels ' was the Stones 1989 comeback album . It was a triumph for them ; why people call this a bad album is beyond me . To me , this is almost a return to form . But then again , this is coming from someone who likes 'Dirty Work ' quite a bit , and when this came out in 1989 , there was great shock that Jagger and Richards were working ( let alone speaking ) with each other again . And the result is this , Bill Wyman 's last album with the band.The album itself is a 4.5 or 5 star record to me . 'Almost Hear You Sigh , ' the world music-esque 'Continental Drift , ' the Top 10 hit 'Mixed Emotions ' and 'Rock and a Hard Place ' all rank among my favorite Stones songs from the 1980s . This record is a great album to own if you love the Stones . I can not recommend it enough.So , now I 've given a brief review of the record . Here 's what I think about this remaster and every other 2009-2010 Polydor remaster of the Stones.==============================================================Well , it 's dreadful . Just dreadful . The sound is loud , distorted , and WAAAAY overcompressed . Bill Wyman is turned up way too loud and the mix on this , and the vocals almost seem to drown in the mix . Mick is almost inaudible at times , and Charlie 's snare shots almost blast you out of the park on these remasters . And no , that 's unfortunately not a good thing.Granted , I do not own all of the remasters : I could n't stomach buying all of them . I started with 'Sticky Fingers ' ( BY FAR one of the worst remasters I have ever heard ) , and later bought 'Still Life ( American Concert 1981 ) , ' 'Tattoo You ' and this one , 'Steel Wheels . ' All of them were horrendous . Every one of these remasters were designed for your iPod or MP3 player . Now I love listening to my iPod -- but these just reek on them . I own the original CD issues on Columbia ( released from 1986-1991 approximately ) and they sound great . Not perfect , but great . After hearing these Polydor/UMe remasters , I found myself reaching for those . The original CD pressings ( as well as the 1994 Virgin pressings ) still sound punchy and deliver a great sound . Sure , on the originals , you have to turn up the volume a little bit , but it 's worth it . The sound is great , and everything is audible . Here , on these 2009 remasters , it is the complete opposite . The instruments drown each other out . The sound is unnatural and lacks any depth.I love The Stones . Always have , and I always will . Which is why I give this and every other Polydor remaster ( that I have heard ) one star . A friend played me the 2010 'Exile on Main Street ' remaster , and I could n't listen . It too was compressed and distorted , but I would n't expect anything less from these crappy remasters.I recommend this to one who cares absolutely nothing about how a recording sounds or one who wants to hear what a bad remaster sounds like . After all , every one of these Stones remasters are fine examples of the `` Loudness War . '' Track down the original Columbia CD pressings for the recordings made 1971-1991 and buy 'Voodoo Lounge , ' 'Stripped , ' 'Bridges to Babylon , ' 'Live Licks ' and 'A Bigger Bang ' in their original Virgin pressings . To fully appreciate the Stones from 1971-present , that is the way to do it.But whatever you do , stay , FAR , FAR , FAR , FAR , FAR away from these recent remasters . They are absolute junk and you will find yourself wanting a refund right away ( if you are an audiophile , that is ) .	-1
one great track in continental drift and a couple other worthy ones in driftin away and blinded by love but the rest are just product . the one stones album that i can do without	-1
There 's some awful songs.There 's some terrible performances.Even the pants Mick is wearing on the cover are horrendous.So is there anything redeeming to Dirty Work , the album that broke the Stones up in the mid-80 's ? In fact , there is . Dirty Work sometimes thrives on the fact that it 's easily the angriest , most forceful disc in Stones catalog . Think of the kind of emotion that fueled Exile on Main Street 's `` Ventillator Blues '' filling up an entire album ( so long as you exclude the dreadful Hold Back , Winning Ugly , and Back To Zero ) . The tension and disgust that fuels the disc are summed up by the opening of the album 's first track , `` One Hit '' . The battle between the tension-filled acoustic guitar part and the bursting , screaming electric is essentially the relationship betwen Mick and Keith on the album . The song also contains Jagger 's best vocals and lyrics . Is the song addressing a relationship between two lovers ? A drug and its ' addict ? It 's followed by the messy , sloppy `` Fight '' , which like `` Had It With You '' and the title track are good , and are GREAT to listen to when you 're angry with the whole damn world - but only seem great in the light of the sub-par album that they 're part of.Aside from `` One Hit '' and the cover of `` Harlem Shuffle '' , Jagger 's vocals are his worst in the Stones catalog : as if he were trying to sabotage the album just so he could get back to being a solo artist . In fact , the best singing on the album is on Keith 's two tracks : a cover of the reggae tune `` Too Rude '' ( I think it 's great , but be warned : no else I know seems to like it ) and the only other Must-Have from this album ( along with `` One Hit '' ) : `` Sleep Tonight '' . Keith has always had a reputation as a potential killer : this is the first time where he performs the lead vocals that reflects that image.My advice ? Simply burn the handful of songs that are good on this album . To have the whole thing is really not worth your while , and besides , do you really want to see those pants that Mick is wearing ever again ?	-1
When Paul McCartney got up on the Ed Sullivan Show and sang `` Till There Was You '' , a shmaltzy Broadway tune , it is said thousand switched to becoming Rolling Stones fans . Probably not true ; but the vibe surrounding DIRTY WORK was of a band grasping for one more breath of air . There was a major war between Jagger and Richards over Jagger 's freshly launched solo career . If Richards is to be believed , it was not that Jagger had gone solo that bothered him . If Jagger had gone a done an album of Irish drinking songs with a fiddle player and harpist , ( or , I suppose these days , do a Sinatra turn with the Great American Songbook ) that would have been perfectly OK with him . But it was that Jagger took some perfectly good rock songs the Stones could have done justice with and wasted them . Jagger had chosen some excellent musicians-but thrown together they just were n't a band.The chill is all over this album . Only two songs are worthy to polish the steps leading up to the temple of Stones ' Songs : `` One Hit to the Body '' and `` Winning Ugly '' . `` Fight '' might be OK ; but too often it just melts into `` One Hit ... '' as one continuous song . The Stones did have a minor hit with `` Harlem Shuffle '' -itself a minor R & B ; hit from 1964 . As with most Stones R & B ; covers , you 're better off going directly to the original . ( Even by Stones standards , `` Harlem Shuffle '' is uninspired . ) The rest of the album is simply forgettable . Even among those who just adore the 1980 's , DIRTY WORK does n't appear on anyone 's retrospective radar.Looking back , it seemed that rock stars from the 1960 'S went into a sudden de-tox whiskey hangover with a pine-scented cough syrup chaser during the 1980 's . It must have been all those long nights of women , sex , and cocaine that left nasal passages permanently dilated , long boring days doing crossword puzzles in rehab , IV drips on antibiotics and truck loads of women 's underwear thrown on stage . `` Oh , gee . Another bird on her boyfriend 's shoulders flashing her headlights at me . How droll ! ! ! ! '' They lost their way . Plus there were all those young whippersnappers in spandex and big hair kicking their butts across the stage.Jagger 's solo career inched up to the cliff and then took a sharp nosedive . Although Jagger did release a couple of excellent albums , Richards put out a few solo albums himself that were more highly regarded by the critics-but neither did well . A small , silent gasp ran across the entire rock community . `` If Mick Jagger ca n't do well outside the Stones , what hope is there for the rest of us ? In the sixties and seventies , people would have just killed for a Jagger album . Now most people ca n't be bothered . `` This album is a piece of junk . It does n't come even close to the greatness of TATTOO YOU the Stones began the decade with . For die-hard fans only .	-1
If you think this album is bad , stay away from & # 34 ; Love You Live & # 34 ; ... .	-1
Originally I was going to mark `` Black and Blue '' as the low point in the Rolling Stones catalogue ... until I remembered this one ! Has the be the lowest musical points in their stellar catalogue . `` One Hit '' is good , but the rest..oh my ... If you want to hear this Rock group visit `` Let it Bleed '' or `` Exile on Main Street '' .	-1
`` Undercover '' is a record that has long fascinated me . In terms of quality and overall importance , it 's somewhat of an anomaly in their catalog . Sandwiched between their last truly great record and their first truly dismal one , `` Undercover '' just sort of sits there awkwardly and its presence becomes somewhat ignored . With `` Emotional Rescue '' mostly comprised of the `` Some Girls '' outtakes and `` Tattoo You '' made up of leftovers from as far back as 1972 , `` Undercover '' is the band 's first official original recording of the 1980s ' . They are n't far enough into the Reagan era that the decade 's trademark slick , polished , synthetic sound swallows these songs whole , but make no mistake , the record is definitely the band adapting to the sounds of times , much the same way they latched onto disco and punk around 1976-78.So what 's the verdict ? Not well , I 'm afraid . There are definitely moments that work . The band gets the album 's two best songs - by far - out of the way at the start , which is kind of a mistake in my opinion since the rest of the record struggles at points to keep their momentum . The opening title song , `` Undercover of the Night , '' is a blazing full force rocker centering around the Central American violence going at the time . Not normally known for the political statements in their music , `` Undercover of the Night '' is a force to be reckoned with musically and lyrically . The imagery in the lyrics is strong and vivid without coming off as forced or hamfisted , and the music is an explosive whirlwind of crunchy riffs , pulsating hooks and pounding drums . It 's one of their best studio performances and they 've never been able to capture the same intensity in concert.Moving from the sublime to the ridiculous , `` She Was Hot '' is a raunchy tale of a one night stand told with lusty vigor . The guitars move at a brisk pace and Mick is at his seedy best , singing with a grimy faux American drawl that only adds to the humor of the song . I personally wish they want with the harder rocking take on the song from the music video , but the version used here is no slouch and serves the song just fine.Of the rest of the album , only Keith 's charming `` Wan na Hold You , the creepy `` Too Much Blood , '' and the fun `` All the Way Down '' leave a lasting impact . The rest of the record is n't terrible , but kind of forgettable . I 'd be hard pressed to recall any of these songs without having to seriously sit down and repeatedly listen to the record , which its overall quality simply does n't warrant . `` Tie You Up '' has a nice groove but not much else going for it , while `` Feel On Baby '' is a droning , lyrically underdeveloped Police rip-off that grates on you really quickly . `` Pretty Beat Up '' and `` Too Tough '' are interchangeable in that they 're both wholly inconsequential rockers with nothing going for them in any way , shape or form . The closing `` It Must Be Hell '' is a hackneyed attempt at a political statement and should 've ever gotten beyond paper.Overall , a shockingly below par record for the group , with some nice gems if you look hard enough .	-1
HOW FAR DOWN CAN THEY GO ? HOW ABOUT TITLES LIKE & quot ; TOO MUCH BLOOD & quot ; & quot ; TIE YOU UP & quot ; AND & quot ; TOO TOUGH & quot ; . THE FACT IS & quot ; THE WORLDS GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND & quot ; GAVE UP CARING LONG AGO , FULL WELL KNOWING THAT THEY CAN RELEASE A ALBUM OF PURE BILGEWATER LIKE THIS AND SOME FANS WILL STILL RUN OUT AND BUY IT . FOLKS , THE GLORY DAYS ARE LONG GONE , THIS IS JUST ANOTHER CLUNKER TOO ADD TO THEIR POST 1973 LIST !	-1
I have tried to listen to the Rolling Stones many times but the result is always the same , I just do n't like their music . I do n't understand why they are so big with so limited talent . Mick Jagger is not a signer , this band should consider themself very lucky to have been in the fisrt band in the history of Rock'n'Roll because I am sure they would never have such success if their career started in the 70 's when there were many more bands to choose from .	-1
The song titled 'Love is Strong ' , is the main reason why I bought the Rolling Stone 's Voodoo Lounge album . After I listened to the rest of the album , I was quite dissapointed . I just wished for the days of great Stone 's albums like Sticky Fingers or even Some girls to come back . Unfortunately , I think those days are long gone with an album like Voodoo Lounge . If you are a hard core Rolling Stones fan , I would imagine you buying this album . For now , I just wish that the Stones could just pump out one or more great albums that would send the rock and roll fever going through my veins .	-1
Filling the whole album with outtakes from & quot ; Gish & quot ; and & quot ; siamese dream & quot ; could be a great idea but the songs from here are lacking of originality and their specific energy.there are good songs like dark and creepy & quot ; soothe & quot ; , & quot ; Landslide & quot ; and & quot ; Obscured & quot ; , & quot ; Hello kity kat & quot ; rocks like nothing before but it is a bit to less to give it 3 stars.these songs from album are leaving you wanting more but there is nothing more really.unfinished songs , jams and nothing really important for standard rock fan although Pumpkins fans will buy it anyway .	-1
As everyone knows , Keith Richards adheres to a different sense of `` time '' ( not necessarily `` timing '' ) as do the rest of us mortals . If he so chooses , Keef can stay awake , chemically or `` el-Keefo '' /organically sort of `` indefinitely . '' And when Keef is playing , that 's when the Rolling Stones are playing . Yeah , yeah , read all the other blurbs about `` who , what , when , where , why , & how , '' for the specifics ; but OK , I 'll reiterate : this is Mick Jagger , the Eternal # 2 Rock And Roll Rhythm Section , Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts ( `` first '' is , as any fool knows , Duck Dunn & All Jackson of Booker T & The MGs ) , pianist Nicky Hopkins , and session guitarist Ry Cooder . And while the Rolling Stones are my all-time favorite rock and roll band , specifically the edition with Mick Taylor & Ian Stewart , they started to ... stink really badly when Mick T quit . `` Why , '' you ask ? I 'd be only too happy to oblige - two words : `` Miss You . '' As Mick J writes in the `` liner notes '' to ... '' this , '' `` we were waiting for our guitar player out of bed . '' Well evidentally , Mick T was n't out of bed , either . So , sometime between the `` Let It Bleed '' version of `` Love In Vain '' ( where Cooder played `` mandolin '' ) and `` Sister Morphine '' off `` Sticky Fingers , '' `` slide guitar , '' blah-blah , I guess this was recorded . It 's interesting - sort of - to hear Mick and the 4 musicians try to `` lock '' into a riff or tune without Keef 's guidance , but with the exception of Elmore James ' `` It Hurts Me Too , '' `` Jamming With Edward '' is more akin to the Dreadful Grate , a Hahavishnu `` ochestra '' something-or-the-other , or , um , `` late Santana '' : ALL the other material starts in the `` middle '' somewhere and ends in the `` middle '' of something else . Wan na hear Bill Wyman jamming w/o the Stones ? Listen to anything by his `` Rhythm Kings . '' Or Charlie ? Really , ANYTHING that man graces by his percussive ability shines , but his latest , `` ABCD '' /boogie-woogie thing is good , but to hear the man within his element : I suggest his first solo CD , `` From One Charlie . '' If you 're not necessarily `` that into jazz , '' then scope out his work on the `` Weird Nightmare : Meditations On Mingus . '' `` Jamming With Edward '' is interesting - ONCE .	-1
First , let me say I am a huge Blur fan . And I knew exactly what I was paying for when I got this-the exact opposite of what got me into them , Blur and 13 . This is made for Britain : string and horn arrangements , and the so-called punkish Globe Alone ( while not such a bad song ) , ca n't be compared to anything in the way Green Day or Bad Religion or whatever your idea of punk is . So , for U.S . Blur fans in it for their rock , do n't bother unless you 're a big fan .	-1
Apart from a few flashes of genius , mainly the singles , this album is mostly poor . I mean , 28 songs ? C'mon Billy , do you really love the sound of your own voice that much ? I imagine even the most avid Pumpkins fan ( which i am not ) would begin to get dizzy after 28 songs of your monotonous nasal whining . Other than the singles there is n't much else worth listening here . I recommend you get Gish and stay away from this nasty pretentious beast .	-1
More Boring rock by the talentless fool who excels at sounding like a whiny Tottler .	-1
My copy has no visible marks but it skips heavy begining with To Forgive . I am more than disappointed and wish I had never purchased this record as now there is a disclaimer for it .	-1
Thought I would get lucky and receive an `` undistorted '' vinyl copy through Amazon but to no avail . Several songs were unlistenable . I 'm sending back tomorrow . I wish those few people who said they received perfect copies would post which 3rd party sellers they ordered from so maybe I could order from them and maybe get a good one but oh well . Look in your mailbox Amazon cause here it comes back to you .	-1
I can not understand how such a weak album can be sold as a masterpiece ! This sound could besatisfying for a teen-ager but a developed listener and music lover should save his money !	-1
I HATE THIS ALBUM ! ! ! I have always hated this album and always will ! ! ! I am a huge Bowie fan and I HATE THIS ALBUM ! ! ! Not because of the blatant commercialism of it but because it is terrible . There is honestly not a single track that I can say that is essential for me . The title track and biggest single is a nightmare of insipid one liners , China Girl and Modern Love I liked when they were released but have come to detest over time . All other tracks are throw aways . His rerecording of Putting Out Fire is shameful ( I love the original from the movie 'Cat People ' ) . The only track I even remotely like is 'Criminal World ' and even that is being generous . I even liked 'Tonight ' and 'Never Let Me Down ' better than this album . At least those albums had 'loving the alien ' and 'time will crawl'.Is it just me ? ! ? ! ?	-1
This soundtrack is horrible . All it is is a mix of electronic sounds and 2 good tracks : 1 and 2 . The title song is good , and track 2 ( The Goldeneye Overture ) is O.K . but the rest is bad . The music is very boring . The CD case is more interesting than the music . Eric Serra just is n't good for the part of composing James Bond music . The only reason I bought this CD was because I collect James Bond soundtracks . It sure was n't worth the money I payed for it . But that is only my opinion .	-1
What a pity I 'm forced to give this License to Hurl 1 star , because that 's one more than it deserves . Synth maven Serra was a terrible choice for this genre from the beginning , being far more comfortable with a futuristic feast like `` The Fifth Element , '' but then he arrogantly doffed the Bond theme and peppered the film with hokey , inappropriate synth solos that dragged down every scene they accompanied . One ( `` Pleasant Drive in St Petersburg '' ) was so bad that the producers omitted it from the film , leaving the scene it was meant for to flounder on without help.Of all Bond scores , this one would be a finalist for the worst ever , along with Legrand 's jazzed-up mess for `` Never Say Never Again '' and Hamlisch 's disco-drenched `` The Spy Who Loved Me . '' Decide for yourself which one was the worst , but this one is definitely a bottom-three puker .	-1
As much as I 've always loved Geto Boys , Big Mike , and the whole 90s Houston and Rap-A-Lot scene , 3-2 is a rapper I 've never been able to get into . His earlyConvictsalbum with Big Mike andSecrets of the Hidden Templealbum with Blac Monks are solid albums , but solo I 've always found 3-2 quite underwhelming , and this is especially true on this release . And that 's really a shame , because `` The Wicked Buddah Baby '' is excellently produced . These beats are top-notch Houston productions , from the likes of Rap-A-Lot greats N.O . Joe , Mike Dean , and Swift . The songs have slow , rolling bass , some really nice funky instrumentals , and that signature woozy quality that will always be associated with Texas hip hop . These are perfect for riding and chilling . If these beats had been saved for Scarface , Big Mike , or even Willie D or Facemob , we might have some truly great material on our hands . But somehow , 3-2 ended up with these beats , and the product is simply disappointing . 3-2 is an average gangsta rapper , he raps about clothes , grindin ' , the hood , cars , and the typical subjects with little flair or style , and he 's neither an enticing lyricist nor a really appealing character . But what really makes him hard to like is his flow . I find 3-2 's voice hard to take , and never so much as on `` The Wicked Buddah Baby . '' His high voice is annoying , and when he sings the hooks in his pitchy drawl and holds notes , it 's just short of awful . There are some nice tracks that 3-2 nearly ruins here with his performances . The tracklist is too long , most songs well exceeding five minutes . A few guest appearances from high profile MCs save the album from being terrible , but `` The Wicked Buddah Baby '' does n't have much going for it outside the beats.The intro has a cool beat but is n't worth listening to more than once , it 's too long . `` Comin ' Down '' is an upbeat ode to his region , musically good but lyrically average and poorly delivered , the hook is weak . `` Dressed 2 Kill '' is slow rolling and well-produced , but I really feel like 3-2 brings this song down too , his day-in-the-hood and flossy lyrics are boring and his delivery and voice are hard to take . There are definitely some nice vibes on `` My Sweet Trick , '' but as is too often the case on this album , 3-2 lowers the quality with boring rhymes and an annoying tone . The same goes for `` Them Against Me , '' a funky and bouncy number . `` Welcome to the Slab '' is easily among the best songs here , but even on this song 3-2 's performance is disappointing . The beat is great , a quality laidback Houston track , but 3-2 raps poorly about nothing in particular and the hook is poor . `` Turnin ' Lane '' is probably the most solid song , it 's actually nice . The beat is funky and upbeat , and the lyrics about riding are n't amazing but match the vibe of the song nicely , South Side Playaz provide a nice guest appearance . `` Kickin ' Flowz '' follows the album 's trend : great beat , poor performance . `` Hit the Highway '' brings high-profile guest appearances from both Too Short and 8Ball & MJG , it 's a decent song but nothing special . `` You Wan na Ride '' is pretty boring , despite UGK 's guest and `` Buddah Nature ( Remix ) '' with UGK is decent . The album closes with a banal six and a half minute outro.There 's a reason 3-2 is n't as well known as his contemporaries , and that 's because he 's an inferior MC . Add that with his annoying delivery and you have the recipe for , well , not much good . I think that 3-2 benefited foremost from knowing all the right people ; he was able to get great producers and a Rap-A-Lot deal for his affiliation with Big Mike and Geto Boys , and later with DJ Screw and the Screwed Up Click . But he 's really a run-of-the-mill rapper on this album . The beats are enjoyable enough , but you can find similar beats with vastly better raps on Big Mike'sSomethin ' Seriousand U.G.K . 'sRidin ' Dirty , among others . This just does n't stack up with the 90s Rap-A-Lot discography that includes so many classics . It 's long out of print too , so the high prices that this demands are ridiculous . This might have collector 's value for some , but `` The Wicked Buddah Baby '' is n't an album I recommend .	-1
The songs `` Wannabe '' and `` If You Ca n't Dance '' are the most annoying songs on this album . I think this is the Spice Girls ' worst album because they try to hard to be sexy on most of the songs and it comes out being fake and awful . I only liked `` Two Become One . ''	-1
Eric Idle 's pre-fab creation , The RUTLES , were an hilarious dead-on knock-off of the Beatles . But that was 1978 , and all four Fabs were alive then -- so laughter came easy . This 1990s rip of the ANTHOLOGY specials and CDs is Idle-less , ill-considered and quite unnecessary.The new `` old '' songs here are dismissively mediocre , the three-man-left joke in poor taste , and even the mixes seem wrong : music obscures many vocals to the point where this not only does n't sound like the Beatles , it ai n't the RUTLES , either . Give it a rest Neil -- it 's not funny anymore , mate ! TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 49:37	-1
This album is a pathetic attempt to sound like Garbage . They did n't come anywhere close to the mark and are definetly one of the bands you should make sure to avoid .	-1
I was really disappinted with this album because I 'd bought discovery before this one and it was a great funky cd.Now , my theory is that the 1st album of every artist ever , is always their best..Boy was I wrong ... and a half ! Homework absoloutly squashed that idea completely ! After hearing the classic 'Around The World ' ( in my opinion their best song ever ) i thought the album would reflect this . As soon as i heard the beginning track 'dafizetrse ' or watever its called , i had an instinct that the album would suck..and it did . Do n't bother with this album , the only 3 good songs ( out of 16 tracks ) are Around The World , Teachers and Oh Yeah . The rest are just noise . So , in a nutshell , this album stinks worse than a hobo , get discovery instead .	-1
I tried my best to like this cd but it just was n't happening . The tracks ranged in quality from annoying to unbearable . Consider Discovery first before buying this cd unless you are truly a fan .	-1
I really did n't like this album . It sounded like Scarface was just rapping over these beats and did n't really bring it . And I know how Scarface is because I have all his albums . The only good songs were `` Smile '' with 2Pac and the one that follows it , `` Smartz '' . Also , `` Mary Jane '' .	-1
Oh no . I hate to say it but The Stones dynasty has finally come to an end . Voodoo Lounge was a step down the ladder , but the guys have fallen off it now . With this shocking album , you can only cringe upon hearing songs like 'flip the switch ' , an absolutly terrible rock track . You have to ask the question , Where has the edge gone ? Where is the percussion ? The backing vocals ? I do n't know , but those used to songs like 'Under my thumb ' , 'Jumpin ' Jack Flash ' and 'You ca n't always git what you want ' could curl up and die upon hearing this album . Lets face it . The Stones have stopped rollin ' .	-1
In their heyday the Stones defined the essence of rock music , they were musical and sexual icons , whose compositions were each sculpted to precise standards . What happened ? By the standards of today 's music Bridges provided some decent perhaps even quality material , but from a band with such and undeniable impact on the Genre , from the band who brought us & quot ; Honky-Tonk Women & quot ; and & quot ; Under My Thumb & quot ; ( among dozens of outstanding others ) this is rock bottom . Gone are the infectious melodies and blistering riff-heavy tunes which we so often associate with Jagger and co . This lapse in quality is due in great part to overproduction by the Dust Brothers and the Glimmer Twins , but the core of the failure can be attributed to poor lyricysm and an attemptto capture the essence of modern music , as is especially evident on the horrific & quot ; Anybody Seen My Baby. & quot ; If you do n't know what the Stones are about and want to learn shell out $ 30 for Hot Rocks ( 64-71 ) and if you 're already a fan , let 's hope you were smart enough to avoid this .	-1
The reviewer who called Mick Jagger a `` Cartoonish sex symbol '' was right on the money . I agree - the Stones used to be the greatest band around ( before I was born , sadly ) . But now , they 're a joke.When Mick Taylor left , the Boys lost all the credibility they once had and became one big , unfunny joke . This can be blamed almost entirely on Mick Jagger who , like Brian Jones before him , was obsessed with style . Case in point : Some Girls was a decent record , but hurt by the group 's attempt to play disco . Emotional Rescue ( probably their worst album to date ) also saw them taking on the disco and punk trends . And Bridges To Babylon continues this tradition , this time featuring the band trying two popular genres on for size : techno and rap . Yes , that 's right : Rolling Stones rap . What happened ? They sold out.Saint of Me , the only song worth hearing , is actually close to good . But the rest ( Anybody Seen My Baby , Too Tight , Flip the Switch , Out of Control , Might As Well Get Juiced , etc ) . is worthless . Check out Beggars Banquet , Let It Bleed , Get Yer Ya-Ya 's Out , Sticky Fingers , Exile on Main Street , Some Girls , the underrated Voodoo Lounge and A Bigger Bang instead .	-1
This is certainly one of the worst Stones albums ever . The utilization of hip-hop/flavor of the month producers , rap crap in the middle of songs , shows the last pathetic gasp by Mick to make the Stones contemporary circa 1997 . What is the point of being contemporary , if what is contemporary SUCKS ? ! ? With the exception of Anybody Seen My Baby , there is really nothing redeeming about this album . When I first heard it 10 years ago , it struck me as contrived and tepid . Now , I was going thru a bad patch personally at the time , so I thought I 'd give it another shot . NOPE . It still smacks of desperation , and was VERY unlike the Rolling Stones I know and love . Thank god they gave up trying to be something they 're not , and with their next full album of new studio material ( bigger bang ) , delivered an album worthy of being by THE ROLLING STONES !	-1
At least Wyman had the sense to get out when he realized that these geezers were 25 years past it.This record stinks , like everything they 've done for the last , oh , 25 years . You must be a blind fan , or one that ca n't hear , to think otherwise .	-1
After the success of the `` Janet . '' album Janet Jackson runs with its formula of dark grooves and sexually explicit songs . This time however she goes too far into her own world and fails to connect with the listener . To be sure there is some fun and interesting music here ( Velvet Rope , I Get Lonely ) but none of it is as captivating as her previous efforts . Somehow it all comes off as self involved and distant . Gone is the chipper Janet of `` Escapade '' . Gone is the funky Janet of `` Control '' . Instead we have an angry , depressed and almost pornographic woman who seems to think that she is the sexiest person alive . My how you 've changed `` Miss Jackson '' .	-1
This is one of the worst albums ever released in Rock and Roll History . & quot ; Bittersweet Symphony & quot ; kicks off the album nuff said . If maybe one of the other songs kicked the album off it may have had a chance , but since the group chose to kick off the album with this vomit then the whole album is bad . Yes you may argue that it has the classical music which makes it sound cultural , but it 's so mind-wrecking so psyche-damaging that it makes me want to suck a lead piece with a trigger at the end . The vocals are at best nasly and whiny too . I was left with the sense of & quot ; Why Bother ? & quot ; The group comes out of Michigan which is notorious for artists like Ted Nugent , Frijid Pink , Brownsville Station , MC5 , Iggy and the Stoooges etc . The Verve are the dishonorable boys from the Wolverine State .	-1
At the time of it 's release , this album was praised by some critics as being the rebirth of & quot ; serious & quot ; music in the wake of the & quot ; ironic & quot ; brit-pop era . But seriousness does not always mean good . Built around anthemic and pompous sondscapes , the lyrics are self pitying . & quot ; I want to her some sounds that recognize the pain in me & quot ; Ashcroft sings in Bittersweet Symphony . Granted , we need to belong and relate . But then he goes & quot ; Happiness / more or less / is just a change in me /something in my liberty & quot ; .It 's too literal and it doesent talk to anybody but himself . Sorry , but we do n't need selfpity .	-1
I bought this one because I loved the Pure Moods CD and saw that many people had bought this one , too . This CD is boring and uninspired ; I wished I had n't bought it . This one will be hanging as a tree decoration in time for the holidays .	-1
If your Looking for that Try The Soundtracks of the Legendary VANGELIS ! ! ! Morricone Works a tiny bit of magic here but Soon lapses into repetitive motif 's that wear on the listener to try and Stay Awake , lol ... .Ciao	-1
i bought this by a recommendation of a soundtrack fan , however i tried and i put it aside for half a year and then by accident i read again some people praised again this disc , so i really listened to every track todaysorry , really not my type , i have 'once upon a time in america ' and 'lolita ' from ennino , they were very good , but this one doesnt impress me at all	-1
This is where i lost all interest in David Sylvian 's solo career..or almost . While he has certainly produced some great stuff both with Japan , solo or in collaboration with others , I personally was no longer able to follow him on the intimate journey he chose . Sorry .	-1
I looked forward to buying this for a very long time . Every comment on CD Now or anywhere else not only looked favorable but also portrayed this album as a `` must have '' classic.Unlike others who experienced the same disappointment with this recording , I did n't mind the long instrumentals . I even found them relaxing , but the raging voice track that appears in the second and last song is just weird . Why would you do that to a song ? I remember Iron Butterfly did it with a song on their Metamorphosis album I listened to when I was a teen , and although it was strange , it worked somehow . This did n't do anything for me but make me angry that I wasted hare-earned cash on this crap.You do not want this recording unless you are a rabid fan of Mike Oldfield . Personally , I will never buy anything else he created . If you want this CD because of something written by an adoring fan who loves Tubular Bells , first , take a look at anything by Pink Floyd -- a band that made fantastic music worth five stars.I gave this one one star , because I could n't choose a lower option .	-1
I memorized the three famous Monty Python albums of the early 1970 's but I have n't listened to them in years and I just got this CD collection . Some of the routines hold up well ( Novel Writing ) . Some seem tired to me . Some of them seem to have been re-mastered and made to sound worse ( The Cheese Shop ? ) . And having them taken out of their original flow and contexts makes me feel like I 've visited an old neighborhood that has changed more than I want . Maybe it 's a good introduction for you fresh young folks to whom it 's new . I feel sorry for you to hear the live versions with the actors shouting all their lines and the audience so predisposed to laughter that all the subtlety of the original versions is lost . But it 's an overview ...	-1
I remember how big a deal this disc was back in the late 80s , but I just never got it ... or her . The & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; and & quot ; Forever Your Girl & quot ; songs were awful pop tunes and that & quot ; Opposites Attract & quot ; video was just plain awful with the obnoxious animated cat . Then the allegations surfaced that she never really sang leads on the album . I did like the & quot ; Way That You Love Me & quot ; song . Now that was pretty sweet .	-1
I decided recently to pull out my old vinyl of Paula Abdul and spin this baby.Well I have noticed since I am now about 11 years older I realized Abdul 's voice now gets on my nerves , and that her songs though they had their place and time in 1989 just do n't hold up well today.Songs like & quot ; Straight Up & quot ; , & quot ; Knocked Out & quot ; , and & quot ; The Way That You Love Me & quot ; , just do n't infect me like some old pop songs do like The Emotions & quot ; Best of My Love & quot ; or Lovin ' Spoonfuls & quot ; Summer in the City & quot ; ... .get the picture ? Unless your an Abdul fanatic , all I can say is this is really run of the mill pop with some infectious hooks ... I think if Madonna , or Deborah Gibson ( who have stronger voices ) sang these dittys they may hold up better .	-1
If you are a die-hard Winwood fan , you 'll probably like this album well enough to own it . There are definitely good songs on this album , but they are the exception . You get the sense listening to this album that record company execs pressured Stevie for a couple of cookie-cutter hits and a quick release date . `` Shining Song '' is my favorite ; it is a variation on the upbeat lyrics of `` Still in the Game '' and `` Back in the High Life Again . '' `` Do n't You Know What the Night Can Do ? '' is possibly the best beer ad ever made , but for anyone who watched TV ads in the late 80 's it will be hard to separate from the commercial . `` Roll With It '' is catchy at first , but after a few listens it seems like a pale imitation of `` Gim me Some Lovin ' . '' And `` Holding On '' probably bored itself into your brain if you watched MTV in 1988 , but you might not need to hear it again just yet.The rest of this album is n't really listenable except as background music . This is n't an album I can just pop in and listen to front-to-back , over and over , like Arc of a Diver or Back in the High Life or Talking Back to the Night . I 'd say those are all better choices .	-1
Steve Windwood has added alot to the pop music scene . Unfortunately his efforts on this disc do n't hit on all cylinders . Some of the rhythms are pretty catchy particularly on Hearts of Fire , Holdin ' On , and Do n't You Know What The Night Can Do . However , the lyrics are extremely basic throughout this eight song collection . And the overuse of the synthesizer is just plain annoying . Try some of Stevie 's other work such as Back In The High Life or John Barley Corn , Low Spark from his Traffic days .	-1
When I got this cd I thought it was the music from the first version and that is the main reason I bought it . Its an ok cd just not my taste in music .	-1
Mediocre vocalist who disguises her shortcomings by working with very talented producers who multi-layer and process her thin vocals . This is a perfect example of style over substance.On the positive side ... if you 're looking for something to work out to rather than listen to , this CD would probably be perfect for you .	-1
I just popped this CD in and popped it out about as quickly . I gave track one about 12 seconds and track 2 about 4 seconds before I heard all I needed to hear . I 'm not saying this is necessarily a bad CD , but calling it `` blues '' is a bit of a stretch . He may be playing some blues standards but the sound is very much hard guitar rock .	-1
This album has it 's moments . Neon Forest had some fun lyrical imagery . The Undefeated is my favorite Iggy song , period . But one expects more than a few *moments* to make a good album . For the most part , the arrangements are uninspired , the performances sloppy , and ( most importantly ) most of the songs suck . The title track , with its `` I get off my d -- - ; I 'm living brick by brick '' refrain is criminally inane . Butt Town , Pussy Power , etc ... these songs are even worse than the titles suggest and Living on the Edge of Night is more cliched .	-1
Paula Abdul slammed into the pop consciousness with `` Forever Your Girl '' , a CD crammed with 5 solid Top 40 hits . After such success , most artists fear the dreaded `` sophomore slump '' . Whether this CD , her 2nd , avoids that pitfall depends on whether you 're judging it on artistic or commercial terms.Commercially , it was a definite comedown . This one charted 3 instead of 5 , although it would 've been hard to match the first on that score . Artistically , it 's a definite step forward . Paula 's voice is still pretty mediocre , but she does try and push it and seeks to make the music more inventive.She sings a Prince song that he produces ( `` U '' ) , attempts to go out of her depth with a John Hiatt tune ( `` Alright Tonight '' ) , and tries to reinvent herself as a vamp ( `` Vibeology '' , even managing to dabble in a little New Agey protest music ( `` Promise of a New Day '' , '' Rock House '' ) .Some of this works ... '' Promise of a New Day '' actually hit the charts respectably and does the `` save Mother Earth '' thing without sounding too dorky . But `` Rock House '' does n't fare as well , promising the baddies she will `` rock you '' and `` house you '' .Likewise `` U '' has a great groove , but Paula does n't really sound like the sex kitten she needs to be to make the song work . `` Rush Rush '' and `` Blowing Kisses in the Wind '' , the other hits , are both likable ballads , as is `` Will You Marry Me ? '' . But when all things are said and done , nothing makes you say `` Play that AGAIN ! `` This is what it is ... .a collection of occasionally catchy but mostly undistinguished ( or is that indistinguishable ? ) pop . There are some OK tunes , but nothing of lasting value really . An extra 1/2 star for trying though ... 2 1/2 stars ...	-1
Hooker 's second album on the Pointblank label is a guest-heavy homage that does n't have a great deal to do with John Lee Hooker as an artist and only occasionally plays to his strengths . Some cuts , such as the opening & quot ; I Want to Hug You & quot ; are just plain odd in their selection . This album is for the completist ; sporadically enjoyable but unnecessary . The title cut is much better in its original version on & quot ; Urban Blues & quot ; ( a somewhat chaotic but quite good album from the late '60s ) , while & quot ; Backstabbers & quot ; ( actually & quot ; Backbiters and Syndicators & quot ; , another remake from the same album ) meanders too . The later cuts are better and , as usual , the fewer musicians playing with Hooker the less his sound gets mucked up . & quot ; Highway 13 & quot ; , & quot ; Father Was a Jockey & quot ; and yet another remake of & quot ; Crawlin ' Kingsnake & quot ; are all quite nice . One wishes Hooker 's late '80s and '90s producers more often had had the sense to leave him by himself or with minimal accompaniment . So , like all of Hooker 's work on Pointblank , this is less about making a good album than honoring a lifetime of work . Still and all , worth having . His June 21st passing is greatly mourned .	-1
That sleazy sex symbol , hepcat , Lenny Kravitz , offers us another piece of his 60s/early 70s fixation . There 's a little bit of Lennon , a little bit of Hendrix , and for a little black soul we have Smokey Robinson . Add a smattering of cod reggae and record it all with 'authentic ' 60s recording techniques . End result ? A dreary copy of the real thing . Most of the LP is riddled with repetitive , lacklustre melodies and predictable , cliched lyrics about Lurv . Only two songs stay clear of the dross , the inventive , subliminal 'Believe ' , which sounds as if was recorded in some kind of underwater echo chamber , and 'Sister ' , where Len really connects emotionally . Still , the LP sold by bucketloads . The Question is though , if you can fall for chains of silver , why not go for gold ?	-1
Sometimes I believe that singers are treatly unfairly and judged too harshly but this is n't the case . What is a mystery to me is that noone mentions how thin and limited Janet 's voice is . Everyone even critics seem to ignore it while more talented artists are judged harsher think Jennifer Lopez and Macy Gray . Anyway ... I gave it a star because the music is ok but it becomes annoying after one run through . Let 's face it Janet is an entertainer and she delivers on that level but she is not a vocalist and on slower songs like & quot ; Again & quot ; it is immediately apparent . If you want a fun dance album and see it in the discount store then purchase it but if you are expecting a good singer stir clear .	-1
I discovered the Verve in 1998 after hearing their brilliant single , `` Bitter Sweet Symphony , '' from their record `` Urban Hymns '' ( 1997 ) . My wife bought me `` Urban Hymns '' and I loved the rest of it . Shortly thereafter , The Verve broke up and Richard Ashcroft went solo . I 've followed Ashcroft since , but curiosity led me to explore the Verve 's back catalog.Unfortunately , I was extremely disappointed with `` A Storm in Heaven . '' My main problem is with the production values . The sound quality of `` A Storm in Heaven '' is n't poor ; it 's offensive . This is one of those CDs you have to keep turning up because it never sounds loud enough . It actually sounds like a bad bootleg at times.I do n't understand why bands bury a record under waves of reverb - unless , of course , they have something to hide . In this case , it 's probably the songs themselves : monotonous long-form grooves that drone on with no development or direction . ( There is definitely a stoner ethic at work here , which might explain the record 's appeal in some quarters . ) On `` Virtual World , '' the instruments actually sound out of tune . There 's no hint of the brilliance that manifested itself on `` Urban Hymns , '' which remains one of my favorite albums of the 1990's.Anyone intrigued by late 90 's Verve would do well to skip this one and move on to Richard Ashcroft 's fine solo records .	-1
this one fails miserably for me . A lousy follow up to sugar tax . There are a couple good tracks but nothing classic or close to english electric . clearly andy needed pauls help .	-1
... this album just blows . Not enough John , too much of Doug & Stu . Neither one of them can sing . I thought the Grateful Dead 's 'Pigpen ' was bad ...	-1
Fans who believe that John Fogerty forced Doug Clifford and Stu Cook to contribute two thirds of this album to prove a point may not be listening carefully . John 's contributions to Mardi Gras are also pretty weak . It 's just possible that he was desperately seeking some breathing room under the weight of an onerous recording contract.Consider this ... only 3 Fogerty songs on Mardi Gras are original . The fourth , Hello Mary Lou , is a Ricky Nelson song . Fogerty 's next album ( The Blue Ridge Rangers ) did not contain a single original song . And his first solo album ( John Fogerty ) relied on a few covers as well.He did n't record again for 10 years after `` John Fogerty '' . Maybe the great man was simply tapped out.No matter ... he deserved a rest . Six brilliant albums in a row , all resting solely on his shoulders , are more than most artists can claim .	-1
This is the last studio album recorded by CCR and was recorded as a threepiece since the departure of Tom Fogerty . Although his presence is not missed by the band you can really tell that they were running on fumes by then . I only purchased this cd to complete my Creedence collection .	-1
Love , the album . But the SACD transfer does little to enhance the already superb audio recording on the regular CD .	-1
I 've heard all the praise of Big Star for years but never came across their LPs in any record store . Now that I bought their CD I ca n't figure out what all the hype is about.There must be something I 'm missing , because this sounds like a pretty pedestrian imitation of a Steve Marriott record . I 've always heard the songwriting on Big Star records was great , but short-sighted ditties like `` The India Song '' leave me wondering if I 'm listening to the same record as those reviewers.Big Star left me completely underwhelmed .	-1
This review is for all of the neophytes who are gon na hear that Big Star was/is one of the greatest `` lost `` groups in rock history . Do n't you believe it ! ! ! There are about 3 good songs on this disc , and the rest are failures . There is a new Big Star release in September , and I urge anybody who thinks about purchasing this disc to skip it . If you want a truly great `` lost '' band , pick up any of the discs by The Records . They made some incredible music and never got the recognition they deserved ! ! ! G2theG	-1
I have the original vinyl . Bought it 1961 or so . Great record , although not as good as NEWK 's TIME ... The 'Remastering ' . ahem , is dreadful , unless you like to hear the bass obliterating everything , especially the drums . So much of the 'remasstering ' today is done by enginners who never heard this music live . Understandable , but still , a bass played on gut strings into a microphone , one microphone is not an 'acoustic ' bass with steel strings played thru an amplifier into multiple mics .	-1
An album that seems to garner more positive attention that I can ever understand , Ornette Coleman 's sophomore album `` Tomorrow is the Question ! '' is an unqualified disaster . His debut album , `` Something Else ! ! ! ! `` , featured Coleman playing fairly straightforward pieces ( all compositions that were several years old by that point ) in a sympathetic backdrop but by and large with musicians who were n't quite ready to play with Coleman . Still , the pieces were largely advanced blues forms , and Coleman 's non-tempered playing introduced a bit of tension to them ( with the piano in conflict ) and somehow , it works out ok.This time around though , things are worse -- liberating himself from a piano , Coleman nonethless had a rhythm section foisted upon him of either Percy Heath or Red MItchell on bass and Shelly Manne on drums . One gets the impression they wanted to get it , but just could n't . Coleman ( on alto ) and to a lesser extent Don Cherry ( on trumpet ) attempt to bring the music out , but every time they do , the bassist and Manne seem to stay with the straight pattern . This sort of leaves the soloist hanging , with disasterous results on several pieces ( most noticably `` Mind and Time '' and `` Compassion '' , where it almost sounds like the horns and rhythm are playing two different songs because their playing is so dramatically different and `` Rejoicing '' where Coleman tries to break the structure but the Heath in particular stubbornly walks ) .In fact , the only piece that really seems to work is `` Tears Inside '' , where both Cherry and Coleman solo much further inside than they do on any of the other pieces -- Cherry 's solo in particular is lovely.But in the end , the set is a disorganized mess -- these guys may have been sympathetic to Coleman , but they were n't prepared for what they had to do to keep his music intact . In several months when in New York , Coleman and Cherry would record masterpiece `` The Shape of Jazz to Come '' with Charlie Haden and Billy Higgins , and the difference is astounding . This one is for completionists only .	-1
I truly wish that Amazon would not allow people to sell CD-R 's , or any homemade disc . I ca n't even believe I 'm saying this - you 'd think common sense would prevent this in the first place . I accidentally ordered this fake , then caught it and cancelled in time . I then ordered the correct CD - profesionally made . Come on guys - let 's get with it .	-1
Defintely not the best representation of this groups performances/recordings . Only three hits in total on this cd , everything else is a B side ! NOT THE BEST OF THE MAD LADS ! It would have been better served and honest if it were called `` The B-Side CD '' ! Do n't buy this cd if you do n't have any other Mad Lads recordings !	-1
Well this is a total F for sound . I have 3 dif 3 cd players , home , port , and car , and yes they are good ones , car is a Q45 with a Bose . I bought this CD because of the reviews I read here , what is everyone smoking ? or is there not that good of stuff avail from Albert ? I do n't own any other CD 's , but I do know about him from the SRV Sessions VHS I have had for a few years , and it sounds pretty good.This CD sounds like a taper recorded it , from that last row in the back or something . I have both SF CD 's , the both sound the same.Can someone email me please and let me know what Albert King CD 's . If any , have good clear sound.What I have that is great for Live shows is Cream Reunion DVD and CD , and Roger Watters in the Flesh DVD and CD , great sound .	-1
What a great idea ! What a flat , boring , soulless execution ! It sounds like a bunch of couldn't-care-less paid by the hour studio guys who might have just finished laying down a track for a McDonalds commercial stepped into a studio , were given the charts , played what was written , and packed up and went home . Big disappointment . Now I see they have a part II of this - unbelievable . None of the energy and joy that infuses bluegrass , nor any of the magic and beauty the is the Grateful Dead , made it on to this sorry rip-off . Save your money .	-1
I 'm a big fan of noisy stuff like John Zorn 's Naked City , Fantomas , and the Melvins , but this is just plain bad . It 's ear-splitting static for 72 minutes . No variations , no hint of music or even sound effects . Sure , it 's extreme , so I can brag about it : & quot ; I own the most annoying CD ever recorded ! & quot ; But , other than that , it 's a waste of time and money .	-1
the songs are short and crude sounding . great bass and drumming but . a little bit too nu-metal .	-1
Forget this Capital slapdash collection and buy the much better Rhino remastering with much better selection : `` Sons of Mercury '' . See my review there.Poor selection here , also , not enough wonderful Cippolina , too much Valenti.murky , compressed , midrangy	-1
With the exception of one song ( that I 'll get to in a moment ) , this album could pass for a parody of heavy metal , a la Spinal Tap . The guitar licks mostly sound like rehashes that you ca n't quite place . The lame synth parts are classic examples of how NOT to use synth . And then there are the vocals , which are both off-key and flat . I 've heard plenty of unknown small town bar bands with better vocals.The exception , and the reason I give Sun And Steel two stars rather than just one is the song `` Scorching Beauty '' ( not to be confused with the Iron Butterfly album called Scorching Beauty which does not contain a song of that name ) . The song is reminiscent of vintage Steppenwolf or Mountain . Its musical themes are well-constructed and even catchy . And its vocals are almost ballsy , despite the mid-tempo blues feel , which gradually picks up steam as the song progresses . Although I 'd never heard `` Scorching Beauty '' prior to getting this CD , the song deserves to have been in regular rotation on FM rock radio stations back in the '70s , when actual DJs used to pick album cuts to drop the needle upon.Unlike the rest of Sun And Steel , the song `` Scorching Beauty '' is the only tune that deserves the label `` masterpiece '' which other reviewers have applied to the whole album .	-1
In the mid-1990s Deutsche Grammophon boasted of their sound quality by advertising their stereo CDs with not a little hyperbole as wonders of `` 4D Sound '' . Karlheinz Stockhausen 's `` Gruppen '' seems like one of the best pieces to choose to show off how your recording system faithfully reproduces the original space , and the disc is rounded off by two orchestral pieces by Gyorgy Kurtag . `` Gruppen '' for three orchestras ( 1955-57 ) is probably the greatest thing Stockhausen has ever written . The three orchestras are placed to the left , centre , and right of the audience respectively and exploits this spatial separation by having themes thrown from orchestra to orchestra , making it seem like the very sound is moving . Though written at the height of 1950s serialism , it 's a light and airy piece that any audiences but the `` classical music stopped with Brahms '' conservatives are sure to enjoy . However , in spite of the best efforts of studio engineers , this piece simply does n't work in a stereo downmix . A 5.1 surround version is desparately needed , and one wonders why Stockhausen-Verlag at least has n't provided this yet . Furthermore , this performance is filled with misreadings of the score . Compare it to any of the other recordings out there ( Boulez et al. , Rattle et al. , and the definitive recording from Stockhausen himself ) and you 'll spot a plethora of mistakes.Gyorgy Kurtag is one of the most fascinating figures of the 20th century , with a unique blend of dark Bartokian sonorities and Webern-like brevity . Though his oeuvre slowly but steadily proceded from an opus number one string quartet in the late 1950s , he arrived on the international stage only when Pierre Boulez took up his music in the early 1980s , when the composer was nearly sixty . Most of Kurtag on disc , however , is for soloists or small ensembles , and this disc finally brought his orchestral music to home listeners.Like the Stockhausen , Kurtag 's `` Gravestone for Stephen '' op . 15c ( 1989 ) exploits the performance space by widely dispersing the players . It is the most stripped down piece I 've ever heard from the composer . For most of its 9-minute length a guitar plays ascending scales at very low dynamic with the slightest of accompaniment by strings at even lower dynamics . Only at the midpoint do we get a few sad calls from the brass , before the music returns to the guitar and strings . Were the piece not written to commemorate the dead -- the husband of Marianne Stein , the French psychologist who led Kurtag out of compositional crisis in the 1950 -- the limited musical material would seem as fluffy and insubstantial as the typical output of Rautavaara . Its anguished tones do move the listener somewhat , however.The more ambitious `` Stele '' op . 33 ( 1994 ) is written for large orchestra in three movements , though at not much over ten minutes long it continues the composer 's tendency to think short . The first movement consists of soft microtonal writing with prominent winds . The second begins with a buzzing , aleatoric-sounding soundscape reminiscent of Lutoslawski 's second symphony before exploring various portions of the orchestra and then fading out with soft strings . The third movement is a slow ostinato on low instruments . It 's an impressive exploitation of the possibilities of a large orchestra , though somewhat directionless.Though I enjoy `` Grabstein fuer Stephan '' and `` Stelae '' , especially the latter , I find Kurtag to be more impressive in the chamber music -- especially the string quartets -- and piano solo genres . But that could be due to Abbado 's reading of the pieces , which are untrustworthy . Watching Abbado prepare the pieces under Kurtag 's supervision on the documentaryThe Matchstick Mandocumentary , I got the impression that Abbado just did n't really understand what he was doing . `` Grabstein fuer Stephan '' has been recorded on a Col Legno disc , where Peter Eotvos conducts , and I 'm going to need to track that down.Besides the lame reading of `` Gruppen '' and the untrustworthiness of the `` Kurtag '' performances , another objectionable thing about this disc is that it contains only 44 minutes of music . Could nothing else be found to fill it out ? All in all , I give the disc two stars , but since Kurtag 's orchestral works are difficult to find in recording , fans of that composer are probably going to make do with this disc anyway , and that hurts . If you are looking for an introduction to Kurtag , get theArditti Quartet performanceof the string quartets . Likewise , encountering Stockhausen here for the first here would be disastrous . Lovers of modernism need to get to grips with Stockhausen 's work at least for its historical importance if not the pure enjoyment in it , but as much as it 's a pain in the neck to order , the definitive discs from Stockhausen-Verlag are the way to do it .	-1
Claudio Abbado and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchesta . You 'd think that combination would turn in an outstanding reading of a Bruckner symphony . They did n't . As the Penguin Guide said in the only edition that rated this CD , Abbado was clearly uninspired and the orchestra was on autopilot . Nothing about this CD suggests anything significant about Bruckner or his ambitious First Symphony . My advice is to look elsewhere for satisfaction . In single issue copies , Sieghart , Scrowaczewski and Tintner are all to be preferred . If you 're willing to buy a set , the two best versions out there are included in the Karajan and Jochum DG sets .	-1
Irma in the 1960s [ 2 and half stars ] This compilation , an updated and expanded version of a 1983 LP compilation ( tracks 1-16 ) , features 24 songs recorded 1962-1966 on Imperial , Brandy , and Minit labels . This is a slightly superior compilation to Razor & Tie 's 1996 compilation `` Sweet Soul Queen of New Orleans : The Irma Thomas Collection '' .TIME IS ON MY SIDE consists of 24 songs from 1963-1966 ; songs are not in chronological order . Disc packaged in black jewel case ; total running time : 65:50 . Booklet includes an essay by Clive Richardson , two b & w ; photos , and songwriting credits ( recording years provided on back cover ; chart positions , albums of origin , producer credits , and musician personnel are not included ) . Sound quality is decent.The disc closes with `` It 's a Man's-Woman 's World Parts 1 & 2 '' , which is the same recording as `` It 's a Man 's Woman 's World ( Pt . 1 ) '' , the latter appearing on the `` Sweet Soul Queen of New Orleans '' disc . Both are the same length and include the last note of another song at the beginning of the track.For her Soul recordings , and I would contend best work , get `` A Woman 's Viewpoint : Essential 70s Recordings '' [ 2006 ] .	-1
The rest is trash ... Intermission 1 & Conclusion are great but there not songs.Total 360 on that Red album , Shouts to my cousin kara , I remember she looked just like t boz bacc in the day ... i also remember the summer of 92 when r & b ruled the radios an video channels .	-1
Given all the positive reviews of this recording , I really hate to be a wet blanket , but as much as I admire the music of Dvorak , and am sure Mr. Gunzenhauser is an otherwise decent conductor , I ca n't help but feel he misses the boat when it comes to Dvorak . His dynamics are sudden , his phrasing is uncharacteristic and pedantic and the recorded sound leaves a lot to be desired . My impressions , unfortunately , apply to both symphonies . When we have such great recordings by Szell , Kubelik , Suitner and others , I rather regret having wasted money and shelf space on this one . The only advantage in having done so is to be able to make direct comparisons with various recordings of the same music , a pastime I hugely enjoy .	-1
I had high hopes for this recording which seems to have been well received by others . Unfortunately , I was very disappointed by what I heard . Another posted has already expressed my thoughts . I quote : & quot ; The entire performance left me bored . I could hardly keep my patience , and almost skipped ahead repatedly . Although I blamed Bruckner , I later found that it was merely a poor interpretation . & quot ; In addition to problems with the interpretation , the orchestra sounded like they had not rehearsed adequately . The recorded sound was dull with poor balance and little hall ambience.I strongly recommend the Horenstein/BBC version instead.George	-1
Buy this CD for tracks 11 , 12 , and 13 . The finale of the score is amazing , with a powerful build-up of the choir and orchestra . The rest of the score , sadly , is a waste of time . Track 1 rips off the main title to James Horner 's BRAINSTORM , before settling into a repetitive percussion motif . Tracks 3 and 7 are merely recycled from Silvestri 's PREDATOR score . Everything else is simply synth droning and boring & quot ; atmosphere & quot ; music . If it were n't for the last ten minutes of the score , I would sell this disc .	-1
The score/soundtrack to the first Conan film is a feat of genius and stands as one of the fantasy film genre 's best musical compositions.Inasmuch as the film `` Conan the Destroyer '' was a lesser effort than its predecessor , it seems as though Poledouris felt that he could use less of his composing talents on the film . There 's very little that is as grandious as the cues from Arnold 's first foray into Conan territory.If one wants to simply have the companion piece to the first film , then this purchase might be necessary.For other fans of film music , it is a buy that should be avoided .	-1
I bought this album thinking it was a greatest hits compilation . I was wrong . It 's a LIVE ALBUM . I have not listened to any more than what it took to hear the applause in the beginning of all the tracks , so I ca n't vouch for the quality of the recording itself . But if you are looking for the original hits , do n't buy this import ! Sedaka fans might want it for their collection , I do n't know , someone else might want to write a review of the quality of the performance . But if all you want are the original recordings of the latter part of Sedaka 's career , look elsewhere . You will not find them here .	-1
I was very disappointed with the soundtrack . There were a lot of good songs done by various artists , which really helped make the movie into the great flick that it is ( it is one of my all time favorite movies ) . Yet , those songs were not on the soundtrack . All you get is the instrumental music by Hans Zimmer . I just wanted to let everyone know what they are getting before they buy this ; they are not getting a complete soundtrack .	-1
Something should be done by Amazon to regulate persons from price gouging . I spent so many years looking for a particular CD with absolutely no luck . It eventually appeared on amazon for the price of $ 95 not including shipping . I had come into some money at the time , so I broke down and purchased it . I was certain that it was my only chance to ever own this CD again . Months later , I noticed it being sold by the same person for $ 19.95 . Needless to say , I was pissed off . This kind of practice should be completely stopped . As far as Legend , this movie and it 's music made an impact on me , so I was excited to buy it . I saw the price , and this time I decided not to be such a sucker . I went to my friend 's house who basically went on a music sharing site that you pay a small fee of 10 cents per song , found the sounds , downloaded them , and then burned them onto a CD for me in the exact order that the songs appear on the original soundtrack .	-1
This music , with only a few exceptional moments , is just another example of the same meandering theatre pablum we 've been hearing for too many years . Unexceptional melodic phrases leading to long held notes -- this same rank formula over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over , ad nauseum . The writers try to be as brilliant and `` important '' as Sondheim on his worst day , resulting in lyrics so jam-packed with MEANING that one simply grows tired instead of inspired . [ I kept thinking that this work was like Craig Carnelia on his best day , which is n't an admirable position . ] Musicals nowadays are either dry as dust [ like this one ] or relentlessly wacky fun , like `` Avenue Q '' -- where are the shows that had drama and comedy combined ? `` Most Happy Fella , '' `` She Loves Me , '' even , dare I say it , `` Fiddler on the Roof '' -- works with tremendous heart , admirable skill , and a nice dose of humor . I 'm all for the art form growing and improving and changing , but not into dour , humorless works like this . I 'm not a fuddy-duddy , but why has the term 'musical comedy ' become anathema ? Miss Carmello is again in top form ; she makes the most of this limited material . Mr. Ludwig , however , manages to be utterly bland and utterly annoying ; one dreads hearing him after a very short while . Though his basic vocal technique is solid , he has a notably limited range of vocal colors/expressions.I got this recording in hopes of finding new material ; the pursuit proved fruitless . Ho hum .	-1
This album has been derogatorily referred to as the & quot ; Send in the singers & quot ; album by Sondheim afficianados , and not without reason : The interpretations of & quot ; Someone in a Tree & quot ; and & quot ; Invocation & quot ; are off-key , off-tempo , and off-full . There are some redeeming features ( A hysterical parody of & quot ; The Ballad of Sweeney Todd & quot ; by the Forever Plaid cast ; Glynis Johns 's proof of her ownership of & quot ; Send in the Clowns & quot ; ; and the Cassidy brother 's & quot ; You Could Drive a Person Crazy & quot ; are probably the major ones for me ) , but this is by far and away the most mediocre of the Sondheim compilations out there . If you must have every thing ever done , then get this album ; otherwise , get the considerably better Carnegie Hall celebration .	-1
Bar none , the worst Sondheim compilation and/or concert to ever be foisted together . Many of the artists were likely very busy when they committed to this project , but that does not excuse the utter shoddiness of some of the performers ' preparation . Worst example : The tenor in the `` Kiss Me '' quartet from `` Sweeney Todd '' sings most of his music wrong , or late , or early , or all three combined . Other examples of mediocrity include inane gender switching -- the Cassidy 's singing `` You Could Drive a Person Crazy '' ? ? ? -- and a notable veneer of passionless performances . On that last note , I got the distinct impression the performers were sight-reading their scores . This CD remained in my collection for several years simply because I was maintaining a comprehensive Sondheim collection ; I just downsized my library , and this was the first CD to get sold on eBay .	-1
I did n't care much for anything but the music from North and South . I should have got just that but it was $ 90 something . Too expensive for me . I did n't care for The Right Stuff .	-1
I really should stop being so impulsive when I glom onto a favorite . I love the movie , recently watched it again ( twice within a week ) , read the original novel ( and the lousier sequel ) , and then ordered the soundtrack . If I could go back in time , I 'd scratch the last two impulse purchases.This soundtrack could be so much better , but as is , it 's very weak . You 've got the lovely Trio in E flat ( you actually get two versions of it ) , and you get Lakme , but there is no Bauhaus ( Bela Lugosi 's Dead ) . I knew from the list of songs that BLD was n't contained in this cd , but I 'd hoped the rest would suffice to justify the entire purchase . Alas , the majority of the remains are atmospheric pieces that fall flat in the absence of the film accompaniment.Lesson learned . Save yourself some money and download the three or four classical pieces and find Bauhaus somewhere else .	-1
Sure this CD has some good tracks , however the second CD is just plain wack , the only good song on the second CD is & quot ; all eyes on me & quot ; the rest is all filler , Me against the world was pac 's only good album , the rest of his albums are wack .	-1
a good poet he was.but a average rapper.he was a better actor than anything else.his music does n't move me like public enemy or rakim.i find him to be way overrated.a few alright songs on this two-disc set but alot of filler.he ai n't no legend to me.self-destructive more likely.this album is pure garbage .	-1
It 's terrible . Badly recorded . Uninspired playing . Generic punkesque songs . Lame , lame drums and Greggy simply ca n't sing . I was expecting more from the leader of Black Flag and mighty mogul of SST records , more than this boring collection of what sounds like bad demo recordings . Unfortunately Greg 's best work seems long behind him . Maybe though he just needs a real band in which to play . In any case Getting Even is not worth the penny especially when you consider shipping is 3 bucks or so .	-1
My Rating : 3.5/5 Only because & quot ; When a Man Loves a woman & quot ; is such a great song . ( Scale can go over 5 ! 5 is just a standard ) This rating is decievingly high . The album is not that good . Percy Sledge seems to have lost his voice in the album and ends up sounding more like a hick named & quot ; Cletus. & quot ; Ultimately this album is a mixed bag of unforgettable songs , pretty good songs , decent songs , and really bad songs , and bad covers . The album starts well with & quot ; I 'll be your everything & quot ; which has a nice chorus exentuated by back up singers . The album then seems to get even better with the start of & quot ; When a man loves a woman : & quot ; a timeless classic not only for the music but for the perceptic characterization of foolish men in love . The Percy attempts to cover an old favorite sung by Otis Redding and Three Dog Night : Try a little tenderness . Percy Sledge actually does a decent job , but for this song I say listen to Otis . Unfortunately the album has a string of failures in & quot ; You Send Me & quot ; & quot ; Behind Closed Doors & quot ; & quot ; Sitting on the Dock of the Bay & quot ; ( a worse cover of a great Otis Redding Song ) and & quot ; I 've been loving you way too long. & quot ; Surprisingly Percy Sledge makes a miraculous resurrection with & quot ; Take Time to know her & quot ; which sounds more like the title track , for which I bought the album . Following is another pretty good song & quot ; Warm and tender love & quot ; and a decent song & quot ; If loving you is wrong. & quot ; Overall my suggestion is this : If you want good soul music buy Otis Redding . If you want & quot ; When a man loves a woman & quot ; look for a compilation album ... please please do n't go buy Michael Bolton !	-1
This does n't sound like the same band that made `` When The Kite String ... '' at all to me . I liked 3 or 4 songs off of `` Paegan Terrorism Tactics '' . The best tracks on the album IMO are `` Locust Spawning '' , `` Diab Soule '' `` Paegan Love Song '' and `` Graveflower '' . There 's not enough energy on this album . There were maybe 4 heavy tracks . `` When The Kite String ... '' chits all over this . lol	-1
Sorry to disappoint the fans of this band who clearly worship them so much that seeing a negative review could lead to them spending a week alone sulking in their bedrooms with the lights off ( save for when mummy comes in to give them a glass of orange juice and some choccie biccies ) , but this album is sludge.It 's neither groundbreaking , nor is it remotely interesting . It 's every bit as overwrought and self-absorbed as Pearl Jam 's `` Ten '' and Alice In Chains ' `` Dirt '' , the only difference being that both of those albums had something resembling tunes amidst the repressed hormonal drama . This album doesn't.One of the reviewers here compares this album to Soundgarden 's grunge masterpiece `` Badmotorfinger '' . That 's a misleading comparison , because Badmotorfinger is what this album really wants to sound like , but it does n't have the depth or focus necessary to to succeed . ( And if you think I 'm being too harsh , I have friends who point the same accusations at Badmotorfinger that I 'm levelling at Paegan Terrorism Tactics , so Lord alone knows what they 'd make of this album ) . Overall it 's just another overblown excercise in fake rock'n'roll.Nice artwork though .	-1
I bought this CD after these spectacular reviews . And wow , am I disappointed . I should have looked a little more carefully at the track listings , the rave review listing wonderful performances is referring to songs on some other CD , cuz they sure are n't on this one . The opening cut is solid , but it descends from there into a squeaky , tiring vocal without punch or conviction . She is an adequate vocalist , but compared to some of the potent voices that were becoming stars at the same time , these recordings just do n't cut it . Her voice misses the notes she wants to hit on a regular basis . & quot ; I 'm Somebody 's Somebody Now & quot ; is downright ugly , and how about & quot ; Who-oo ? You-oo , that 's who ! & quot ; ? She sounds positively straining . She ca n't hit the high notes.And the concluding & quot ; That 's all ! & quot ; her special trademark ? Woop-de-doo . It sounds rather obligatory after the fifth or sixth time.These are early recordings ; possibly she got better in the 30s . But if not , I can see why she retired from singing , she must have realized she was n't that good .	-1
The Southern Death Cult was one of the old British post-punk/goth bands of the late '70s and early '80s , these days best remembered for being the launching pad for the Cult . And honestly , that 's probably the way they 're best remembered.The band was a quartet led by vocalist Ian Astbury . Even at this early stage , Astbury 's aggressive and powerful vocals were quite apparent , he dominates every moment he 's at the microphone , but unlike the Cult with Billy Duffy 's guitar to offer foil for Astbury , there 's nothing in the Southern Death Cult to match him . Instead , Astbury sits on top of a background reminiscent of early work by the Cure and Joy Division . The band 's total released output was one 12 '' single , this is presented along with some radio sessions , a few live tracks and some unreleased studio material.Taking on the 12 '' first -- the three tracks all feature pretty much the same pattern , goth-styled cleantone guitars are the order of the day , with Astbury 's undeniable presence on top of it all . But at its best , the music is somewhat dull even if Astbury is inspired ( `` The Fatman '' ) and at its worse , Astbury seems unsure of himself and does n't really know where to go ( the other two tracks ) .The two radio show pieces are pretty much more of the same -- ranging between dull goth ( `` Flowers in the Forest '' ) or totally lacking whenever Astbury does n't sing ( `` All Glory '' ) . The exception is `` Apache '' , which is somewhat more driven and excitable and while musically it does n't rise much above the band 's cleantone-guitar-goth formula , it 's among the better of the pieces in that sound and Astbury 's vocal is superb ( it also points towards the future ) . The additional studio sessions are a bit of a mixed bag -- `` The Crypt '' is a total disaster -- a bizarre shouted backing vocal totally mangles the piece , but both `` Moya '' and the other recording of `` The Fatman '' are vast improvements -- setting up atmosphere and mood far better then anything else on the record does , but Astbury 's vocals , while definitely the highlight of the pieces , still lack confidence.In direct opposition to all of this is the three live tracks -- they 've got a more punk edge to them , overdriven , feedback soaked guitars dominate the pieces ( well , as much as any guitar performance dominates these tracks ) and Astbury seems to feed off the live energy , his trademark shouts and quips find their way in ( `` Faith '' ) .Invariably , it 's really more a curiosity than anything else -- the performances are n't horrible , it 's all just a bit boring compared to both what would rise from the band 's ashes and its contemporaries .	-1
Despite earning 2 stars for containing the very best recordings of 'Bela Lugose ' and 'XRay Eyes ' out there , the rest of the tracks were never the best live takes they could 've chosen . Bauhaus were a good live band but that simply does n't come through on this album . On most of the songs Peter Murphy sounds like he is out of breath as he keeps cutting words short . The bonus tracks though are simply the worst . They sound like an undiscernable wall of noise , and then 'Waiting for My Man ' is the finale of terribleness , as Peter 's and Lou Reed 's voices do n't jel in any way whatsoever . It is ruined by the feeling that they are both singing blindly over the top of each other . Sigh . But it has some very high moments at least , worth buying for the few good recordings if you find this album cheapDaniel Thorlby bnP	-1
First of all , this album is not the classic a lot of people here seem to claim it is . This is a cd for Ween fanatics only . If you do n't like or care about Ween , you wo n't like this cd . It is mainly an hour of screaming , yelling , and disjointed singing over fast guitar riffs and jangly pop sounds . While some of the songs are really creative and good , most is just white noise . I really love Ween 's later , poppier albums like & quot ; Chocolate & amp ; Cheese & quot ; and & quot ; White Pepper & quot ; , so I thought I 'd like the earlier stuff as well . But be warned ... this sounds TOTALLY different from their post-C & amp ; C stuff . Personally , I 'd recommend all Ween albums from & quot ; Pure Guava & quot ; onwards because they are all brilliant , but this one really dissapointed me .	-1
I downloaded this music for free thank goodness just because of all the five star reviews . After listening to this album I have my doubts about these five star reviews . Not much to say about the album except I was totally disappointed . The album was monotonous and boring to the extreme . Almost all of the songs sounded the same . The same guitar rifts , slow beat , and jamming on each song . The song Washer was so so , but was ruined by the lyrics of the lead singer . It sounds like a group of guys in their late teens/early twenties ( which they probably were ) in a garage just jamming with no common goal or purpose with each band member having their own direction or agenda . No band assimilation whatsoever . To make matters worse the lead singer is not actually singing but just occasionally speaking or telling a story . Fortunately he speaks so low that you ca n't even tell what he 's saying with headphones on . Not that it matters what he 's saying anyway.The band reminds me just a little of a much less talented and interesting version of the great band Bedhead . Bottom line this album was terrible and would never even consider listening to their other music .	-1
This record is horrific . I got it more to be a completist after loving their more polished , later stuff . Most of it is unlistenable ( `` Emmaline '' is OK ) . After reading about all the `` controversy '' within the indie community when UO left to make professional recordings , I concluded that it 's all jealousy . If the hippies could make professional records like `` Saturation '' ( or even `` Exit the Dragon '' , although that one 's not fantastic either ) they all would . If they say they would n't , they 're lying or delusional .	-1
Shellac is a great LIVE band , but on vinyl , except for the first singles , they are absolute crap ! -The folks here that give this `` art piece '' 5 stars are just Albini A** kissers , is all ! Great engineer , no doubt , but most anything post Big Black or Rapeman , his MUSIC just does n't translate on recorded media ! More like a `` fart piece '' because it falls flat like one . The only good song here is `` The Admiral '' , & it was on one of their singles . Albini should just stick to playing live , and quit recording his music , it 'll give him the most unique `` indie cred '' anyone could ever enjoy ! What a waste of vinyl , of which he & I most truly love ! The Only Good Recorded Shellac Songs List , in order , are:1 . Doris2 . Wingwalker3 . Copper4 . Prayer To God5 . Rambler Song6 . The Admiral7 . XVI8 . The Guy Who Invented Fire9 . Steady As She Goes10 . SpokeThat 's IT ! -now Steve , record these songs live , put it out as a `` best of '' comp , then retire from composing `` sound '' & just engineer it !	-1
Since I love & quot ; 69 Love Songs & quot ; I was eager to check out Merritt 's back catalogue . Bad move . I have three more albums now , this one , & quot ; The charm of the Highway Strip & quot ; and & quot ; Get Lost & quot ; . None of them are even near any resemblance to the quality and range of styles we know from & quot ; 69 & quot ; . I will not buy any more Merritt albums , unless he comes up with something new that can compare with & quot ; 69 & quot ; .This & quot ; two albums for the price of one & quot ; disc is by many concidered to be one of Merritt 's best . It leaves me headscratching.Some albums simply does n't make any sense to me , and this is one of them . No mattter how I try , I simply ca n't figure out what on earth it was meant to accomplish.It is by far the most monotonous sounding pop album I have ever heard in my life . The arrangements seems to have no direction at all . It 's like a hotchpotch of droning sounds smashed together at random . At least , this album gives the term & quot ; wall of sound & quot ; a completely new meaning to me . And it sounds the same all the way through ( except from Tokyo a Go-go , which sounds like a really bad one from the Eurovision Song Contest ) .Singer Susan Anway sings in the same emotionless manner all the way through , like if she was completely unaware of the heavy , sirupy sound machinery surrounding her.I must admit , the contrast makes me smile . She sounds just so phenomenally lost and LONELY it 's actually worth checking out.On top of it all , the production is intetionally horrible.Should I describe the music on this album very simply , I would have to say that it sounds just like karaoke from hell .	-1
As the keystone Elephant 6 band and a much heralded indie CD , NMHs most popular album deserved attention . And while faithful NMH fans will hate me for stating the obvious , nonetheless my reaction is : there is little here beyond catchy guitars . In fact , the lyrics are nonsensical in the painful tradition of They Might Be Giants . In discussing this I have heard it argued that Jeff Mangum is working with very personal metaphors , but I do n't see the value of indeciferable metaphors . Just as I 'm not interested in James K. Polk ( They Might be ... ) I 'm also not interested in the king of carrot flowers ; in fact , the lyrics are distracting.Additionally distracting is Mangums vocals , which people either seem to love or detest . I do n't particularly care for them . At least we have less fuzz than his other work.Unfortunatly the indie kids running around with this stuff ca n't get past the mainstream bias to honestly critique what they were told is good by pitchfork and CMJ . How can some origionality make up for underachievement ? Is Jeff still in Europe recording folk music ? Quit slacking off Jeff and show us what you can do !	-1
What 's going on here ? I must have missed something in a big way . I read the reviews , saw the comparisons to Sparklehorse ( one of my favourite bands ) , heard it was the greatest 'lo-fi ' ( is n't everything these days.. ) loveliness in ages , so I bought it and ... it was really bad ! What am I missing ! The songs do n't hang together , the instrumentation is stark and unfriendly , the guy 's voice is NOT great at all..I can get into most stuff after a while but this really troubled my ears . Anyway , I got my money back..	-1
A few weeks ago my son sent me some links to a few of Scott Walker 's music and videos assuming that since I was a teenager in the 60s I 'd like this guy . Up till then I 'd never heard of him . Neither has anyone else I know . For some inexplicable reason my son has become obsessed with him . I could barely believe it . He usually listens to Radiohead , NIN , Arcade Fire - stuff like that . Obviously he 'd been possessed by someone with no taste because everything I 've heard by Scott Walker is total and complete crap . His sixties stuff sounds like someone trying to imitate Engelbert Humperdinck with his wobbly vocals and sappy strings wailing in the background . The stuff on this album , while certainly more intriguing sounds frighteningly like 80s uberweirdo Klaus Nomi after swallowing a handful of Lorazepan . The difference being every song on Tilt sounds more or less the same . If you listen to one song for a minute then move to the next one and so on - it 's the same song ! For some inexplicable reason this guy has developed a major cult following with the likes of David Bowie fawning over him . Walker has written at least one good song , although his version , while not as bad as most of his stuff , pretty much sucks . If you want hear how it should be done put on Neko Case 's version of 'Duchess ' . I 'm considering an intervention for my son because this is really scaring me !	-1
Kyuss is n't really a bad band by any means , but they seriously needed a quality songwriter in the band . Stoner rock at its most generic , I 'd say . `` Thumb '' contains riffs reminiscent of old Zeppelin and Sabbath songs , but without the riffs actually being memorable . That 's the biggest problem with the album right here- it tries to create decent guitar riffs , but somehow always finds a way to fail . `` Green Machine '' sounds like a Megadeth throwaway track . `` Molten Universe '' takes a riff section from Sabbath 's `` Snowblind '' and makes it the main dominating riff . `` 50 Million Year Trip ( Downside Up ) '' has a nice speedy guitar riff before quickly dissolving into generic forgettable riffage . `` Thong Song '' features a lead singer growling carelessly with his out of tune hoarse voice and spitting out a terrible vocal melody . `` Apothecaries ' Weight '' has some nice drumming and a steady rhythm before VERY average alternative rock riffage comes into play , `` Caterpillar March '' contains some of the most predictable and brain dead drumming and guitar playing I 've ever heard , and it 's impossible to believe anybody would truly like it . `` Freedom Run '' is just outright bizarre so it 's probably the best song here . `` 800 '' has some nice drumming and weird chanting vocals- an obvious highlight . `` Writhe '' has bad , intentionally lazy and forgettable vocals . `` Capsized '' has guitar playing probably ripped from an old Zeppelin or Eric Clapton tune but at least it 's decent . Of course Zeppelin or Clapton would have actually taken the guitar playing somewhere *interesting* instead of repeating the same set of simple notes so often , but at least it 's not a bad song . `` Allen 's Wrench '' sounds like a poor Metallica imitation without the songwriting to back it up ... or rather , 90 's Metallica . `` Mondo Generator '' is basically another awful Sabbath imitation but with REALLY bad vocals implemented this time . So terrible . `` Yeah '' finally closes this unappealing collection of disappointments by being ... yeah.Overall , not a very good album .	-1
A perennial favourite of the chattering classes , I purchased this hoping for some high quality soul music of a similar style to the excellent Lighthouse Family - sadly there is no comparison . Firstly there are only 9 songs compared to a whopping 17 on the Very Best of the Lighthouse Family , so it 's easy to see where to go for value for money . Secondly , Mr Gayes ' anti war sentiments seem somewhat nave and foolish in today 's political climate . Thirdly , Mr Gaye ca n't sing and has to resort to shock tactics such as singing in a high voice like a lady in order to sell records . No wonder his career ground to a halt in the early 80 's ! Verdict : avoid .	-1
Middling second album has the boyz in top vocal form , but the material they work with here is very , VERY average . & quot ; I 'll Make Love to You & quot ; is a safe , radio-friendly , G-rated ballad courtesy of Babyface , and even Jam and Lewis stumble on the through-the-motions & quot ; On Bended Knee. & quot ; Only on & quot ; Water Runs Dry & quot ; do things get a bit interesting . It sold a gazillion copies , but does that really speak for album 's quality ? Boyz II Men 's sophomore offering is not quite a disaster , but it 's a very dull record that plays by the rules and does nothing more . Is that supposed to be progress ?	-1
Like always with AF releases , the sound is just so bad and lifeless . As ususal a reverse remaster job by the `` great '' Hoffman or Gray . The plot is suck the life out of the music and make it sound dull . Take away the sparkle and details . Why are not this company exsposed yet ? Why do people use USD 30 to buy these discs ? It really annoys me that this company still releases discs . It is an offense to the artists .	-1
Audio Fidelity does not use the Original master tapes on this and about all of the CD releases . They claim the sources they use are going to give the consumer a great sounding CD.If you 're not using the Original master tape then you 're comparing HDTV to analog TV.This version sounds very slightly better then the Motown release but compare the cost.I wish Mobile Fidleity would release this because they use nothing but the Original Master tape and the sound comes through.A great Stevie Wonder CD , but all of his CD 's are great ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I ordered the cds but never received them . they were returned to the company that I ordered them from . needless to say I am not happy as I was really looking forrward to getting this music . I ordered it around the second anniversary of mj 's death .	-1
The Best of Michael Jackson is a compilation of Michael Jackson 's greatest hits and was released in 1975 by his former record company Motown . It sold 2.2 million copies worldwide and peaked at number forty-four on the U.S. R & B album chart .	-1
This does not contain every great Motown hit of Marvin Gaye , despite its title . There are far better compilations of his work out there.There is a two-disc collection that is more complete with all his early stuff and dance music too .	-1
In Square Circle had some of lame '80s product on it , but this whole album is lame '80s product . It does n't help its cause that there 's only one unqualified success on it . `` Skeletons '' and `` Get It '' were both hit singles , and they 're fun , but routine , funk , but the fact is you can find better songs that do the same thing on virtually every other Stevie Wonder album from 1972 on . ( The third hit , `` You Will Know '' , is awful . Unbearable . I dunno , pick a negative adjective and run with it ) . The song I 'm talking about is the stomping , long funkfest `` My Eyes Do n't Cry '' . Now that 's a total classic ! I love it ! Especially the percussion and keyboard riffs . And the melody . And the chorus . And everything else about it . Everything else is a zero . The funk ( `` Dark ` n ' Lovely '' ; `` In Your Corner '' ; `` One of a Kind '' ) is forced ; the ballads ( `` You Will Know '' ; `` With Each Beat of My Heart '' ; the space-soul , `` Rocket Love '' -like `` Galaxy Paradise '' ; `` Cryin ' through the Night '' ) are overwrought . Stevie was in sad shape here .	-1
EH ! some of the reviews seemed to suggest that there was more to this CD than the `` sings the blues '' sound-track ... NOPE ! Have to say I wish Diana would return those moments she stole from me . Waste of time !	-1
Perhaps the thing you should know first here , before you even think about plunking down the sixty bucks , is that two of Ross 's most identifiable , signature hits , `` Ai n't No Mountain High Enough '' & amp ; `` Love Hangover '' are in their chopped-up three and a half minute 45 RPM versions . ( On their original LP 's they ran over six and seven minutes , respectively . ) For a work that 's supposed to be the exhaustive , definitive and long-awaited retrospective of so important an American singer , this is inexcusable.The last Ross single to even nudge it 's way into the top ten ( and then just barely , for only a couple weeks ) was `` Missing You '' in January 1985 . No Ross single since then has come close . Note that on this set , after you hear the song , you 've got a whole disc yet to listen to , much of it then-newly recorded 90s material meant to foster the impression that Diana was a vital , trend-setting force in pop music still . No , not that anymore , though yes , forever a diva.So why did I buy it ? In October 1993 , it was the first instance Motown released a good number of classic 60s Supremes sides back in their original mono , many that did n't make it to the `` Hitsville U.S.A. '' set , and on that score , it delivers . But this set falls far short of giving fans of the solo Diana ( which I remain ) the heartening and nostalgia-inducing reacquaintance of her recording career we 'd been waiting for . ( It was also a side-by-side failure if you 'd also bought her alleged ` biography , ' `` Secrets of a Sparrow . `` ) One has only to compare the masterpiece work done on the boxed-sets of Aretha Franklin ( `` Queen of Soul '' ) , the Temptations ( `` Emperors of Soul '' ) and James Brown ( `` Star Time '' ) with `` Forever Diana '' to know that the lady was done wrong here . Motown , it 's been 10 years - scrap this one , forget about it ( and we 'll try to too ) , and start over again .	-1
Berry Gordy and Diana Ross really Screwed up here on this 4-disc compilation . My first thought after finally getting thru the four discs was : WHAT were they thinking ? ? ? ? First , let 's start with the APPALLINGLY BAAAADDDD fourth and last Disc . The music they came up with is n't even worth a fourth-rate R & B ; singer . It 's hard to believe Diana Ross had to record such drivel . Apart from the gem `` Best Years of My Life '' , which really was a classic -- well arranged , written and performed . Aside from that one song , the entire fourth disc is a MESS ! ! And this is on a Diana Ross career retrospective collection ? ? ? Com'on Berry Gordy , surely you can do better than this ! ! While Diana 's star was on the decline as the 1990 's began , still considering her stature in the music biz , they could 've come up with better songs and choices for this career retrospective collection . Many reviewers have complained the Supremes stuff on Disc 1 does n't even belong on this retrospective and I 'd have agree . Call it `` Padding '' by Berry Gordy and possibly Diana herself for this collection . With the wealth of Motown material in the vaults from Diana the solo artist since 1970 after she left the Supremes , surely there was plenty of more material and unreleased rarities to add to this collection.They could 've taken notes from Barbra Streisand 's superb 4-disc 1991 retrospective `` Just For the Record '' , released two years earlier . On `` For the Record '' , Streisand was wise to include outtakes , alternative versions and unreleased tracks from the music vaults . THAT 'S how you do a career retrospective ! ! ! Instead here , Diana 's fans have to put up with lousy songs and the waste of an entire disc space on Disc 4 . On some selections , you can even detect Diana 's own indifference towards the lackluster material.Berry Gordy also skimped on the sound quality . It 's mediocre at best . Again , it just shows lack of attention to detail and the basics . In 1993 when this retrospective was released , improvements were already being made on sound remastering technology as record companies were re-releasing classic CD 's with improved digital sound . Since `` Forever Diana 's '' release in 1993 , there have been Diana Ross and the Supremes compilations with much better sound , especially those released in the last 10 years since the early 2000 's . If Berry Gordy and Diana had decided to spend as much time on the sound quality as they did on the vanity project that went into the accompanying booklet , then maybe results would be much , much better in the sound department.If they ever decide to go back and release another Diana Ross career retrospective ( which does n't appear likely ) , they would have to re-think and re-do the entire song selection process ( especially filter out the Supremes stuff ) and go with the best digital Remastering for sound . They would also have to release classic tracks in their original entirety , not skimp to the single remix versions ( with `` Love Hangover '' `` Ai n't No Mountain High Enough '' as painful examples here ) . Her fans deserve much better treatment for sticking with this Diva for the past half century.Then again , the fans must be wondering , `` Why bother ? '' There are better Diana Ross two-disc collections out there with better sound , better selection of songs , so why bother with this lousy 4-disc compilation ? Too bad Diana Ross decided to call this career retrospective `` Forever Diana '' b/c the compilation does not stand the test of time nor deserve to be called `` Forever Diana '' . If she and Berry Gordy had decided to spend as much energy and time on the four discs as they did on the accompanying booklet ( a vanity project at best with self-serving photos of the Diva preening and posing in various guises ) , then maybe results would have been much different and better.Instead Berry Gordy decided to give Diana the reins to come up with a Vanity Project by sticking one too many needless , unnecessary tracks as fillers , especially on the last disc when they could 've come up with indeed material that was worth calling `` Forever Diana '' . Instead , the fans are saying : `` Forget It , Diana ! ''	-1
This has got to be the worst I have ever heard . I ca n't play it again to get used to it or give it another chance .	-1
For some reason there seem to be three versions of this album listed separately for sale on Amazon . One of them only has 13 tracks . Be sure to get the version with 14 tracks because the 14th track is too good to miss . `` Down the Line '' is one of the live songs and you absolutely want to have that cut . This review seems to appear in several versions of the album	-1
This CD drips with its own sense of self importance , and has nothing new to say . Highly recommended by the introspective bedsit set , not for the rest of us .	-1
Un Disco para mi gusto sobrevalorado , en realidad , es tan bueno ? este disco es para los que caen con el apantallamiento facil y se cren la actitud que toma la banda en sus letras , en realidad tengo que decirlo algunos temas son muy buenos , pero hay otros que jamas deberian haber sido grabados , la & quot ; chavada & quot ; cae redondita con las letras de la banda , epro , son tan buenas ? el decir una bola de sandeces es gran musica ? no es por ser regazon , pero es algo que las banadas anglosajonas llevan haciendo por a & ntilde ; os , bueno , tal ves ese sea el punto : este disco revoluciono la mijigata radio latina ( en especial la mexicana ) con sis letras , pero si buscas uno de los mejores discos del movimiento latino , estas viendo en la direccion incorrecta	-1
I 've never heard a funnier album than this ... all the songs sound the exact same ... you do n't know what they 're saying at all.. it fits the stereotype that all death metal has ... . just screaming with no talent.There 's no talent to be found on this album . It 's just song writing with the sickest , most vile thoughts imaginable . Anyone could write something like this.The lead singer could be saying & quot ; Have sex with dead people & quot ; or & quot ; kill your dog with an axe & quot ; you really ca n't tell ... and that 's what 's funny about it . All this band does is think of the most disgusting thing ever and write about it ... it 's a cheap way of getting people to like them . When you listen to this band you think that they 're are joking cuz there 's no way on earth that a band could be this bad . It 's horrid . It has very simple song writing and musically it sucks . But if you see it at a flea market for like 25 cents then buy it cuz you 'll need to listen to this if you 're feeling down.And let 's face it , without this band we would n't have those sweet & quot ; my anger is too complicated for you to understand & quot ; kids who dress in all black to make fun of . And not to mention the girls with the died black hair and fishnets.Those people are so rad .	-1
this album in my opinon at least is their worst , the singer is absolutly HORRIBLE ! ~~~ DONT BUY THIS ALBUMYOU WOULD THANK ME LATTER , JUST LISTEN TO THE SAMPLES OR EVEN GET THE SONGS FROM THE INTRNET KAZA I JUST ONE OF MANY COICHES	-1
I ca n't beleive people on this site take this band 's music seriously this is total noise.What the hell is wrong with you people.This band is sick and nasty for the sake of getting attention.The-y have nothing important to say or Growl about.The guitars areweak and annoying.The people that say this band have talent orjust as stupid this is nonsense , Barnes might as well speak inspanish , it 's almost like these death bands are trying to make uptheir own languege.Now I do n't have a problem with death metal.Ilike some.But this is annoying music with sadstic , nasty , perverselyrics that will only appear to stupid , pot-smokin , a**holes whodo n't know what true metal is.Now as far as death metal that isactually good-Barnes later project Six Feet Under and Obituarythat is all.Listen to those bands do n't waste time with this over-hyped band that are about as listenable as fingers down a chalkboard or even worse rap music ( well maybe not that bad ) .	-1
I 'm not stereotyping this album according to a genre . Read my other CC reviews , some are quite different than this . But the fact remains , this album is terrible . With the exception of the awesome guitarwork in Hammer Smashed Face and the better production of the instruments , there are no positive aspects . The vocals are worse than on any album CC has done and sometimes do n't even line up with the music , as if there was a major tracking error during recording . The solos are sloppy and the riffs in general are unrefined . The lyrics/song titles are at the peak of perversion , though it 's impossible to understand them without a lyric sheet . Even if you 're a huge CC/death metal fan , avoid this album like the plague . Buy the Bleeding or Vile .	-1
For those of you who are about to click the not helpful button because of my rating , would you read what I have to say before using the trigger finger ? I Love Death Metal . But I do n't just accept every band because they are `` Br00tal '' and have songs filled with `` Blast Beats . '' I like Death metal that I can take seriously . I have taste . I like Death Metal bands that are made up with great musicians who are able to create memorable riffs and have excellent guitar solos and able to create a structure to their music as well as a sense of imagery . Cannibal Corpse accomplishes none of these tasks ; they simply do not pass the bar that my favorites have raised . Cannibal Corpse is the most overrated Death metal band out there , hands down . Why do people praise Cannibal Corpse ? I have the feeling that most of them love Corpse to look tough , blend in , to be feared and to shock . I know a guy who simply does it for the image . Cannibal Corpse and their artwork do not shock me . Every one of their albums is a Fart Joke told over and over again and again . It gets old and stale really fast . Rule number one when listening to death metal : If you get bored , it sucks ! This is n't going to be just a stereotypical attack on Cannibal Corpse that only serves to rip on the band . I 've actually taken the time to listen to these three songs , several times as a matter of fact . First off ; the production is horrible . Especially the grunts of the former vocalist Chris Barnes . When he first began to grunt , I thought that the bass guitar somehow broke . If Death metal could whisper , this would be a perfect example . It 's a desperate attempt at the death metal voice . He 's muffled in the background which only further serves to aid his inaudibility . The weird random bass solo in the intro to Hammer Smashed Face could have been interesting if it had n't come off as sloppy and messy as it did . Hammer Smashed Face is supposedly a favorite of Cannibal fans . It 's honestly nothing special . It does n't grab your attention.Then to cause further annoyance , they throw in two covers . The Exorcist ( originally by Possessed ) and Zero the Hero ( originally by Black Sabbath ) . For those of you who do n't know , Possessed was the first Death Metal band and not surprisingly their version is far superior . Zero the Hero is an embarrassment even for a band as bad as this . It just does n't fit ... at all ... In short Cannibal Corpse just does n't cut it . They are a novelty band with a thirst for attention instead of blood . With artwork and song titles that are meant to grab your attention but after one hears the song , they can only laugh . Then after hearing more and more of their songs , there are no laughs . There is only the dull and bored face of someone wanting actual substance in death metal . This crap is n't believable ; the musicians are not the gods their fans make them out to be either . I 'm going to cut this review shorter and end with this . Check out bands like Malevolent Creation , Krisiun , Possessed , Macabre ( deliberately funny ) , Vader , Obituary , Behemoth , Sepultura ( first 2 recordings before becoming Thrash ) , Celtic Frost and Kataklsym instead for some excellent Death Metal that you can take seriously and not become bored with . Another reviewer once said something like `` if you pay attention to them then they wo n't go away . '' This is true . For those new to Death Metal , the next time someone tells you to `` check out Cannibal Corpse '' , just ignore them or download and really listen to them before jumping on the bandwagon.However , there is one thing that I will always respect Cannibal Corpse for . Apparently early in their career , they used to call their fans Maggots , but shortly dropped the title after realizing how stupid it was unlike another joke of a band . They still suck though .	-1
I always have heard about cannibal corpse and seen their t-shirts in every concert that i go but i had never actullie heard any of their stuff so i was like & quot ; why not ? & quot ; so i purchased this album & quot ; eaten back to life & quot ; yesterday for the first time and i thought i would get actullie good deathmetal and true deathmetal substance but what i got was a waste of money and a 6 grade lirycist who probely ca n't spell the word & quot ; good & quot ; .There is n't one high trach here and it gets worse and worse song after sog so please if you see cannibal corpse in the cd store skip it ! Insted go for & quot ; suffocation & quot ; , & quot ; morbid angel & quot ; , & quot ; obituary & quot ; , & quot ; grave & quot ; , and , & quot ; hate-eternal & quot ; and leave cannibal corpse alone ! Laters ! !	-1
This band really , really , REALLY suck . Chris Barnes sounds like he 's having a particularly nasty bout of constipation , from what I can discern from the incomprehensible grunting and snorting . The background music never varies , and sounds identical from song to song , which , coupled with the awful singing , creates the effect of the same song being copied and pasted to fill up a disc and packaged with different names.But the really awful part of Cannibal Corpse is the lyrics . Necrophilia , rape and mutilation are the order of the day . And people actually find this drivel funny ? Tell me , please , what is so damn hilarious about a woman being flung through a windscreen , being impaled on a roadsign , and her unborn baby slopping onto the road ? Or a man shoving a knife up a girls private parts ? This is neither funny nor clever . These guys are sick , twisted neanderthals . For all those people who say that you have to ignore the terrible grunting and sick lyrics to & quot ; Understand what death metal is all about & quot ; , this is not death metal . This is n't even music . It 's a group of talentless sickos thumping out as much noise as they can and calling it music . I 'd rather be ignorant ( by your standards ) than be a Cannibal Corpse fan .	-1
You know , I actually try to sit down and listen to this music . I try to find something that is good about this album . Interminable instruments banging and slamming all at once without stopping , a singer who groans . I 've tried to find something good with this album , but like before , Cannibal Corpse is a really stupid band ... if you even want to call them a band . If you want REAL death metal , get morbid angel or In Flames ... . Hmm ... should I even rate this album 1 star ? ? ?	-1
Back in the summer of 1997 , I went through a crazy ( and now , a bit inexplicable ) phase of being hugely into Cannibal Corpse . I would scour the area record stores for their albums and EPs . This was my third or fourth album purchase of theirs . I never really got into this debut that same way I did , say , Deicide or The Ten Commandments because the production was poor ( only slighly improved on the 2002 remaster ) and the songs were not quite there yet . Some rate this as a great death metal masterpiece ( some meaning few ) but I ca n't see ( hear ) why . Their next album , 1991 's Butchered At Birth was a huge step in the right direction .	-1
This is by far the worst music group I have ever listened to.Not one song that they sing talks about anything besides death , that is why they call it death metal.Death metal is the worst type of rock music out there.Avoid this CD at all costs.I hope this review was helpful.Peace Out .	-1
... but sometimes you must reach bottom to get to the top . I know , I know , they must have been on a budget , but I 'm sure they could 've found a decent quality studio at a cheap price . After all they lived in California , probably the epicenter of music ( especially metal ) in the 1980s.Many of these songs have potential , especially the song `` Hell Awaits , '' which sounds like a firestorm live , but not only does the bad sound quality kill it , Slayer sounds like that they did n't even try to give their demonic brand of metal any justice while recording . The guitar sounds like it 's being played on low volume through a dryer , and Tom Araya 's vocals sound like he 's talking through a dying a cell phone . ...	-1
How can someone say & quot ; Slayer is the greatest thing mankind has ever made & quot ; ! Are you crazy ? These guys are a shame to metal , even speed metal , they do n't play anything in this albun , only noise . Anyway , there are people who like it . But who is more commercial ? Madonna or Slayer ? I do n't know ... In Madonna 's music ( which I hate ) there are at least musicality in their songs , some coeherence in songwriting . In Slayer , they keep selling for fools who think & quot ; Slayer is the greatest thing mankind has ever made & quot ; ...	-1
Hell really awaits for you in this record . A hell of bad songs , bad singing , bad songwriting , bad solos ... all this under the cover of & quot ; metal & quot ; . This is not metal . & quot ; Metal & quot ; is Iron Maiden , Metallica , Sabbath , Priest ( of course , all these bands in their epic times ) . Music like Slayer 's only denegrate metal .	-1
2.5 stars . There are a few classic songs on this album , such as `` The Antichrist '' and `` Black Magic '' , but this is only the begining of how great Slayer were about to become . The guitarwork is n't that great , and the lyrics are much more tough to take seriously , both of which were completely changed on their later albums . Diehard fans will enjoy this , but you 'd be much better off buying `` Reign In Blood '' , `` South of Heaven '' , or `` Seasons In the Abyss '' , three of metal 's finest documents . That 's when Slayer went from being just another average thrash band to a truly monumental experiance .	-1
Sorry but the Production on this is terrible . I mean when they play these songs live they are absolutely killer , but here , the volume must be turned much higher then normal to balance out the production and even then it 's sub par . But what makes this painful is that Metal Blade is asking $ 10 for this thing . The proper thing to do would have to put all Metal Blade records on 2 disc sets . I would say put this with Show No Mercy but there is a rare import version of Live Undead that contain this on the same CD . Even though on the original version of Live Undead there was a much better , redone version of Chemical Warfare , yet Metal Blade removed it . Metal Blade claims to have aggressive perfector here as a bonus track here but it really is n't . Aggressive Perfector was put on a large selection of versions of Haunting the Chapel on Vinyl . But enough about my complaints lets see the music.1 . Chemical Warfare 7/10 This Song is a Slayer classic , or at least for most , I find it below average in comparison to other like Hell Awaits , South of Heaven , Angel of Death , Etc . It seems to drag on for a bit too long in my opinion and the poor production is most evident here.2 . Captor of Sin 9/10 The best song here , always a joy when played live and a quick one . Production does n't affect it that much here.3 . Haunting the Chapel 6/10 The Title Track is surprising in that no one even cares about this one really , they never seem to play it live , it is an interesting song , but not a standout , it 's definitely something different though . What a lot of people do n't know was that Slayer was supposed to redo this song and 2 others for the Box set that came out yet that never happened . If they did redo it , it would have been significantly better.4 . Aggressive Perfector 10/10 The reasoning behind the 10 out of ten is that this is Slayer 's First song , originally from a compilation and its hilarious , as everyone else has said ` you could square dance to this '' .Though I may have been pretty positive and high ratings about the songs , I still do n't yearn to listen to the songs , and there is much better music that Slayer has to offer . This EP , their only EP , is pretty weak in comparison to almost all of their other stuff . This is where Slayer developed the niche that makes them Slayer , but they actually did n't really become the true Slayer until Hell Awaits , and though that album 's production is bad too , it 's not as bad as this and is more enjoyable . I know some of you Slayer fans will disagree with me on this , but I 'm just speaking of it from my point of view , please do not take any offense , It does pain me to give a Slayer CD such a low rating . Hoped this helped .	-1
The Goo Goo Dolls are a terrible power-pop group who have as much artistic talent as NSYNC or whatever boy band is popular these days . Jed proves that The Goo Goo Dolls were never any good . I heard this CD was supposed to be a PUNK record . The Goo Goo Dolls were just a less known power pop group when this CD came out . If you thought this was punk , you 're wasting your time ...	-1
Cannibal Corpse are probably the worst death metal band ive ever heard ! ! I mean it 's just some messed up riffs not even played on a proper scale with heavy distortion ! ! Im only 13 years old and im sure i could play better.And the songs , OMG they all sound the same with the gore lyrics ! This is definitely not worth anything ! ! If u want some good technical death metal listen to bands like Crpytopsy and stuff like that .	-1
Whether the lyrics are meant for shocking purposes or not , if you like a band that has songs like `` Stripped , Raped , and Strangled '' or `` She was asking for it '' , I hope you feel proud of yourself . Sure , I thought their last album was terrific , but The Bleeding is from way back when Chris Barnes was still in the band . While his growls are still very cool ( unlike his current garbage band ) , the music on this disc is typical , generic early ` 90s death metal with some of the most immature lyrics ever layed down on paper . It 's been re-issued with a bonus song-a cover of Possessed 's `` The Exorcist '' and the video for `` Staring through the eyes of the dead '' .	-1
I listen to a lot of HEAVY stuff like SLAYER , SODOM , LAMB OF GOD and KREATOR ... ..my father argue with all those HEAVY METAL bands , but one day i put cannibal corpse to play and for the first time he ask WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ! ! ! ! you see , regular people can argue with regular METAL , but this is not even really music ... ..The singer only growls a repetitive OOOOOOOOOO where you ca n't understand a word ... .The lyrics are highly blasphemous and immoral ... .the SLAYER lyrics are naive and sweet if you compare to this ... .in resume , the gore visual , the offensive lyrics and the repetitive noise makes me wan na puke when listening to cannibal corpse ... .Sorry , it 's true ... THIS IS COMPLETE GARBAGE ! ! ! ! BLAAAAHHHHHHHHH ! ! ! ! !	-1
Cannibal Corpse ... ..now I know these guys are supposed to be the next big thing in Death Metal , but honestly , this band is bad . Yes , the guitar solo 's are good , the guitars are good , the drummer is alright , and as for the bass player , you could never hear him becasue of the guitars . There are too many times in their songs where they sound as if they 're playing any random note or chord . Now do n't get me wrong , I 'm a big fan of heavy metal ... but this stuff is just horrible and stupid . How perverted are these lyrics ... .constantly talking about all of this gore crap in ALL of their songs ? I mean ask yourselves , what is the point about CONSTANTLY singing about raping , tortuing , and beating women , killing people , ripping out people 's insides , ripping off people 's skin , talking about certain body parts , butchuring and killing babies , talking about maggots , venom , and death ? ( just to name a few of the VARIOUS gory topics they talk about ) and just writing horrible music like that ? I mean these guys think its cool and think it 's a joke but it is n't . The guys from Cannibal Corpse keep talking in their interviews about how their lyrics are n't supposed to be taken seriously , but if that 's true , then why are so many people mad about it ? I thought heavy metal lyrics were supposed to be about your emotions and feelings , or about how you 're angry at life , how you 're sick of certain things . I thought lyrics were supposed to be meaningful . Cannibal Corspe is heavy no doubt about that , they 're probably the heaviest band you 'll meet . But I do n't feel right listening to their songs , realizing that this is the stuff they talk about . You can be able to tell that this is a putrid band just by looking at the artwork on the CD cover or the song titles . But you know something , I think these guys are doing it just for the attention , to be honest . No one else has written these kinds of lyrics before , no one has made violent graphic disturbing artwork on a CD cover like this . I really think this is done only for attention . Everybody likes them because of how `` cool '' and `` tough '' Cannibal Corpse looks . Cannibal Corpse probably thinks that takling about beating women , killing babies , and all of that sort makes them look tough , and is a way of selling albums . Oh yeah , that 's tough , but I bet that they never have the balls to do that in real life . It should be illegal to write music like this . Why write lyrics about things that happen in for other people 's unfortune in real life ? This stuff should n't be taken lightly and taken as a joke , it should n't . The band Cannibal Corpse has been a band for about over a decade , and made LOTS of albums , but the sad thing is , they have n't changed their lyric style AT ALL . A whole decade of nothing but `` GRRRRR EEEEEEEE , smelling a girl 's insides , it was so enchanting , EEEEEEEE , I raped her and then beat her on the head with shot gun , while masterbating to it , EEEEEE OOOOOOOOOOH , and it was exicitng , then I go outside , and see zombies , EEEEE , with venom and blood dripping from their heads , and maggots flying out of their skulss , EEEEEE then I hack out their brains then eat the brains , the gooey water flowing from their insides tasted good to me as I drunk it up , GRRRRRRR , OOOOOOOH , EEEEEE '' in ALL of their songs . I mean how stupid is that . See , even I can write a Cannibal Corpse song , I just did when I just gave you that example . Seriously , anyone can just sit down and write gory scary lyrics like that , I bet even a 6 year old could do it . I mean I 'd rather listen to Avril Lavigne than to listen to this . And their music is not THAT great . The solos are good , but just the music they play in general gets old after a while , becuase all of their songs sound the same and you ca n't tell the difference between any of them . This is n't good music at all . This band would be a whole lot better if it was n't for the extremely perverted lyrics , and if they started being more organized with their music , becuase like I said , their are parts in their songs where it seriously sounds like they 're just playing any random note/beat/chord . This is not worth your time listening to at all . Listen to some good metal bands like Lamb of God , Black Label Society , As I Lay Dying , Trivium , Rammstein , System of a Down , Static-X , Necrophagist , Mastodon , and the best guitarist ever , Jimmy Hendrix . Just do n't waste your time on this ... it 's not music , just garbage .	-1
cant believe kids like this ... ..it sounds like the cookie monster singing along to some bad metal ... .the album covers are very entertaining and thats pretty much it ... if you want real metal , listen to Winger ... ... haha just kidding ... ..kids , please just listen to Slayer ... .no gimicks with those guys ... .the read deal ... this is just trying to be scary , and it is not scaring me ... .	-1
okay before you read this you 'll probably think & quot ; yeah another one of those limp bizkit/metallica poser wimps you thinks that he knows everything about metal and just ca n't deal with the heavyness and genius of this album & quot ; . wrong . i 've been into all kinds of extreme metal from sheer hardcore metal ( pissing razors , hatebreed etc . ) over death metal ( nile , krisiun , lamb of god etc . ) , over grindcore ( napalm death , coalesce etc . ) to the most extreme technical metal ( dillinger escape plan , strapping young lad , meshuggah etc. ) . so much for my qualifications . i personally think that this album is just plain boring . it has these pseudo-tough lyrics that make me laugh , also the vocalists growl seems week , the guitar player is able to play about 3 chords . it does n't have the sheer ripping power and speed of napalm death , not the technical , cutting insanity of strapping young lad or dillinger escape plan , not the blunt brutality of let 's say deicide or nile , not the straight ahead , in-your-face exploding power of pissing razors or brujeria . i think this is dull , repetetive ... simply boring . get some of the aforementioned bands they are simply better .	-1
THis band does n't improve . Incredible ! THey always play the same stuff , what means : nothing .	-1
This is a bunch of tards with instruments . When I think Death Metal , I think good bands like In Flames , Children of Bodom , Dimmu Borgir , and early Sepultura . NOT garbage like Cannibal Corpse.These guys are completely untalented . I doubt the guitarist ( s ) actually learned how to play guitar , they just decided to attack the strings randomly . And also , the singer sounds like a dog choking on something . As for the drums , I 'm sure the drummer just decided to attack a bunch of drums randomly and double pedal rapidly . And the lyrics are just stupid over-the-top gore lyrics . Just reading them , I imagine a conversation going down like this : '' Oh , I 'm uncreative . What should I do ? `` I HAVE AN IDEA ! ! ! ! Write a bunch of lyrics about necrophilia , blood , gore , murdering , and a bunch of other disgusting random things ! `` No , seriously . They really are that stupid . Here 's an example : '' Crawling rodents gorging on meRepulsive starving drovesShredding , stripping , consuming all I wasTissue pulled from bonesDying slowly , feeling every fangShock has yet to comeScavengers tear out my eyesMy pain wo n't end , I have not died '' Brilliant ! That does n't even make sense ! `` Gorging on me '' ? ? ? LOL ! ! ! ! ! ! Not stupid enough ? Here 's another brilliant one : '' Severing , parts and veins in the wayMy insides are on the outside of meMy bones now shatter and explodeThe pain , its destination my brainCa n't hide from beign eaten from inside '' Um , Shatter and Explode ? Wrong order , idiot.I 'll write my own CC song now ! ! ! ! Blood , Blood is all I seesplashing down on my pancreasMy intestines falling outAnd my kidneys left to dryBrains splatter all over my bodyBlood followsI feast and drinkOn rotten insidesTonight we shall killand rip out the intestinesAnd glorify infaticideThere , I wrote my own CC song ! ! ! ! ! Point is , this band just plain sucks . Want good death metal ? Listen to In Flames or Dimmu Borgir . Stay away from this garbage at all cost .	-1
My definition of death metal : loud noise that sounds the same.Yep , the title says it all , this CD is vile.I would tell you what the worst song on the CD is , but I ca n't since they are all the same song.Yep , same drum beats , same distorted guitars , same useless screaming.If you love mindless noise , then be sure to pick up a copy of Vile by Cannibal Corpse.Peace Out .	-1
See , here 's the problem with Caribou : It is n't very good . There are hits , oh yes - what Elton album would be complete without hits ? Those are good . `` The B*tch is Back '' is a funny heavy rocker with a full brass section and is not sexist , unlike ... oh , I dunno , everything else Bernie Taupin ever wrote : the `` b*tch '' is the singer , you see . `` Do n't Let the Sun Go Down on Me '' , meanwhile , is one of Elton 's many classic love ballads with another one of those soaring refrains . `` Stinker '' is a rewrite of `` The B*tch is Back '' , but I do n't care - it 's a damn good time . And `` I 've Seen the Saucers '' is cool in its eeriness . On the other hand , I really wish Bernie Taupin would stop parodying country , since `` Dixie Lily '' just may be worse than `` No Shoestrings on Louise '' , which is an impressive feat ; `` Pinky '' and `` Grimbsy '' are yet more cheesy ballads ; `` You 're So Static '' is more unwarranted misogyny ; `` Ticking '' has no reason to exist ; `` Solar Prestige Whatever '' is a painful sequel to `` Sun King '' . Oh , and the cover image makes Captain Fantastic 's look like a Da Vinci .	-1
The only reason to buy this CD is for `` I 've seen the saucers '' and `` Dont let the sun go down on me '' ... .in my personal opinion ... the only 2 songs worth listening to ... ..This album was a complete flop ... compared to the epic GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD and everything that preceeded it ... ..I think the falling out between Elton and Bernie contributed to its failure ... ... Elton is a great musician and performer but his song writing ability leaves alot to be desired .	-1
Bring The Noise and Keep it in the Family kick butt ... but that 's about it . I 've mentioned this in other reviews of Anthrax ... I prefer Bush era Anthrax ( the singer , not the president ! ) , but I also consider `` Worship Music '' one of Anthrax 's best discs ever , so I 'm not against Joey Belladonna . However , whether it 's the production or whatever , his voice just does n't cut it for me on this disc . It does n't have that feeling of fullness that it had on `` Worship Music '' where he sounded amazing . Anyway , I 've heard far better from Anthrax and hold them to a high standard , but this is still worth buying for Bring the Noise .	-1
Sorry , but this album is one of the most overrated albums ever ! There is nothing to get excited about with this album . The best word to describe it is `` boring '' . I 'm not sure how it gets put up there on some lists of `` the best albums of the 90 's '' . I not a huge U2 fan , but this album is nothing compared to Joshua Tree and War .	-1
this horrid garbage is a prelude to the super no talent tramp Miley . They both need to be shot . Why was billy ever allowed to have demon offspring !	-1
Webber 's rather slight musical needs the best possible talent to be successful . The gimmicky score and too precious lyrics can only be salvaged by energetic performances and this version does not have talent to support the play 's faults . Jason Donovan is an adequate Joseph but seems to play the role so straight that the humanity in the character is lost . Linzi Hately 's narrator is no match for others recorded in the role and David Easter 's Pharoh has very little of The King in him . Not recorded with clarity , and with a rather bizarre club mix at the end , this version could be missed unless you want a keepsake for this particular production .	-1
Two good songs on this entire CD ... TWO ! ! ! DO NOT waste your $ $ $ on this twofer.Oh well , live and learn .	-1
There is only one good song out of the entire CD- Strawberry Jam . This CD will be donated to charity for write off .	-1
This is after the brilliant `` Hysteria '' Def Leppard 's second best album by far and no mean feat considering the drummer only had one arm by this time and Steve Clark had just died ! Almost every track is brilliant and the hit single `` Let 's Get Rocked '' is actually one of the weaker tracks too ! It 's frightening how much better it 'll sound once they get around to remastering this thing.Unfortunately , this is not one of those times . Given the very hefty price tag on this thing in order to justify upgrading from your existing copy , it has got to be a major improvement at least from the aesthetics of the cardboard sleeve and especially when it comes to sound quality . The cardboard sleeve is nothing to shout about given what is currently out there e.g . The Band , Hall & Oates etc that have been very well designed from thicker good quality cardboard which is so well assembled that you do n't fear it coming apart when the glue wears out like it is here . In fact , when it comes to the mlps version of `` The Band '' the only way to describe it is as a brilliant work of art ; you 'll have to see it to know what I mean about someone having great pride in his work to come up with what I believe is still the very best mlps version of an album that is currently out there.The inclusion of the inner jacket replica and an insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese also is n't enough to justify a ridiculously expensive upgrade . The biggest crime though is the SHM-CD sound quality which is really very poor . In fact , my existing old copy sounds even better ! Listening to both , there is nothing to distinguish between the two except for the cardboard sleeve with the SHM-CD label on the front and the vastly different sound quality which is no better than the old copy . I 'm disappointed to have waited so long and this is what they have come up with : poor mlps design and sound quality that is no improvement over my existing old copy . The only plus is that they have added two bonus tracks : `` Miss You in a Heartbeat '' and `` She 's Too Tough '' which is a nice touch . I have placed SHM-CD orders for other albums that are due to reach me soon and I hope and pray that they are much , much better sounding versions than this one.Given the very high price on this baby for a version that is no improvement over the unremastered old cd that you already have , this is a rip off and a major waste of money in these uncertain economic times.Avoid with as wide a berth as possible !	-1
I have always loved this album . BUT the bonus disc is missing `` Action '' , `` From The Inside '' , `` Miss You In a Heartbeat '' , `` Only After Dark '' , and `` She 's Too Tough '' . I know they were previously released on Retroactive , however it would have been nice to include them here to be complete . Still hoping for a REAL b-sides comp .	-1
Swing Out Sister is the duo of vocalist Corinne Drewery and keyboardist Andy Connell . They were big in the late '80 's and early '90 's with songs like & quot ; Breakout , & quot ; and the only hit on this album . They rode the coat tails of such new jazzy bands like Level 42 , Breathe , and Marvelous Sauce . I looked forward to this with great shortness of breath , then it started:1 . Get in Touch With YourselfStrings really accent this funky song where a woman just KNOWS she is all a man needs . The saxophone solo is a great idea.2 . NotgonnachangeDisco and classical strings meet in a breakup song where Drewery sings she will not change for love . The great instrumentals help lyrics that you have heard before in better songs.3 . Am I the Same GirlThe only hit off the album , this song about young love is the best here where Drewery 's vocals get a workout.4 . Everyday CrimeCool bass line and more disco as she sings of loving someone from afar.5 . Who Let the Love OutThe title threw me , I thought I saw the word & quot ; dogs & quot ; instead of & quot ; love , & quot ; but again the lyrics fail an otherwise flawless piece.6 . I Can Hear You But I Ca n't See You ( Instrumental ) The first of two instrumentals has a great piano overlay , with enough ear stuff going on . Vocals come in to & quot ; daa-doo & quot ; at a perfect time . Really fun to listen to.7 . UnderstandA little darker love song suddenly changes in the chorus to sound as familiar as the other work here . Cheesy rhymes do not help.8 . CirculateOkay song about a cheating love has a terrible title line : & quot ; You let your love circulate. & quot ; All the subtlety of a Kid Rock music video.9 . Love ChildThis sounds like a Madonna song , but this is so lyrically challenged . Do you see a pattern developing ? 10 . Incomplete Without YouThe second best song on the album is more jazzy than the others , and with better keyboard work.11 . Do n't Say a WordCompletely bland song starts suddenly , then degenerates . & quot ; I 've heard it all before & quot ; is the most truthful line on the album ! 12 . Everyday Crime ( Instrumental ) Completely unnecessary instrumental version of the earlier song feels tacked on ... and it is.I was very disappointed in this album . The music and production was great , but Drewery 's vocals sounded a little restrained , as if she was holding back . The major weakness here is the songwriting . The lyrics are terrible , singing about ideas of love , loss , and everything else everyone else has written about . All in all , Swing Out Sister needs to get in touch with a muse , not themselves . I do not recommend this one .	-1
SOME PEOPLE PREFER POP AND WILL LIKE THIS CD BETTER THAN OTHER SWING OUT SISTER CD'S.This is Swing Out Sister 's third album . Sound quality is pretty good and it is 57 minutes long.The CD starts out strong with the title track . It is an energetic jazz rock tune and is similar to material on their first album , It 's Better to Travel.But , after the first track , the album turns more to sugary pop . It is very similar to the British club music style of the late eighties . Many British groups , especially disco ( Dead or Alive ) and new wave bands ( Banarama ) were switching over to this style . To me it is a bland and tedious musical style . It does not have the creative energy of Swing Out Sister 's earlier work.What typifies this CD is the instrumental I Can Hear You But I Ca n't See You . It is a funky number that sounds just like the Theme From Shaft , only , it is dumbed down and mellowed out for white bread tastes.Swing Out Sister is one of many jazz/soul oriented rock/pop vocal bands to come out of England starting in the mid eighties . Others included Simply Red , Sade and Seal . They filled a muscial void after progressive rock and Southern rock died for those who were n't into disco and wanted a little soul and emotion in their music . It was a popular style until Grunge morphed into jangle rock in the mid nineties .	-1
This album is not the pinnacle of shoegazing that a lot of people seem to think it is . This band seems to have stolen most of its ideas from the band Ride , and its album Nowhere . If you like Ferment , take one listen to Nowhere ( released 2 years before , in 1990 ) . You 'll hear what I mean . Do n't get me wrong , Ferment is a nice listen in places ( I like `` Flower To Hide '' and `` Balloon '' ) , but all I can think when I hear most of it is `` rip off ! `` .To the band 's credit , they really honed their craft on later albums and concentrated on songwriting , rather than trying to take your head off with walls of guitar noise . If you compare this to their 2000 release Wishville it does n't even sound like the same band .	-1
I was at a party last week and someone said I needed to listen to Tom Waits . I said what the heck because I 'm always open to music I 've never heard before . What I heard blew me away . This guy is the worst singer in the history of recorded music . He actually has surpassed names like Ricky Martin , Corey Hart and Jerry Garcia as the worst vocalist in the world . The only thing I could imagine sounding worse is if you got my uncle Ted drunk on Milwaukee 's Best Light took him to a karaoke bar and had him sing a Josh Groban song . This guy is that awful . I stood up , walked over to the CD player , took out the Tom Waits CD and simply broke it in half , daring anyone to fight me . The owner of the CD ran at me , but I dusted him off with a crane kick and a people 's elbow . I took off my elbow pads and gave them to a hot girl who wanted me really bad . I went to my ferrari and got my copy of Hasselhoff sings America and put it on the system . The party was immediately kicked up from an embarrassment to a nice , respectable level . Everyone took turns practicing wrestling moves on the Tom Waits fan that I laid out . One guy did a Hogan knee drop , another did a superfly snuka from the top rope ( loveseat ) and J abs threw in a camel clutch . The guy got what he deserved for trying to ruin the party with a cd from this goof . It literally sounds like he 's gargling gravel . I do n't whether to be mad that this got put on at the party to feel sorry for Mr. Waits because everyone keeps making him think he 's talented .	-1
All that 's worth mentioning on this album are the hits 'Connected ' and 'Step It Up ' which , sadly , form the highlights along with the mellow 'Chicken Shake ' . But it 's all the same . Soft hiphop , slightly electronized , and with the interesting , kinda deep and electronic-sounding , lead vocals . All through the album . Buy a single instead , that 's enough by far.When Stereo MC 's do their best , they try to sound like LL Cool J , or like Grandmaster Flash & amp ; The Furious Five , as on 'The End ' . But it 's simply not that great .	-1
Despite your album title not everybody was trying to imitate 10,000 Maniacs in 1993 , and so therefore the title does n't apply to you . If you wanted to just say you were recording an album then that 's fine , but do n't say you are doing this because everyone else is SO THERE ! ! ! ! ! ! Now that my venting over the title is over now onto serious business : `` Linger '' is my first introduction of the Cranberries , and let 's just say that it was as bad as getting a manly handshake from a woman . The melody is despicable , and the lyrics are too , and it was one of the bad memories of the first months in FL . That 's where I was first introduced to this , so I feel that if everyone was rocketing to the moon in their underpants would you ?	-1
This is easily the most overrated of P.J . Harvey 's records and is perhaps one of the most overrated alternative records released in the 1990s . The production and song-writing is as shoddy as it gets . With the exception of the misplaced experiment with violins , & quot ; Man-Sized Sextet & quot ; ( which was better executed on later records ) , and the melodic , & quot ; Missed & quot ; ( reminescent of her debut release , 'Dry ' ) , the simple punk/riff which works on some of the tracks ( & quot ; Rid of Me & quot ; , & quot ; Yuri-G & quot ; , and Bob Dylan 's & quot ; Highway 61 Revisited & quot ; ) becomes tiresome after a short time.NOTE : Whether you agree with my assessment of this record or not , people who really seem to like this record also seem to like her new record ( & quot ; Stories from the City , Stories from the Sea & quot ; ) but not 1995 's & quot ; To Bring You My Love & quot ; or 1998 's & quot ; Is This Desire & quot ; , both of which represent far-better productions by Flood . Depending on where you are on the P.J . Harvey fan spectrum , beware .	-1
Why is Polygram releasing all these greatest hits compilations on this gritty , nasty , just too tight funk band . They have to be one of the hottest groups to come out of the south . And the justice that Polygram is giving them on these compilations are n't gon na do . They are just barely scratching the surface of what this band has to offer . I would like to see full length cd 's by this super funk group . Cause anybody who was around when they were in their prime knows that the party was n't happening till there were some Bar-Kays jams being played . Come on Polygram ( Universal/Uni whatever your calling yourself 's ) get with the program and show these brother 's some love . Release the full length ( Too Hot To Stop , Light Of Life , Injoy , As One , Nightcruising , etc . ) already ! Dang ! Oh , and enough with the compilations already .	-1
This band released so much compilations , ( like BEE GEES ) , that you end forgetting their real discography !	-1
I am a big fan of the band , but this CD is in my opinion a low point . It is not terrible with songs like the title track and `` Dirty Day '' as my stand outs , but the rest of the album just does n't stand out . U2 was moving toward more electronic music and away from some of the passion that makes this band great . I think that this is this CD 's downfall . I was glad to see the follow up discs take a new direction . I admire the band 's willingness to try new things , but this just did n't do it for me .	-1
Gross , Homer Simpson-level incompetence . Soulless dreck . Music that struggles and fails to be cutting-edge . You 'd never think that U2 would make something like this , would you ? Well , you were wrong , then - this represents their lowest low . Distorted , processed electrofunk is not U2 's strong point , and you probably could tell that by listening to `` Babyface '' and `` Numb '' ( with a vocodor ! On a U2 song ! Seriously ! The Edge raps on it , too ... urgh ... ) . I mean , at least Achtung Baby had some really high highs , rather than awful imitation Prince fused with techno such as `` Lemon '' ( which was somehow a charting single - when you 're massively popular , you can get away with anything ) . The only song with organic elements , `` Stay ( Faraway , So Close ) '' ! ) , is a pathetic flop with some of U2 's worst lyrics . Said awful lyrics show up to plague `` Some Days Are Better Than Others '' , which does have a fine bass groove going for it . It 's the only song on this monstrosity I can tolerate for more than a half minute , and even then I have a hard time with the instrumental break . At least `` The First Time '' and `` Dirty Day '' have nothing to do with techno , even if I ca n't remember a thing about any of them . Oh , and did I mention the title track , less a song than an excuse to whip out as many headphone tricks as possible ? Or the execrable Johnny Cash duet `` Wanderer '' ? No ? Wondering why ? I hope not . This is the ultimate low for U2 . Painful . Just painful .	-1
Ever notice the 'helpful ' votes lean to 'no ' most often when a review is a pan ? I have much respect for the reviewer from Sydney ; though many tout this U2 clunker to be terrific , he 's the only one bold enough to give it 5 stars -- misguided though he is ... .Going in a new direction is not synonymous with improving . That U2 continued to lose their way by proffering new sounds to ever-restless fans is proof that they had run out of their greatest asset : songs of faith . Now , faith is hard to hold onto , no doubt ; but since this album ( and the previous ACHTUNG ) , they have n't re-found their souls , try as they might to make spiritual statements . `` We were just ACTING the rock star persona , wink-wink . '' A recent mild return to their greatness is promising , but likely you will never hear an album like WAR again . Remember Neil Young 's awful 80 's ? He came out on the other side with SILVER AND GOLD . Remember Dylan 's 80 's ? He rose like a phoenix with LOVE AND THEFT . Unbelieveable , really . But U2 have n't yet hosed the stink quite off of themselves .	-1
UNLIKE THE JOSHUA TREE & amp ; ACTUNG BABY This Disc Never RIses Or CHallenges the Depth OF Lyrics & amp ; Music that has Made U2 very Important in the first place.Lemon was good for a Laugh Like Much Of The Music here.This Disc is Like an Inside joke or Something.it Never Matches The Highs this Band has ENjoyed .	-1
Pretty much after John Mellencamp dropped the `` Cougar '' from his name things have not been the same . `` Big Daddy '' and `` Whenever We Wanted '' were panned big time , and the movie that Mellencamp would star in ( I forget the title now ) would bomb . With `` Human Wheels '' he would continue on the downward spiral as his vocals are shot on this album . Apparently the excessive cigaretts , and poor diet caught up with him here . The songs are anything but rocking which I know he 's capable of with classics like `` American Fool '' , and `` Scarecrow '' not to mention his debut album proves he can rock , but here it 's just not happening . There were only 3 songs that really stood out as good on this album , and that was the title track , `` Case 795 '' and To The River '' . The rest is just bleak as a cold , cloudy , Indiana day . I went through one of those I should know ; Indiana has a very cold air about it , and so does this album . It did n't make me want to rock it made me want to hide away in my room . The only other thing good on this is the album cover ... ..very risque . Perhaps it 's just coincidence that Mellencamp started to bomb after dropping the `` Cougar '' , but I would seriously consider this as a possibility .	-1
Tom , leave the schmaltz to & quot ; The Great White Way & quot ; . Absolutely , without a doubt , Tom 's worst effort to date . It simply is what it is , & quot ; Broadway & quot ; . To me , trying to listen to this album is completely impossible . Sorry Tom , you 're an artist of the highest order and I love all of your other work , but some times even the golden goose lays a rotten egg .	-1
First , people who loved CATS told me about the concept : a bunch of people dressed up as cats , moving in convincingly feline ways . It did n't sound that interesting to me . Then , they said that the music was great : so I listened to the Broadway cast recording and was mostly unimpressed ( see the next paragraph for commentary on the music ) . They said that the story was unique : a collection of children 's poems about cats by T. S. Eliot , but I was appalled that no serious attempt had been made to connect the poems together . Next , they told me you had to see the show to appreciate it , so I watched the PBS special a few years back . Again , I was not particularly moved . Now my friends tell me you can only get the full CATS experience by attending a live performance . Maybe they 're right , but I 'm not particularly keen about spending more money on a show I have tried so hard to love . Yes , the show deserves praise for its unique concept , but seriously , folks , what does it say about Western culture that the show that had the longest run in Broadway history is about a cat getting reincarnated ? Andrew Lloyd Webber is a talented guy , and some of the songs from the show are great , `` Memory '' and `` Macavity '' being the standouts . However , here is a classic example of Sir Andrew 's tendency to write through-sung musicals with insufficient melodic material : we hear `` Memory '' sung three separate times in the show , and other tunes , most notably `` Mr. Mistoffolees '' and `` Old Deuteronomy '' drag on and on , repeating the same lyric over and over again . Also , some of the melodies are not up to Sir Andrew 's usual standard , including `` Bustopher Jones '' ( which sounds surprisingly like the bridge section of EVITA 's `` Eva , Beware of the City '' ) , `` Skimbleshanks , '' and the torturously long `` Gus '' / `` Growltiger '' production number.My advice : if you love musicals , I guess you have to own a recording of CATS to make your set complete , since it merits a mention in musical theater history . ( Another gripe : the liner notes give little information about the show . ) However , if you can live without the full score , purchase an Andrew Lloyd Webber anthology including `` Memory . '' If you need something more , buy the video so you can see the costumes , which , in my opinion , are the stars of the show .	-1
CATS has always inspired a mixed reaction ... see some of the other reviews this CD has garnered.When I first saw the show back in 1982 , I felt it was a lot of hoopla over nothing . Oh , the original set in the Winter Garden theatre was sight to behold : The stage stretched out into the auditorium and the walls were decorated with junk yard trash..scaled to a cat 's eye view ( i.e . 2/12 times its normal size to give us a cat 's perspective . ) During the overture the & quot ; cast of cats & quot ; dashed about the audience flashing their bright eyes ... starling some and amusing others . Soon they were all up stage singing : & quot ; Jellicle Songs for Jellicle cats ... .Jellicle Songs for Jellicle cats ... .Jellicle Songs for Jellicle cats ... .Jellicle Songs for Jellicle cats ... .Jellicle Songs for Jellicle cats ... . & quot ; and I thought ... ok ... what 's the point ? I admired the dancing and the spectacle . But when all was said and sung , I could see no compelling reason for this show to exist . Some of the songs are quite catchy ( I prefer the American version of & quot ; Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer & quot ; , I rather like & quot ; Bustopher Jones & quot ; and & quot ; The Old Gumbie cat & quot ; ) but , after a half hour it starts to get boring because it 's not about anything . ( Story : Hal Prince was asked to direct the show and wondered what it was about . Was Lloyd Webber was trying to make some sort of political statement ? & quot ; Hal , it 's about cats ! & quot ; the composer explained . Exit Hal Prince ! ) By the time we get to the show 's big aria & quot ; Memory & quot ; so much tedium had set in , that as beautiful as the song is and as well sung as it was , I dreaded the endless applause fearing an encore would only keep us in the theatre longer . Happily the finale arrived and we are told ( finally ) what the point of this show is : & quot ; A cat is not a dog. & quot ; I lost three hours of my life to learn that ? ? ? Neither the original London cast nor the Broadway cast album include & quot ; The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles & quot ; ( though the number really has to be seen to be fully appreciated . ) The London cast has Elaine Paige as Grizabella while the American Cd offers Betty Buckley . The best bet is to go for the single CD of highlights from the U.S. production : you get all the best songs and none of the filler .	-1
John Mellencamp sounds tired and this cd sounds like a conglomeration of cuts that were n't up to snuff for earlier albums ( like `` Human Wheels '' which was bad in its own right ) .This is a very boring cd . There 's really only one song on here that I would really argue is a good song , and that is `` Wild Night , '' which is a cover song . The songs are so pretentious , the cd sounds like a joke , like what Jimmy Fallon would sound like if he were making fun of Mellencamp . With this cd you get what you pay for : an 80s pop star way past his prime in the 90s.I see very little evolution as an artist from Mellencamp . `` Another Sunny Day 12/25 '' is supposed to be meaningful , but instead it sounds contrived and forced , like instead of seeing something important and writing a song about it , he thought 'i need a meaningful song for this record '' and whipped this up . `` Dance Naked , '' is almost stomach churning , its so bad . `` Brothers '' is right up there with `` another sunny day '' as far as sounding contrived.Every song on here is forgettable , aside from `` Wild Night , '' and that 's because it is such a good song in its own right , not because of anything Mellencamp adds to song ( if anything its Meshell Ndegeocello that makes this song great ) . This is the most uninspired , pitiful album John Mellencamp has ever put out . It 'd be really good elevator music . But a very bad cd .	-1
Being a big fan of Mellencamp for years , I was taken aside by this album . The reason I do n't like it is not because it did not produce any hits , but I just felt it was very depressing and boring . I love John when he tackles gritty subjects , but on this album he seems to focus on matching the depressing message with bland untextured , boring melodies . Try another album , any other album !	-1
Compared to all their other great albums , this one totally bites . Even worse than the techno/hip-hop disaster of Filth and Dreams . This is the album that demoted them from being a world-wide popular act to being merely a cult favorite in Japan . Every song here is slow , meandering , unmelodic , unmemorable and ultimately unlistenable except as background music . They tried to reinforce their & quot ; hip jazz-lounge pop & quot ; credentials here and obviously made a small cult group of people happy who like that sort of stuff . But for the pop afficionados , check out SOS 's other efforts . The best song here , & quot ; Better Make It Better & quot ; is redone much better on the Shapes and Patterns album . It 's as if SOS was saying , & quot ; Gee , we really loused that great tune up on the last album . We better make it better this time. & quot ; Another note : Paul Stavely O'Duffy who usually produces the group is absent on this outing . His good judgment and skill is definitely missed here . This is like the Beatles making an album without George Martin . I only give this album 2 stars because even SOS at their very worst beats listening to gangsta rap and boy band garbage .	-1
The Where Are They Now award for 2002 would probably have to go to Ill and Al Scratch who scored big with & quot ; I 'll Take Her & quot ; and & quot ; Where My Homiez & quot ; back in 1995 . But then again , after that lackluster debut Creep Wit Me ( and another follow-up years later ) , few people would care what happened to them.Creep Wit Me has to be one of the most unoriginal albums ever made . First off , every track is either a spinoff of a remix of one of the two aforementioned songs ( see & quot ; I 'll Take Her -- Brian 's Flow & quot ; ) . Also , Ill Al Scratch are by no means good rappers , as shown on & quot ; Ill 's Solo & quot ; , but Al Scratch is a tad better than Ill. See the first verse of & quot ; I 'll Take Her & quot ; for a possibility of minor potential.In fact , & quot ; I 'll Take Her & quot ; is the reason why this album went from 0 stars to 1 . A clever use of one of EPMD 's lines from their & quot ; Jane & quot ; combined with Brian McKnight 's vocal makes for a good chorus . But that 's not enough to prevent this tape from keeping my window cracked open .	-1
I always considered myself the ultimate Donna Summer Fan..butwhen this long awaited Geffen release hit the air waves I knewDisco was over..I have never been so disappointed in an album..even though I remember the first time I heard Hotstuff its hard rock edge I knew things were changing ...	-1
love ciderella ... just ca n't see paying 70 bucks for a CD ... .The blah blah blah blah crap is just to get them to post this message	-1
More like descending , the first two albums are the ones to get from this band . Third one is where to stop .	-1
The only redeeming quality of this recording is the quirky final track , & quot ; His Immortial Logness. & quot ; The Orb descends once again into incomprehensible random , annoying noise .	-1
Coming off the high and the worlwide acceptance of Yes I Am , I was a bit taked back with this album . It seemed a little fluffy and very overproduced . I just did not feel a connection with her on this one . I did however like a couple of the songs that were hits on the radio , but other than that , I was dissapointed . But even though Melissa may have missed on a couple albums altogether ( Breakdown and Your Little Secret , you could never walk away from a Melissa concert without being inspired .	-1
What 's worse than a bad cd ? `` The Burdens of Being Upright . '' I do n't even know where to start . I bought it because I really liked the first song `` Mother Mother '' ( which is the only reason why Tracy Bonham even gets 2 stars from me ) ... and I was completely disappointed with the rest of the album . The songs are n't interesting and the whole thing all in all is just simply not worth the money . Unless its used and only costs like , two bucks . Actually , when I went to to trade it in at the record store , they only offered me 25 cents for it because they have so many copies of it and nobody wants them . And I took the quarter ! If you like grunge music , there 's a chance that you might like this , but you most likely still wo n't .	-1
I still have this CD and every once in awhile I pop it in to see if maybe by some miracle I am missing something in my opinion that this is the worst cd U2 ever made . Every time I do I just reassure myself that this is indeed the worst thing they ever put out . Innovative ? , Exciting ? , Dynamic ? No , just a boring piece of [ junk ] .	-1
Do n't let the die-hard U2 fans fool you . Borrow from a friend if you must . I think I 've listened to this twice since I bought it . Other U2 albums , hundreds of times . That says it all .	-1
YUCK ! This is total sellout time for U2 . What went wrong ? The world will never know . I guess that what happens eventually . It becomes a business and the passion to write great music fades away . DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM ! Pick up someting earlier like , & quot ; War & quot ; , & quot ; The Unforgettable Fire & quot ; , or & quot ; The Joshua Tree & quot ; , but not this album !	-1
Cutting through the b.s . here - `` Pop '' is not a techno album , and that is not why it is so rudely criticized and held in contempt by U2 fans . In fact , the trio of techno-infused songs that open the album ( `` Discotheque '' , `` Do You Feel Loved '' , and the stomping `` Mofo '' ) are the three best tunes on the CD . All pulsate with energy and sing-along choruses ( okay , maybe not so much `` Mofo '' , but it still rocks ) with Edge 's guitars charging in and out of the mix to create some truly interesting aural soundscapes . It does n't sound like `` Sunday Bloody Sunday '' , but you really do n't want it to either.What sinks the album is what immediately comes after that hat trick - a 9-song dullfest , mostly ballads , that just falls flat , with zero dancability and zero rockability . That 's not to say the songs are all bad . `` Staring At The Sun '' and `` Gone '' are soaring ballads cut from the same cloth as previous anthems like `` All I Want Is You '' and `` Bad '' , and both would 've been classics on any other U2 record ( in fact , both sound much better in the context of their inclusion on `` The Best Of 1990-2000 '' several years later ) . `` If God Would Send His Angels '' comes close to hitting that mark as well . But when those three admirable tunes are surrounded by ho-hum material like `` If You Wear That Velvet Dress '' ( the most boring song in U2 's catalog ) , and `` The Playboy Mansion '' ( hands down , the WORST song in U2 's catalog - this is their version of Billy Joel 's `` We Did n't Start The Fire '' , rife with awkward dated pop culture references set against elevator music ) , they 're not given a chance to stand out . `` Last Night On Earth '' desperately wants to rock but does n't , and `` Miami '' is sort of a Nine-Inch-Nails-by-way-of-Zeppelin fusion that tries to be both heavy and funky , and accomplishes neither . `` Please '' is a jazz-rock experiment released as a single many months after the album came out , and was heavily promoted in hopes that it would be the sleeper hit that would revive sales . Instead , it was the sleeper hit that just put everyone to sleep . Album closer `` Wake Up Dead Man '' is interesting in that it 's one of U2 's most overtly spiritual tunes , at a time when it seemed they 'd long abandoned that angle . The song relies on little more than a slow-moving Edge guitar riff that never really builds , and a heavily processed Bono vocal that finds him pleading to Jesus about the meaning of life . It 's not really a classic , not really a clunker , but either way , not enough to save an album that clearly collapsed under its own ambitions.U2 would wisely retreat to safer , more familiar ground for their next two records - `` All That You Ca n't Leave Behind '' and `` How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb '' , and then would find just the right mix of classicism and experimentation on `` No Line On The Horizon '' , but `` Pop '' was just too far off the beaten path for most fans , and now stands mostly as a curio in their vast catalog .	-1
I bought this CD because so many good reviews about it were listed , but man ! ! what a terrible dissapointment . This CD is just plain awfull and I think I have an eclectic music taste . This is TRANCE music , only one track remained in my collection and that was `` Chitagong Chill '' . The rest were trash.I should have known because I purchased `` Ha '' before , another Talving Singh CD and only one track was good on that one `` Mustard Fields '' . You really have to be spaced out on acid to get into any of this stuff if you ask me . I made myself a note to NEVER purchase another Talvin Singh CD . I do n't know how this got so many good reviews , so I had to cast my vote and try to balance the scales here .	-1
This album signifies all that is wrong with musicians today . The first few tracks were slightly interesting and almost beautiful , then you are dragged slowly down until you hit the off switch . The problem with modern music is the severe lack of talent . Tori Amos and Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto are the only talented artists of today , that I know of . I keep searching for more , but have n't found any . The Orb is so stupid , I am amazed they figured out how to record their noise , and then send it to a publisher ! They think they are terrific , so they torture you with a crazed preacher and 5 minutes of silence to make up for their terrificness on this album .	-1
I 'm sure that everybody has heard of Insane Clown Posse somehow in their lives , and the overall reaction tends to be a love/hate stance towards this duo . `` The Great Milenko '' is the group 's fourth full-length , but it is usually known as their best known work . However , I 'm going to have to break the ice here and give an honest review about this , seeing how this is n't as terrible as the 1-star reviews may suggest , but it 's definitely no masterpiece either.First off , when it comes to the MCs Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope , let 's face it , they 're not rhyming geniuses . Their flow is mostly a contrived way to be edgy in their songs , and some of the lyrics are so bad that you ca n't help but laugh at them . For example , let 's take an example from the first real song on here , `` Hokus Pokus '' , where Violent J gets some time to shine : '' Abracadabra boom shacka daeI 'm Violent J , and I 'm back like a vertebraeAnd I come with a hat full of tricksTrunk full of Faygo , car full of fat chicks '' And that is just a small taste of what the clowns have to offer . Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope really do n't get much better throughout the rest of the album . If it was n't for the decent production by Mike E. Clark and the humor displayed ( whether it would be the face-paint or whatever ) , this would have definitely got a one.Speaking of Clark , he 's not bad at what he does . The beats are n't completely interesting , but they manage to be good enough to fit the mood throughout . It 's not polished , it 's not professional , and it 's nothing like what you 'd hear on other fellow Midwest hip-hop releases likeCreepin on ah Come Up , but for what it is , it 's acceptable.So bad it 's good ? Almost , but sitting through this whole thing is practically the equivalent of huffing gasoline . Sure , it may seem cool to do and it will give you a buzz for a little while , but for over an hour 's worth , I 'd probably end up brain dead . Maybe it 's the fact that I 'm not `` down with the clown '' and I know that the Hatchet Man mascot is actually holding a meat cleaver , but this is right up there with other novelty albums likeHulk RulesandPlease Hammer , Do n't Hurt 'Em . Now that I come to think about it , why did n't MC Hammer gain a cult following while ICP managed to spawn millions of juggalos ? 3.5/10	-1
I was surprised this got so many stars ! It is very boring , one dull , slow , BOORRIINNGG song after another ! !	-1
Oh well , I guess artists have to grow . Unfortunately , Gino grew into something that I did not like . This album kinda sucks . It must be a Canadian thing because Rush moved from one ( terrific ) style to a good style too.I am not saying this album totally blows , it is just that I wanted more from one of my favorite artists . Looks like the gino-boat has left the dock without me . Still , there are lots of earlier fantastic albums from GV to fall back on and they are timeless and tireless .	-1
Being a long time fan of Janis ' music I looked forward to receiving this CD ; but I had forgotten just how different Janis ' music was after her four year layoff between & quot ; Present Company & quot ; and & quot ; Stars. & quot ; There is no comparison . What intrigues me though , is that Verve positioned Janis to be a one hit wonder and provided ( obviously ) terrible studio/technical support , and now that she is validated as a singer-songwriter they are glad to cash in . The only good song on this album is & quot ; Society 's Child , & quot ; and it plays better on her & quot ; Live at the Bottom Line & quot ; recording . Save your money for her later CDs	-1
I 'm sorry , but this album is horrible . The drastic drop in quality from the brilliant , affecting & quot ; Honky Chateau & quot ; LP makes it clear , in retrospect , that this is where Elton made the tacky transition from & quot ; Artist & quot ; to & quot ; Entertainer & quot ; . Sure , & quot ; Daniel & quot ; still sounds great ; but & quot ; Have Mercy on the Criminal & quot ; is just horrid , and & quot ; Midnight Creeper & quot ; is quite possibly the most embarrassing Rolling Stones imitation of all-time . And the rest just reeks of early-70s tackiness -- all dressed up in baby blue polyester suits with nowhere to go ... .	-1
First off , I am an EJ fan . I own everything he 's recorded . Nevertheless , I also try and be objective and this review is more for the casual/beginning fan who may not be familiar with Elton 's entire catalog . That said , Empty Sky is very much an album for Elton enthusiasts . It 's a sort of curio piece ( or artifact ) that only rabid EJ fans will find listenable . In truth , Empty Sky 's only value is the glimpse it shows listeners of Elton 's origins . Skyline Pigeon , is the one worthy track on this thing . From failed psycadelia ( Empty Sky ) to dull , cheerless , false antiquity ( Valhalla , the Scaffold ) , this is an effort that reflects the times ( late 60 's ) and Elton 's attempt to compete with all of the other once popular ( and now utterly forgotten ) & quot ; time capsule & quot ; , mock-atmospheric oddities such as Procol Harum or the Moody Blues . Elton was very much trying to find himself , musically , and he had n't yet realized his true gift : the ability to pen unbelievably catchy pop songs .	-1
If it werent for the 3 add on songs it would be 1 star , nice to sleep to though	-1
When 11-17-70 was originally released in April 1971 , it was significant for showing those who were buying Elton 's records but had n't yet seen him live that he was just as incredible a performer as he was a songwriter ! This album may not have succeeded in its mission , but only because its sales paled in comparison to the slew of other Elton albums released in 1971 -- Tumbleweed Connection , the Friends soundtrack and Madman Across the Water . 11-17-70 also had vinyl bootlegs to contend with , many of which included the entire radio concert from which the album was culled , as opposed to the mere six songs on the official release.Until this album was remastered by Elton 's ( mainly ) 70s producer , Gus Dudgeon , it was Elton 's greatest live album and one of his best albums overall . In April 1971 , people could clearly hear the mania in his singing and playing ; indeed , every piano note came to the surface with aggressive abandon . Elton 's non-verbal exclamations were also in abundance , as were multitudinous audience screams and clapping . Until Gus remastered it , 11-17-70 had a quality that increased one 's heart rate and level of exhilaration before the first song was over ! But Gus has erased the excitement by lowering the brightness of Elton 's piano , muffling many of his non-verbal exclamations as well as those of the audience and erasing much of the clapping . What a horrible disappointment ! I would advise anyone interested in hearing this album who owns a functioning turntable to seek out the vinyl . If all you 've got is a CD player , try the Polydor CD . Forget about this remaster !	-1
Ok I 'll make it shortIt is toooooooooo bad , the worst ever made by Bon Jovi , never think of buying it , I bought it in 1995 when it was released , and it is on the shelf since then.I did not find even one goos song on this record , or even close to being good , all song are slow and sound the same , no song rocks , so spicial things , how ever if you wonna listen to Bon Jovi buy any other album like Crush , Slippery when Wet , Keep the Faithdon waste your monyEven the one star is much more than this album deserves	-1
[ I ACTUALLY RATE THIS 2.5 STARS , NOT JUST TWO . ] Def Leppard 's first greatest hits CD , ranging from 1981-1995 . ( NOT 1980 , as suggested on the cover . There are ABSOLUTELY no songs present from their 1st album , `` On Through the Night '' , which is by far one of their best albums ever ) I 've never been a big fan of greatest hits packages because , in my point of view , they usually fail to capture the band 's essence . Def Leppard is one of those disappointments . Do n't get me wrong ; Def Leppard is a great rock band which survived some turbulent times . However , like Skid Row 's greatest hits ( which had virtually every song written by the bassist , so you would hardly find any songs on there written by other bandmembers ) , this one features many songs mostly written by producer Mutt Lange , which is a shame because there was A LOT of material not present on this album.With that said , I still recommend getting this . It will still get you hooked onto Def Leppard despite the bad tracklist . After all , `` Photograph '' got me hooked in the first place . I 'd get it used , though , because more than 12 bucks is NOT worth this.Here 's the tracks : '' Pour Some Sugar on Me '' - good song . I have no complaints here , even it being the first track . `` Photograph '' - Let 's face it , Photograph ROCKS ! Great song . As said above , it got me hooked to Def Leppard . `` Love Bites '' - one of the best of their ballads . Great chorus . `` Let 's Get Rocked '' - even though this song has some of the DUMBEST lyrics ever , it still rocks . I never was a fan of Adrenalize , but I 'm glad this one 's here . `` Two Steps Behind '' - this is the acoustic version . Not bad , BUT THE ELECTRIC VERSION IS WAY BETTER . This one does n't capture Leppard very well . `` Animal '' - I never did like this track at all that much , and even though it was a hit , they should 've replaced this one with my favorite from Hysteria , `` Gods of War . `` `` Foolin ' '' - A very good ballad . I 'm glad it 's here . `` Rocket '' - I like this song , BUT THIS IS THE RADIO EDIT . What 's worse , they could 've fit the original ! That ticks me off . `` When Love & Hate Collide '' - this one 's actually new . It 's a ballad , but I never really liked this one . It just does n't sound like Def Leppard , and therefore , DOES NOT BELONG . `` Armageddon It '' - Great song , no complaints . `` Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad ? '' - A ballad off of Adrenalize , but like `` When Love & Hate Collide , '' this one is n't that great at all . Suggestion : Replace it with `` White Lightning '' and/or `` Tear it Down , '' also from Adrenalize . `` Rock of Ages '' - Great song , no complaints . `` Hysteria '' - I really like Hysteria , but this one does n't capture the band 's essence all that well . `` Miss You in a Heartbeat '' - Another ballad ? ! Not bad , but could 've been dispensed for other songs , like maybe from the first album or my personal favorite from Pyromania , `` Die Hard the Hunter . `` `` Bringing on the Heartbreak '' - Another ballad , yet again . I really like this one , but UNFORTUNATELY they took off the Switch 625 instrumental piece that this song fades into . SHAME . Steve Clark must be rolling in his grave now.All in all , this is definitely not one of the best greatest hits CDs ever . They should 've made a Double Disc set . THAT would 've pleased the Def Leppard fan much more . This song caters more towards the Hysteria/Adrenalize crowd , which is quite a shame because 1 ) Pyromania is their BEST album , 2 ) On Through the Night is an excellent piece of metal history and it has hardly any pop influence whatsoever AND IT 'S EXCLUSION IS ALMOST INEXCUSABLE , and 3 ) For some of the really good songs , they cut essential parts from them . As such , this is disappointing to the extreme . My suggestion is to buy the individual albums , but if you feel the need to get this , I 'd get it for a low price .	-1
I really like to try to keep an open mind to exploring different styles of music . However , this greatest hits compilation by Def Leppard shows this band to be mediocre at best and unlistenable at their worst.It starts with their lead vocalist . The man just screetches and scratches his way through nearly every song especially the hard rockers . The man hardly even tries to sing . The sond comming out of his mouth is more like a drunken yell . Now I like my share of hard rock n roll singers . David Lee Roth has personality and style , Paul Rodgers has blues and soul , Ian Gillan brought power and range in his prime . Heck even Vince Neil from Motley Crue added an edgy bluesy style with some colorful vocalizing . This lead singer ( Joe Elliot ? ? ) brings nothing but an annoying yell and a half baked effort.As for the instrumental support , it is just the same from track to track . Guitar solos devoid of any passion or soul . Both these players just try to solo as fast as possible without adding any color or tone to the notes that they are playing . The drumming is fairly steady but limited in regards to special effects and style . In addition , there seems to be a synthesized effect that is just plain annoying on most of these tracks . By the way where is the bass player in the mix ? He is barely heard from in the mix of the annoying crunching guitars and the over used synthesizer . Gosh these guys mine the use of the synthesizer with the exact sound effects through nearly every song.Now the songs do have decent structures . There are verses , a chorus ( sort of that is if you count repeating the same words over and over again as a sufficient and memorable chorus ) , and on some occasions even a bridge . However , the little stylings that exist on great recordings by the Beatles , Stevie Wonder , and The Who and even good recordings by Van Halen and Paul Rodgers era Bad Company are just non-existent on this greatest hits compilation . And the lyrics are just so basic that they do not sound any more mature than a teenage bar band just starting to write their first songs . That is when you can decipher the words that Old Yeller is screaming ! ! ! ! ! ! Out of fifteen songs on this compilation , only Live Bites and possibly Bringin ' On The Heartbreak seem to be even a little memorable . Whereas ballads like Missin ' You In A Heartbeat and Two Steps Behind do n't offend me , they just do n't compare with even similar material written by the reasonably melodic Bon Jovi.Fans of eighties hair metal and synthesizer drivel should probably bypass this review and just buy this compilation or maybe even Hysteria . Maybe I just can not relate to the mindset of that era . But those who appreciate music with quality songwriting , good singing and instrumental prowess should avoid this compilation and anything by this band like the plague .	-1
So sad that Kiss were so desperate at this point in their career that they felt compelled to do the unplugged thing and display the logo of corporate deathsucker MTV on their album . Sure , it 's great to see Ace and Peter back in the fold , but is three good songs worth buying this dreck for ? It 's nice to hear the acoustic treatment of songs like & quot ; Comin ' Home & quot ; and & quot ; Rock And Roll All Nite , & quot ; and Ace 's cover of the Stones ' & quot ; 2000 Man & quot ; is welcome in any form , but & quot ; A World Without Heroes & quot ; ? Give me a break . Based on the reception this album got , the band decided to reform for one more tour ( or was it two or three ? ) with the greasepaint and while it initially seemed like a good idea , they soon wore out their welcome , playing by my best count at least three & quot ; final & quot ; shows in the U.S. alone . Especially tragic when I think how much guff I took for loving Kiss in high school back in the 1970 's . To quote Ian Hunter , & quot ; It ai n't easy when you fall. & quot ;	-1
At first you got a good impression from this album , if you 're a real KISS fan , like myself . You like the new versions , find they to be & quot ; nice & quot ; . THen , you sudden realize how empty this initiative was , totally imersed in commercial interests together with MTV . All of a sudden , you realize that this was not a product deigned to please the fans or the deliver goo dmusic ; it was just a last breath of air to earn some more money . Advertising Criss and Frehley back , when they only fature in three songs , was also a swindle . Very disappointing ...	-1
This is a very good soundtrack from a really great film ... however , if you are expecting to hear ALL the songs as they were performed in the film , you may find yourself a little dissapointed . For example , the John Lennon song `` Beautiful Boy '' is the original version by Lennon himself , not the version that was performed by Richard Dreyfuss in the film . Do n't get me wrong , I love John Lennon 's version and I consider it one of his best ... but this is not the version from the film , and it would have been nice to have the Dreyfuss rendition here because it was so delightful ! The same can be said for the song `` Someone To Watch Over Me '' . The CD does not include the beautiful movie performance by Jean-Louisa Kelley . Also dissapointing is the complete absense of the song `` Stranger On The Shore '' , the tune that Mr.Holland is teaching to his student , Gertrude Lang near the beginning of the film . There was not a complete enough , or good enough version of this song in the film to include here , but in this case , the original hit version by Acker Bilk would have fit in very nicely . However , I give this CD 4 stars because it is still very enjoyable to listen to from beginning to end !	-1
Track # 12 on this album , & quot ; An American Symphony ( Mr. Holland 's Opus ) , & quot ; which was the resounding , resonating and shivers-up-the-spine-sending capstone of a very heartfelt and moving piece of cinema eponymously titled , does n't move the listener at all here , except to thrash himself vigorously for tossing his dinero away foolishly ; is this really the ORIGINAL soundtrack from the ORIGINAL film ? The answer alas can only truthfully be & quot ; NO . NO . NO. & quot ; This is n't the original filmtrack at all ( at least not from the film I enjoyed at the theatre in 1996 ) ; not the same mix ; here we have , at best , & quot ; Mr. Holland 's Opus Manque. & quot ; Sorry , gentle listener -- This recording is bogus , lackluster , jejune , muddy and muddled , inauthentic , a big mistake to purchase . Who produced this deceptive , uninspired spool o ' dreck ? Mr. Holland himself would be mortified . ( Track # 12 honestly sounds like it was mixed in a coffee can . ) Do n't make the same mistake I did , fellow audiophile ; My advice : Rent the wonderful movie on videotape or DVD and record the soundtrack you desire off of THAT . Do n't buy this miserable knockoff , unless you have an inescapable urge to be sonically chagrined .	-1
Was disappointed that it did n't include the Mission Impossible theme I heard at the end of the movie . Good orchestral sequences , but only for the classical at heart !	-1
There are only a few great hard rock bands from the seventies . Deep Purple , Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath come to mind . Kiss is not even in that league . It 's showbiz rock and Kiss Alive is the perfect example of this.It 's one crappy `` live '' album even though it has been revealed they pieced this thing together using studio enhancement . Many of the vocals and guitar parts ( bass included ) were re-recorded in the studio as well . Paul Stanley is on record admitting this.Buyer beware.Looking for a great live `` HARD ROCK '' album ? See Deep Purple 's `` Made In Japan . `` No overdubs , no edits , no fake cheering , just a great band doin ' their thing .	-1
outside of the original artwork there really is NO REASON TO OWN THIS period ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this is a ca $ h grab as usual , god i remember back in the 70s and early 80s when i could really respect ki $ $ but since the mid 80s its all been about the money , really since the beggining its all been about the money , any real fan knows ace and gene barely played on this record in the first place , anyway these two are so out of control they both plan on retiring soon ( within the next 5 years or so ) and having themselves replaced by others wearing there make up , im serious that is why paul has been saying the past few years how fans of the yankees dont mind who is playing as long as they are in pinstripes , how nice , they retire , collect most of the money while they have some ki $ $ wan na bees out doing there work , ill really be suprised if the fans fall for that crap but then again i was suprised the fans went along with tommy thayer in aces make up so who knows , anyway from 1974 to 1984 THAT WAS THE TIME TO BE A KI $ $ FAN ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .	-1
False advertising or bad quality control ? Either way the people that pre-ordered this for the bonus material/2nd disc as it was advertised got fooled . Many did n't even know until they got it in the mail . 2 weeks prior to the release they stopped taking orders for the `` Deluxe 2cd edition '' . I do n't believe the explanation that some have given , blaming Amazon for getting their info from `` unofficial '' sources . Amazon is selling a lot of their cds so I 'm pretty sure they 're getting info directly from the record companies on pre-orders . Did someone at KI $ $ corp see how much interest there was in the unreleased demos & decide to hold them back for future re-re-releases of the entire set ? I 'm very disappointed in the current state of this band that I once considered one of my favorites .	-1
First let me state that I have been a KISS fan since 1976 and I have stuck up for them through albums like Unmasked and The Elder ( which I actually like ) but , me being a fan for so many years did not prepare me for the $ 9 I spent on this CD . What a let down.Sonically , it fatigued my ears . The re-worked vocals and brightened guitar parts were barely noticeable at first but , by the time God of Thunder started , my ears hurt ... I found myself turning the volume down repeatedly through out the whole disc.The re-worked bass and the tightening of the drums was decent but , in my opinion , the first press CD or the 1997 re-master would be a much better choice.I thought the Ozzy remaster of Blizzard of Oz was bad but , this beats it by miles . I laughed at the part in Bob Ezrin 's linear notes that stated he fixed a problem that was vexing him from the original recording session - then challenges us to find it . Really ? Just listen to the first few measures of `` Flaming Youth '' ... Perhaps it was how it was originally recorded that limited them to what they could do . Bob Ezrin went into great detail in the linear notes explaining how he only had a 16-track recorder back then and that the guitars were paired up in stereo as were the drums , thus limiting what he could do . Notice I said what Bob could do - not KISS.KISS should have put they 're cash heavy , lazy butts back in the studio and reworked some of these parts - that would have made this CD a real treasure .	-1
I have been a fan since BEFORE the original release of this album . To `` remix '' it and market it is a travesty against the fans of this band who ( me included ) shell out the bucks for damn near anything with a KISS logo . I still remember the horror I felt when I first heard the `` remix '' of Detroit Rock City without the car crash and the poorly dubbed in `` Get ups '' and `` Get downs '' during the symphonic guitar solos.Hollywood has gone so far down the rabbit hole that they now resort to remaking moderately good films from the 80s ( Total Recall ? Really ? ) because nobody can be original any longer . There comes a time when the fans need to draw a line in the sand . Maybe this is it . You want to give me a NEW Destroyer ? Re-record it with the current line up . Let Tommy and Eric sing a couple of tracks ( Flaming Youth and Beth maybe ) . But STOP SCREWING WITH MY MEMORIES !	-1
The second live album is in my opinion the worst of them . If you are lookng to add this cd to your collection , borrow it from a friend first- listen to it and maybe it will grow on you . I am a devout KISS fan and though i have it , it is one of the least KISS cd 's I play .	-1
This is not the worst , but it comes close . I really think the only good one was Ace Frehley.Only RadioActive is any good . It is not a heavy album . People wishing for heavy metal are going to be very dissapointing.Gene hired a lot of help , and it still sucks . I think this is his worst material ever written . This set the road for the Elder , that is when Kiss 's popularity sunk to an all time low .	-1
Gene Simmons seem to believe his solo album was the best , as well as the most liked . I would say that Simmons recorded the least exciting album of the four Kiss members . The opening `` Radioactive '' is the album 's highlight . The Beatles sounding `` See you tonight '' and the quite rocking `` Burning up with fever '' are better than the average , but when it comes to the closing `` When you wish upon a star '' , I certainly wish that Simmons would shut up - it 's plain awful . The overall impression is that it 's rather lame and the material is in fact quite weak more than occasionally . Simmons sure have a talent for business , but he surely think too much of his musical skills .	-1
I have no idea what Gene was attempting to pull off with this album , so for all I know it was n't an attempt , he was successful . But I hope for his sake it was more like a failed experiment . Kinda like a mix of chemicals sitting on a Bunsen Burner and exploding into a fireball of badness . I hate to focus on negatives in my reviews , but I feel it 's necessary to steer the unwitting clear of this one . I think that it 's fairly obvious just by reading the ( breif ) liner notes what can be expected . We see that an orchestra is credited , and then the appearances by Donna Summer , Helen Reddy ( ! ? ! ? ! ! ) , and Cher . Yeah , overproduction , overextension , and ultimately overblown . I 'm sure Gene had a big role in & quot ; Music from the Elder , & quot ; too . There is an interesting parallel here . Not that I could do any better , but really , we expected much more from you , Gene .	-1
I heard Gene thought his solo album was the best of the four . Oh really ? Only the song `` See You in Your Dreams '' saves this effort from sinking to a one star rating . After listening to all 4 solo albums ( on vinyl ) again after 25 years , it is way `` too '' easy to see why Kiss went downhill after Ace 's departure . Paul 's effort is solid , but only a shade above ordinary hard rock . And bless Peter for trying . This ? You 'll maybe listen to it once all the way thru ; that 's if you do n't keel over laughing during the final track . The sound samples here are all you need to convince you .	-1
Of all the solo 's released under the kiss flag this ranks dead last ! Gene was in a & quot ; special.place & quot ; I guess when he decided to do these tracks . The highlight of this effort ( if there was an effort ) is radioactive . After listening to that song move directly to track 5 true confessions . then to track 10 to re visit the rock and roll over album with see you in our dreams . then turn you player of and put the disc in the collectable column.In a word ... .delusional	-1
By far the worst blemish of all the Kiss records . Peter 's solo album is horrid . I first picked this album up at a flea market back in the early 80 's and I probably paid a buck for it and I still feel like I was ripped off . This could be the best dust collector you could ever get !	-1
Do n't be a completist and feel you need to have all 4 of the Kiss solo albums . Peter Criss ' is horrible . Kind of lounge music meets sappy ballads and all poorly done . Sounds nothing like Kiss or anything that should be associated with any of the band members . Gene , Ace , and Paul are all good . Avoid this CD .	-1
In September of 1978 , all four members of KISS simultaneously released solo albums . This is the album by the drummer . It 's not too good , in my opinion . `` That 's the Kind of Sugar Papa Likes '' is fun , in a dopey kind of way . And `` I 'm Gon na Love You '' is decent , but the rest of the album is n't very impressive . The cover version of the early-'60s classic `` Tossin ' and Turnin ' '' pales next to the original . But the ballads are especially bad . For members of the KISS Army only .	-1
WHYY ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? This album sent Kiss into the gutters for years . It was made for the wrong reasons . Kiss was always the anti-disco and they did this . I would n't recomend this album if your looking for rightous rock.The only reason it deserves 1 star is because of Ace and his kick ass playing .	-1
Another album from Kiss ' unfocused period , and it definitely shows . The pop/disco trend began with the previous `` Dynasty '' album where producer Vini Poncia stripped away some of Kiss ' rock edge . `` Unmasked '' finds Poncia back again at the helm , adding even more gloss and sterility to the proceedings , resulting in a very tame and limp-sounding album.Peter Criss was already out of the band and recording his first post-Kiss solo album `` Out Of Control '' at the same time as `` Unmasked '' ( although he is still credited on the album ) ; session drummer Anton Fig , who also sat in for Criss on most of `` Dynasty '' was again behind the kit for this album while Kiss searched for a replacement for Criss . Several months later , Paul Caravello was hired as the new Kiss drummer , and soon changed his name to Eric Carr.On `` Unmasked '' , the sound is so slick and glossy that you could slip and see yourself falling all at once ; the opening track `` Is That You ? '' finds Paul Stanley trying to be David Lee Roth vocally , and the results are somewhat embarassing . The remainder of the album does n't fare much better ; the colorless ballad `` Shandi '' finds only Paul Stanley and Anton Fig playing on it . When Kiss released `` Shandi '' as a single , it became a huge hit in Australia , but flopped everywhere else.Ironically , it 's Ace Frehley who again pitches in and practically saves the album , contributing some of his best material since his 1978 Kiss solo album , such as `` Talk To Me '' , the excellent `` Two Sides Of The Coin '' , and the quirky `` Torpedo Girl '' . Unfortunately , Vini Poncia 's glossed-over production takes all of the hard rock edge away from even these songs , and they sound equally sterile and lifeless.Paul Stanley definitely embraced the disco phenomenon full on by contributing the wimpy `` What Makes The World Go 'Round ? `` , `` Tomorrow '' and `` Easy As It Seems '' , all of which would 've sounded perfect in a disco or roller skating rink . Meanwhile , Gene Simmons again seems to be lost in the shuffle for the most part , emerging only for the lame `` She 's So European '' , the halfway decent `` Naked City '' and the poppish , synthesizer-fest `` You 're All That I Want '' .Apart from Ace 's songs , I do n't care much for this ; it does n't sound at all like a Kiss album , and unfortunately , this would only be the tip of the iceberg in terms of where Kiss was headed . They would hit an all-time low point with their next album , the disastrous `` ( Music From ) The Elder '' , and all but lose their entire fan base .	-1
KISS ended the 70s on a high note with their disco-pop tinged `` Dynasty , '' ( 1979 ) which contained the massive hit `` I was Made for Lovin ' you . '' By the end of their first decade KISS were one of the world 's biggest bands , with millions of loyal followers . And in addition to their mostly adolescent male following , the mainstream public were buying KISS albums and going to shows as well . KISS concerts were now family friendly and KISS were no longer feared or dangerous . But while KISS hit a homerun with `` Dynasty , '' and reached the pinnacle of their commercial fortunes , the cracks in the foundation were beginning to show . As KISS entered the new decade they hit a crossroads as to what KISS meant and for whom were KISS playing ? While `` Dynasty '' was a smash , the KISS ARMY was growing disenchanted with the band 's overtly commercial direction . `` Dynasty , '' for all the criticism it received , was fairly successful at balancing commercial pop with hard rock , the follow-up album , however , `` Unmasked '' ( 1980 ) titled the scale in the direction of the former.Simply put , with `` Unmasked , '' KISS did n't make an album that their loyal fans wanted to hear , and they probably did n't make an album that they themselves wanted to make . With `` Unmasked , '' KISS made an album that they thought the general , record buying public would want to hear.While other KISS albums have embraced trends ( pop-metal in the 80s , grunge with `` Carnival of Souls '' ( 1995 ) ) KISS has usually written memorable songs that rock . It is not the case however , with `` Unmasked . `` While `` I was Made for Lovin ' you '' was an obvious attempt to jump on the flavor-of-the-month bandwagon , the song was so incredibly infectious with such a great hook , it worked . In addition , most of `` Dynasty '' rocked pretty hard , so KISS is given a free pass for their one trend-hoping single . `` Unmasked , '' however , is filled with nothing but lightweight , disco-pop . The entire album sounds forced and disingenuous . To be fair , most of the songs are well-written and crafted , but the over-the-pop glossy production , Tom Jones cringe-worthy lyrics , and lack of any real hard-rocking songs makes `` Unmasked '' a very mediocre album . Add to that the fact that by 1980 disco was on its way out . In short , KISS was a day late and a dollar short to make such an overtly-trendy album as the disco-pop pap that is `` Unmasked . `` Perhaps KISS 's biggest mistake in writing/recording `` Unmasked '' was their decision to collaborate with Vincent Poncia and have him produce the album . While many of these songs have potential , they are ruined by Poncia 's unwelcome and undeserved input . You can bet that if past KISS producers Bob Eznrin or Eddie Kramer had been at the helm `` Unmasked '' would have been a much stronger album . `` Unmasked '' actually starts out on a strong note with the cynical , forceful `` Is that you , '' ( McMahon ) which is one of the only songs on the entire album with any real balls . While `` Shandi '' ( Stanley/Poncia ) was a moderate hit and somewhat of a fan favorite , I do n't particularly care for it . It represents everything wrong with this album ; overly glossy , commercial , saccharin drivel . Ace Frehley 's `` Talk to Me '' is n't bad , as it 's well-written , but much like the rest of the album is a casualty of a slick overproduction . `` Naked City , '' ( Simmons/Bob Kulick/Castro/Poncia ) along with `` Is that you '' is one of the album 's highlights , as it rocks pretty hard with a good hook . `` What makes the World go Round '' ( Stanley/Poncia ) is another clunker , sounding like something Olivia Newton John would have recorded and is somewhat of a rehash of `` I was made for Lovin ' You . '' `` Tomorrow '' ( Stanley/Poncia ) is a decent pop song and an obvious would-be single . Ultimately , however , it 's just forgettable . Frehley 's `` Two Sides of the Coin '' is one of the album 's better songs , although it lacks the bite of Ace 's past contributions . `` She 's so European , '' and `` Easy as it seems '' ( Stanley/Poncia ) with their unwelcome synthesizers , disco-trimmings and corn-ball lyrics are embarrassingly awful . Frehley 's `` Torpedo Girl '' is another song with potential , but is ruined by its glossy production . No small wonder that Poncia is credited as co-writing the song . While the closing number `` You 're all that I Want '' is n't a KISS classic , it 's not bad . But what would be filler on `` Love Gun '' stands-out on `` Unmasked . '' Still , Simmons singing the lines `` My heart belongs to you and no one else '' and `` You 're the only women that I ever loved '' is as insincere as it is laughable.While `` Unmasked '' went gold ( 5000 , 000 ) copies , it was the band 's first album since `` Dressed to Kill '' ( 1975 ) that failed to reach platinum ( one million ) status.While `` Music from the Elder , '' ( 1981 ) `` Crazy Nights '' ( 1987 ) and `` Carnival of Souls '' ( 1997 ) have all had their detractors , and are said to be the band 's weaker offerings , I have always stood by those albums . In this writer 's opinion , `` Unmasked , '' along with `` Hot in the Shade '' ( 1989 ) are the weakest albums KISS ever made . Poncia 's slick production and unwelcome contributions , the band 's obvious attempt to jump on a dying trend , and just plain lack of good songs make `` Unmasked '' fall far below KISS 's usual standard.It should be noted that although Peter Criss is credited as the drummer , he did not play anything on the album . Ghost drummer Anton Fig filled in for the Catman 's shoes.If you are just a casual fan , give this album a pass , as it 's only recommended for die-hards and fans wanting to complete their KISS collections .	-1
Kiss ' Unmasked was recorded in 1980 . After the release of & quot ; Dynasty & quot ; , Peter Criss had left the band even though he was still on the cover . Kiss began to expierence inner turmoil after the song & quot ; Beth & quot ; was released in 1976 . Peter Criss 's head got too big and he forgot what he really was , a drummer.The solo albums are a good indication of a band falling apart.Peter had told his bandmates he wanted to go solo and leave Kiss . Gene and Paul begged him not to leave and they suggested that they all do solo albums just to make him happy and keep him in the band.When & quot ; Dynasty & quot ; was about to be recorded Peter again threw an ultimatum at Gene and Paul and said he would leave the band again if they did n't use Vinnie Poncia ( Peter 's solo album producer ) to produce the album . Gene and Paul let Peter have his way.Peter left the band after the & quot ; Dynasty & quot ; world tour and Kiss was left to pick up the pieces. & quot ; Unmasked & quot ; is a very strange record for Kiss . The sound is very poppy , very radio friendly.Some of the songs on it are good , but they just do n't have that Kiss sound like & quot ; Hotter Than Hell & quot ; or & quot ; Rock and Roll Over & quot ; .I am a huge Kiss fan . I love Kiss , but when all is said and done and rock and roll history is written , & quot ; Unmasked & quot ; will not be remembered as one of their best . If you love Kiss , buy this album . If you want a good Kiss album let me suggest & quot ; Alive & quot ; or & quot ; Destroyer & quot ;	-1
Maybe I 'm missing something here but I 'm having an awfully hard time swallowing the notion that this is a `` classic '' album , let alone a good album . Maybe it 's being raised in a household where prior Kiss albums were played 24/7 ( at least when Kiss Alive was released-now THERE 'S a classic album ! ) . But anyway , I remember a good friend of mine ( a HUGE Kiss fan ) bought this album over my house one day ( we were in our sophomore year in high school ) and played it for me . I vividly remember his look of disgust on his face and my utter disappointment with the music . He asked me if I wanted the album for ANY other album I wanted to get rid of ; I refused . He sighed and we spend the rest of the afternoon listening to Kiss Alive and playing my Atari video ( sad , but true ) . I have n't heard the album since ( and have no desire to ) .Since then , my interest in Kiss 's music waned and I discovered other bands ( and other genres of music ) . I still respect the hell out of them ; they gave me MANY moments of happy memories that will last a lifetime.Back to this album , though . If people actually like this album , great ! More power to them . Still , let 's have a REALITY CHECK ; If Amazon had a poll to list the most popular Kiss album ( let alone being the most enjoyed ) , do you honestly think that this album would come ANYWHERE near the top ? Of course , not . And for a VERY good reason.If you want to listen and judge for yourself , at least go to a music store where you can listen to it first before you buy it . I honestly feel you could spend your hard earned money elsewhere , like ANY Kiss 's albums before it ( and some albums released later ) .Keep the peace !	-1
The boys went out on a limb with this one . In my opinion this was less of a KISS album and more of a producer exerting too muchinfluence ... It happens . I do like a few of the tracks though you will probably never hear them again . & quot ; I & quot ; was good , and of course , & quot ; A World Without Heroes & quot ; . They ventured too far from what made them great during the 80 's but they figured it out and came back from the brink . This is one that is kept purely for historical record by the hardcore fan .	-1
... ... .. about how mad I was after I first heard this record . That was definately my `` say it ai n't so , Gene ! '' moment . The first Renaissance- ( or was it Baroque ? ... Middle Ages ? ? ) inspired notes are played on a flute ! Immediately your jaw drops and you check to see that the label on the CD says the same thing as the CD cover . You check to see that this is a Kiss album and your worst fears are confirmed ... ... ... it IS ! ! This is concept rock gone horribly wrong . This is like when an otherwise cool guy asks a girl out on a date to a Bon Jovi concert , and instead at the last minute diverts the car for a behind-the scenes tour of the local library just out of weird inspiration , and only he knows why . The `` concept '' supposedly has something to do with a boy rising to the occasion to go on a King Arthur-like quest to find ... ... what ? ? Who knows ? ? At the end of the CD you still do n't know and do n't care . There is one really good song on here , actually -- `` The Oath '' . It makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up . The rest makes you want to go out and do what Ace Frehely actually did after they recorded it -- find a good solid wall to throw it against and let her fly . If you like Kiss out of their element , just pretend like you never saw this one and pick up Dynasty instead .	-1
Kiss puts forth a great musical effort on this one , especially Eric Carr and Ace Frehley , who plays some of his best solos despite is unhappiness with the band 's direction at the time.The lyrics and the story are confusing and seem incomplete . There are n't any real hooks or sing-along type songs here . Kiss fans like it because we 're Kiss fans ! If you 're willing to give it a few fair listens , it 's actually a bit intriguing . The sound of the hottest band in the world completely alienating their audience ! The best tracks are Ace 's 'Dark Light ' and Gene 's 'A World Without Heros . 'If you 're new to Kiss , go for the ALIVE ! albums , 1-4 . If you do n't like Kiss , then why the hell are you reading album reviews ?	-1
Gene Simmons took pot shots at Emerson , Lake and Palmer for being too serious in terms of musicianship.Here , we have Kiss trying their turn at serious musicianship with less than stellar record sales.Not so easy is it guys ? Kiss is an act , that happens to play music.No serious musician listens to Kiss to steal licks or technique.They do however love to steal the business model that made these guys famous and rich.Kiss 's stab at serious concept music is a bit like Stallone trying to do Shakespeare.Not a good fit.Their niche is party music that glorifies sex , drugs and rock n ' roll.It may not play well with their egos , but it does so with their bank accounts .	-1
First of all , I love KISS . I own this album and always will , simply because it 's a KISS record . The truth is ... .this blows big time . It 's not useful for anything other then completing collections . This is the worst idea Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley EVER had . Ace and Eric wanted to do a heavy metal album to make up for the `` Unmasked '' disaster . Good ole Gene and Paul said `` nope '' , `` were doing a concept album ! '' The songs do n't make any sense and do n't connect . The concept seems very similer to the `` Zelda '' nintendo games . When this record bombed , Gene and Paul knew they had blown it again . This is the only KISS record that did n't at least go gold . They decided to do a good metal album and returned with `` Creatures of the Night '' in '82 . By then , the fans were gone , and a good album went ignored . KISS would have to remove their trademark makeup to get their fans to pay attention in the 80 's .	-1
If you like alt./grunge , you will like this album . This is Def Leppard 's first album to break from the pop metal scene . They were pressured by the public and most likely their record label as well to do something `` new '' or `` different '' . So here it is . Here 's your `` different '' . Not too bad , not if you like alt./grunge bullcrap , but this is NOT my cup of tea . Nor is it to most Def fans , especially to those who are fans of earlier releases like `` Pyromania '' , `` Hysteria '' , or even `` Adrenalize '' .To us , this does NOT cut it . Def Lep 's first two albums were real generic , hard rock-type music . With `` Pyromania '' and up to this point , DL was with the pop metal scene , and that 's the Def Leppard we have all come to know and love.Few of the tracks are actually worth listening to more than once , if even THAT . The few exceptions to that ( but do not expect old style Def ) , would be `` All I Want Is Everything '' , `` Blood Runs Cold '' and `` Work It Out '' . This album also features the debut of Vivian Campbell ( Whitesnake and Dio ) on the band , Def Leppard ( not the best album to start with , but Vivian is a great guitarist , no doubt ) . `` Slang '' is desperately trying to be hip while completely ignoring its original fan base . Def lost enough of its fans with `` Adrenalize '' which could never hope to live up to the expectations people had after `` Hysteria '' , especially with the loss of longtime guitarist Steamin ' Steve Clark . But with `` Slang '' ... please skip this record . Check out Def 's latest , `` Euphoria '' , an EXCELLENT return to form . There are a couple of tracks you might want to skip , yes , but it does n't sound washed up , or like it 's re-hashed . If you want GOOD new Def Leppard , buy `` Euphoria '' , by all means , BUY EUPHORIA.Skip `` Slang '' -- again , ONLY if you like alt./grunge bullcrap . If that 's the case , well then , it 's not that bad . Damn good , actually.Peace , bros. ( ... )	-1
In the beginning , Def Leppard was a heavy metal band that wrote some great songs every once in a while . After two albums in the musical line of New Wave Of British Heavy Metal ( & # 65533 ; On through the night & # 65533 ; and & # 65533 ; High & # 65533 ; n & # 65533 ; dry & # 65533 ; ) that featured some great material , the band moved gradually away from heavy metal to pop metal and in end & # 65533 ; just pop ! On & # 65533 ; Slang & # 65533 ; Def Leppard are just uninspired and they give us a bunch of lame songs I easily can do without . On the previous & # 65533 ; Adrinalize & # 65533 ; , it was clear that Def Leppard tried to do another & # 65533 ; Hysteria & # 65533 ; but failed completely . There & # 65533 ; s no doubt that & # 65533 ; Adrinalize & # 65533 ; was a bad album , but & # 65533 ; Slang & # 65533 ; is even more awful . And while I & # 65533 ; m at it , singer Joe Elliot have to thank his lucky star ( Mutt Lange ? ) that he & # 65533 ; s still in the music business , because he has never been and will never be a good singer , and can you imagine that guitar player Vivian Campbell once did & # 65533 ; Holy diver & # 65533 ; together with Ronnie James Dio ? I tend to ask myself what Def Leppard want & # 65533 ; are they in it just for the money ? It & # 65533 ; s a mystery that it & # 65533 ; s ( almost ) the same band that once gave us songs like & # 65533 ; Sorrow is a woman & # 65533 ; , & # 65533 ; Wasted & # 65533 ; , and & # 65533 ; Lady strange & # 65533 ; among others . Now , it & # 65533 ; s even too late to quit with some dignity left !	-1
just like the title cut it was Bizarre that OMC even blew up in the first place.very boring & amp ; a one trick pony through out.VH1 awaits them in a very few short years .	-1
if ever there was an appropriate title for an album , this was it . `` Elegantly Wasted '' was an album that was just uninspired . trying to capture on what made INXS special , this album misfires and wanders aimlessly . at this time in the 90 's INXS had become irrelevant . the previous album `` Full Moon , Dirty Hearts '' was a sorry experience as well.It was not for lack of trying that INXS released this album , but time had been unkind to this band as the 90 's turned its back on anything 80 's and INXS was not spared . Sadly this was the last album that Michael Hutchence would record with INXS.Thankfully , `` INXS Rockstar '' helped show the world that INXS is one of rock 's greatest bands and their legacy is secure.if you are new to inxs , this album is not for you ! start with `` listen like thieves '' , `` shoobah shoobah '' , `` the swing '' , `` kick '' , `` X '' and `` Welcome to Wherever You Are '' as these are possibly their best work .	-1
... other than Donna Summer 's double-whammy of `` Last Dance '' and `` With Your Love '' ( both of which can be found on Donna 's 12 Inch Collection ) , this soundtrack mostly consisted of subpar material from established disco acts - especially when compared to what the Bee Gees contributed to Saturday Night Fever.Given their reputation as pop balladeers , the Bee Gees initially seemed like a rather odd choice to anchor a disco soundtrack - that is , until you heard what Barry Gibb brought to the table . As everyone already knows by now , Barry was at his creative peak and the Bee Gees wildly surpassed anyone 's expectations - since 1977 , Saturday Night Fever still bears the distinction of being the best-selling movie soundtrack of all time . Not so with this dud.As the joke goes , this was one of those LPs that shipped gold to the retail outlets only to be eventually shipped right back platinum to Casablanca Records . Although the critics loved to bash this movie , there 's no denying its appeal as a guilty pleasure to watch and is far more entertaining ( and replayable ) than this turkey of a soundtrack . Do yourself a favour and get the movie instead .	-1
Be prepared to waste nearly an hour of your life . Hanson 's MIDDLE OF NOWHERE is where this CD ought to be . Pure pop pablum , regurgitated without a hint of creativity , this CD might best have been marketed for pre-teens . Along with the Backstreet Boys and Spice Girl media blitzes of the mid-90s , MIDDLE OF NOWHERE marks a low water mark for Western Civilization .	-1
Back in the beginning , before they were the rock idols that they are now known as , RUSH , wasnt ' all that great , or good for that matter . Coming off as ZEPPLIN want to be 's , this group was a long way from sounding the way they do now . Guitars screaming , Geddy screaming , and I 'm screaming , to a hard rocking cd , with some good songs . But for the most part it comes up short . Finding My Way , is by far the best song on the cd .	-1
Classic rock bands such as Led Zeppelin , Van Halen , Black Sabbath , and Deep Purple all had really strong debut albums . Rush did not . The lyrics on this CD are all very amateurish , especially the lame rocker In The Mood . John Rutsey is an okay drummer but he can not hold a candle to Neil Peart . Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee show promise as the great musicians that they are but the album comes across as too Zepellinesque . The only worth while song here is Working Man . The band did have to start somewhere and they did get better . This is for die hard fans only .	-1
There are some things in life which I will never fully understand ... advanced calculus , bionuclear physics , and how certain people can possibly give this album 5 stars . I keep thinking that it has to be some sort of joke , yet as I read the reviews I find out that , no , the reviewers were quite serious and ( appeared ) sober when they wrote them . That is a shame , because there is very little to like about this album.Very little progress , musically , has been made since & quot ; Rush & quot ; , their first album . With & quot ; By-Tor and the Snow Dog & quot ; , you have them attempting one of the multi-part rock epics which they would be known for in the late 70s . The keywords being & quot ; attempted & quot ; and & quot ; LATE 70s & quot ; . This is 1974 . They simply were n't there yet . Sprinkled throughout this album are enough annoying riffs to make Angus Young 's hair stand on end . And when they are n't annoying , they 're flat-out bad . Consider the ending of the first movement of & quot ; By-Tor & quot ; . Horrible ! And Geddy ... my goodness , the English language fails at attempts to find words to describe Geddy 's vocals on this album . Obviously having not yet found his singing voice , Geddy resorts to a variety of yelps , screams and shrieks to get his point across . At times , it 's more listenable than others . Other times , the listener may require earplugs.Overall , this is simply a BAD album . When you listen to this album , think : & quot ; This is the same group that recorded songs such as & quot ; Freewill & quot ; , & quot ; Spirit of Radio & quot ; , & quot ; YYZ & quot ; , & quot ; SUbdivisions & quot ; , & quot ; Time Stand Still & quot ; , & quot ; Red Barchetta & quot ; and many more . It almost does n't deserve to have the name & quot ; Rush & quot ; associated with it . Giving it 5 stars is an insult to fans of & quot ; Moving Pictures & quot ; everywhere .	-1
From about the 40 second mark of the very first song on Rush 's second album it 's clear that there 's been an upgrade in the drumming department with the addition of the great Neil Peart . Fly By Night is a decent and daring leap , in terms of the music , the arrangements , and the lyrical ventures ... .but still to only marginally better results.Despite the concentrated effort to do something more than three-minute single-type songs found on their debut , the best songs on the album follow the simplest formula . ( I think there 's a good reason history best remembers Working Man and Fly By Night from these two albums ) . While a noble effort to shake things up in an epic way with the enumerated length of By-Tor & The Snow Dog , and all its sub-chapters , the result reads like a musical hodge-podge rather than a cohesive bit of musical narrative . Lots of interesting things happen in spots , musically , but very little of it inter-relates well and it kind of smacks of arrangement experimentation rather than true vision . But it 's only their second album and Rush is n't done with the Roman numerals opuses either.Songs like Anthem improve on the guitar formula set up on their debut album , culminating in the record 's strongest tune and title track , Fly By Night . And a tune like Making Memories explores further the acoustic prowess of Alex Lifeson , and this shapes itself into a really underappreciated little gem in Rivendell . ( Break out your copy of Lord Of The Rings and hit mute on the tv and let this tune be your ethereal and wistful soundtrack ) . Mark that down ... Rivendell is my first-proclaimed Rush hidden gem , reviewing these albums in order . No one mentions this tune and for shame.End result ? A good ( not great ) step forward with clear efforts towards diversifying their sound ( both acoustically and with their arrangements ) and adding theme to their lyrics versus having to listen to Geddy talk about `` chicks . '' ( Whatever you think of Rush 's occasion pretense when it comes to lyrics - whether waxing on about `` unrest in the forest '' with a straight face or crossing the river Styx , you have to admit it 's better than listening to Lee talk about sex ) .	-1
IT 's hard to say anything negative about any Rush record here , because in an instant all their so-called loyal fans will detonate your review with dozens of `` not helpful '' votes ... . BUt I 'll write what I think about this album , anyway ... And I 've got all Rush studio albums ... THis album is simply not good . Since the review rating-scale in Amazon puts a maximum of five-stars , it 's not fair to rate FLY BY NIGHT as high as MOVING PICTURE or PERMANENT WAVES . It just does not make any sense , unless the reviewer thinks that EVERY Rush album is a five-star album , and that 's insane , I think ... FLY BY NIGHT is annoying . It has Geddy 's still not singing up to his potential and , instead , resorting to screaming . It has bad guitar riffs all around . Alright , Peart soon makes his presence felt , but that 's not enough to forget the fact that is still not the RUSH that people all around the world would come to know and love and adore . I 'll resume as this : if RUSH had stayed in the path demonstrated in this album , they surely would not be known nowadays ...	-1
Other than the first track , CARESS OF STEEL , this is a limp cd . Two over drawn out rock operas , and , besides Carress , not a decent stand alone song on this waste of money . This one a very few bad rush cds .	-1
What is up with the Rush cult ? Why worship a band that possesses all of the vices of Progressive Rock , but retains precious little of Prog 's virtues ? The constant time signature shifts , mythical ( i.e. , incomprehensible ) lyrical subject matter , stuttering drum rhythms , mammoth riffs , etc. , had been done to death years before this pile of garbage was even released . What does Rush have to offer anyway ? What have they ever done that Gentle Giant , Jethro Tull , Frank Zappa , Genesis or King Crimson have n't done infinitely better ? Gee , you can probably tell that I 'm not a Rush fan . Still , this album is tedious by any objective standard . Imagine the most banal Aerosmith or AC/DC riffs married to inane lyrics of the Yes variety . Mix into this brew some ( very ) gratuitous and textureless soloing & ensemble work of the workaday Dream Theater ilk , as well as some castrato vocals that recall Robert Plant in heat or Bon Scott in a torture chamber , and you have Caress Of Steel.To save time , I 'll point out the disc 's relative virtues : there 's some good drum work on The Fountain Of Lamneth , there are parts on The Necromancer where Geddy Lee does n't sing , and Caress Of Steel is n't a double album . That 's about it . Do yourself a favor , and listen to Gentle Giant 's Octopus , Zappa 's Uncle Meat , Jethro Tull 's Thick As A Brick , or King Crimson 's In The Court Of The Crimson King . After listening to these , you 'll have to wonder what 's so `` progressive '' about Rush .	-1
Well , I have the & quot ; BAstille Day & quot ; version contained in ALL THE WORLD 'S A STAGE & quot ; , so I did not buy this album , because this song is the only worthwhile moment here ... Geddy 's voice was never more annoying than in this album . The two & quot ; epic & quot ; pieces are boring and unfocused . Of course we find a lot of great musicianship , after all we 're talking about Geddy and Neil here ! ( Let me tell you a little secret : I Never liked PEart 's lyrics . They are dumb , disconnected , they have no rhythm when Geddy sung them . The classic songs would be much better with other lyrics ) .Anyway , most of RUSH fans swallow anything they do . I do not .	-1
ALL THE WORLD 'S A STAGE is , from a production viewpoint , the best of Rush 's four live albums to date . This 1976 concert was recorded with superb mixing and sounds authentic . Later Rush live albums were tinkered with in the studio after they were recorded , resulting in a `` live '' recording that sounded nothing like the concerts they were supposed to capture ( 1988 's A SHOW OF FANS is infamous for this ) . However , the downside of ALL THE WORLD 'S A STAGE is that it only includes material from their first four studio albums , an era that is seen by many fans as immature compared to their output of the early 1980 's and later.ALL THE WORLD 'S A STAGE is by no means bad , it just is n't as good as Rush came to be a few years later . There are hints of their future skill in Neil Peart 's drumming and Alex Lifeson 's improvisational guitar work . The rendition here of their concept-rock breakthrough `` 2112 '' sounds all the more exciting in a live context because the listener knows that the band is doing this in real-time and is n't going back and spicing it up . The concert 's opener `` Bastille Day , '' flows better live than on their album CARESS OF STEEL.The low point of ALL THE WORLD 'S A STAGE are Geddy Lee 's vocals , which are n't as smooth as they came to be circa 1981 , and the tracks from the band 's first album , the self-titled RUSH , released in 1974 . These songs , written before Peart joined the band and took over songwriting , suffer from lackluser imitation-of-Zepplin lyrics.Because it included few tracks that came to be the favourites of Rush fans , I 'd recommend saving ALL THE WORLD 'S A STAGE for last when completing your Rush collection . Unless you are indeed a fan of their first four studio albums , this will provide little entertainment . It does , however , score points for great production .	-1
This album gets two strikes for me , the sound quality is absolutely terrible . Like the band picked any random night on the tour and decided to release it as a live album . Secondly the songs are , for me , terrible . I will never be a fan of Rush and a subpar sound quality sound recording is unlikely to change my opinion , if you 're looking for an introduction look elsewhere , if you 're a fan of the band , invest your money in a higher quality audio live album .	-1
One of the great unsolved mysteries of rock : how can the same album contain a song as great as `` Xanadu '' and a song as bad as `` Cygnus X-1 ? `` `` Xanadu '' is indeed a brilliant composition : classically constructed and confidently played , it 's my choice for Rush 's best epic song ever ( even ahead of `` 2112 '' ) . Drummer Neil Peart 's lyrics paint an exquisite portrait of Kubla Khan 's pleasure palace ( with significant borrowing from Samuel Taylor Coleridge ) ; Geddy Lee manages to control his still-maturing voice enough to convincingly deliver the melody . The band segues seamlessly from one unforgettable riff to another , with dramatic synthesizer parts stragetically sprinkled throughout . It 's 11 minutes of pure prog rock bliss ; once it 's over , you 'll wonder where the time went.The album contains another authentic Rush classic , `` Closer to the Heart , '' a lovely 3-minute ballad that foreshadows the band 's eventual trend towards shorter and more concise songwriting.But the rest of this stuff ! After repeated listenings , I still can not determine why `` A Farewell to Kings '' is so revered by hardcore Rush fans . The longer tracks are as undisciplined and unfocused as `` Xanadu '' is tasteful and tight . The most egregious example is `` Cygnus X-1 , '' with shrill , screechly vocals by Lee and interminable , self-indulgent riffing by all three members . Rush fans are going to kill me for saying this , but this track actually sounds worse to me with each listen . `` A Farewell to Kings '' captures an extremely talented and ambitious band in a transitional phase , still unable to channel their virtuosity for the length of an entire album . The record is definitely worth owning for `` Xanadu '' and `` Closer to the Heart ; '' just watch out for the rest of the songs !	-1
This record 's been around the block a couple of times and even a quick glance here at the other reviews tells me folks out there think the world of Rush but I gots to say first off the dude up front comes way too close to sounding like a cross between a chipmunk and a Muppet . And it 's not just the alarming Marc Bolan on helium vocal delivery either , the lyrics themselves made me get up and rummage round for alternative footwear . Shoes really if you must know , very nearly brown ones . I honestly do n't think I 'm kidding about this -- Hemispheres too I 've bunged in the Toshiba more than once , well away from that unspeakable cover -- so if we could somehow selectively expunge Geddy Lee 's excruciatingly cartoonical bleating we might just have ourselves here a right crunchy bunch of Canuckleheads .	-1
There have been correct criticism that the first Rush live album `` All the World 's a Stage '' was of poor sound quality but at least it sounds and feels live . `` Exit '' is too perfect and too sterile . I want to hear some ad libs and audience participation in a live album : i.e . Lizzy 's `` Live and Dangerous '' , UFO `` Strangers in the Night , and Deep Purple 's `` Live in Japan '' . Each of those three feel like you are in a concert , worts and all . There is very little difference between the studio and `` live '' versions in Rush 's `` Exit '' . Avoid .	-1
I suppose it was inevitable with a band such as Rush that their long and varied output would attract different groups of mutually antagonistic fans . It seems a change of direction takes place on average every three albums , and it was wise move to preview `` Permanent Waves '' on the `` Hemispheres '' tour otherwise a few more of us sad sci-fantasists might have fled in terror . ESL takes up not much more than 4 years and not much less than a million light years from where `` All the world 's an over-used quote '' left off . The political incorrectness of the mid 70s has been all but swept aside in favour of the smoother sounds and more sophisticated production of the new decade . Unfortunately a live album is not the place to come if you want to admire the production and the generally slower-paced `` Moving Pictures '' did not prove a particularly succesful hunting ground for material to perform live . There is nothing here which does n't sound better as a studio version . Probably an even less pleasant listening experience than the deeply horrible `` Grace Under Pressure '' ( see seperate review ) and even more pointless .	-1
i bought this Rush album , not knowing what any of their music sounds like . I do n't really like 80 's music , so this cd was n't my favorite . I am not really bashing this cd , it 's just not my kind of music . I 'm sure if you like this kind of music , it is the Sgt . Peppers of this genre . So if you 've never heard this music before , give it a listen , and then if you like it , go ahead and buy it .	-1
Ever listen to something that was about as fun as being stuck on the John ( porcelain throne ) for 3 hours ? Well I think that accurately describes the experience of listening to this 1982 Rush album called Signals.Fans can be convoluted sometimes . This is not a good album . The band members themselves hate it . It was SO AWFUL that immediately after this was released they fired Terry Brown , a man who had produced and crafted a wonderful relationship of 8 years and 8 studio albums with.Reader be forewarned ; my thoughts on this sonic bowel movement differs greatly fromthe majority of reviews on this website . Come to think of it , I really do n't understand how the majority of fans can honesty be handing out 4 and 5 star reviews to Signals . Something is awry here . Simple put , Signals is the first blunder Rush ever hatched . It 's like a pile of fresh fecal matter after a bad meal that you were disappointed in and wished you just stayed away from . Unfortunately unlike fecal matter , this record will still be around . I do n't know how on god 's green earth they released something as magnificent sounding as Moving Pictures only 1 year prior , then release this P.O.S . Up until this point , Rush never put out anything that would be considered `` unlistenable '' , however in 82 Rush surprised everyone when they released this god awful bowel movement from their musical bum-bums . The album cover art even depicts a dog going to the bathroom right on the front . I suppose that was an indicator for what would be inside ... So , what went wrong ? I 'll tell you what.Ther4e are 2 big reasons why this record is so bad.1 ) This has to be one of the worst 'sounding ' albums that 's ever graced my ears . And when I say sound I am strictly talking about the production/mixing here . After the first listen I though my CD was defective , literally . Every song on Signals has this awful fuzzed , washed over harsh feedback sound going for it . Nothing is clear sounding at all . Terry Brown MUST have been drunk or on serious illegal substances here , because he really dropped the ball in the knob twisting department . All of the instruments except for the vocals and keys are terrible under mixed , poor Alex is submerged in excessive tasteless synthesizers because Geddy has n't learned how to play them yet . Thank Jesus he took some lessons after this because his keyboards were much better on GUP.So the record sounds like complete $ h ! t.2 ) Lack of songwriting . I know most will think I am blaming Neal for this but I 'm not really . The lyrics themselves are pretty good . Not his best but there are some literary jems in there like Subdivisions , The Weapon and Countdown . But on a sonic level the songs just sound boring . The arrangements just lack any sort of excitement and you just sooner wish then record end rather then listen to this $ hit . It 's as if The boys just wanted to rest on their laurels with Moving Pictures and phone it in for the rest of their career . Way to be lazy guys ... .the hunger , creativity and passion you heard on 2112 and Permanent Waves is long gone . I 'm serious here , could n't they have tried a little harder ? It 's Rush after all , their smart guys and good with their tools I would of expected something better then turds like The Analog Kid Or Digital Man.Simple put this record should have never existed . It 's that bad . I find it crazy that this actually made it past a record company and made it to music store shelves . Whats even more crazy is that it was put out by Rush . Thank Satan that they were able to recover and put out 2 great records after this ( GUP and Power Windows ) that would help deodorize the $ h i t stench left over from this disaster .	-1
Well , Rush WAS a great combo of both progressive and hard rock in their heyday . Signals was a slight downturn from Moving Pictures , but Grace Under Pressure slides further . In the 80 's ( worst musical decade thank you very much ) everyone was obliged to make their stinky & quot ; robot man & quot ; album full of synthesizers and sci-fi themes . It got overdone to death and this album is no exception . Synths ( sequenced in live shows ) take over leaving Rush not even sounding like a power ( what power from here on ? ) trio at all ; a trend that continued for many a dull album . However I always liked & quot ; Kid Gloves & quot ; ; it has great tricky time changes and maybe Lifeson 's best guitar solo ever . Overall , not their absolute worst ( Roll The Bones is a few down the line ) , not the best , not recommended .	-1
Signals was acceptable , but nothing could follow Moving Pictures . After Signals , Rush had a decision to make - be a very good rock band or a barely tolerable pop band . This album reflects the choice they made . Any decency that Rush had previously , died with this album . It took them down a road they would never recover from . There is nothing cool about this album , except Peart 's lyrics , which are always at least intelligent . The music is boring with no passion at all - but it looks like the fault lies with Geddy Lee , who took over too much on this album , plus Alex Lifeson forgot how to play the guitar . The problem with longevity in bands like this is they run out of steam , creatively and otherwise . Rush is no exception , what little energy is on this album is stupid and uncreative . There is no drive and no good songs , bottom line . Who cares about intelligent lyrics when it 's being sung by a dated singer with a Miami Vice jacket on with no clue anymore about how to put energy into a song ? Edit : 2006 -Vapor Trails totally and utterly resurrected this band . So I have to take back when I said `` they would never recover . '' They did , thankfully , but I still maintain that Grace Under Pressure was the beginning of the worst period of Rush . And now I feel a little bad about calling Geddy Lee a `` dated singer '' , but this album just killed this band for me for many , many years . I 'm very happy they 're back to form .	-1
Rush were my ultimate favourite band ... until this album came out in early 1984 . My first album was & quot ; All The Worlds A Stage & quot ; ( still one of the great HM - yes , HM - live albums ) and got all of their others with great abandon . The prior release & quot ; Signals & quot ; was a departure , but a very well-executed one with lots of heart . That is precisely what this album lacks . Cold , clinical , with oh-so-trendy 80s Mattel electronic percussion , Lifeson playing with a guitar strung with 6 high-E strings and no bass on the amp , Geddy becoming so enamoured with keyboards he basically forgot that 4-string lump of wood around his neck . I remember the band being very arrogant about it in interviews around this time , saying they really did n't care if their fans liked it or not . Except for & quot ; Distant Early Warning & quot ; and & quot ; Between The Wheels & quot ; , this is where Rush ceased to be Rush , trendsetters , and became Rush , trend-followers : Let 's stop being Rush , let 's be U2 , Tears For Fears , etc. , as long as no-one recognises us as a ROCK BAND ! They wo n't on this album . They have partially redeemed themselves since , but I gave up on the band after this vinyl abortion .	-1
Rush 's 1985 album POWER WINDOWS ranks among the band 's lowest points . Released smack-dab in the middle of the controversial `` synth era '' of 1983-88 , the album contains a number of elements which alientated fans and annoyed listeners.The synths are indeed the weakest spot of POWER WINDOWS . Bassist Geddy Lee was fascinated by keyboards and MIDI technology at the time and nearly every song is based on some experiment or another with synthesizers that either sound horribly dated or amateurish . Neil Peart 's lyrics here are risible . Ridiculous lines like `` I see the Middle Kingdom between Heaven and Earth / Like the Chinese call the land of their birth '' are abundant on POWER WINDOWS . Peart wrote each song to be an insight into power , thus the title . This is an intriguing idea but unfortunately falls flat . The structure of several songs make no sense , here synth-rock , then suddenly screaming guitar solos which sound as if an entirely different song has cut in . Finally , Hugh Syme 's art design deserves mention here as one of the strangest and most visually unattractive of Rush 's career.POWER WINDOWS does have a few bright spots . Alex Lifeson 's guitar skill was at its height in 1984 and 1985 , resulting in some awesome riffs and solos before his capabilities mysteriously disappeared after this album . Neil Peart 's drumming is lackluster compared to former albums but occasionally shines . `` Manhattan Project '' , about the mad race for the atom bomb and its terrible effects on the civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and `` Mystic Rhythms '' are both solid songs that may not make the album essential but give a reason to frequently take it down from the shelf if one already has it.All in all , POWER WINDOWS should wait until you 've already bought most of Rush 's other albums , which are generally superb . I 'd recommend 1984 's GRACE UNDER PRESSURE above this as an example of how the band could combine their prowess in traditional rock instruments with synths .	-1
Power Windows ' biggest flaw is that it is too polished , and lacks any warmth . The synths and the electronic percussion remove any organic feel it might 've had , and the final finish is high-gloss ( and , to my hearing , sterile ) .On the plus-side , Geddy sings this album really well , and there are some really interesting bass & guitar lines here and there.The song-writing itself is mixed.The top-tier songs include BIG MONEY , which is a good song , catchy , well-crafted , etc. , and MARATHON , the best song on the album , with good bass , good melody , and lots of drive . MARATHON 's problem is ( again ) that it is over-polished . Geddy 's vocals on the two ending choruses are so doctored , they made him sound like Hannah Montana . Take a listen to MARATHON on Show of Hands , and you 'll hear the difference . It 's a great song ruined by PoW 's high-gloss finish.MIDDLETOWN DREAMS & MANHATTAN PROJECT make up the second-tier songs . Each has good lyrics , and is reasonably well-crafted , though not particularly great or memorable.As for the rest , there 's not a lot to say - they 're over-polished , and poppy.MYSTIC RHYTHMS is a decent slower song , but lacks anything special.EMOTION DETECTOR is a sappy bit of work which tries to fill a pop-niche.GRAND DESIGNS has good moments , to be sure - a couple of neat guitar licks , and few interesting turns of phrase in the lyrics , but it falls smooth and glossy . When its over , there 's little to hang on to.TERRITORIES is one of Rush 's few songs that is simply not that good . The lyrics are preachy , the music is dull and lifeless , and it 's way too long for what it accomplishes.Interestingly , Rush has only played 3 songs off Power Windows since 1990 ( Big Money , Marathon , & Mystic Rhythms ) , and then only one tour each . This is in the days of 3-hour sets and lots of b-side tracks from other albums being played . What does that tell us ? Power Windows is not horrible . It 's just that unless you like a really polished , pop-ish sound with a lot of synths and electronic percussion , you will not be satisfied with this album . Instead , look for a more organic-sounding Rush with stuff from the 70 's , 90 's and 00's.2 1/2 stars .	-1
This is the worst Rush album ( cd ) I 've heard so far and I 've heard most of them since I 've been a fan of the band since 1977. what were these guys thinking when they put out this out ? ? ? only the first two songs sound any good . I bought it cheap from here and after listening to it about six times I decided to trade it in . `` Live In Rio '' is also another Rush album ( cd ) that is not worth buying as you can hear the audience in every song . why they recorded it this way is beyond me but it was a dumb thing to do .	-1
I am a huge fan of Rush , but this album is their worst , with Presto being a close second . Forgettable songs , lacks fire like their great 70 's and 80 's albums . They really do `` hold their fire '' . The only decent song on the whole album is Time Stand Still . If you want to get into Rush , DO NOT START WITH THIS ALbum ! I ca n't believe how many good reviews this album got , it is horrific . It 's almost as if Rush did n't even try to write great songs on this record .	-1
Do n't laugh : it 's right here on track 3 of this album . Yes , the most cringe-inducing lyrics in rock music are firmly set down here . After all , if it were n't for the wisdom of Neal Peart , how would we ever know that : 'A spirit with a visionIs a dream with a mission . 'Or that : 'Nothing can survive in a vacuumNo one can exist all alone . 'If you 're wondering how Peart manages to play the drums and stroke his chin at the same time , here 's how : 'I find no absolutionIn my rational point of viewMaybe some things are instinctive ... 'Or here 's another profound observation : 'Folks are basically decentConventional wisdom would say . 'Or try this for grammar : 'How they suffered about it ! 'I 've heard of people 'suffering from ' something or even 'suffering with ' something , but 'suffering about ' ? Such lyrics might be bearable if they not also being squeezed through the helium balloon of Geddy Lee 's voice . There 's a track on the 2007 album 'Snakes and Arrows ' called 'Malignant Narcissism ' . Rush did not have to wait until 2007 for that : on track 9 of 'Hold your Fire ' you 'll find Lee crowing that'I stood on the top of the mountainAnd China sang to me . 'Me , me , me : thousands of years of history and 1.5 billion people , all singing to Geddy Lee and the self-absorbed lyrics forced upon him by Peart . Sigh ... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Any yet , and yet ... I ca n't deny that my whole reason for buying this CD was to replace the tape I had about fifteen years ago while I was in college . At the time I really like Rush 's melody . One 's distaste for such lyrics grows stronger as the years go by , and still I find that if I can tune out the words , the actual music the band made remains lively and listenable . So , in summary , I think it 's fine that Lee , Lifeson and Peart are still playing : it 's just a shame that Peart is still writing . But for that - if I may employ a Rushism - I could probably see past Lee 's singing voice .	-1
If you do n't know Rush , it 's better not start with this one . It has some good songs ( & quot ; TIME STAND STILL & quot ; and & quot ; PRIME MOVER & quot ; ) , but the general effect is weak , tasteless and boring . It 's a & quot ; plastic & quot ; album . Proof of what I 'm saying : Not even one of the songs of this album were included in RUSH 's triple live album & quot ; DIFFERENT STAGES & quot ; , which covers the entire career and phases .	-1
After `` Power Windows '' , it sounds as though Rush did n't quite know what to do -- they 'd taken their synth sound as far as it could go , with mixed results -- `` Power Windows '' was totally synthesizer driven . `` Hold Your Fire '' begins a transition back in the other direction.Indeed , the opener , `` Force Ten '' , features keyboards only as highlights , its a great tune , lots of fire and power to it , and some monster bass playing from Lee . Lifeson uses a totally clean guitar tone for his rhythm playing , and the song even has a reasonable ( if brief ) guitar solo . Do n't get me wrong , I enjoyed many of the synth-driven songs , but hearing the band settling into a groove on this one is great.The sort of clean-tone guitar/groove feel with highlight synths and stunning bass playing keeps up with `` Time Stand Still '' -- this is the first Rush song in a long time ( `` Lakeside Park '' maybe ? ) that reflects internally rather than externally -- a great little tune about enjoying the moment.The album continues largely in this direction -- Lee 's bass playing and a personal viewpoints are largely the focus -- songs like `` Open Secrets '' ( with a great mid-tempo melodic guitar solo from Lifeson ) , `` Lock and Key '' , `` Turn the Page '' ... there are some that drift in theme , `` Second Nature '' for example , but as a rule , they all have that same feel -- clean tone guitar , great bass playing , synth emphasis , mostly mid-tempo . In fact , that would be my big complaint with this album , it does n't really have much variance on it -- there are some great songs , the first couple I pointed out , `` Lock and Key '' is superb , `` Mission '' may well be even better , its certainly one of the great songs , but the lack of variety on the album has the effect of blending them together.I actually enjoy the album , but its lack of variance makes me rarely reach for it .	-1
It 's hard to believe that the same magic heavy band that bring 2112 , FAREWELL TO KINGS and CARESS OF STEEL are the creators of Hold your fire ... In my opinion , this is the most uninspired moment of ALL RUSH career ... There some ok songs like force ten or open secrets , but the rest could be associated to lame 80 's pop bands ! Really love RUSH , but this is not a good rock album ! ! !	-1
Is it communist ? I like FORCE TEN and OPEN SECRETS . The rest is either sort of okay ( TURN THE PAGE ) or , let 's say , not at all okay ( TAI SHAN ) .I love Prague rock *and* Canadian power trios , but even the mighty hosers in Rush can make a weak record . Look , I 'm not happy about it either , okay ?	-1
The first REALLY unlistenable and downright irritating album from RUSH.I Know that some of you might think that this trio jumped the shark with *Signals* , but thats not true at all . They put out two underrated masterpieces in 84 and 85 in the form of *Grace Under Pressure* and *Power Windows* , so i am more of a fan of their so called `` synth '' -era . Then in 87 they release this abtrosious album of 'easy listening ' on our asses . GOD ! WHAT AN AWFUL ALBUM ! I still will give it two stars thou ' for Force Ten , which is the only salvagable tune on this train-wreck . In fact it is one of my favorite RUSH songs , but too bad it had to be on this album of crap.Simply put , they ran out of ideas and started scraping the bottom of the barrle . The whole album sounds directionless and completely uninspired , thank god they reinvented themselves with the next album , *Presto*.Save your money . This thing is cruel , stealing your hard-earned cash for 50+ minutes of unmemorable vomit . I can safely say that this is easily the band 's worst album , by far .	-1
As has been tradition , `` A Show of Hands '' is the live album after the third set of four studio records by Rush , and like the last batch , emphasizes the most recent material . Excluding the intro and the drum solo , four songs are from the last two albums ( `` Hold Your Fire '' and `` Power Windows '' ) , two from `` Grace Under Pressure '' , and one from `` Signals '' . 'Oldies ' this time around are `` Witch Hunt '' from `` Moving Pictures '' and `` Closer to the Heart '' from `` A Farewell to Kings '' .As an experience goes , this show is a bit too clinical for me to enjoy -- Rush had really mastered replicating their studio sound on the live records , combining that with the somewhat artificial nature of the material ( due to its reliance on synthesizers ) , and the experience is a bit lifeless . In many ways , this is the same complaint I had with some of the material in their studio versions.There are exceptions , of course , `` Marathon '' and `` Turn the Page '' vastly superior to the studio version in my assessment , and there are several songs here -- `` The Big Money '' , `` Mission '' , `` Force Ten '' and `` Red Sector A '' come immediately to mind -- that are extraordinary in their composition ( and their performance ) . Overall , however , this album is fairly superfluous , if you 're a fan , you probably already have it , if you 're not , this may not be altogether necessary .	-1
This really captures the essence of Cinderella : the worst kinf of glam ever made , along with Stryper , Ratt , Poison , Motley Crue , White Lion and other kinds of this terrible wagon which almost expelled completely the true heavy metal from American forever . Liste carefully to this CD . I think even Spice Girls are more authentic , because they are totally commercial , without disguising themselves as & quot ; rock & quot ; .	-1
Listen to the title track on this album , and then listen to `` Bittersweet '' , by Big Head Todd and the Monsters . It 's the exact same guitar melody ! But hey , by Toby Keith 's standards , it 's really not a bad song . Probably because he ripped off someone who actually has talent . Also , this was back before he turned into a crazy flag-waving pseudo-political pro-Bush wacko , so he did n't annoy the hell out of me quite as much back then.But um , listen to the album `` Sister Sweetly '' , by Big Head Todd and the Monsters . Toby thought enough of it to rip off a song from it , so you should listen to it too.Edit for Kevin Sloan : if you really ca n't hear the similarities between those songs , then you are the one who is on crack . I do n't know what else to tell you .	-1
I still like Catherine Wheel a heck of a lot.I wonder if the new direction of & quot ; Adam & quot ; caused the bands ' riff . Seems like they 're trying to replicate & quot ; Cats and Dogs & quot ; . They would be better off trying to write & quot ; A & quot ; sides again.Here 's less melody on melody , more forward vocals ( thus more noticable lyrics , cry-boy , slightly sappy ) , and that formerly trendy & quot ; unplugged & quot ; feel ( well sort of ) .I 've listened to this quite a few times waiting for the dawn of understanding some others mention . To no avail . DAMN ! Concept album or no , this is not a must buy . I kept waiting for a home-run like & quot ; Idle Life & quot ; or & quot ; The Nude & quot ; . Nothing . Not even close.I 'm glad & quot ; Wishville & quot ; showed up . There 's still hope .	-1
Come On Over by Shania Twain sold millions and millions of albums but I despise this cd with a passion . Shania is one of the worst singer-songwriters I have ever heard , especially in the genre of country/pop . Her voice is completely unoriginal , there 's no fire , range , or accessiblility . I ca n't believe how truly awful her songwriting is ! Terrible cliches , junior high filled lyrics and child-like melodies . Songs like That Do n't Impress Me Much , Man I Feel Like a Woman ! , Do n't Be Stupid , and You 're Still the One just gives me the willies . The only two tracks that have any emotion in them are From This Moment On and You 've Got a Way . Come on Over is a horrible and silliest record of the '90s . Stay clear from this over-rated mess !	-1
Talk about truth in advertising - the song title That Do n't Impress Me Much ( the improper use of Do n't will likely up the ire of school teachers ) is all one has to know about Shania Twain 's abysmal singing.Shania first exploded onto the music scene with The Woman In Me . The follow-up here , though , does n't improve on the glaring weakness of Woman - the fact that Shania is a horrible singer - and in fact compounds her lack of talent with overblown production values.Nowhere is it better shown on the treachly You 're Still The One . Shania displays the nauseating slur that permeates all of her singing . Like so many of her fellow divas , she can only master one emotion - whining . Can you imagine her trying to belt out a power number like 19th Nervous Breakdown ? Given the rock credentials of husband-producer Robert Lange , it is n't a stretch that she would cover one of The Rolling Stones ' greatest hits , but it would be an enormous stretch to imagine her doing anything other than ruining it.Shania strives hard to look erotic in her videos , via hooker-chic costumes , makeup that likely inspired Princess Amidala 's look in The Phantom Menace , and deliberately enticing poses . At times this attempt at sex appeal borders on camp , as when she rubs her hands below her crotch on the You Win My Heart video . Other times , as in You 're Still The One , she 's shot to appear naked . But given her emaciated thinness , it 's difficult to take her seriously as a sex symbol.For that matter , it 's difficult to take her seriously as a singer . She should get singing lessons from Mike Nesmith or Mike & quot ; DC5 & quot ; Smith .	-1
After this CD came out i bought it , and i listend to it for a while , why i do n't know ? it had some cathy songs , yes , it has some fun songs , sure , but i really hate her voice . at first it 's fine to listen to her voice and she 's a good songwriter and seem to have a great personality , that i 'll give her , but in the longrun , her voice is very harsh on the ears ... i suggest you listen through one of her cd BEFORE you buy it ... cause her voice might not be as appealing to everyone ...	-1
There are worse albums in Elton John 's catalogs than 1998 's `` The Big Picture '' - I 've already reviewed several of them . However , while it does n't quite sink to the level of `` Leather Jackets '' or `` Victim of Love , '' `` The Big Picture '' is Elton ( and Bernie Taupin ) at his most generic and uninspired.Unlike those previous efforts , there 's no real underlying factor ( drug abuse , attempting to stay relevant ) to why `` The Big Picture '' is a subpar effort . It 's not terrible , and it 's certainly more listenable than the other two atrocities I listed ( not to mention superior to `` A Single Man '' and perhaps `` Ice on Fire '' ) , but it suffers from a combination of maudlin lyrics and uninspired melodies and syrupy arrangements that do little to distinguish one track from the other . Several really good songs ( `` Recover Your Soul , '' `` Live Like Horses , '' `` Wicked Dreams '' ) lose their potential due to being smothered by garish , overbearing electronic arrangements that overshadow their more organic elements.The album 's best remembered track , the mega-hit `` Something About the Way You Look Tonight , '' ( the lead track on the double-single that brought forth the all-time bestselling `` Candle in the Wind 1997 '' ) , is trite lyrically but is sold by Elton 's passionate vocal and a subtler arrangement than the rest of the tracks . Do n't get me wrong , it 's certainly bombastic , but not nearly as bad as some of the other tracks here . `` The Big Picture '' is not a classic by any means , and is undoubtedly one of Elton 's weakest efforts .	-1
This album is depressing . After the astonishing comeback and return to form of 'Made in England ' this album was a big let-down for me . All the songs sound like they were made with an Elton John songwriting program , there are n't any interesting melodies or modulations , the arrangements are uninteresting , underplayed , and by-the-book , and even his voice , which can lend viability to substandard fare , sounds detached and bored . Except in the hit , `` Something about the way you Look tonight '' , where he sings with a bit of REAL soul . That 's why the album actually deserves one star , it is a good song in his finest tradition . To be fair , he lost a number of friends in distressing circumstances in the period this album was made ( putting it mildly ) , the album seems to have a mournful underlying mood , when there 's any mood at all .	-1
This Elton John release just is not up to par by any means . Yes there are some `` good '' songs : Long Way From Happiness , Love Like Horses , Something In The Way You Look Tonight , and The Big Picture . These songs are indeed well crafted . However , they fall a bit short of the best of Elton 's Classic 70 's period as well as from other top releases like The One and Made In England.The remaining tracks are n't terrible per say . However , they just drag on and on without having anything meaningful to say . Coupled with the fact that most of them are over five minutes long , its a real chore to listen to this CD in one sitting.Furthermore , the pacing and stylings of the record are limited . Way too many ballads and mid tempo pieces that lack excitement and verve . On top of that , the arrangements are so identical . Must every piece have a synthesizer string arrangement ? Elton 's trademark keyboard runs just are n't present enough in the overall mix . Yes there are some good solos , but once the solo is finished Elton 's piano playing more often than not falls into the background behind the strings . The guitar , bass , and drums do n't do anything exciting on any of the tracks.A few good songs here and there , but I would recommend passing on this collection .	-1
From the OBJECTIVE reviewer ... '' Recover Your Soul '' is decent and adding the duet version of `` Live Like Horses '' would have been a slight improvement . The big single `` Something in the Way '' was only big because of the song it was paired with cuz it 's nothing special .	-1
carnival of souls to me is bad i gave my cd away.IT ` S Slow it just Don ` t sound LIKE kiss.some may Like this cd but I did not . I SEE WHY THIS WAS THE FINAL SESSIONS . IT IS JUST BAD I DID NOT LIKE THIS CD . THANK YOU .	-1
TERRIBLE , i mean just look at the cover that 's more than enough proof this band could n't care less .	-1
Kiss did not lend very well to the grunge sound . This does not sound like Kiss at all . while other albums that they made were influenced by other types of music you could still hear Kiss shining through . I could not hear Kiss in any shape or form in this album . It is the worst they ever attempted . Thank God that Ace and peter came back briefly to derail this direction they were headed in .	-1
This album is a real embarrassment in the Kiss catalog . There are plenty of GREAT Kiss albums , this one can be avoided .	-1
This is without doubt the worst Kiss album ever alongside with `` Psycho circus '' . The band have jumped every musical trend since the late 1970 's ( disco , hair metal , grunge ) and this release show it 's all for fame and money - not music ! I 'd like to think that there once was a musical honesty that made albums like `` Kiss '' , `` Hotter than hell '' , `` Destroyer '' and `` Love gun '' among others so good . But with a lot of weak and uneven albums , Kiss have really hit rock bottom with this awful effort . The calculating ( of especially Gene Simmons ? ) have just proven that the band have totally lost their soul and I do n't think it 's possible for Kiss to ever make a come back . Too bad the band did n't quit earlier when they had some dignity left .	-1
How can a collection featuring Yma Sumac , Townes Van Zandt , Nina Simone and Moondog get only 2 stars , because of Kenny Rogers & the 1st Edition . This version of the song sucks , and the scene in the movie sucked . Edit this self indulgant dreck out of both and they rate higher .	-1
As a huge Soundgarden fan , I guess the reason I give this `` Greatest Hits '' CD 2 stars is because I already own all the albums and there is nothing new here . Which is quite disappointing because there are some pretty awesome Soundgarden B-sides out there , including the dense and brooding `` Blind Dogs '' song they did for the `` Basketball Diaries '' soundtrack , the bouncy cute rock of `` She Likes Surprises '' from the European version of Superunknown , the excellent Devo cover of `` Girl U Want '' , and the revved-up testosterone-laden `` Kyle Petty , Son of Richard '' from the obscure `` Home Alive '' CD . It would have been nice to include these rare cuts on a Soundgarden compilation album , the only one you get here is `` Bleed Together '' which is nothing to rave about .	-1
I recall being excited when this album came out , as I was a huge fan of the albums previous ; it seemed the band was on an unstoppable streak.The disappointment I felt once I got the vinyl home was profound . Besides the okay instrumental `` Vielleicht Das Nachste Mal '' and the coulda-been-much-better `` Spotlight Kid '' ( that keyboard solo , yuck ) , this album was a total dud . Gone were the incredible epics like Stargazer and Eyes of the World , the songs that pioneered the band 's great , individual sound . Instead this album was populated with what sounded like Foreigner and Bad Company rejects and a generally sloppy , careless performance by Ritchie Blackmore.New-at-the-time throat Joe Lynn Turner proved up to task , sounding especially magnificent on the album 's cover , `` I Surrender '' . The problem was the songs he had to work with . It 's as though Blackmore and Glover were overly conscious of getting rid of any Deep Purple or Rainbow influence on this album , and relearned how to write songs by listening to bad , early 80s AOR.Buy this only if you 're either a completist , or a fan of Joe Lynn Turner 's voice . The latter variable is especially valid , because Turner sings great all over this album . It 's obvious at the time that Blackmore was pushing his love of Paul Rodgers on him ( as Blackmore did all the way back to Gillan ) , but overall it 's hard to fault the singing itself , great stuff from JLT.But if you 're looking for great songs and playing , look elsewhere .	-1
Hoped to replace my LP with this CD . NOT ! Think the record sounds better . The quality is the worst .	-1
Every album The Moody Blues has released after & quot ; Long Distance Voyager & quot ; has been fairly worthless . For some reason , I used to like this lame stuff back when I was in high school . As I 've grown older and wiser , I have come to realize the error of my ways . & quot ; The Present & quot ; is a thoroughly mediocre album from a bunch of washed up hippie has-beens that barely has enough energy to power your speakers . Stick to classic Moody Blues material instead .	-1
all over again . I can hear and watch Photograph being played on MTV for eons and eons , all over again , what a hellish expierience and I 'm yacking on the television . Mullets from hell , and spandex garbage explains why we pass these days so very carefully . I would n't waste my time with this trash unless I thought it would make me a millionare to give this crap to the dumbmest person on the face of the earth and said this album will cure you 're hair loss , and regrow that mullet of yours . Have n't found that idiot yet so I 'm venting . This was the most overplayed bull**** on radio for years , and still is . This album should be put away with the bubonic plague and only used as psychological warfare against our enemies , they would agree . Either way if you 're a Leppard fan buy it enjoy , if you 're like me , HURL ! ! ! ! !	-1
What is the class of this band ? Crap rock ? Chick Rock ? This is just radio friendly , pop rock at it 's worst , Rock Of Ages is not a bad song but it gets tired after a few listens as is not epic or anything like that . Also every album they made until the absolute garbage after Retroactive sounds like a carbon copy of this album . I hear now they are playing with Taylor Shift ... ..	-1
Because tehy are much better than this PYROMANIA , who marked the new `` phase ' for Leppard ... The drums sound here is annoying , the lyrics are a joke . There 's no way you can compare this with HIGH N DRY !	-1
At best this album should be considered as a good Demo.That I am rating a greatest hits package by Cream as two stars should speak volumes for what a regular Cream album would be rated.Firstly , I would have rated this album , The Very Best of Cream , three stars had it not been for the aged and out of date technology that it was recorded on . If this album came out today it would probably never have gotten beyond the stage of being a Demo . That is in today 's musical world , Cream might not have even got signed with a record deal.The first song , Badge , is the best . It is n't half bad . I like it.Sunshine of Your Love is one that people seem to think absolutely grand , but if you ask me it is a terrible flop . I ca n't believe anyone bothered to listen to this , the pathetic guitar music of Eric Clapton . The popularity and not only that , but also that people thought Eric Clapton was a good guitarist is only to my bane . Do n't buy it . Do n't buy that Eric Clapton is anything but a slightly above average guitarist . The problem is not many people are above average people , such that they appreciate this musical junk.The White Room with Black Curtains is only slightly good enough to be slightly better than annoying . Again , the next song , Born under a Bad Sign , is only slightly better than annoying . Thus , it is such for the entire album , most of the songs are usually only slightly better than annoying . There is nothing on here that I do n't think a slightly better than average band struggling to put food on the table could n't write or play . There is no genius to The Very Best of Cream.Really , this is an album and a band that should be put to rest , if for no other reason than for poor sound quality . I know that they were influential to some bands , but those bands were probably terrible . Eric Clapton is perhaps the most overrated guitarist ever , right up there with Stevie Ray Vaughn .	-1
If you 're looking for the album which makes & quot ; Demons and Wizards & quot ; sound palatable , here it is . Dead weight trying to pass itself as heavy music , obstreperous and with but one redeeming quality - the silence when it 's finally over , assuming it is n't still ringing in your ears and your ears are n't demanding why you violated their Eighth Amendment rights .	-1
The Grid is 18 minutes of what could quite seriously be used for the sound analogy to water torture . It is not only obnoxious but actually sounds juvenile as if a child were responsible for the noise . What a scam that guy has going on .	-1
After their thunderous but commercially unsuccessful return to hard rock form with 1982 's ` Creatures of the Night ' , Kiss decided to resuscitate their fortunes by finally taking off the make-up . Though this seemed to work , and they continued in the renewed hard rock vein , they effectively adopted an approach that lumped their sound in with the pack of new 80s hair metal bands . Despite all their recent experimentation , they no longer sounded unique and ` Lick It Up ' marked the beginning of their least interesting period.Major production duties once again went to ` Creatures of the Night ' Producer , Michael James Jackson . But the massive drum sound of that album was abandoned and the style adopted for this effort became more straightforward fast hard rock . Though songwriting is restricted only to members in the band , it does n't make for a great result . But it does feel consistent and cohesive with new lead guitarist Vinnie Vincent ( Vincent Cusano ) contributing to 80 percent of the ten tracks with Paul Stanley co-writing half and Gene Simmons contributing to six . However , Simmons is back to his repetitive simplistic tricks , which means the dumbness quotient is back after four albums of merciful absence . Even Stanley 's songs are poor by his standards.The whole band , including drummer Eric Carr , co-write the worst song on the album , the excruciatingly embarrassing attempt at some form of spoken word street rap , ` All Hell 's Breakin ' Loose ' . Truly appalling , it must rank as the worst song Kiss has ever recorded . Generally Stanley and Simmons up the register of their voices and scream through half the album 's songs each . The characteristic cheeky sexual innuendo is dispensed with in favour of being blunt - a rather desperate attempt to be seen as bad boys.There 's not much to say . It 's all pretty lackluster and awful - energetic but lyrically and melodically lazy . The best songs are the title track , ` Exciter ' , ` Young and Wasted ' and ` A Million to One ' . But any Kiss collection would be just fine without them !	-1
Bon Jovi 's self titled debut album contains nine tracks which are all right but with the exception of Runaway do not reach the musical heights of their later albums . You would purchase this album more for historical value if your fan of the greatest rock band of the 80 's rather than for the actual songs on here . This album is where it all began and the tracks are not as substantial guitar wise or lyrically as the boys will achieve on their later masterpieces . Unless you are a huge Bon Jovi fan you probably will not want this album . Bon Jovi have created some of the greatest albums ever made and New Jersey and Slippery When Wet would be my recommendations if you do not own any of their albums at all and are looking to start .	-1
Do n't expect any great John Mellencamp songs like & quot ; Small Town & quot ; or even & quot ; Pink Houses & quot ; on this album . Recorded back when he was still John Cougar , this album , like many of his early albums , proved he still had a lot of growin ' up to do . In fact , except for the excellent single & quot ; Ai n't Even Done With the Night , & quot ; in which he starts to show his songwriting abilities , there is little on this album to recommend . Stick to later period Mellencamp instead .	-1
No hab & iacute ; a o & iacute ; do casi nada de Vangelis . Tan solo lo que todo el mundo : carros de fuego , Blade Runner y algo de 1492 . MOvido por la excelente calificaci & oacute ; n de este disco me decid & iacute ; a comprarlo . Y por Dios , ! que simpleza ! . Del primer tema , con ser bonito , ya est & aacute ; s cansado a los dos minutos , cuanto m & aacute ; s para que se repita una y otra vez durante todo el disco . Esto no es m & aacute ; s que pop del m & aacute ; s simple , adornado con algunos efectos orquestales mediante diversos sintetizadores . Sin duda , est & aacute ; bien , para lo que fu & eacute ; hecho : una mala pel & iacute ; cula documental de segunda fila.Si te gusta Vangelis ( como cualquier otro artista ) te vas a & quot ; tragar todo lo que te echen & quot ; , pero por favor , creeme , hay m & uacute ; sicas m & aacute ; s complejas que te aportar & aacute ; n mucho m & aacute ; s. Prueba con Ligeti , Robert Fripp o John Coltrane .	-1
Obviously a contract fullfiller while the group was on an extended hiatus in the mid-seventies . The live stuff from '69 borders on embarassing and that is mostly do to an uneven soundboard mix where the high harmony vocals that appear consistently & quot ; off & quot ; really stand out . The & quot ; + 5 & quot ; are nothing but studio throwaways.I got mine on vinyl in mint condition used for $ 1.00 . That 's a bargain and probably all this album is really worth . No need to re-buy it on CD.Stick with the studio classics ( epics ) Days Of Future Passed , On The Threshold Of A Dream , Search Of The Lost Chord , and Seventh Sojourn .	-1
This is a typical late 60s Moody Blues album . Take a couple of good songs , in this case & quot ; The Question & quot ; and & quot ; And the Tide Rushes In , & quot ; and surround them with a bunch of super pretentious filler material . You 're better off with a Moody Blues anthology album .	-1
If you read enough reviews you 'll find many , including myself , who do n't like the disc being touted as 5.1 when it 's really quad . I think people would be interested if it was advertised as just 4.0 . Another issue is the bonus tracks . They can not be heard on the SACD layer , only the CD layer . Here 's my particular problem . When I first played it , I could tell the horns and background vocals on the song , `` Question '' , were completely missing . The guitar is all you hear . My machine would not pick up the CD layer at all making it seem then that it 's a single layer SACD . But if the bonus tracks can only be accessed through the CD layer then it ca n't be a single layer so there 's another faulty disc issue . I went to my car and the CD layer played but guess what ? The horns and vocals missing on the SACD layer for `` Question '' were now audible as normal . Although I like a few songs , QOB was never my favorite Moody 's title so I 'll never replace it unless I can find a really cheap copy sealed or if used , only if I know all the music plays and the condition is pristine . This is the only Moody 's SACD title that so expensive . All the others on SACD are $ 20 or so . The DTS versions are still fairly rare though .	-1
Buy only if you collect the M.B. 's . This release has three , maybe four songs worth capturing .	-1
Most Moody Blues albums are spotty , usually containing a mixture of good and bad songs . But on & quot ; Octave , & quot ; they forgot to include any good ones . Released the same year ( 1978 ) as Yes 's worst album , & quot ; Tormato , & quot ; it may have had something to do with lumbering dinosuar art rock bands failing to compete in the brave new world of Punk rock .	-1
I was never a big Moody Blues fan but this does have one great song ... '' Steppin in a Slide Zone '' . I like it because it rocks much harder than their typical works . `` Driftwood '' and `` I 'll be Level with you '' are also good . After that , the quality severely wanes .	-1
I love Uriah Heep and this album was awesome , but the CD version is missing the `` Rock n Roll Medley '' track that I foolishly did n't notice was not listed when I ordered it . If you do n't mind that one track missing , the rest of the CD is great . For me , I liked that medley a lot . It was on the album , it should have been included on the CD .	-1
U2 are not and will not ever be a powerhouse . Maybe a pop powerhouse .	-1
& quot ; The Unforgettable Fire & quot ; is a disappointing follow-up to their prior release , the sensational & quot ; War. & quot ; There 's not much on this album to recommend it as much of what 's on here is bland and uninspiring , save & quot ; Wire & quot ; and the title track . A better alternative would be to get the video of this album as it shows what a creative force U2 was in the mid-1980 's .	-1
On the whole , I find this album rather disappointing . 8 out of the 10 songs of the album are not appealing at all . It may be that the album is too focused on America , if we consider the wording of the song titles : `` Elvis Presley and America '' , `` 4th of July '' . Having listened to 7out of 10 albums ( not counting the 2 ` Best Of ' ) , I still see War as the best U2 album , in spite of it being so noisy.But from this rather mediocre record , two songs stand out . Though I still have difficulty to fathom what this song is about , The Unforgettable Fire is a catchy track . But then there is Pride ( In the name of love ) , one of the band 's best ever songs , to be put into the same category as New Year 's Day ( 1983 ) or One ( 1991 ) . Pride is a touching tribute to one of the greatest ever Human Rights ' fighters , Martin Luther King . Maybe a little bit of history might help to understand the song better . Luther King was a pastor in the state of Alabama . He fought actively for the rights of the oppressed Afro-American community , and in spite of being faced with constant injustice , maintained an approach of peace and non-violence in his efforts to fight racial discrimination . On April 4th , 1968 he was killed in Memphis by a sniper . The last part of the song clearly refers to this event : '' Early morning , April 4thShut rings out , in the Memphis sky '' Then , Bono and his band also show a great knowledge of certain little details that make the song more credible as a tribute . On the tombstone of King was carved the following inscription : `` Free at last . Free at last . Thank God almighty I 'm free at last . '' This quote from a religious folk song was often used by King in his speeches . In turn , Bono and his acolytes make use of these lines : '' Free at last , They took your livesThey could not take your pride . `` U2 have always supported noble causes : fighting against poverty ; fair trade ; fight against apartheid ; human rights . Here , they also pay a tribute to a great person . Pride is not only a wonderful song but also a fitting homage . May Martin Luther King rest in peace , and let us hope that his fight will never be forgotten ... P.S : Another song on the album `` MLK '' , pays tribute to Luther King .	-1
I am a long time fan of this band , but I 'm disappointed with quality of this Japanese 2007 Reissue . Other Universal titles as Lynyrd Skynyrd for example the sound is very superior than ABB 2007 reissue.The Package is excellent , lyrics both English and Japanese , but the quality of sound could be better . 2 Stars .	-1
Maybe I just did n't get it , but this album definitely does n't fall into my `` Classic album '' category . The drums are hard panned to the left in every song , and sound like suitcases comprised most of the kit . The guitar is pretty bluesy with some psychedelic flavor , but I did n't find any of the playing revolutionary . The lyrics are beyond bad and are cheesy and unmeaningful . The whole thing just sounds muddy , like a train wreck of styles . I hate to say it , but this album just did n't stand the test of time . Supposedly this is remastered , so I can only imagine how terrible an original would sound .	-1
Few bands could have gone through the challenges this band has and still come out swinging ( Def Leppard is one that comes to mind ) . It makes one wonder just how much better they could have been had both Duane Allman and Berry Oakley made it to middle age instead of dying so tragically so early on and in such similar circumstances too.Still , Dickey Betts pulls off the guitar parts very admirably by himself on most of the tracks although Duanne is still on a few of the tracks such as the massive ( 34 minutes long ) `` Mountain Jam '' and on one of the most beautiful solo acoustic guitar pieces I have ever heard , `` Little Martha . '' I have a soft spot for `` Melissa '' as it 's my wife 's name but I still think that Dickie overdid the guitar fills too much and even `` spoiled '' the song taking away from its potential as being a really good tender ballad . Either the guitar fills should have been reduced in volume into the background or Dickie should have practised some restraint or Greg Allman 's vocal should have been removed altogether to make this just an instrumental piece like `` Little Martha . '' I personally would have gone with the second option as not all of Dickie 's fills were bad but he just plain overdid it . As a guitarist myself , I know how hard it is to just bury your ego , step back and let the rest of the band do their stuff and yet many times , less is more . Angus Young from AC/DC said it best when he said we are called the `` lead '' guitarist and not the `` loud '' guitarist . This coming from one of the best ever lead rock guitarists who ever lived . Still , this is a great eulogy and elegy to the great Duanne Allman.This mlps version of the album though is a vast disappointment as the sound quality is very poor and is certainly not remastered . The old adage of judging the book by its cover certainly holds true here and therein lies the great waste . As far as mlps designs go , the packaging is first class as the gatefold design and workmanship plus the super quality cardboard used makes this one of the best mlps ' that I 've ever seen . An inner sleeve with all the lyrics in English and Japanese is included however , the most important part of the whole package , the cd sound quality , has been left unchanged making this version of the classic album a huge disappointment for the audiophile . Such a well done mlps design surely deserves a much better remastered sound quality to accompany it . The powers that be have let a great opportunity to produce a high-class reissue version of the album go by . Unless you are a great mlps design fan alone , I do n't know why you would want to pay serious bucks for great-looking cardboard when there is no improvement sound-wise to the cd that you already own.If you consider that Duane Allman together with Eric Clapton were probably the greatest blues guitarists of their time when Duane died ( just hear their work together on Derek and the Dominoes ' `` Layla '' ) the loss is truly great and one can not but wonder at what might have been.Alas , we 'll never know but get this and `` Brothers and Sisters '' if you want to get the best of the Allman Brothers ' work . If you are a guitarist and want to learn what great blues and slide work sounds like , get these two as well as the `` Live at Fillmore East '' albums as essential listening material.Just do n't get these mlps versions which sound exactly the same sound quality-wise as the versions you already have and hence waste a lot of money for good mlps design alone .	-1
Bonnet has a great voice , but no wonder Dio left the band : Blackmore was going for a total mainstream assault , and he chose to play almost pop metal ! DOWN TO EARTH is bad , very bad . It starts with a disgusting bad songa calling MAKIN LOVE ( how creative ... ) , which seems like a KISS left over ... Thatn things go worser and worse from there , fo course with some good moments due to Ritchie 's genius .	-1
Loved this movie , but the music was horrible . I had to laugh when I saw there was actually a buyable soundtrack . Like a lot of rotten soundtracks from 1970 's movies ( the Charles Bronson Death Wish series comes to mind ) , this was overly synthesized to the point of sound effects ... camera pan-out ... sound : OOOWWAAAHHHHHHHHhhhhhh , pan in : WWEEEEeeeeeee . Silence would have been better .	-1
Terrific playing and singing on this album , but the songs are sub-par . Winwood 's & quot ; Ca n't Find My Way Home & quot ; and Clapton 's & quot ; Presence of Lord & quot ; hit their mark , but neither is among either man 's best work . & quot ; Sea of & quot ; is listenable , but the others wo n't hold your attention long . The two bonus tracks should have stayed locked up in a vault .	-1
It is n't the same after two decades , this CD is insipid , boring and flat , the only remarkable song is & quot ; Summer Nights & quot ; .	-1
This & quot ; deluxe & quot ; edition is record label price gouging at its worst ! Just about everyone who loves the movie and this movie soundtrack album has already bought the first pressing , so to make the reissue more appealing a 2nd disc of bonus materials has been added.Do n't get suckered in by this.The main disc repeats the one flaw from the original release in that the songs are still all jumbled and nowhere near the order they are heard in the film . You would think that the label would have corrected this but they didn't.The second disc is short ( about 40 minutes ) and just features alternate takes and remixes of the same songs . Nothing new there.One star may seem a bit harsh..bear in mind I give the original release 4 stars .	-1
I am a guitarist , and I can vouch for Malmsteen 's astounding technique . However , that only takes you so far . The songs should come first , and the songwriting just is n't there . Endless solos get boring and old after a while . You can either play for other guitar players to show off how fast you can go wheedily wheedily whee up and down the fretboard , or you can write songs and solos that hit people in the gut and touch their hearts.In my opinion , Malmsteen had an overwhelmingly NEGATIVE influence on rock guitar in the 80 's . It became a competition . So many players were worried about speed and technique rather than composition and playing from their souls . As another reviewer said , if you want emotional instrumental guitar music , pick up a Eric Johnson or a Joe Satriani cd instead .	-1
2 1/2Brought down by its passionate tribute to all things corny in eighties metal , instrumental passages nonetheless can often transcend their cheesy confines .	-1
Sometime within the last quarter century , pundits who consider themselves hip began to shower disco with praise , herald it as being some sort of cultural touchstone of the times that spawned it , celebrate the 4/4 beat ( or whatever it is - I 'm no drummer ! ) as the pulse of life for a generation of young adults looking to escape the daily hell of their going-nowhere , doing-nothing , trailer park lives . Feh ... I hated disco in 1977 and I loathe it tenfold in 2004 and this 800-lb . gorilla of the Billboard charts is as good a place to focus my ire as any . Alvin , Simon , and Theodore ( collectively that would be the Bee Gees ) completely turned their back on some of the outright great pop songs they forged in the 60 's to audition for the Vienna Boys ' Choir with `` Stayin ' Alive , '' ( ranking right down there with `` Hotel California '' as this scribe 's most hated song ever recorded ) `` How Deep Is Your Love , '' `` Night Fever , '' `` More Than A Woman , '' `` Jive Talkin ' , '' and `` You Should Be Dancing , '' and people just could n't get enough . They streamed to the dance floor like lemmings to the cliffs , like lambs to the slaughter , and the music on this album provided the backdrop . Walter Murphy and David Shire set Beethoven and Mussorgsky twitching awake from their dirt naps with `` Fifth Of Beethoven '' and `` Night On Disco Mountain '' respectively and that 's really saying something considering how low classical music flies on my radar . Throw in dreck like KC 's `` Boogie Shoes , '' Kool & amp ; The Gang 's `` Open Sesame , '' and The Trammps `` Disco Inferno , '' all as irritating as simultaneously banging your funny bone on a door frame while getting a chunk of Popsicle lodged in a filling , and it 's obvious why punk HAD to happen . `` Classic piece of pop history '' ? Gim me a break . It pains me to say this , but we 're right back where we started , with the world 's clubs packed with people standing around cheering on people cueing up records . Nearly 30 million people ca n't be wrong , can they ? The apocalypse is nigh ...	-1
These re-recordings of Chuck 's classic Chess hits sound tinny and at times off key . They just do n't cut it ! ! ! If you love the music of this rock 'n roll legend then I would suggest & quot ; The Great 28. & quot ; That collection is well worth the money .	-1
Truth be told , Palmer is n't really a rock artist . His pop instincts and lover boy posturing have more in common with Frank Sinatra than Buddy Holly . Nothing wrong with that ; if it 's your thing . This album contains the hit ` Addicted To Love ' which was so ubiquitous in it 's time that Weird Al parodied it . Like most Palmer albums , however , this one is mostly filler , and annoying filler at that . All but devotees should stick to comps .	-1
This band has not clicked with me yet . Ive tried twice , once with `` Meat Puppets II '' and this thing . `` Backwater '' is a great , if perhaps nonsensical pop hit , theres a few other listenable things here , but anyone that thinks this is one of the best albums of the nineties needs to put the bong down . I hated MPII as well . Both just lack verve and replayablilty , you have no idea what the heck theyre singing about , and the music is too lackluster to make up for the weird lyrics . Now I have heard bits of their first record , and that sounds like fun , but this is not that band . Sometimes , its best that punk bands dont learn to play their instruments . The Meat Puppets are evidence of that .	-1
Do n't purchase this CD unless you really enjoy weak Joe Cocker-ish vocals , lame lyrics and mundane musicianship ( particularly the guitars ) . Almost sounds like a home-recording . if you 're interested in classic rock-type music there are a million better albums out there .	-1
This one seems to get great reviews elsewhere , but to me it typified Paul 's 1990s fear to recreate any diversity of sound . The montonous accoustic style of music here did n't please me nearly as much as his Style Council days.Having said that , it 's just a matter of personal preference.I still think there are some great songs on this album , named after Paul 's childhood neighbourhood .	-1
This is my least favourite Meat Puppets album ( `` Golden Lies '' is not included ) . It sounds very uninspired , no standout songs or musical moments , just a bunch of songs that pretty much sound the same . Curt Kirkwood is a great guitar player but here are no good riffs or solos . Also the bass lines and drums are mediocre as well as the lyrics and vocals . `` Forbidden Places '' and `` Too high to die '' are better choices in my opinion , if you 're interested in their 90 's period .	-1
Definatly a subpar offering from one of the 80s best bands . The first three tracks are really the only competant songs on this record , which is quite a shame . Oh well , any band that has as many great records as the Puppets do are bound to have a few bad ones . This is n't terrible , it 's just boring and emotionless , which as two things their SST output can certainly not be accused of . I have n't listened to this one since I first got it . The last actual Meat Puppets album ( `` Golden Lies '' is more of a Curt Kirkwood solo album ) . At least the cover is cool .	-1
1986 was a bad year for oldies acts , and the Moody Blues prove the rule on this one . It is easily their worst album to date ( as of '86 ) , and in my opinion their worst of all time ( though Sur La Mer 's pretty close ) . The biggest offender on here is the atrocious synthesizers on every track . They just take up so much space in the mix at and choke out every last grain of decency from even the better songs ( the only decent songs are `` Your Wildest Dreams '' and `` The Other Side of Life '' ) .Honestly though , I 'm most upset with the complete sidelining of Ray Thomas on this album and the follow-up . It 's tragic how Ray ( and Graeme ) were all but pushed out of the band in favor of Hayward and Lodge . Poor guys.Bottom line : Hideous eighties plastic trash . One of the worst sell-out type albums in my collection .	-1
With `` The Other Side of Life , '' the Moody Blues , sans Ray Thomas ( and , of course , Mike Pinder ) , completely throw themselves to the mercies of Patrick Moraz and his over-bearing synthesizers , in producing this cold forgettable album , a complete and unwelcome departure from their glory days . I do like the title track , although I wish the band had performed it during their classic seven period , when they played real instruments like an acoustic guitar , flute and piano . It is an interesting atmospheric song , which I can listen to over and over despite its seven minute length.For some reason , I also really like Lodge 's `` Rock and Roll Over You . '' I find the repetitive driving beat to be quite infectious -- a good song for the gym , perhaps . I suppose that `` Wildest Dreams '' is a catchy song , but it 's just way to cutesy for my tastes . The rest of the album -- completely forgettable . But wait ! `` The Other Side of Life , '' unfortunately , would serve as fair warning for the two dreadful albums that would follow ( `` Sur La Mer '' and `` Keys to the Kingdom '' ) . Ah well , nothing lasts forever .	-1
Hey , is this the album when the Moodies tried to sell out and cash in on whatever scraped together from the bottom of the barrel talent they may have accumulated over the years ? Alright , seriously , I 've probably written more then my fair share of bad reviews attacking the Moodies for no good reason and others with far superior intellect and command of the English language can continue onward and upward.Still though , not that i ca n't resist one final besmirching of all good things Moody ; did n't they even crank out an Mtv video or two off this album . As pretentious as the Moodies have always been with their proggy rock that had to be quite a conflicted moment for their legions ( and by legions I really mean circa 10,000 fans ) when they were probably happy that the Moodies had a scrape with barely but almost but not really but kinda but oh-so-far-away moment with mainstream acceptance . It almost kinda really just about did but barely really not happened .	-1
True , theres a bunch of stuff here that was n't included on the Peel Slowly boxed set , but ... most of this is n't really anything to write home about . It 's bottom-barrell leftover for the most part , but not without interest from a historical standpoint . If you 've got everything else under their name and still want more , than buy it.I like `` Hey Mr . Rain '' and `` Real Good Time Together '' ( which turned up on Lou 's `` Street Hassle '' sounding radically different ) . `` Coney Island Steeplechase '' is a pretty cool song too .	-1
I love this album , but the description was not right , I bought the mini lp replica and what I got was a shmcd in a jewel case version	-1
Just a sorry excuse for an Aerosmith cover band with even your clone version of Steven Tyler only younger and with less talent . Glittery clothes ; more makeup than Madonna ; 10,000 dollar hair extensions ; and close to zero talent sums up what this band is all about . Steven Tyler must have had this band in mind when he wrote 'Dude Looks Like a Lady . ' What made Hollywood think this band was going to last . Even more disturbing , why do people think this is good glam rock ? It 's not even original ! Along with Poison , this has to be the sorriest glam band to come out of the eighties . Just listen to Aerosmith instead of this crap . If good '80s glam is what you really want , just listen to early Motley Crue , Ratt , Dokken , or even Bon Jovi instead of this joke of a band .	-1
I realize I 'm alone here , but Steve Winwood 's voice reminds me of a cat trapped in a burlap bag with a mouse stuck in its throat . This may have been a good album for the mid-80 's , but it was this kind of drek that gave rise to the `` alternative '' scene a few years later . There 's one song I like here , `` The Finer Things , '' but listen to it interpreted by someone who understands it , like Linda Thompson or Delores Keane , and you may see what I mean . If not , by all means enjoy !	-1
Slippery When Wet some think its the greatest album of all time but personally i think its just one of those albums you can just pass on as nothing . Whats so special about , `` Let It Rock '' , oooh so they used synth and guitar and just played one note and than bon jovi 's singing comes in who cares . The reason i give it two stars is because its okay i guess i mean livin on a prayer and wanted dead or alive is okay but besides that its too glammy . not great not good	-1
I agree with Motorbreth 100 % . This is the absolute bottom of the barrel . This is the album and the band that made heavy metal/hard rock about hair instead of music . The WORST band of ALL TIME.COMPLETE and UTTER GARBAGE.There is n't one second of music here that dislays the slightest bit of talent or musicianship . Jon Bon Jovi is the WORST singer in modern music . Period . Steve Perry and Journey are more credible ( ... ugh . I ca n't believe I just wrote that ! - DAMN YOU , Bon Jovi ! ) A complete waste of time and money ... ..	-1
I was very excited when I saw this disc in the store because I had always loved Paul 's version of Love Is Blue . I had worn out at least a dozen copies of the Phillips 45 over the years . However , when I got this disc home , I learned that the version of Love Is Blue that is on it is NOT the same one that got all the air play and was a hit . It 's a very different mix , possibly a different performance . The horns and strings are very wrong , not at all what was on the original & quot ; hit & quot ; , and the drumming is n't what was on the original either.If there 's a version of Paul Mauriat 's & quot ; HIT & quot ; Love Is Blue on CD , this is n't it .	-1
I 've seen the show and own the cd , and frankly , I do n't think that it is a good show . Mushy , overblown music , and a trite story . The special effects were good ! Actually , the performances on this cd are excellent . Give the singers credit-they did n't have much to work with . But , for a positive comment , well , the special effects were good !	-1
Hey people I read all your reviews and you forget to mention the very talented work of Mr. Tommy Bolan who really made this album what it was . Dora after not being able to handle the credit to Mr. Bolan promply fired him after the European tour and she sunk like the hag ( HACK ) she truly was.People think about it Warlock was nothing before T and A and was nothing after.Thank You	-1
It 's leaden and ponderous . Clearly they 're trying to figure out how to work together again , but they 're trying too hard . It 's not working . There is almost nothing here of interest , that would merit a second listening . Even the album 's one hit , & quot ; Lonely Days & quot ; , also appears on their & quot ; Best of Vol 2 & quot ; collection ( 1973 ) , and there 's a better version of it on the & quot ; Here At Last , The Bee Gees Live & quot ; album ( 1977 ) .It 's interesting to compare their two albums & quot ; around & quot ; the breakup : 1969 's & quot ; Odessa & quot ; and this one . & quot ; Odessa & quot ; is brooding and dark and sad , and this album also has plenty of sad songs.Yet & quot ; Odessa & quot ; is utterly brilliant ; innovative , interesting , crackling with ideas and experiments , full of attention-getting musical arrangements . This is a dull reunion album . Skip it.Note that the brothers got it together very quickly after this . Their next album & quot ; Trafalgar & quot ; ( 1971 ) , while uneven , has some terrific stuff on it . It 's musically interesting and memorable , and it set the stage for the musical changes they went thru in 1972-4 . This album is just something they had to get thru first .	-1
Tony Manero be damned , Main Course is one of many artistic high water marks for the Brothers Gibb that easily equal or surpass their Saturday Night Fever explosion , offering a dense and diverse palate of rich harmony and even richer song-craft - making Rhino 's handling of this re-release uncharacteristically short-sighted and an object lesson in marketing and engineering malpractice.Rhino 's senseless indifference to sound quality needlessly undermines a seminal , underappreciated record by electing to deny a long overdue remastering . Why buy the rights to the title just to be bad stewards ? I have records remastered off of old 78 rpm cylinders that sound cleaner and more resonant than this much younger recording . You would have thought that with seventeen years to improve on the sonics of the original cd release , Rhino could have , should have gotten around to it.Regrettably , it 's buyer beware for a personal favorite that deserves better .	-1
I want the ORIGINAL recordings , that I grew up with -- not re-recordings ! Gim me the originals ! The & quot ; Man In Black & quot ; series on the Bear Family import label from Germany IS kind of expensive -- but WELL WORTH IT , if you can afford it . GET THE ORIGINALS ! ! !	-1
YOu 'll feel cold after listening to this CD , so bad it is . Not one song at all that make it worth the price . The singer ( Kiefer ) has a terrible voice , no inspiration at all .	-1
Any die-hard Uriah Heep fan ( ie the one 's who actually own `` Firefly '' & `` Innocent Victim '' on vinyl ) is going to listen to this album thru `` Heep '' colored headphones and be somewhat deafened by the vocals of David Byron . Now I am a Uriah Heep fan and have been since I bought `` Look At Yourself '' on vinyl back in 1972 when I was in 7th grade . I actually borrowed the first Uriah Heep album from a friend on 8-track shortly there after . I thought the music was pretty good , but the vocals were very amateurish . Listening to this again 30 years later has not changed my mind or ears one bit ( I recently purchased the mini-album box set which is the way to go for any fan ) . Byron is so off key and tries so hard to be Ian Gillan of Deep Purple it 's laughable , really . `` Gypsy '' is a great song , and Byron 's vocals are passable , but that 's about it . Byron 's singing improved dramatically with every successive album ; but anyone who thinks his vocals on this album can even be rated as `` fair '' is not listening close enough or `` fairly '' . A newcomer to Uriah Heep should purchase both `` Look At Yourself '' & `` Demons And Wizards '' for there initial Heep offering . Followed by `` Live 1973 '' album if they really enjoy the first two . This album is best left for die-hard fans and completists .	-1
There 's nothing avant-garde here , and nothing that will benefit from listening with an `` open mind '' . The problem is not that Nico ca n't sing . In fact she can , a little . The material lacks style , is waaaay over produced and has none of the genius seen in the Velvet Underground album that made her famous . Than goodness she quit that group.Save your money . The promoters of this nonsense are the kind of people you read about in The Bonfire of the Vanities .	-1
& quot ; HOLD ON & quot ; , & quot ; NOW IT 'S THE TIME & quot ; , & quot ; HEAVEN TONIGHT & quot ; , & quot ; DREAMING & quot ; ? ? What is this ? A NSYNC album ? ? ! ! OF course Malmsteen is playing fast as ever , his solos at the speed of light . But this CD is awful , due to the presence of Joe Lynn Turner on it , one the worst so-called & quot ; metal & quot ; vocalists ever to arise . Owner of a great voice , he unfortunately only wants to sing cheesy songs .	-1
Do n't be fooled by all of the positive reviews of this album . Be sure what you 're getting into before buying it ! You may be disappointed.In actuality , only two songs on this album are really worth a darn : those would be the first song , `` I Know You 're Out There Somewhere '' ( -whew- long title ) , and `` Vintage Wine '' . Beyond those two songs , every other song on this album is easily forgettable -- nothing more than imitations of songs they released before , and very obvious ones at that.Of course , if you are a Moody Blues afficianado , you still may feel inclined to give this album a go . If you do , be prepared to listen to it for a month or two then get tired of it . At least , that 's what happened to me . Not that any of the songs on it are bad , but they are just rehashes of previously done stuff . If you feel a need as an artist that you need to copy yourself , the least you could do for me , as a listener , is add something new to the rehashed song . Telling me nonsense like : `` I have to keep telling myself your just a little girl '' or `` I wan na go deep '' is not informative and does n't do anything to enrich my life . It 's just imitation psychedelia . But by 1988 , the psychedelia days were far over.I wish this album could have had more songs like `` Vintage Wine '' -- heavily thematic and original , with something new to say . This song has a true message , in that it tells us things like , `` I remember the taste of the Vintage Wine '' , and `` I 'm proud of the things I believed in then '' , `` if I had a chance I 'd come around again '' , and `` I was there , you see '' -- those are lyrics that seem to come more from the heart . However , a song that does nothing more than request `` No More Lies '' from a woman is lameness at its finest ! Heartless ! If I wan na hear a song telling me not to tell more lies , I could easily listen to that R & B pop ditty , famous around the early ninetees : `` no mo-more lies , screem boo bobby do beem , '' something like that . From a mature band like The Moodys , I would easily expect something beyond that.As far as this album goes `` Vintage Wine '' is the only song I feel is worth its weight in gold . `` I Know You 're Out There Somewhere '' is also pretty good ; kind of a continuation to `` Your Wildest Dreams '' but with extra instrumental soundscapes that are relaxing and invigorating . The rest of the songs are just second rate imitations of previously recorded stuff .	-1
A lot of us used to be Kiss fans , even me once , but it 's time for them to go away now . If you really want Kiss , then Smashes , Thrashes is all you need to get since it contains all of their good songs ( Both of them ) . This album has a half a dozen songs or so that I can stand and a bunch more songs that have been more overplayed than a twenty year old VCR . This is a collection for all those old stubborn yuppies who refuse to acknowledge newer or more progressive rock . By the way , I hate that song 'Beth ' . BOOOOOORING . Was that a song for a baby record ? If rock stars want to have a bad boy image then their music needs to match .	-1
Big daddy is ok it don ` t have that rock sound like some of his older stuff.I give it two star . there are 3 song ` s that i like the rest of them are to slow.I LIKE THAT FAST ROCK SOUND . But still a good price for this cd . thank you .	-1
After a decade of fantastic music , of maturing into an accomplished artist capable of both singles and full-length LPs , Mellencamp makes the mistake of too many other & quot ; mature & quot ; singer-songwriters : he gets @ # % # ing boring . Aside from & quot ; Pop Singer & quot ; , which still stings with sarcasm , every song on this disc is an overblown attempt at pontificating the obvious.This would be the only time in his career that I doubted JCM 's talent . It did galvanize him , though . To his credit , he came back hard with his heaviest CD after this country-fied tripe -- & quot ; Whenever We Wanted & quot ; is a gem . Listening to this CD compared to Uh-Huh shows the obvious fault with the music on Big Daddy ; it 's just dull and unorganized . JCM is a wonderful gift to the world of music , but this disc is worthless drivel . Give it a wide berth .	-1
Except for the Year of the knife , and Sowing the Seeds of Love , this album is at best mediocure . Extremely disappointing when considering how good Songs from the Big Chair is .	-1
Hot in the Shade is not a good album . By the time this album came out , Kiss was on the road of the hair-band trend and just went with the flow of bands like Bon Jovi , Warrant and Poison . If you like those kind of bands you will probably like Hot in the Shade . I on the other hand must say that I am not a fan of hair bands and find most of them to be shallow and boring . Speaking of boring , this album is just that , boring ! If I had to pick which song I like the best , I 'd say it would be & quot ; Betrayed & quot ; and even that is a longshot . Hot in the Shade is for die-hard Kiss fans only !	-1
Kiss spent most of the late 80 's insisting they were a band with a viable future and resisting every temptation to be branded a nostalgia act . And with the success of records like 'Lick It Up ' and 'Animalize ' they were doing a good job of driving their point home . But 'Crazy Nights ' did n't sit just right with fans and the new tracks on the 'Smashes , Thrashes and Hits ' best of compilation ( 'Let 's Put the X in Sex and 'You Make Me Rock Hard ' ) were simply dreadful output , corny , juvenille and closer to the one-note crotch rock of Warrant and Poison.Then , with all eyes on them to deliver the goods , Kiss delivered their weakest record of all with 'Hot in the Shade . ' While their hype machine kept pushing that this was 15 new tracks and no oldies but goodies , no record made this fan pine more for Kiss ' back catalogue than this one . Aside from Paul 's strong 'Hide Your Heart ' most of this record is a forgettable mash of 80 's pop metal , delivered by a band that had lost its personality somehow.This is neither a metal album nor a pop record . It has no voice , the songs have neither charm nor attitude . Sadly , the band was firing on no cylinders with this one . Eric Carr 's singing debut in 'Little Caesar ' is as weak an effort as the band has ever put forth , not that Gene 's 'Prisoner of Love ' fares much better . Not even Paul Stanley can carry this album . His 'Rise To It , ' 'King of Hearts ' and 'Silver Spoon ' all pass without notice . His 'You Love Me To Hate You ' would be a good lost song if the record were better , but it could hardly be considered any sort of lost classic . He and Michael Bolton 's 'Forever ' is a fine enough power ballad but , again , it just gets lost in the sea of late 80 's power ballads coming from hard rock bands.The upside to 'Hot in the Shade ? ' If nothing else , the dead response to this record is what got Kiss to realize it was important to more strongly reflect their entire musical catalogue in concert as their slacking 14 song concerts on previous tours were finally replaced with 20-plus tune evenings that hit on the band 's infamous past more squarely.If the seeds of the eventual reunion were sown on this record , it was a desperation move at best . This record killed 'new Kiss ' far more than the departure of Ace Frehley or Peter Criss ever could have.But , it was also good to learn later , Kiss would get their 'Revenge , ' next time out !	-1
I just can not believe how terrible this is . Kiss really should have retired after Animalize anyhow . They have not done a decent album since . Gene and Paul should be outright ashamed of themselves . I guess they did n't learn that jumping on trends for them does not work after the Dynasty/Unmasked awfulness . How could they sink even lower ? Start putting out crap like this was the answer .	-1
Yngwie Malmsteen has always been a rock guitarist 's rock guitarist . His combination of heavy metal with classical chord progressions and violin stylings influenced by the likes of J.S Bach and Niccolo Paganini were copied by tons of wan na be guitar heros and his Top 40 hit & quot ; Heaven Tonight & quot ; from 1988 's ODYSSEY had seen him claim a broader audience for his guitar pyrotechnics . This album 1989 's TRIAL BY FIRE : LIVE IN LENINGRAD , recorded at the final show of Yngwie 's world tour in support of the ODYSSEY disc , is a poor affair that seems stitched together . For anyone who has seen the live concert video of the same name will be appalled at this record . Most of the guitar solos are redone as are the vocals and leaving off concert opener & quot ; Rising Force & quot ; seems like a travesty of justice . High points include & quot ; Queen In Love & quot ; , & quot ; Deja Vu & quot ; , and & quot ; Heaven Tonight & quot ; , as well as Yngwie standards like & quot ; Black Star & quot ; and & quot ; Far Beyond The Sun & quot ; . This album seems like a patchwork process and is destroyed by in studio recordings . If you want a better Yngwie live experience , get this VHS concert if you can find it . Yngwie was only the second artist from the west ( Billy Joel was the first ) to play in Mother Russia and this live album seemed to close the book on him as a guitar icon . This could have been much better	-1
Okay , we know that the original movie soundtrack was n't the greatest to begin with ( Jack Nicholson singing leaves a very bad taste in your brain ) but it had a few memorable tracks : Prologue 1945 , Christmas , See Me-Feel Me/Listening to You , and the Acid Queen . So , one would think that with a remastered soundtrack the engineer ( s ) would make those , and the other tracks , shine.Wrong.The remastered album is dreadful , _especially_ Prologue 1945 : it 's brash , noisy musical mayhem -- it sounds like The Three Stooges tripping and falling their way through an orchestra pit/recording studio ... and that 's just the beginning . I 'm so disappointed with the disc I just may stick in the microwave just to feel good about its self-destruction as it generates a miniature lightning storm and melts into a puddle of muddled musical goo.Save yourself some money and disappointment : buy the DVD and rip it to .mp3 files , instead .	-1
This is an interesting album , but suffers from the post Quadrophenia blahs ( my opinion ) . NOT a Who album , but a Townshend `` experiment '' with guest stars . Interesting synth treatments and some good performances . A horrible film that pseudo-intellectualizes the original music and loses the original spirit of the album . How depressed was Townshend after the failure of Quadrophenia to concert audiences ? Listen to this Album.Uh ... Ann-Margret and Oliver Reed sing on this ... I say no more . There is camp ... and there is bad . This is bad . I say this as a die-hard fan , tho ... so maybe I ca n't laugh at the schmaltzy symbolismand Vegas-style treatment on top of a rock masterpiece . And I LIKE John Water 's films.Hmmmm.HOWEVER ... the take on Sensation ( Pete on guitar ) , I 'm Free ( full band ) kicks ... There are also some great Who jams on the film that did not make it to the soundtrack ... ( Sparks , and a biker fight as I recall ) .Tina Turner is great ( as you might suspect ) , and Clapton holds his own . As others have said ... decide whether you want to buy this for a few songs ... or not . I have not heard the remaster though and am about to buy it myself ( me=hypocrite/completist )	-1
This horrible little idiot is SO annoying . His voice stinks and his lyrics are stupid . His music is only for idiots who are too brainwashed by outdated garbage music like this to realize that there is such a thing as a catchy beat .	-1
Until Tony MacAlpine was forced to form a hair rock ensemble in late 1990 , the disparity between 1988 's & quot ; Children & quot ; and 1990 's & quot ; Carved In Sand & quot ; represented the single biggest drop off in quality between consecutive albums in the history of recorded music . True , & quot ; Children & quot ; was an aberration - great music , good lyrics , perfect order , outstanding mix , lush orchestrations and tons of vision . Never before had The Mission risen to that level and , sadly , never would they approach it again . & quot ; Carved In Sand & quot ; has none of the aforementioned elements . The titles alone betray the lack of ideas . When your opener is inspired by an ABC TV special , you know there 's trouble . & quot ; Into The Blue & quot ; is n't a half bad song until Reeves Gabrels shows up ( and ruins it ) . & quot ; Butterfly On A Wheel & quot ; suffers from boredom more so than anything . I 'd critique & quot ; Sea Of Love & quot ; except I ca n't remember a note from it . & quot ; Deliverance & quot ; almost delivers until Simon Hinkler unveils perhaps the most annoying guitar tone of its time . The ennui resumes in & quot ; The Grapes Of Wrath & quot ; ( check out Camel 's & quot ; Dust And Dreams & quot ; for a slightly more compelling treatment of John Steinbeck 's novel ) . You 're so disenchanted that by the 7th track , & quot ; Belief & quot ; you are momentarily deceived into thinking it 's a good song . However , 4 minutes into the 7 minute opus , when you realize you 're just hearing the same idea over and over and over and over , well , the luster lessens . I would later learn it 's best to stop the CD after & quot ; Belief & quot ; because the spiral downward ( with apologies to Trent Reznor ) is steep . Honestly , how can any song titled & quot ; Paradise Will Shine ( Like The Moon Tonight ) & quot ; be any good ? Answer : it ca n't ( and is n't ) . I do n't remember a thing about & quot ; Hungry As The Hunter & quot ; other than an annoying & quot ; yeah , yeah ! & quot ; that followed every chorus . & quot ; Lovely & quot ; I believe is a brief acoustic piece that feature 's Hussey non-too-lovely speaking voice . All in all , this is a terribly written , dreadfully performed , incompetently recorded ( by Tim Palmer , of all people ) and downright insulting piece of half-baked nonsense . The band itself was so disillusioned that they released all their outtakes in the hopes that they actually had an idea somewhere ( 1991 's & quot ; Grains Of Sand & quot ; ) . It took me exactly 7 listens to decide The Mission had gone to hell in a handbasket and to eliminate it from my collection . 13 years later , I still hate every note on it ( at least where there are notes to hate ) .	-1
Lousy , godawful drivel that makes me want to dig a hole and bury the CD as if by instinct alone -- and by godawful , I mean Jesus nasty ! This is what your hip bible study group leader plays on picnic day to keep things edgy . It often sounds like a band member is choking the singer who has the clown name . Kinda like James Taylor on a bennie bender , like he 's been jogging for hours in a chicken suit in the desert while sucking on sandpaper . Then there 's that high-maintenance lead guitarist with the rockin ' chops , a steely 'tude and quite the bone-chilling nickname . But wait , 'cuz I have n't forgotten the pair with the regular names . Just ordinary guys , folks . Of course that one guy , the bassist , he tries to hang with the big dogs , but he just comes off like a slightly-demented car mechanic . I take it Silver Surfer boy is the apologetic one , holding the others ' hands as they peer into the porcelain depths and repeatedly offer up last night 's meal .	-1
CLUES is good but not one of Robert Palmer 's best . The album did spawn a couple of hits , LOOKING FOR CLUES and JOHNNY AND MARY . There 's also a cover of the Lennon-McCartney composition NOT A SECOND TIME which was recorded by the Beatles in or around 1963 . Palmer would n't have another hit album until THE POWER STATION in 1985 . What was Palmer trying to do standing in the ocean with a portable radio and headphones over his ears ? I dedicate this to the memory of Palmer who died suddenly of a heart attack on September 26,2003 .	-1
Anyone interested in purchasing the recent Robert Palmer reissues from Culture Factory or Edsel would be wise to read these two articles from SuperDeluxeEdition : # 1 : Online music forums are buzzing at the moment with fans claiming that Edsel 's recent Island-era Robert Palmer reissues show signs of being mastered from an MP3 source.Using sound editing software such as Audacity , audiophiles often like to ` look ' at the sound of tracks via waveforms - it 's a way to check the state of the mastering . Some fans of the late English singer have been doing just this with the latest reissues and are unhappy with what they see . & # 34 ; There is absolutely no musical information above 16 kHz , which is a dead giveaway & # 34 ; stated one person - the implication being that this was an indication of an MP3 source . Many fans have emailed us in the last 24 hours asking if they should not buy the reissues and if we knew whether there was any truth in these claims.So we put these allegations to Edsel label manager Val Jennings and he was adamant that the masters had been nowhere near an MP3 file. & # 34 ; We were given flat transfers by Universal for all the albums and bonus tracks , on CDs with Universal 's Belsize Road Tape Library inlays . Since they came directly from the tape library , I ca n't see how MP3s would come into it . The CDs certainly do n't have MP3s on them & # 34 ; , he said.When pushed about the actual source and details around the transfers themselves he told us : & # 34 ; I can but assume that they would have been new transfers from the tapes with no extra EQ . They were done in 2006 for Universal 's very own catalogue team , who were all set to reissue the albums , until the whole project was shelved for reasons no-one involved can remember & # 34 ; .Clearly frustrated with the situation Val added , & # 34 ; I really do n't know what else to say . It 's shame that people ca n't just be glad that someone has reissued the records , instead of trying to find or invent faults. & # 34 ; # 2 : When Edsel Records reissued Robert Palmer ` s Island era albums on CD , we were delighted . Regular SDE readers will know , we rate the Yorkshireman 's diverse '70s output highly and like many fans were frustrated with the lack of activity around his catalogue.Although the ( Edsel ) reissues that came out at the end of August were budget conscious combo-packs , with two albums in each set ( three , in one case ) , the packaging itself was excellent , with slipcases , thick booklets , essays , lyrics and some great archive photography and scans of sleeves and record labels . Most of the albums also came with bonus tracks.Unfortunately , enthusiasts who 'd purchased these sets started reporting in online music forums that the sound quality was not what you might expect from an original tape transfer . Some were stating that the albums looked like they 'd been mastered from MP3s.That got us thinking . If the new Edsel releases are indeed less-than-optimum , then what is the best way to listen to Robert Palmer 's Island albums ? Exactly which CDs sound the best ? Are the Edsel reissues , really that bad ? There are a number of different masterings , and rather than heap amateur analysis on top of amateur analysis , we asked mastering engineer Nick Watson to give us his professional opinion . In his 23 year career Nick has worked with bands like Faith No More , The Kinks and The Libertines and he co-owns ( with Tim Debney ) of Fluid Mastering in London.We gave Nick three versions of Palmer 's 1976 album & # 34 ; Some People Can Do What They Like & # 34 ; and asked him to analyse them . One was the new 2013 Edsel CD , the second was an original Island CD from the 1980s , and the final disc was the 2011 remaster from US label Culture Factory . To keep things simple this comparison is based on the first track of the album & # 34 ; One Last Look. & # 34 ; Here 's what Nick had to say.The spectrogram image show ( ed ) clearly that there is no useful audio data on the CD above 16kHz , and the blocky nature of the display is consistent with the audio having been subjected to some form of data compression such as MP3 or AAC or similar . The sound of the disc is also consistent with this , with the top end of the recording appearing to switch on and off , the stereo image flinching , and some twittering artifacts in the top end , as one would expect from low resolution data-compressed signal . As a test , using a clean uncompressed version of the same track as a control , I found that a reduction of the bitrate to about 192kbps was required to reduce the perceived quality to something similar to the Edsel CD ( see this image to illustrate ) .Apart from the data-compression artifacts , the album sounds quite thick and bloated ( too much low-mid ) and very closed off in the top end , although this latter point will be partly to do with the data-compression.This CD sounds exactly as one might expect for a reissue done at this time . The EQ is quite thin and the sound is slightly brittle - although once the listener has adjusted to this there are no unusual or distracting artifacts . The stereo image is open and consistent . This sounds like an album that could do with being properly remastered , from the original tapes , with a little extra warmth and bass in the EQ and the more natural and transparent sound of good quality modern A to D conversion.Looking at the spectrogram , ( I could ) see that the frequency response continues upwards from 16kHz and there is none of the blockiness of the Edsel image . Another interesting point is at the extreme high end you can see the response tails away smoothly , but rapidly , at about 21kHz . This would probably be due to the more aggressive filters used in A to D converters in the 80s and early 90s.The spectrogram on this version has no blockiness and no rapid rolloff of the high frequencies . This would demonstrate that as far as digital processing is concerned , this version has suffered the least degradation , i.e . it has not been data compressed and was converted from analogue to digital using more recent technology.The sound of this version however is dreadful . The tone of it would suggest that at least 8 dB of boost has been applied at around 2kHz giving it what you might describe as a telephonic kind of brightness , and the stereo image swerves from side to side wildly and seemingly at random , with the left channel becoming so loud at times that clipping distortion is audible . Given that no engineer in his right mind would do this to a recording ( and I 'm allowing for the fact that plenty of engineers do some pretty awful things in the mastering world ) I can only assume that on this occasion the guy left the room and WHAT WE HEAR ON THE Culture Factory CD IS THE RESULT OF THE CAT WALKING ACROSS THE CONSOLE . All of which is a real shame as it 's a great album , and one that I would enjoy listening to for pleasure.ConclusionsGiven the choice between these three CD editions , the hands-down winner for me is the original '80s Island reissue - which , for all its faults ( faults it shares with pretty much every other reissue of that period ) it at least does n't suffer from strange sonic artifacts or appallingly harsh EQ.Coming back to the much discussed Edsel reissue finally , one might wonder how such a thing could have happened . Well , I 'm not going to speculate about that and can only talk about what I find on the disc itself . However , in general terms , I can perhaps allude to the fact that before computers and music became so closely intertwined , mastering was something that could only be undertaken by professional engineers . Today , however , anyone with a computer , whether they work in a studio or an office , can pick up a disk or download a file , and do stuff with it . Not everyone for instance knows how to make a 1:1 copy of a CD , and might load it into some freeware in order to attempt to do so , perhaps resulting in some inadvertent degradation . I even know of record company employees who do things to audio masters using applications such as iTunes , without really knowing what they 're doing or why , other than it being something that they have been shown how to do by someone else in the office . It 's almost akin to say , 20 years ago , them taking a master tape out of the box , and unravelling it and then editing it using scissors and sellotape . Except that that would never have happened .

A patched up Free attempts to carry on as normal , but the chemistry is just not there - Fraser is gone and Tetsu struggles / does n't even try to make the most of the opportunity given to him . Rather than contribute some great bass ideas , he is content just to plod along ; Kossoff plays on 5 of the 8 tracks . Gone is the heart wrenching melody and beautiful vibrato of his playing . He 's running on remote control . It sounds like he 's slumped in the corner of the studio stoned out of his head ; Bundrick writes 2 tracks / shares the credits on two others . His work sounds like album filler put there to satisfy the band 's contractual requirements . The whole album is Lazarus with a triple bypass.The only standout track is the EXCELLENT 'Wishing Well ' ... the other songs are just musical ideas i.e verse and chorus cobbled into a finished song ... another album to buy if you ca n't stand blank spaces in your Free CD collection ... What a tragic waste ...	-1
These early Palmer efforts ( with the exception of the debut cd ) simply leave me bored . They seem to flounder with very little zip . This is my least favorite of all his cd 's as it 's the only one I sold on Ebay . The songs as written do not have a point and Palmer in these days is still searching for his identity . If you are looking for great Palmer try , Do n't Explain , Honey , Heavy Nova or even his debut cd . Stay away from this cd while driving as it may cause drowsiness .	-1
The `` single '' remastered version added 2 new songs to the original album [ I just want you to know and Sittin ' here thinking of my love ] . This deluxe version added some other unrelated concert songs and a few demos , but , if the record company is charging extra for this edition [ being called DELUXE ] , why not making it complete ? ? ?	-1
Released in 1986 , this is Adrian Belew 's third solo CD . It is only 32 minutes long and the sound quality is good.This is a purely instrumental album ( except for some talking ) . It is discordant , jazzy and electronic . Much of it has a driving electronic beat . It is a lot like the King Crimson ProjeKt albums , only a little more accessible and less metallic.There are some excellent tracks and all tracks have some excellent parts to them . However , some of the tracks devolve into noise or silly themes in parts . All in all there is about 20 to 25 minutes of inspired music.UPDATE : I listened to this again and then lowered my review of it . In reality , only the first 3 tracks are interesting , if you cut out the first 3 minutes of track 2 . The rest of the tracks do not have long enough passages of real music to make them interesting.This is Belew 's third solo album during a break in King Crimson.If you are reading this , you probably already know that he played with Zappa , Bowie , Tom Tom Club and King Crimson . He has some great solo albums .	-1
Okay , I 'll admit it : I bought this album because I liked `` I 'm Free '' which I thought had a great groove and excellent wah-pedal guitar and then I found out much later that it was a Rolling Stones cover . So I thought I 'd judge the rest of the tracks on the very short album which for some reason still sounds too short with the 2 bonus tracks added . I have to say that this album has n't aged well at all and the sound quality is poor . Given the standard of recording that 's out there today , if you want to do your stereo or even your eardrums any justice , I 'd say pass on this until they remaster it ; if they ever do . Nice psychedelic cover art though but this is essentially `` I 'm Free '' plus 12 filler tracks . I 'd recommend getting albums by EMF or Jesus Jones rather than this album .	-1
I have EVERY album that Yngwie has put out , and then some . But I must admit that this album is below par for the following reasons : sound , recording/engineering , production , and the band . In addition to all of the reasons above , the WORST thing was the lack of his `` signature sound '' . I ca n't hear Yngwie and I ca n't hear his Stratocaster and his Marshalls ! The album is not raw enough and sounded like he just plugged everything through some cheap floor effects , then recorded straight to the tapes . Second : the drums ... this has got to be THE WORST part of the recording . My drum machine puts out more attack and timbre than the drums mapped out here . Lastly , the song writing : `` too commercial '' but not commercial enough for airplay , what can be worst than that ? The rest ... well you can just imagine.Sorry , but this album is just terrible !	-1
The great `` Hellbound Train '' album aside , you have to be a REAL Savoy fan to want to own `` Wire Fire '' , certainly not one of the band 's more auspicious efforts.Unfortunately , this CD seems to be the only way to now obtain the album ; unfortunate , because the audio on this disc is TERRIBLE , especially when compared to other available remasters.If it 's `` Train '' you 're looking for , then please do yourself a favor , and opt for theBGO remastered Street Corner Talking / Hellbound Train `` 2-fer '' , which is head-and-shoulders better sounding than this disc.BGO has issued a series of nicely remastered 2-fers of the primary ten-title SB studio catalog : Shake Down / Getting to the PointBlue Matter / A Step FurtherRaw Sienna / Looking InLion 's Share / Jack the ToadI have A/B 'd these to the older 90 's London single-disc releases and have found them all to be superior . By all means , if you own the London discs , and you 're looking for the best audio , replace them with the BGO's.For mini-sleeve collectors and audiophiles , there are also two Japan OOP imports of the first two albums , Shake DownandGetting To The Pointthat may still be locate-able . Both are slightly better than the BGO in audio quality , plus the glossy 'sleeve replications of the 60 's LP covers are very kewl.WHAT IS A JAPAN `` MINI-LP-SLEEVE '' CD ? Have you ever lamented the loss of one of the 20th Century 's great art forms , the 12 '' vinyl LP jacket ? Then `` mini-LP-sleeve '' CD 's may be for you.Mini-sleeve CDs are manufactured in Japan under license . The disc is packaged inside a 135MM X 135MM cardboard precision-miniature replica of the original classic vinyl-LP album . Also , anything contained in the original LP , such as gatefolds , booklets , lyric sheets , posters , printed LP sleeves , stickers , embosses , special LP cover paper/inks/textures and/or die cuts , are precisely replicated and included . An English-language lyric sheet is always included , even if the original LP did not have printed lyrics.Then , there 's the sonic quality : Often ( but not always ) , mini-sleeves have dedicated remastering ( 20-Bit , 24-Bit , DSD , K2/K2HD , and/or HDCD ) , and can often ( but not always ) be superior to the audio on the same title anywhere else in the world . There also may be bonus tracks unavailable elsewhere.Each Japan mini-sleeve has an `` obi '' ( `` oh-bee '' ) , a removable Japan-language promotional strip . The obi lists the Japan street date of that particular release , the catalog number , the mastering info , and often the original album 's release date . Bonus tracks are only listed on the obi , maintaining the integrity of the original LP artwork . The obi 's are collectable , and should not be discarded.All mini-sleeve releases are limited edition , but re-pressings/re-issues are becoming more common ( again , not always ) . The enthusiasm of mini-sleeve collecting must be tempered , however , with avoiding fake mini-sleeves manufactured in Russia and distributed throughout the world , primarily on eBay . They are inferior in quality , worthless in collectable value , a total waste of money , and should be avoided at all costs .	-1
If you are not a fan of Elton 's music , buy this album , I guarantee , the next time you hear Elton 's voice on the radio , you will come to appreciate it , more than you ever thought possible !	-1
Like everyone else , I felt that this collection was worth buying only on the merit of Sin & eacute ; ad O'Connor 's & quot ; Sacrifice. & quot ; I wholeheartedly agree that she brought something absolutely haunting and moving to this song . I heard it at a time in my life that it spoke so directly to me and moved me to tears . Elton John definitely can not move me to tears ( well , I am a tad sentimental , and the video for & quot ; Candle in the Wind & quot ; always made me feel a bit sad . I hated the Princess Di rewrite of the song , though . ) Whatever the case , I do n't listen to the rest of the CD with any regularity , although I can also agree with previous reviewers in saying that Kate Bush 's & quot ; Rocket Man & quot ; is splendid , despite my not at all liking Kate Bush or her voice . Although I recognize that the rest of the artists on this & quot ; celebration & quot ; are renowned , I do n't care for them , which made this collection highly flawed as far as cost-benefit analysis is concerned . However , if you are a Sin & eacute ; ad fan , this is more than worth whatever it costs .	-1
Universal Records should be ashamed of themselves for such a shameful cash grab with this release.Disc 1- The first disc is simply the 2001 remaster , no different at all . They left nearly 40 minutes on this disc completely empty of any bonus tracks when there are dozens of unreleased demo 's , dubs , and songs from the Kaya sessions that could have easily been included , just as they have done with all of the previous Universal Deluxe Edition sets.Disc 2 - This disc is an incomplete live show from Rotterdam , Netherlands on July 7th , 1978 . They excluded two songs that are from ( you are n't going to believe this ) the KAYA album leaving only 1 track in the live performance from the actual album . Crisis and Running Away were removed from the live set making the relevance of the live set almost nill . Truly unbelievable and mind blowing as to how they came to this decision . The two tracks excluded total about 15 minutes and could have been added to the first disc , while still leaving room for at least a half dozen unreleased tracks ! I had to go find the bootleg version of the show to get these two songs , burn them to CD and include them with my set . Additionally , the sound quality on the live album is worse than the bootleg recordings found online ! They did not use the soundboard for this release , even though they have it and the whole show sounds ripped from an online source , and like the treble was tweaked . Bob 's vocals do not sound as good as the bootlegs available.Packaging - They have also really cheaped out on the packaging for this set . The legendary plastic slip cover , which displays the signature `` Deluxe Edition '' has been completely eliminated leaving the cardboard double disc case just flopping around openly . Unbelievably , they even trick us poor consumers into thinking this slip cover IS included by showing the slip cover on this very Amazon listing , displaying the `` Deluxe Edition '' text ! This proves they intended to include it but did not in an effort to pad their pockets with a few more pennies.I am truly shocked at how brazen Universal Records is to release such a shoddy rip off . It 's like they 've become extremely dishonest and unscrupulous and do not care who knows it . Zero bonus tracks , bad quality live show , missing songs from the live show , tricking us on the cover . Just so overwhelmingly ridiculous . The fact that they have released 5 great Bob Marley Deluxe Editions in the past also cements the fact that they know how to release quality collections , but for the sole purpose of bilking the fans and lining their pockets , refused to.I have been a massive fan of the Universal Deluxe Editions and have dozens upon dozens of them in my CD collection , including all five Bob Marley releases , which have all been fantastic . However , the Kaya Deluxe Edition is just flat out unacceptable . Universal owes us fans at least a refund , or more appropriately , a replacement release that coincides with the quality and content of all the other Bob Marley Deluxe Editions they have produced , and which we have come to expect.I truly feel ripped off on this one.Chris Elliott	-1
I am a long time fan of this solo release , but I 'm disappointed with quality of this Japanese 2007 Reissue . Others Bon Jovi titles have been the quality of 20 BIT REMASTERS , released in 1998 in JAPAN , US and Worldwide.This solo release remains the 1990 Master , not remastered.The Package is excellent , lyrics both English and Japanese , but the quality of sound could be better . 2 Stars .	-1
This CD title was falsely created on the Amazon system by an unknown , crooked Marketplace Seller . They removed one of the bonus material discs from theLayla 20th Anniversary Box Setand created a separate listing for it , with a much higher price than the 3CD box set itself , in an attempt to fool an unsuspecting buyer into wasting a lot of money.DO N'T BE RIPPED OFF , just buy the box !	-1
Derek and the Dominoes were , of course , a one-album band for Eric Clapton and `` guest '' musicians . The title song and `` Bell Bottom Blues '' notwithstanding , the album is , in a word , B-O-R-I-N-G . While the virtuoso guitar soloing between Clapton and Allman may enthrall some , this album is guaranteed to otherwise put to sleep the vast majority of the listening public . This is definitely NOT an album to play while driving down the highway late at night . ZZZZZZZZZ ... ..	-1
At the ripe old age of 51 , I was clearly in the generation who appreciated Layla and other assorted love songs as the best rock album of the time . As a drummer and guitar player , I can play Layla blindfolded , with Eric helping me along ! Unfortunately I do not share my fellow reviewers comments . The original Layla album sounded as if it were recorded in a garage with little to no high end , muddy bass , and just dry as a bone , like something I would record on an inexpensive tape recorder.I am so very disappointed at the low fidelity of the new SACD release . I am playing this dics using the Sony SCD-1 , Jeff Rowland amplification and Aerial 10T speakers , and the disc still sounds like someone threw a blanket over the tweeter and midrange drivers ! Everytime Layla would come out in a so called new and better version , I would purchase it , beginning with the Lp , then the Eric Clapton Crossroads set , then the Derek and The Dominos 20th Anniversary Edition Layla Sessions . I will admit , I am unable to take advantage of the multi-channel mix , however the stereo mix played on high quiality equipment leaves a great deal to be desired.Some of these producers bringing back the old recordings in SACD could take a lesson from the likes of Mark Levinson . One quick example is Mark Levinson 's old recording of the New Haven Brass Quintet , recorded in 1976 with a Studer A80 recorder , using 1 '' tape . Mark took this `` OLD '' original master recording and made an SACD master in 2001 that must be heard to be believed . If you want a glowing report on old standards transfered to SACD , try some of Mark Levinson 's offerings , SACD DONE RIGHT ! As for Layla , it seems to me , someone wanted to get this SACD on the shelf far to quickly . If I would not have to stand in a Christmas return line , I would take this SACD back .	-1
I would like to get my hands on the 'orrible , 'orrible lit-tle man who thought up the packaging for this album . Two of the CDs were scratched on receipt because of the way they were stuffed in the cardboard pockets in the set . i managed to clean them up by performing a CD wash using eye glasses cleaner but that 's not the point . The packaging sucks . Recommendation ; if you buy this set , go out and purchase 5 CD sleeves to store them . Other than that a great set . However , where is the `` video '' which is advertised . My DVD has only audio . Whoever kaboshed the design of such a monumental set should be fired . I gave it 2 stars because such great music can oversome even the odds presented here .	-1
Other than Layla , there is n't much of interest here , just more British white boy blues , I 'd stick to the comps .	-1
Another disappointment . The only good thing on the CD is & quot ; Too Many Walls & quot ; ... besides that , the CD is pretty much not good for much .	-1
This album does n't even rate a review.What is it about Paul Stanley ? During the makeup-less years he just sounds so annoying ! As for Gene Simmons ... he stopped penning good songs years ago !	-1
Yes , it 's true I only give Revenge 2 stars . In all honesty it 's my least favorite KISS album . I do like a few songs though . `` Unholy '' `` God Gave Rock 'N ' Roll to You '' `` I Just Wan na '' `` Heart of Chrome '' and of course `` Carr Jam 1981 '' These are the only tracks I really listen to when playing Revenge . The album is dedicated to the late great Eric Carr which is very cool.I recommend all the other KISS releases first , but to make your collection complete you must own Revenge .	-1
I bought this title hoping for a majority of head bobbing , hip wiggling , hard core funk.Unfortunately only about 3 of the 7 tracks really get down on it , the remainder being the standard 70 's soul ballads.It 's all good , but 70 's soul ballads are not my cup of tea . The funk that does get rolling -- especially FOPP -- is out and out , dead on , groove in , funk .	-1
If you want to buy an Animals CD that does not contain `` House Of The Rising Sun '' or `` We Got ta Get Out Of This Place '' , and sounds like it was recorded on a portable cassette recorder in an unfinished basement by Beavis and Butthead on acid then by all means -- -knock yourself out .	-1
This is the Moody Blues 12th studio album . It was released in 1991 and is 53 minutes long . The sound quality is only fair . It is surprisingly poor for a CD that came out in 1991 and for something by the Moody Blues , a group known for its sound . The dynamic range is flat and the mix is muddled . It is n't horrible , but it certainly is n't up to the standards of the time.This is typical eighties/nineties Moody Blues after reforming in 1978 . They were releasing an album of new material every two to three years and going out on tour , mostly playing the old hits . In between the studio albums , live albums or retrospectives and greatest hits albums would be released.The group is was fairly stable with Lodge , Edge , Hayward and Thomas . Patrick Moraz was the keyboardist , replacing Mike Pindar through the eighties . This is the album where Moraz left the group and is only on three songs.I think that Pindar 's departure had an adverse effect on the group . His musical inventiveness melded well with Hayward 's sappy pop song writing . When Pindar left , the group was left with Hayward dominating the group too much.This is probably the worst Moody Blues album . It is filled with sappy love songs , bad lyrics ( you ca n't blame the rainbow for the rain ) and easy listening listening arrangements.The first four tracks have an eighties disco sound to them , only softened . It 's got the disco violins , and keyboards . Some of it sounds like something Frankie Goes To Hollywood might do . Coming in 1991 , it really sounds out of date.The next several tracks sound much like something the Traveling Wilburys might do , with a lot of George Harrison and Jeff Lynne ( Electric Light Orchestra ) influence . However , it is all softened and has none of the energy or emotion.The last part of the disc just completely falls apart and is a jumbled mess.Some people really like soft pop . For those people this would be a great CD to get . Someone called in soothing . I could see where someone might feel that way , because there certainly is no emotion in it . But having to sit through bland , soft pop with bad lyrics always puts me on edge.THIS CD IS NO LONGER IN PRINT . YOU CAN ONLY BUY IT USED . WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS ?	-1
On the 14th studio offering by the Moody Blues `` Keys Of The Kingdom '' , we get maybe their worst album ever . As a long time follower of the band , this started out strong with the bouncy `` Say It With Love '' and the magical Justin Hayward ballad `` Bless The Wings ( That Bring You Back ) . The rest is pure rubbish , what happened ? , just not the Moody Blues on this set . Patrick Moraz was guest on this disc , as he left the band after 10 years . Producer Tony Visconti ( i love most of his work ) , but this one just seems phoned in . 1999 would give us their next album `` Strange Times '' .	-1
Maybe I am not ready to appreciate this , but for the moment , this cd is just awful to my ears . Sorry for the die hard fans .	-1
Truly , this original French version of & # 34 ; Don Carlos & # 34 ; is a virtually complete 'recording ' , with extras in the 4th CD for alternative ( original ) scenes and excerpts for one reason or other abandoned by the composer.As many have pointed out , this is not Domingo 's only Don Carlos recording , and in my view , probably his worst recording , though even not at his best , his performance still owns good parts , though at many places the voice is not well-controlled ( especially in the soft passages ) and clear pitch problems set in . The heroic outbursts are still dynamite-like , but the opening Act 's Fontainbleau Scene is a disappointment comparing to his recording ( in Italian ) with Caballe 9 years ago.Katia Ricciarelli does not have any high notes or pitch problem as one reviewer claimed - rather , her intonation is way better than Domingo 's , but her is the reverse of Domingo 's , with her fortissimos lacking the power to carry through the emotional outburst in most places.Other members of the cast are competent , if not outright brilliant.I do not agree that Ghiaurov should be cast as Filippo in Raimondi 's stead , given that the Grand Inquisitor is the most imposing figure in the entire libretto.Generally , the lower voices fare better than the high or middle ones in this performance , but the major problem is that Abbado has too much of a 'seggretational ' approach to the music.His orhestration cuts into the character 's singing parts most in the most ungaining manner in terms of dynamics control , with an immediate result of the singing cast struggling in competition with the orchestration . Domingo suffered the most under this treatment - a direct comparision with Guilini would show up all the difference.Yet further still , the mainly Italian cast does not seem to own the French language . Domingo fares no better , either.If not for its completness , this would be a recording to avoid , given the large amount of better available choices .	-1
This was my first recording of Beethoven 's Ninth . While it has its moments , notably in the finale , I believe there are serious flaws to it that comparison with other great recordings will immediately reveal . This is Karajan 's third recording of the Ninth ; he would go on to make one more . The 1970 's and 1980 's were what I call his & quot ; sheen and gloss & quot ; period ; that is , during these last twenty years of his life , Karajan became concerned with lusciousness of texture as an end in itself . While many people may like this beautiful sound , and it is undeniably beautiful , I do n't . After listening to a performance of a mighty work like the Beethoven Ninth , I expect to emerge emotionally drained but happy . After listening to this recording , or to his & quot ; Tristan und Isolde , & quot ; or any other recording from this period , I feel myself thinking , & quot ; That was nice. & quot ; I ca n't really point out any physical attribute of Karajan 's performance that is either lacking or unnecessary ; it 's the overall intensity and emotion that communicates to me as a listener - in this case , not much . Similarly , the Berlin Philharmonic plays gorgeously , but there 's not much behind the playing . It sounds to me as though Karajan has knocked all the life out of the piece by over-rehearsing . However , many people may find this attractive . It 's inexpensive , gets some fine vocal work ( particularly from Anna Tomowa-Sintow and Jos & eacute ; van Dam ) , and does sound beautiful . The Vienna Singverein sings excellently ( I ca n't understand the complaint about them below ) . But in the end , I just do n't get much out of this recording . If you want a modern recording , my top choice is Sir Colin Davis with the Staatskapelle Dresden on Philips . I 'm not sure that 's available separately , though ; even though I have n't heard it , I feel safe in recommending Abbado 's second version , with Eaglen , Meier , Heppner and Terfel . But if you want the BEST recording , regardless of sound , go for Furtw & auml ; ngler on EMI .	-1
Mutter obviously put her heart in this performance but her upper tones are often shrill , steely and piercing . I have heard her art to much better effect elsewhere . The total disaster of this cd is Karajan 's accompaniment . His old-age tendency to indulge in slow tempi might work well for Wagner operas and R.Strauss , but it is entirely inappropriate here , in one of Tchaikovsky 's liveliest scores ever . Karajan might have imagined that his luxuriant tempi would enhance the beauty of this work . However , given the distanced , low-resonance live-recording venue the overall orchestral effect is very dry and irritating . You are always left wishing he 'd hurry up and get on with the music -- - which he never does , because the contents of this CD are permanent !	-1
This is a prime example of why the historical performance movement is so vital and important . I 'm sure everyone involved with this recording is an accomplished and thoughtful musician , but why anybody would butcher J.S . Bach in this way is beyond me . It is simply wrong to treat & quot ; Wachet Auf & quot ; as if it were a Verdi opera . You may as well score Vivaldi 's famous & quot ; Four Seasons & quot ; concertos from his Op.8 for 1,001 piccolos ( if that has n't been done already ) . The orchestra is too big and clunky , the choir is trying their best to drown out the orchestra , and the direction is heavy handed . I do n't see how people can complain about period instruments when they compare this recording of BWV 140 to Gardiner , Rifkin , or even Harnoncourt - who all treat this music with the graceful touch it requires . I would liken Richter 's approach to swatting a fly with a television set . I also recommend Koopman or Gardiner 's recordings of the Magnificat , though there are many fine versions of that work available . I admit I am prejudiced toward period instruments , but I gave this CD a fair chance and it disappointed . The question of & quot ; what Bach wanted & quot ; is moot , this is not a good performance .	-1
Horowitz would n't know musical phrasing if you put a gun to his head . If you just like to hear shapeless pounding on the keyboard , however , this disc is for you . If not , there are tons of worthwhile alternatives .	-1
The myth that Bernstein is one of the greatest conductors of our age is no more evident than in this Beethoven cycle . The funeral march of the Eroica is so unbelievebly slow ( even by Klemperer standards ) that Bernstein just ca n't keep the tension , it just falls apart . At over 18:00 minutes , the movement just seems to go on forever . The 5th fares better , but the first movement is mannered and stiff , you never feel the excitement and drama that this movement needs . The 6th is also taken at a slow pace and lacks the sunny lightness that Bruno Walter brings to this . The opening of the 7th is so anemic , you have wonder what Bernstein was thinking . If you want to hear how the 7th is done , go with Toscanini . The publicity that Bernstein receives for his conducting is sickening . Just literally compare ANY Bernstein performance to Bohm , Walter , Stokowski , Horenstein and you will hear for yourself how overated Bernstein 's conducting is . If your are looking a complete set of Beethoven symphonies , go with Bruno Walter on Sony .	-1
I am a huge fan of Bernstein 's Mahler . I have no idea of how many times I tried this 5th , but it never goes down smoothly . It is interesting because it is the most famous recording of his DG cycle . I found this recording too dark , colorless , uneven . The most Berstenian interpretation of this symphony is Sinopoli 's . It is in Sinopoli where I can find the drama and vibrant energy , Bernstein 's trademarks but absent from this recording . Sinopoli 's 5th was also infinitely better recorded .	-1
I do n't care for this recording , and had it not been included in the Domingo boxset , would not have vbeen bothered with it.First of all , I like the three leads , especially Liu ( Hendricks ) . Ricciarelli is one of my favourite sopranos , and her Turandot is atypical but acceptable.As for Domingo , though really no Corelli , sounds plangent enough , if sometimes a bit forced . However , I really do n't like the sound balance , especially in ensembles involving the Unknown Prince ( UP ) , where Domingo 's voice is invariably given far TOO MUCH SOLO presence . In the Act 1 , when the UP is being persuaded by the ministers to avoid Turandot , ONLY the voice of the UP is heard , turning the entire scene that paves the way to LIU 's suicide a mere monologue of the UP ( CALAF ) .The voices of Timur , Ping , Pong and Pang could scarcely be heard , so is the chorus . The result is gross dramatic inbalance that robbed the work of its allure.For the three leads , two stars ( Hendricks one , Riccarelli 0.5 , Domingo 0.5 ) .Do n't waste your money .	-1
What a perverse combo ! This is without a doubt the worst recording of this symphony I have ever heard ( I have heard at least 20 ) . The combination of an infantile humor in the dance sections with a grotesque portentousness elsewhere is unique in my music listening experience . It sounds as if the conductor is alternately a drunken Bugs Bunny and Von Karajan at his worst . And does the scherzo plod on and on and on ... Can this be the great Concertgebouw ? They are technically fine , but sound like the backup band for a Jerry Herman show . How did Lenny achieve this ? The musicians must have laughed all the way home.It would be a genuine shame if someone coming to this music for the first time judged it by this distorted egomaniacal performance . Instead , try Kubelik , Haitink 1 or Walter . Or for moments of true Mahlerian genius , listen to Horenstein , if you can find it .	-1
Leonard Bernstein adopted some SLOW tempos in his late DG recordings . For me , this , the Tchaikovsky 'Pathetique ' and the Elgar 'Enigma ' Variations go too far , beyond 'conductor 's discretion ' and almost render the works unrecognizable . I guess this is worth hearing once if you mainly want 'different ' , but there are plenty of recordings of merit inhabiting the mainstream of this highly familiar work .	-1
It 's funny . I can deal with slow tempi ( for some works ) , but not for others . For Dvorak , I can not handle slow . Especially for his 9th . Even more especially for the finale , which needs to whirl and dance to be effective . After a really slow opening movement , Lenny kicks it down another notch for the slow movement and Finale , which is unacceptable . As a result , the slow movement sounds bloated , and the Finale just plain lame . The scherzo is the only highlight here , as Lenny comes back to life momentarily , but he has trouble maitaining the energy for the full movement and tempo is unsteady . The Israel Philharmonic is sloppy too , probably because they 're all falling asleep while Lenny schmaltzes every last ounce of syrup he can out of each note . I can not recommend this disc , even to Lenny fans , because this is not Dvorak 's 9th . It 's Lenny 's 9th , and it is way too slow . Well , I guess if you are a Lenny apologist , you should look into getting a used copy cheap , but you need to understand the man was probably 75 years old and running at half-speed when this was recorded.I gave this a 2 only because Dvorak 's 9th will never be a 1-star experience for me . The recording sound is typical early digital ... harsh , muffled , stale .	-1
Wiener Melange is a sickly conconction , an insipid , limp travesty of real coffee . And so it is with Mr Rieu 's brand of music . All watery sweetness smothered under a thick blanket of froth , visually attractive , but ultimately lacking in substance . Those who insist on skimmed milk , greenhouse tomatoes , McDonald 's french fries and Foster 's lager will no doubt find this the last word in entertainment . Those whose tastebuds have not yet been corrupted to respond exclusively to the common denominator will not really find this to their taste .	-1
For Ivo Pogorelich , slowness is deemed a great asset.For listeners , this is more controversial.Ivo has a very burnishing tone . If used to good ends , yields immaculate performances.More often , however , he has quite funny ideas about how a piece/pieces should be played.I would bet that he spends hours and hours pondering on how a piece 'should be ' played . In the process , he ends up losing touch with the innate musically of the work ( s ) .As with the case of those on the odd-way-out , his methodology draws a bunch of stunch followers.Undoubtedly he is talented , but at the same time , he has too little respect to the composers the works he played.This set of Preludes opens with a hiccuping piece that is enough to chase listeners away , and ends with a blurred ( but not stormy ) piece that would seal the views of opposers.The truth , however , is somewhere in between - neither is Ivo so 'odd ' , nor is he so 'uncommon'.My testimony , after listening to most of his recorded works , is that he is one of those chaps whom the Chinese saying says `` would not lay in peace without resort to shocks '' .Shocking for shock 's sake , however , is cheap , more so in the field of fine art like music than anywhere else .	-1
I was recently in search of the best L'Elisir d'amore that I could find . Because Pavarotti was admired as the Donizetti tenor par excellence , his two recordings , early and late , were obvious contenders . The Decca version has always been preferred , thanks to the freshness and charisma of Pavarotti 's singing - he owned Una furtiva lagrima for decades - but as much as Sutherland is beloved , her Adina is girlish or light ; she tries hard to bring the right comic tone , and even her notorious pronunciation is improved - but a second drawback for me is Bonynge 's conducting , although he too tries hard to bring rhythmic life to his ordinarily slack style . Of course , the testimony of countless fans sees beyond these limitations - so be it.The later DG L'elisir corrects the weak points in the earlier with alert , expert conducting by Levine and Battle 's utterly charming Adina , her voice and characterization a delight . But Pavarotti ! This recording dates from a series of live Met performances that began in 1989 ( there 's a met release in MP3 at various download sites ) , and the great tenor 's voice had grown creaky and threadbare - to me , it 's painful to hear . When the lead singer is unacceptable , so is the entire performance . Apparently this is n't the case for the enthusiastic reviewers here , but newcomers should be warned . I bought the set sight unseen and threw it away .	-1
I 've encountered a surprising number of people who rave about this recording of Pictures at an Exhibition , so I was excited to hear it , but it proved completely disappointing . The New York Philharmonic could be one of the best orchestras in the world today , but they just do n't play like a team.While the strings and winds are generally quite good on this recording ( and particularly the winds in the Ravel ) , the New York Philharmonic brass section is especially problematic . If they played with their best sounds , accurately produced what Mussorgsky wrote , and responded to Sinopoli 's interpretation , this would have been a fantastic performance . Instead , they 're constantly overblowing , to the point that they sound either angry or like they 're trying to assert their insecure manhood , and are constantly holding notes past the written lengths , which bleeds into other textures and ruins harmonies . This alone makes this particular performance unbearable.I had hoped they might redeem themselves with `` Night on Bald Mountain '' or `` Valses nobles et sentimentales , '' but was sorely disappointed . More of the same.Do n't get me wrong : I like a powerful brass section . However , there must be taste , musicality , and musicianship . For that , and for a fine performance of Pictures at an Exhibition with a powerful brass section , I find Solti 's recording with the Chicago Symphony far more rewarding , and Solti 's interpretation better-paced .	-1
What a tub of lard ! I do n't see how anyone could listen to this record with pleasure . It is an assault on all which faithful musicians and composers hold dear to them . Just take a look at the score while you 're listening to this music , and you 'll see my point . For starters , this is one of the longest performances of Beethoven 's 9th on record . The first movement is 18 minutes long , and the 2nd almost 11 with a repeat omitted . The third movement is an astounding 20 minutes long . Bernstein takes this literally at half tempo , as he always does with important adagio movements that have `` much to exploit . '' And then comes the big finale - 28 and a half minutes . All told - a 78 minute long symphony . Average performances clock in at about 70 minutes ; faster performances which follow Beethoven 's metronome markings are about 60 minutes long . So , Bernstein was `` just a little slow '' , eh ? Sure . Two minutes longer and Deutsche Grammophon would 've had to market this performance using two CDs . ( And what a pity for them . They would have made a killing off of it for sure . ) That 's just the tip of the iceburg . Rhythmic intensity and accuracy are thrown completely out of the window . Everything is blunted to a fault . Bernstein 's pickup orchestra , some of the best musicians from the best orchestras in the world , lose their footing because they are not used to beating Beethoven about the head as Bernstein has them do here . There are numerous mistakes - some are noticeable , some are more hidden . These folks do not play as an ensemble , and who would expect them to , with all the different styles present ? One might expect that Bernstein , faced with this dilemma , might be sensible enough to give them some direction as to how to articulate similarly - or at all for that matter . Not the case here . He just trusts that everyone will understand how things go , attempting to hammer out something resembling a phrase through sheer force of will . The orchestra responds with careless and sloppy playing . Harmonic progressions are lost amidst a sea of angry robotic ostinatos . There is no shape or balance to the music . The poetry is gone . Bernstein gesticulates and says , `` Here you go , be inspired , '' but they do n't know how . On the rare occasion that a bit of unique and interesting music is made , it is completely out of context and of a character not suited to this symphony.Another side effect of lousy direction is one of the most complete structural collapses in the history of the 9th ( how fitting , considering what is being commemorated here ) . Bernstein 's failure to acknowledge this symphony as more than just a bunch of spliced 2-measure character pieces wreaks havoc on the musicality . There is no forward drive , no anticipation of the next musical idea that blooms from the previous one . There is no continuity . The fire dies . `` Oh , but wait ! '' the other reviewers would say . `` There is much fire in these performances ! Just listen to the climaxes ! Heavens , what energy ! '' Well , Bernstein inciting his musicians to play extremely loudly does not equate with a real energetic performance . A string quartet could play with more intensity than this lost group . Bernstein does n't stoke up the fire , but instead sears us in the back with a hot branding iron.This recording can be summed up as being retrograde . Instead of setting free emotions and thoughts of joy and freedom , this performance inhibits them . I 'm not sure how the Berlin audience could get through the concert without crying from sheer boredom and irritation . I see no joy here , only a languid , aggravating and oppressive mish-mash of bad execution and bad interpretation . You may certainly buy this because of the occasion , but what is the point of celebrating if the music itself wo n't even let you do that ? Do n't waste your time on this .	-1
This is without a doubt one of the worst Brahms 1st symphonies ever recorded . Not only does Bernstein take an unbelievably slow pace , he insists on taking the exposition repeat . Then in the 4th movement , the tempi is so slow , the whole symphonic structure just falls apart . Bernstein is so self indulgent that the performance is just one ego trip . Bernstein 's entire Brahms cycle for DG with the Vienna Philharmonic is just a disaster . Do not believe the two rave reviews also posted here . Brahms is not Bernstein 's specialty . Go with Bruno Walter on Sony , or Horenstein on Chesky to here the proper way to conduct this symphony . The whole performance is just a disaster !	-1
OK , I understand the historic importance of this being Bernstein 's only appearance ever during his life with the Berlin Philharmonic ( presumably owing to Karajan 's jealousy ) , but I can not believe this recording qualifies to be issued in the ( mostly ) excellent `` Originals '' series.There are numerous technical goofs during this recording , but I only need mention one that should still disqualify this recording from `` The Originals '' , even if the rest of the recording was flawless : In the fourth movement , at the climax of the entire symphony , the trombones are playing a previous theme from earlier in the symphony , fortissimo ( maximum volume ) , which is supposed to be a counterpoint to what the rest of the orchestra is doing . But guess what ? For some inexplicable reason , the Berlin trombones simply do n't play on this recording ! It is THE worst error I have ever heard on a recording of a professional orchestra in my entire life , and I 've heard some doozies , but this one trumps them all . It 's doubly shocking coming from the mighty Berliner Philharmoniker.Considering that Karajan recorded this same symphony not once , but twice , shortly after Bernstein left town , and both of those recordings are generally considered to be among the finest ever made of this piece , it makes no sense whatsoever for DG to choose this one for the `` Originals '' series.I suppose I just really am that much of a perfectionist . The DDD Karajan recording is ( to my ears ) one of the finest performances ever recorded by any orchestra , regardless of what one thinks of Karajan 's interpretation ( which I greatly admire , BTW ) . When I listen to that recording , I ca n't imagine any orchestra doing it better - it was a truly flawless performance . Gramophone Magazine called the BPO the `` eighth wonder of the world '' as a result of that Karajan recording , and I was similarly impressed . And Karajan 's DDD was live , recorded in one take , just like the 1979 Bernstein recording . The flaws in the Bernstein are , to me , too much of a distraction by comparison.Having read Mahler 's biography , I 'm quite certain that he would be shooting daggers with his eyes at the speakers ( once he got over the astonishment of the technology , of course : - ) ) every time he heard anything going wrong , just as he used to do while he was conducting . And there are just so many other absolutely wonderful recordings where we do n't have to settle for such a rough performance . There 's Giulini/Chicago , Solti/Chicago , Haitink/Amsterdam , Chailly/Amsterdam , Sinopoli/Philharmonia , Barbirolli/Berlin , Rattle/Berlin , Abbado/Berlin , Abbado/Vienna , Levine/Philadelphia , just to name a few , in addition to the Karajan recordings and Bernstein 's others . I just do n't see why it 's necessary to consider this one as the five-star recording when there are so many alternatives that ( to my ears ) are easily better . That 's just my opinion.I fully recognize ( and respect ) that not everybody else would agree with it . However , I would point out that I have not gone into anybody else 's five-star review here on this page and given them any blistering comments about `` how dare '' they give this recording five stars , because I respect their right to have a different opinion . It would be nice if my right to not worship at the feet of Bernstein would also be respected . ( By the way , I think very highly of Bernstein 's other recordings . His DDD Mahler 3rd and DDD Mahler 5th are my favorite recordings of those symphonies . ) This is indeed a historically important recording that no Mahler fan should be without . But for the novice collector looking for their first Mahler Nine , you would do better to consider an alternative . If you want the Berlin Philharmonic doing Mahler 9 , get either of the Karajan versions . ( The DDD version from the 1982 Berlin FestivalGustav Mahler : Symphonie No . 9is my favorite . ) If you want Bernstein doing Mahler 9 , get either his older , analogue version with the New York PhilharmonicMahler : Symphony No . 9 ( considered by many to be his best Mahler 9 ) , or his DDD version with Amsterdam 's Concertgeboux Orchestra.Mahler : Symphony No.9Then , afterward , this version would certainly make for a very interesting comparison experience , but I 'm quite certain that Mahler himself would much prefer a first-time listener to hear a version that does n't leave out part of the climax .	-1
Before everyone tar and feathers me and runs me out of town on a rail , please let me explain about my review . Kathleen has one of the true great voices . I would put her among the top five sopranos in the world . She is ever bit as good as Jessye Norman , Barbara Hendricks , Kiri Te Kanawa , Lesley Garrett at el.Geting back to my review , well her voice was definetly a ten . The only reason that I rated this cd a two was because most of the songs were from the classical venue . Do n't get me wrong , I really like classical music , but my preference is classical music that is performed instrumentaly not vocally.I did n't think it helped that this cd was recorded live . I had much rather hear a studio project.Recommendation : I think Kathleens ' fans should buy this cd .	-1
I agree with the reviewer who wrote that this recording sounds & quot ; wrong from the start & quot ; .But Ekkehard Wlaschiha is great as Klingsor . If you 're into wagner 's baritone villians , you have to hear him do it . He 's one of the best contemporary character baritones . Listen to his alberich on Sawallich 's RING ( on EMI ) or watch him in Levine 's video RING or watch him as Telramund on the Schneider video of Lohengrin ( with Werner herzog 's scenery ) . His Klingsor is right up there .	-1
This is a stunningly clear , perfect , precise reading of the concerto and Four Orchestral Pieces , wherein Boulez demonstrates he has stick technique that 's perhaps the finest out there . The violin glissandi in the second movement of the Concerto are particularly exciting and vividly captured by DG . But while he sees not just the trees , but the leaves , the bark and the twigs , he misses the forest completely . These works lack the folksy-excitement of Bartok . It 's Bartok under glass . It 's a conductor who knows everything there is to know about music -- except how to have fun with it . These are pieces of almost unbearable contrast -- from mysterious to joyful to blistering to serene . They 're not just a test of technique for the conductor but a test of conceptionization as well . Boulez 's own earlier take on the music was much better , but for a real treat , hear Dorati and the LSO on Mercury Living Presence , and compare him to Boulez . Pierre , lighten up !	-1
I 've tried hard to like this set , being a huge fan of the Vienna Philharmonic , but Karl Bohm 's direction is SO slow that it robs the music of all sense of forward movement . The 6th , in particular , is almost coma-inducing . On balance , I prefer Claudio Abbado 's under-appreciated cycle with the same orchestra , although Abbado 's 6th is a bit slow for my taste as well .	-1
I did not need another Otello , much less one with the same Otello as my other one . I guess it was Cheryl Studer that lured me into this . And indeed her performance is good , more than capable but not great.This is not the best Otello of Domingo on record-for me that would be the one with Milnes and Scotto , a cast that I saw perform it on several occasions and each performance was rapturous . Two problems with this set : there is no chemistry between the performers and more important it is sloppily conducted . Chung conducts as if he is late for something and is hurrying to get out of the studio and on to his next appointment . The first act flies by so fast it seems to be over before it begins.Anyone want to buy a second hand copy ?	-1
I 'll just be clear . This is not a good recording and you can find and listen to much MUCH better work from Czech conductors such as Smetacek , Talich , and Ancerl.Kubelik 's `` Vltava '' ( NOT Moldau ) with the Boston Symphony is wonderful.I thought `` Santa Fe '' listener would appreciate me using his uneducated jab as a title for my dislike of this CD.Oh , I forgot , Karajan is untouchable .	-1
Take a look at the picture and the forces involved in a recording of Mahler 's 8th . Then take note of the names of the performers.This should have been a roaring success , with all the glamorous personnel involved.Instead it turned out to be crushing disappointment.On one hand , the performance is as grand and powerful as one could wish . But this work is a challenge not only to the musicians . It is also a challenge to the sound recording staff , and I 'm afraid to say they failed us . Many recordings of this work put the 300-odd performers in a cardboard box ; but what happened here I can not explain except by `` the art of pushing dials '' on the part of some utterly unmusical people . The orchestral sound is so hard and dry and entirely without its natural resonance in a big hall that after half an hour of close listening your nerves begin to complain about this torment of your ears . The organ sounds like a cheap imitation of a real one , as if the computer was employed to add it . There is no distance between orchestra and chorus , so there is a conflict between what you see and what you hear . It adds up to a most unnatural aural perspective and extremely irritating to anyone who has ever heard a fiddle or a trumpet or a singer in real life.At most , therefore , this recording will serve only for sampling moments . When you come to it from the magnificent soundscape of the Solti recording , it is like coming out of a refreshing shower into a concrete box . This is not making the big point that overrides all other considerations , namely that Solti 's is much the superior performance as well . This is not even mentioned that the almost ancient Kubelik recording of this work , also from the DGG stable , does n't sound anywhere near as bad.Thus enjoyment , at least for my money , is not on the bill of fare with this recording . Best sample yourself , extensively , before you make your decision . I for one regret having taken the plunge without sampling or attending to a trustworthy review !	-1
Call it alaienation , I d n't know , but when they got together , Argerich and Kremer found themselves of like mind : Beehoven should be performed with no romance or heroism , with stark , edgy tone and banging accents . It 's not my kind of Beethoven at all , so I will stck with Perlamn/Ashkenazy on Decca for both works .	-1
In order to upset the scale towards the minus side ( to the found wanted ) I have to draw your attention all , to the fact that the sound of this CD is annoying : It is the sound that killed DGG reputation in the late sixties and in the seventies.The recording is taken a bit too far from the orchestra - which gives rise to the GLASSY huge of the Berlin hall with its STRANGE reverberation.The Hall sonic properties by themselves are too bright and returns a vague diffused acoustics . This hall is certainly not in the same league as the Concertgebouw hall , the Chicago old hall , the Vienna `` shoe-box '' hall , the Kingsway-hall , London , and others ... The microphones DGG used were the `` nazzal '' -sounding Nuemans-brand.Should this interpretation have been recorded in a better hall with a more talented sound engineers ( not adhering to the DGG sound-policy of that time , that said that all DGG recording should sound good on any playback system ... and you know what means ... it means medicare ... ) Should this policy have been ignored , we would have had a magnificent account of Beethoven nine.As it is - it is an irritating sound that would make one turn somewhere else for a better recordings of this work : consider SOLTI Chicago affair ( twice on Decca - one ADD , the other DDD ) , consider an EMI recording or so - but certainly not this one , for your ear 's sake .	-1
I 'm sorry to disagree with the rest of the reviewers but this recording of the Verdi Requiem conducted by Ferenc Fricsay just can not compete with some of the other recordings that are currently available.Obviously the mono sound bothers me much more than the other reviewers . For me , the mono sound loses much of the impact and texture of Verdi 's score . Also , the orchestra , chorus , and soloists are not as good as most of the other recordings I own of this work.The Verdi Requiem is one of my all time favorites and I listen to it at least once a month . My favorite recording is the one conducted by Giuilini/BPO , closely followed by Reiner/CSO . I would also rank Giullini/Philharmonia , Solti/VPO , Shaw/ASO , and Barbirolli/New Philharmonia above this recording.Maybe I 'm missing something that the other reviewers find special but I found this recording disappointing .	-1
Wunderlich was a great lieder singer , and he did record a brilliant version of Die Schone Mullerin . But this is n't it.This version is loud and coarse . The recording is boom-y when it should be intimate . The pianist takes everything too slowly , loses the driving force and the musical thread , and inserts a disruptive ritardando just about every other phrase.The great recording of this cycle by Wunderlich used to be on Nonesuch . The pianist was Kurt Heinz Stolze . And it 's a wonder of musicianship and drama . The rhythms are driving without being pounding . The sound is intimate and lyrical . Everything moves forward . Subtle changes in speed and volume help tell the story . The accompaniment makes both a springboard and a fabric which supports Wunderlich as he embroiders it -- to mix metaphors.God only knows where that other recording got to . Probably something about the distribution rights has it mired in a legal limbo . I 've seen the CD advertised -- on Amazon , even -- but I 've never seen it in the flesh.Given DG 's enormous industrial power , they , of course , have been able to put over the idea that this recording is the standard bearer.Do n't believe the hype.This is the phony .	-1
In my opinion , this CD is awful . Would never recommend it for any purpose ... certainly NOT relaxing ! In fact , it made me feel very depressed and wasactually so irritating I got rid of it !	-1
The other two reviewers here give high praise to this recording . If its the only version of these two works you have heard I can understand why , but having heard numerous versions of these works both recorded and live I must say that these renditions are not at the level I am used to . One would think that with the Chicago Symphony at his disposal Abbado would let loose a little more , but instead of a blazing interpretation we get a rather tame , definetly non-Mahlerian piece of hash . Abbado never really lets the brass shine the way they could and the recording quality is sub-par for DG . As for the recording of the fourth symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic , I was even more dissapointed than with the Ressurection symphony . Very dull sounding and lacking a lot of character found in other renditions . All in all not an invalid interpretation of these two works , but you can certainly do A LOT better than this .	-1
Pierre Boulez frequently returns to the repertoire that established him in the Seventies on the Columbia/Sony label . He made an acclaimed Symphonie fantastique back then , but this 1997 remake is mystifying . It 's so inert , undernourished , and detached that one ca n't imagine the conductor had any interest in the performance . Yet every bar is under control , and the Cleveland Orch . plays suprbly , so boulez had something in mind . He is n't simply drifting . Did he want to bring out the classical side of an arch-romantic ( Berlioz was a great admirer of Gluck ) ? If so , it was perverse to pick a work that demands color , atmosphere , and dramatic contrast , all the things utterly lacking here .	-1
One of the great mysteries in life has to be why metal scribe Martin Popoff ( 'The Collector 's Guide to Heavy Metal ' ) dismisses Bathory 's first four albums ( including ... 'Blood Fire Death ' ) as `` vacuum-cleaner-with-drums ... metal '' and loves First , the production and mix : the worst of any Bathory album , including 'Requiem ' ; thin guitars andnoisy biscuit-tin drums that are borderline unlistenable ... it almost strikes me that Quorthon is trying to artificially recreate the garage feel of the Heavenshore days , but he forgot to include the chainsaw on steroids and the vomit vocals . And speaking of vocals ... yeesh . Utterly tuneless shouting and without either the sickness or the vitriol he 's known for . The songs : like leftovers from 'Requiem ' with ridiculous social commentary ( `` Century '' is utterly insipid ) or lyrics that are just over-the-top disgusting ( `` 33 Something '' , which describes John Wayne Gacy 's sex murders in repulsively explicit detail ) . Did Quorthon REALLY want this album to come out this way ? 'Octagon ' is so bad that it has actually discouraged me from plopping down my ( cash ) to check out 'Destroyer of Worlds ' , and anyone who questions my devotion to this band is advised to check out my other reviews . I heartily encourage any young black metal devotee who has n't heard a Bathory album before to check 'em out ... but avoid this one like the plague .	-1
I owned a couple vinyl copies of this album from back in the day , and I know it well . It was one of my favorite Christmas albums as a kid . I knew something was up the minute I saw that they had photoshopped a new Santa Claus dress on the cover model to cover up the crease of her butt . This is not the original album cover.Some of the arrangements on the tracks were also changed , and not for the better . In fact , some of them sound pretty bad . The new Silent Night is just one example -- with that awful acoustic piano drowning out everything else . That piano piece is an overdub . It was not in the original recording . Overall , the timbral quality of the sound on this CD is 'tinny ' , as though they had held up a transistor radio to a tape recorder to re-record the music . Somebody attempted to re-engineer the original and messed up the sound quality pretty badly . This CD lacks the heavy , throbbing rhythm and bass that the vinyl LP had . Yet another example of a classic ruined by some fool 's attempt to modernize it.If you want the real SalSoul Christmas Jollies that was originally released in 1976 you 're either going to have to hunt for a vintage vinyl copy or look for a CD print that was NOT `` re-mastered '' by the jokers who released this version . This looks and kinda sounds like the original Salsoul production , but it is n't .	-1

I was listening to the magnificient percussion andoverall sound of this double release , from 2000 , # 469 169-2 , when throughout the 1st CD , which opens up with the Mussorgskynumber PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION , there 's an irritatingmusician in the room , exhibiting signs of a bad whooping cough , thereby totally destroying the 20 minutes or so recording ! There are many soft passages throughout the number , andit is just incredible that DEUTSCHE GRAMMOPHON allowed thebad caugh distractions and irritations ( cough ! cough ! cough ! ) to stay on the tape ! Unbelievable ! It 's so bad , I thought about unloading thisart work , at a second hand music store for a buck and a half , although I surely paid more than $ 20 for this double CD releasea few years ago.I do n't care much for the vocal pieces , either.Aside from that , the remainder of the release is very strong , so ... I ca n't bring myself to unload it ... .yet , anyway .	-1
I used to love the Cramps.When I first heard `` human fly '' , it sounded so nasty , so sleazy , so intoxicating . My hard rocking friends hated it which made me like it even more.I had a girlfriend who opined that `` it was the worst song she had ever heard '' . What a boost ! I saw them live circa 1979 . They were wild ! Lux Interior was ferocious shoving the microphone up his ass , scratching himself and slithering on stage . Poison Ivey was so sexy strumming her Green Gretsch and totalling ignoring the chaotic singer . Bryan Gregory was still with them picking on a black Gibson Explorer . He looked freaky ... and was a freak ... he left the band soon after to join some freaky cult . `` Gravest Hits '' , `` Songs the Lord Taught Us '' and `` Psychodelic Jungle '' received a lot of plays on my turntable and cassette player.That was then ... this is now.While I appreciate the whole gutteral , voodoo , psychobilly vibe , the music is essentially just a novelty and no longer sounds relevant . Most of the songs sound the same and listening to this stuff gets old , really fast . The most melodic songs work the best ... Garbageman , Goo Goo Muck , Human Fly and TV Set are the standouts.This is a compilation meaning these are supposed to be standouts . I feel that their earlier material ( when they were a more earnest band ) is of higher quality than their latter stuff ( it seems they were just adhering to a formula . ) The Cramps must be appreciated for the moment they were in rather than having an enduring quality . The Ramones they were not !	-1
How is it that so many people think this album is great ? I 'm a fan of the Go go 's and I finally got this album . I 've heard some tracks here and there throughout the years . After listening to the complete album , I must say , the only reason I think they actually got their status was due to them being young female rockers with elements of pop . In my opinion , they did n't master their sound until after the broke up . This is evident on 'Return to the Valley of the Go go 's ' . You can hear in the arrangements of the music and vocals that the texture in the playing , along with Belinda 's vocal performance was more refined and listenable.As for Beauty and the Beat , I 'm completely disappointed . Belinda 's singing is awful on some of these tracks , very pitchy and off-key . A lot of the band 's work is also slightly out of tune . Their was n't the best harmony in their debut . Belinda even said it , along with the others , that they were pretty much self-tought , and some of their playing/singing was off . She also stressed that because it was the 'punk days ' they could get away with not knowing how to play , because 'it was punk ' . Well , let me just add to that , she tells no lies . It 's necessarily the songs or lyrics . I think the songs could 've been better if Belinda was more vocally trained , and the band was more in shape . Their most developed sound were the three new songs from 1994 's Valley of the Go go 's , and 'Bless the Go go 's from 2001 . I think if they were in this shape while recording this album , it 'd be so.much better . As for this album , I could do without it . Everytime Belinda trys to hit those high note 's I cringe and squint my eyes . I ca n't be the only one who knows that 'We got thee beat ' is played too high for Belinda 's vocal , you can hear that she sounds forced as if she 's struggling . I 'm pretty sure she was out of breath and winded after that recording session ... I also noticed how some of the songs have a very pop-country sound to them . Belinda sings with a twang as well throughout this album . Fading fast isa great example of this	-1
We are giant Tallis Scholars fans , and hear them live whenever they are in town.We have heard Spem at least once , perhaps twice , live . sounded great.But this recording has the most wretched soprano screeching I have ever heard . At least one of them sounds as if she is forcing a too-loud falsetto . I do n't know if she is to blame , or Peter Phillips , or the recording engineers , but it is awful . Reminds me of the early days of CDs played on cheap systems.My favorite Spem is David Wulstan and the Clerkes of Oxenford on LP . I also have the CD transcription , and it is a close second .

Although Bad Religion formed in 1980 , they seem to fit in with the punk revival scene of the 1990 's rather than the original hardcore punk scene.Their first album , `` How Could Hell Be Any Worse '' which was released in 1982 , was dwarfed by the competition in Southern California by such bands as Black Flag , the Circle Jerks , Social Distortion , and the Descendents.In 1983 , they released `` Into the Unknown , '' which was an attempt at cheesy progressive rock that was heavy on the synthesizers . That album pretty much ended their relationship with the hardcore community and was such an embarrassment that they wo n't re-release it.Bad Religion was ignored until 1988 when they released `` Suffer '' to a new generation of hardcore fans . At that point in time , hardcore punk was pretty much dead and Bad Religion was one of the only bands around at the time playing that style of music , so they were successful without any competition . `` Against the Grain '' is considered to be the peak of Bad Religion 's career . Once again , they were still one of the only bands around playing punk so there was n't much to compare it to and that was a good thing for them because it 's a weak record.The style of punk they play is very pop . The only thing that gives it a punk edge is the speed , but it 's not raw and angry like earlier hardcore . Some say the lyrics are very angry , but it 's tough to find the anger through the `` whoa-whoa-whoas '' and `` aye-aye-ayes ' . `` There 's nothing wrong with using a harmonized and melodic pop rock vocal style , if you do n't intend to be taken seriously . The Misfits and the Descendents could pull off the pop vocal style because they generally sung about humorous and outlandish things.Bad Religion sings about serious issues , but delivers it in an upbeat way which really kills any impact their message may have.The music that backs the computer geek sound of the vocals is all about speed and almost seems bouncy at times . `` 21st Century Digital Boy '' is the best song by far , but it 's ruined by the vocals . All the rest of the songs basically sound the same.There are plenty of '80 's hardcore records out there that are far superior to anything Bad Religion has ever recorded . The '90 's revival of punk had nothing new to offer the genre , so go straight to the source and listen to Black Flag , the Misfits , and the Dead Kennedys , who were original and sincere .	-1
The Offspring often start off their live shows by announcing that they play & quot ; dumb punk rock & quot ; . No argument here- that 's what they do a lot of the time . Now , the Ramones never exactly claimed to be geniuses , which enables the & quot ; dumb punk rock & quot ; label to be a badge of honor of sorts . The Offspring are actually at their best when they are n't dumb . Basic maybe , but not dumb . Witness & quot ; Self Esteem & quot ; , a funny-as-hell ditty about self-worth -- basic lyrics with basic music . Pick your spots carefully with this album , some songs are a lot better than others . Not bad overall , but not smashing .	-1
I 've grown tired of what people are telling me is punk . Evidentally if you dress in all black and mope around all the time you are punk . You also have to pierce yourself a lot and pretend you do n't like things the rest of society likes . Cry me a river . That to me is n't punk at all . I 'm so punk it 's hard to believe . I walk out of my house most mornings in a baby blue leisure suit , burger king crown and sperry topsiders . I then ride a big wheel to work that I 've modified to fit my growth . I ride my big wheel on the interstate with people honking at me . Do I care ? No , because I 'm what punk is really about . Punk is about doing something no one else does , not wearing black makeup . Punk is walking through a drive thru and ordering some rancid sauerkraut in an ice cream cone . When they tell you they do n't have it , you scream like a banshee into their speaker until the worker 's ears bleed . When the manager comes out , you start quacking like a duck and running windsprints . That my friends is punk .	-1
Nofx 's `` punk in drublic '' is just like every other stupid punk rock band ... It sucks . I dont see how this genre cna look at themselfes after listining to such disgrace.If you want real music ? Listing to some gore/grind ! Punk rock blows .	-1
Overrated , craptastic , name dropper band . They stole Minor Threats CD cover too and added a mohawk ( WTF ? ! ) Plus the lead singer helped Pink out with her new album , so think about this before you go trying to call Rancid a great punk band , the early stuff was great the new stuff is not .	-1
From the cover of this CD to the music on the disc , `` And Out Come the Wolves '' is a polished , unoriginal album.Two of Rancid 's members came from a great punk/ska band called Operation Ivy , who never recorded a bad song . Rancid 's first two albums were descent , but they were nothing special . `` And Out Come the Wolves '' was a dictionary definition of a sellout . A year earlier ( 1994 ) , punk had been officially murdered by Green Day 's and the Offspring 's commercial success . Even Bad Religion had signed to a major label . Punk was destroyed completely.First , the `` Roots Radicals '' single came out which was a descent punk song . When `` And Out Come the Wolves '' was released , it contained a different version of `` Roots Radicals '' and it did n't even sound like the same song . The sound of the guitars were so polished that it sounded like Motley Crue . In the background , there were melodic vocals mixed in and at one point you can hear Lars Fredrickson go `` Oh-e-oh-e-oh '' . What was that ? Other parts of the album were just horrible Clash rip-offs . The Clash were not really even a punk band , but they were a critically acclaimed rock band . Maybe Rancid was trying to get critical acclaim.For people that think the cover is original , take a look at the cover of the Minor Threat E.P . ( also used for the Complete Discography CD ) that was released over ten years earlier . It looks like they took the original picture , drew a Mohawk on the head with a marker , and then released it as their own.It 's rumored that the only reason Rancid stayed with their original independent record label , Epitaph , is because they offered the band more money than the competing major label record companies . The official story is that Rancid stayed with Epitaph because they offered more artistic creativity in their contract . Judging by the sound of this album and Rancid 's MTV success , it seems the rumors were true .	-1
Rancid - ... And Out Come The Wolves ( 1995 ) These punks really wear their Clash influence on their sleeves . It 's not a bad influence to have ; hard-core and ska are worthy genres as well . Rancid do it with conviction and do it well , particularly the bass player.The main problem is I hardly ever make it through this entire CD . There 's almost no point because the songs sound so much alike . I can understand people going crazy for this music ( at least for a little while ) , but Rancid 's style and songwriting powers , at least on this album , are pretty limited .	-1
Ska sucks , this `` new '' lame excuse for punk is just made to sell to idiots dumb enough to buy it ( like my brother ) basically everyone who says they like this is a poser . great job ! ^_^	-1
when you compare this to albums like & quot ; Milo Goes To College & quot ; ... .this is extremely poppy ... ... this is radio friendly cheese pop in the same style as Blink 182 ... .the Descendents never did have the punkest lyrics , but back in the 80 's they were an extremely hyperactive band knocking out fast punk songs , most of them under 20 seconds . This album is way to commercial and cheesy , and EVERYTHING SUCKS on it .	-1
What is the point in having supposedly humorous lyrics if you ca n't even make out what the hell the guy 's singing ? He sings as if he has got cotton-wool shoved up both his nostrils and his microphone 's getting on a bit ... I mean , I 've heard poorer , but still , this album flops out of your hand and dribbles onto the floor where is festers and begins to smell , whilst emanating a rather strange guitary kind of sound.The only song that actually rose a little detection of a smile to my face was the `` Murder the government '' one , whatever it is called.This is definitely not an album for talent , not an album for humour , and not an album to buy . Consider taking your money to other better bands . I hate punk and especially this album .	-1
To me , Information Society is one of the best bands to come out of the synth-pop era from the '80 's . Back in the & quot ; What 's on your mind & quot ; days , Kurt Harland had a unique style , a captivating voice and real talent for keyboard programming and sampling as well as for songwriting . I 've always loved that band , and recently I decided to rediscover their music by purchasing some of their albums . Fortunatley , when I came across the latest and fourth one , Do n't be afraid , I listened to all the songs samples to decide whether to buy the album or not . Well , as you may expect , I did n't . Do n't be afraid is a huge disapointment and has nothing to please InSoc fans who prefered the earlier sound . It 's nowhere near what we were used to hear from Kurt : this album is industrial gothic , not dance/synth-pop . I would n't go as far as saying that he was on drugs when he recorded it , but he obvioulsy made the decision to resent his InSoc past and take his music on a whole new direction . Whether he succeeded or not in doing it is up to the listener , but personnally , I hate this album , it 's far to eerie and dark for my taste . Another reviewer suggested that Kurt was probably going through a very dark phase in his life when he did this album . It was released in 1997 , and we have n't heard from Kurt since , but if he ever puts another album out , let 's all hope it will bring back his techno roots instead of that horrible gothic sound . Just do n't listen to it before going to bed , it 'll give you nightmares , the kind Kurt must have every night since InSoc have broken up ...	-1
THIS is InSoc ? Here 's a hint , Kurt : If I wanted to listen to ( badly done ) Front 242 , I 'd pick up one of their CDs . I ca n't figure out what they were trying to accomplish here . If Kurt wanted to release a dark , depressing album , at least he could have done it in his own name and not call it Information Society . But instead he decides to alienate half his fans ( if not more ) by making a complete departure from his trademark style . Do n't get me wrong , I have nothing against gothy techno kind of stuff . And this album does bear a slight passing resemblance to the first ( apparently unofficial ) InSoc release ... the one with the giant & quot ; I & quot ; on it . But for a band that is constantly hovering on the edge of obscurity , this was a bad move . I am begging you , please bring back the techno/synth happy stuff and the clever samples for the next album ( if there IS a next one ! ) , okay Kurt ? This stuff is just depressing .	-1
This is a 2 CD set that comes in a standard double wide jewel case with a carboard sleeve . It has a nice booklet and poster . The first disc is live and about 55 minutes long . The second disc is studio recordings and is about 40 minutes long . The sound quality is very good to excellent , but the audience noise is cranked up too high in some places on the live disc . The sound quality is a surprise because all Yes CDs before these releases had poor sound quality . CDs like Big Generator were just horrible.This and Keys to Ascension 1 and a DVD are available in a complete boxset now.The live music is from a few nights when the band just reformed . This band is Anderson , Wakeman , White , Howe and Squire . This particular group had n't played together in almost 20 years and the last `` Yes '' had n't played for 3 years , and they were AWHB . The group just got together and hurriedly did this concert . There was not much time to practice or innovate . So , most of the tracks come out as flat or closely matching the studio versions . Each of the members of the band , especially Howe , have some nice moments . But , it really feels like they are solo performers and not really playing together as a band . The background vocals are really out of sync on many of the songs.I like the versions of And You and I and I 've Seen All Good People ( with the Give Peace a Chance chorus ) , but they have bad spots too . I never liked Time and A Word or Going for the One , but there as some nice musical additions that make them almost bearable . Turn of the Century is pretty bad . There is not much new or different about Close to the Edge , but since it is Yes 's best long song it is always nice to hear it . However , the intro is just ruined by mixing in the audience noise way too loud.The studio songs are OK and this might be an OK studio release . Mind Drive is another typical 18 minute Yes song . It starts out good and has good musical passages . It sounds a bit like early Genesis . But , there are two vocal interludes that just spoil the song . I edited them out and came up with a pretty good 13 minute song . Foot Prints and Children of Light are fairly good songs in the 6 to 9 minute Yes tradition . Sign Language is a nice little closing instrumental . Bring Me Power is pretty bad.Anyway , this is better than the first release , Keys to Ascension , which had a worse choice of live material and the worst studio Yes song ever .	-1
I really really really hated this CD when I got it . I was hoping for new versions of their classic songs that would sound good . Instead I heard new versions of classic songs that made me want to toss my cd walkman out a window . Some people must like this CD . I 'm not one of them .	-1
Switchblade Symphony 's Serpentine Gallery is widely considered the quintessential darkwave and/or modern-day gothic album.This is nothing short of a travesty.While definitely not a fanatic , I 've delved quite a bit into the goth/industrial/darkwave genres and have mostly been impressed by the bands ' atmospheric darkness , beauty , and compositional skill . I of course love the classics ( Bauhaus , the Cure , the Sisters of Mercy , Christian Death , et al ) , but I also find a few acts today to be worthy , such as London After Midnight and Bella Morte . When I heard THIS album , however , the only thing on my mind was , `` When is this going to end ? `` This is one of the most excruciatingly BORING albums I have ever had the misfortune of hearing . There is nothing dark , atmospheric , beautiful , emotional , exciting , or shocking about this album , which really sucks , because something with the `` goth '' label oughta have at least a couple of those aforementioned traits.The female vocals are HORRIBLE , and have all the vocal presence of American Idol rejects . They are absolutely deadpan and reflect no emotion or passion whatsoever.The music is uncreative , hackneyed , and just downright dull . There is no drive or danceability , nor anything unique and stimulating created by the tired combination of keyboards , drum machines , and guitars . The songs never feel like they get anywhere , but rather are content to merely float about until they 're mercifully ended.The lyrics are awful , much like the lyrics of most modern-day goth bands . Plenty of clich & eacute ; d references to death , glitter , dolls , and darkness.Please , people , if you are considering getting this album because you 're interested in the goth scene , I urge you to steer clear of this absolutely abysmal , sleep-inducing piece of garbage.As a bonus , here is a list of 10 true goth albums you should buy instead of this:1 . Bauhaus- In the Flat Field2 . The Cure- Pornography3 . The Cure- Disintegration4 . The Sisters of Mercy- Floodland5 . Siouxsie and the Banshees- Kaleidoscope6 . Christian Death- Only Theatre of Pain7 . ANYTHING by Joy Division or Dead Can Dance8 . Type O Negative- Bloody Kisses9 . London After Midnight- Psycho Magnet10 . Bella Morte- Where Shadows Lie	-1
Moravec can be very good , but this is not one of his good recordings . I did n't like the music that was selected and the disc was defective ( from a marginal label ) . I now try to stay with the major labels.Fortunately , amazon has a good return policy and I was able to return it and I received a full refund .	-1
Unbelievably bad , that is ! The sound quality is hideous , as if the single microphone had been swathed in compost . The instruments , when they can be distinguished from the general rumble , are nearly unrecognizable . Choirs are the hardest thing to record effectively anyway , but this recording failed more painfully than most.However , it would n't have mattered , since the performance is totally flawed , inept , misbegotten . The sopranos and altos , especially soprano Eva Csapo , are so consistently out of tune that I have to suppose they did n't know any better . They quaver shrilly like a loose fan belt in a 1950s jalopy . The conductor , Martin Behrman , wallows in the thickest sludge of spent romanticism . Choir and instruments are all just a feed lot bellow of noise.And that 's a shame . A waste , not only of my money and my listening time , but also of an opportunity to introduce another facet of the brilliance of Franz Schubert to the public . I 'm sure there are devoted Schubert fans , people who love the piano songs and symphonies , who are n't even aware that Schubert composed seven masses over the course of his short life . The masses reveal a lot about their composer . For instance , in the Latin masses , the phrase `` unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam '' is conspicuously omitted from the Credo . Schubert in effect denied the rightfulness of `` one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church '' , which of course meant that his masses could never be used in Roman Catholic worship . They were `` unsellable '' therefore . Was Schubert a Christian believer ? His friends did n't consider him one . It 's an interesting question , but listening to these performances will NOT suggest any answer .	-1
Originally put out in 1983 . Not by far the best lp from the long running British space rock ensemble . Notice that Nik Turner had returned on this record , although I believe he was only on a couple of tracks . Even though the production is good , 'Zones ' simply just does n't make the grade . As for the tunes , I thought `` Running Through The Back Brain '' , `` Utopia 84 '' and the remake of `` Sonic Attack '' were the only cuts that make this CD even worth keeping . The remake of `` Brainstorm '' is bloody awful . Nice cover anyway . Most definitely - my least preferred Hawkwind lp ever . In fact , I believe it 's the only title in their vast catalog that I do not like .	-1
Tangerine Dream was obviously suffering from the departure of long time bandmate Peter Baumann . The band had hired Steve Joliffe to help them out , and Steve decided that it would be a great idea to ... & lt ; gasp ! > ADD LYRICS ! Of course , most die hard TD fans felt betrayed . By now , Tangerine Dream had become the de facto instrumental band known for their exclusive devotion to electronic instruments.In defense of the fans , most of the lyrics contained in this album are downright strange . At times , it sounds like self-idulgent poetry ... ..BAD poetry . At other times , there are no words at all , just nonsensical ramblings and gibberish . It also did n't help that Steve Joliffe did NOT have a very good singing voice.Yeesh ! Despite these TREMENDOUS negative points , Cyclone does have some shining moments . During the first track , Bent Cold Sidewalk , after Joliffe finishes singing the first set of lyrics , Chris ' now famous sequencers kick in with a rolling rhythm with some excellent keyboard work layered on top . Unfortunately , this eventually returns back to Joliffe and his `` lyrics '' .The final track , Madrigal Meridian , is entirely instrumental and showcases the classic Tangerine Dream sound . Unfortunately , it was too little and too late to save this critically and commercially doomed album.BUT , in the big picture of things , it 's really not all that bad . If you overlook the ( very ) poor vocals , the music and musicianship is actually quite impressive . But , have no fear , true beleivers . After this outing , TD quickly fired Joliffe and pressed on to make ammends for this , as Edgar Froese once put it , `` failed experiment '' .I still pop this one into the player from time to time .	-1
There are those who claim that the best thing about Tangerine Dream 's 1978 album `` Cyclone '' was Edgar Froese 's painting used on the cover ! Of course , there are those who do n't even like that , and the new releases of the CD do n't feature it , but an original copy of the vinyl edition may just have something going for it ... Now , though , with the benefit of over 20 years of hindsight , it can be seen that `` Cyclone '' was just one experiment to try to determine the future direction of a group suffering greatly from the loss of one of its most inspirational members.There can be no doubt that Peter Baumann 's precipitate departure from the trio in 1977 deprived Tangerine Dream of a highly important and enormously creative influence . ( It is a sad fact of artistic life that the most creative forces are often also the most destructive ! ) `` Cyclone '' was the soul fruit of the collaboration between the two remaining members of the band ( Edgar Froese and Christoph Franke ) and two others : percussionist , Klaus Krieger and flautist , Steve Jolliffe . This latter brought to the album not only woodwind playing ( in the form of flutes , clarinets and cor anglais ) but also another , entirely new element for the band : lyrics . ( Add dramatic chord of your own choosing at this point ! ) Many commentators have attributed the unpopularity of `` Cyclone '' to Steve Jolliffe 's fairly outlandish lyrics and vocal style but I think that this assessment is most unfair . After all , they feature in less than a third of the album in total and for the most part fit in well with the material around them . True , there are times when Jolliffe 's rather brash delivery is at odds with established Tangerine Dream leanings . But his wordless and vocoded passages are entirely consistent with previous TD practices and mesh seamlessly with the synthesised sounds . In addition , his detractors say , his lyrics are often pretentious or just plain meaningless . Well , most of the pop industry does quite well out of pretentiousness , thank you very much ! And why is music with 'meaningless ' lyrics any less meaningful than music with no lyrics at all ? Think about that one for a bit . Answers on anything that suits you ... ( used banknotes of any denomination preferred ... ) No : if there are weaknesses to be identified in the music presented on `` Cyclone '' , it has to be the overall lack of clear direction for the album , coupled with the unimaginative and often just plain boring percussion lines which underpin some of it ( especially around the vocal lines ) . Klaus Krieger 's skills are entirely wasted in these standard pop percussion figures , which are entirely superfluous to the TD mix . Personally , I suspect that the real reason for this album 's lack of popularity with the established Tangerine Dream fans of its time is that those fans had come to think of the band ( quite erroneously ) as a pure synthesiser trio - something that set them apart from other bands of the time . Suddenly , with `` Cyclone '' , Tangerine Dream were a quartet , complete with 'standard pop ' drummer and vocalist . And basically just like any other boring old pop group . Couple this with the fact that other artists like Brian Eno and Ultravox were breaking new ground with their forays into synthesised sounds and one can understand that `` Cyclone '' was a grave disappointment indeed at the time.So : turning away from idle ( and pointless ) speculation , what does the music actually sound like ? The album opens with one of its highlights : a beautiful passage for vocoded voice ( & agrave ; la Pink Floyd `` Animals '' ) as an introduction to 'Bent Cold Sidewalk ' . This 13-minute track is in three sections of roughly equal size : the first section features the aforementioned much-maligned lyrics of Steve Jolliffe , here integrating well with rich , supporting synth textures ( although the trite drum line is rather irritating ) . The middle section is mostly instrumental ( there is a patch of wordless - or at least unintelligible - voice towards its end ) and introduces a change of mood , with Jolliffe 's lilting flute and woodwind contribution harking back to the days of `` Alpha Centauri '' . With a strong sequencer pulse and a wandering cymbal-based percussion line , this is probably the strongest ( and by far the most beautiful ) music on the album . A drum burst brings this central section to a close , though , reprising material from the opening section . Jolliffe 's vocal contribution here does begin to jar , and he has certainly outstaying his welcome by the end of the track . ( The track 's ABA form is another departure for TD , who usually continue to introduce material right through to a track 's ending . ) The following 'Rising Runner Missed by Endless Sender ' is a fast and furious 5-minute romp of a work , through which Jolliffe shouts and screams , sobs and sighs his way , with his own particular brand of surreal lyrics . He is kept company by a screaming lead synth line over a throbbing bass synth pulse as well as by some fairly innocuous drumming from Krieger.The final track , 'Madrigal Meridian ' , is a much larger scale work . At 24 minutes long , it originally occupied the whole of the second side of the vinyl disc . Stylistically , the music here harks back to a variety of earlier TD works ( and has no vocals at all ! ) . It starts out with some 'cosmic ' style electronic ambiences , through which a throbbing synthesiser pulse finally hammers its way , forcing the sound to dissolve into soaring string textures . Suddenly , a strong sequencer pulse erupts and a typical TD synthesiser melody of delightful simplicity takes over . The first half of this track is very reminiscent of both `` Stratosfear '' and `` Ricochet '' , with its catchy tunes and driving rhythms , coupled with some fabulously uninhibited guitar-playing from Edgar Froese . After almost 20 minutes of this delightful stuff , the material gradually disintegrates both melodically and rhythmically , until a series of crashing chords introduce a short lyrical section for synthesised harpsichord and strings , and a brief interlude for flute . The track 's peaceful ( but unresolved and therefore ultimately unsatisfying ) conclusion is spoiled further by some truly cringe-worthy intonation problems - something of a shame , as it leaves the listener finally feeling that this album really could have been very much better than it is.Worth a visit if you 're at all curious but Tangerine Dream have done much better than this in their time .	-1
After Tangerine Dream stopped making records that would be called & quot ; ambient & quot ; these days , they 're output quality fell down . The group members can not compose very well and production has nothing interesting . The potentials of analog synths are not used . Bore , bore !	-1
Gone were all the unique qualities that set Budgie apart from other heavy rock acts . Tony Bourge 's guitar was the key to the greatness of their early material . Nightflight is just an attempt to get more commercial , with a guitarist that sounded just like everybody else circa 1980 . This record is bland , yet still listenable ; I understand that things got much worse .	-1
The songs are well-written but Belle 's voice could peel paint.If you want a real scare , listen to her sing in The Enchanted Christmas . There are some notes that she hits ( or does n't hit ) that will send you running out of your living room.New ... . and a bit alarming ... . ( ouch ! )	-1
I was n't too keen on this cd , the songs did n't really appeal to me or the kids , the price was nice , but I was a little disappointed .	-1
This cd blows , Its silly and kiddy , Plus they got Billy Joel here . Were is RUN-DMC or Neil Young . cuz that would have rocked	-1
I bought this CD because I 'm a big POINTER SISTERS fan and wanted their one song on here to complete my collection . I enjoy their song , and I view this CD as basically one for die hard fans to complete their discographies of the recording artists who are on this CD . Fans of OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN , LINDA RONSTADT , BARENAKED LADIES , POINTER SISTERS , PATTI AUSTIN , and the rest will probably just want their one song each just for their collection . I 'm not a big fan of Disney songs . This CD is okay , not great . Probably the biggest goof is TIM CURRY doing THE BALLAD OF DAVY CROCKETT . He intentionally mocks the song with ad-libs & lines not in the original version . Surprising how they actually put it on this CD . I guess Disney purists will not like the new arrangements of most of these songs . Just for die-hards & completists , in my opinion .	-1
Too bad the sound is so uninvolving here , its an old recording best appreciated in its original form , lp , I bet Disney could do better now , this is a remaster done in 1990	-1
I thought whatever comes from Disney is a gem . But I was greatly mistaken on this one ! When I went around scouting for a nursery rhyme CD for my newborn , there were obviously a huge range of choices , and I picked this one from Disney , mainly because ... ..well , it 's Disney , known for all the wonderful songs from those classic cartoon films . And I noticed that these songs in Vol 1 are from the 70s and before , must be real classics . But no ! was I ever wrong ! Firstly , you have only one boring singer singing ALL the songs . Though his voice is smooth and suitable for children songs , but I expected more variety , like some girl , boy , woman or old man lending their voices too , and maybe some sound effects , like a choo choo train and what not ! That would have been very entertaining to the kids . And the backing instrumentation is deadpan mundane ! Secondly , the CD 's only 37 minutes . C'mon do a great favour for these kids and fill it up to some 60 minutes or so , do n't force the little ones to dig more from their pockets ? !	-1
I think this and Music For Pleasure were the two black dots on an otherwise awsome carrer for The Damned . While this is the better of the two it still is n't as good as the others . Not really a bad album just not a very great one . It does have its moments `` Is It A Dream '' , the Beatle-eske '' Grimly Feindish ( the best song ) '' , and `` Trojans '' do have a gothic charm . It feels like they lost the fun element of their earlier efforts and tried to replace it with gloom and sadness . Just imagine the Damned without punk and you 'd get this one . Felt like `` 13th Floor Vendetta '' , `` The Dog '' , and `` Life Goes On '' over and over and over again , not really my cup of tea but the more gothic fans will love it .	-1
The first song on the CD is the best of the bunch at this Carnaval . After hearing it , you 'll want the party to be over . Unless you are a die-hard Spyro Gyra fan this one will disappoint you . I bought the album twenty years ago and gave up on the group . Now in 2000 I decided to sample them again . Your best bet is & quot ; Got The Magic & quot ; . The band has matured nicely .	-1
what can i say ? ive seen garbage so much better than this . this cd feels extremely depressing to listen to and i try not to hear it for fear of becoming grumpy . this in no way says that i dislike garbage , i love garbage ! theyre one of my favorite bands ! i dont so much recommend this one , but there are two songs on it i really like ... im only happy when it rains , and as heaven is wide . good songs . but i would recommend garbage 2.0 over this one.. beautifulgarbage was also reallllly good : -D	-1
I prefer the good old days of the Tijuana Brass . Not that I 'm saying it 's wrong for an artist to change with the times , and try and do different things . But these & quot ; different things & quot ; should be a lot better than this ho-hum release . & quot ; Passion Dance & quot ; is Herb 's most passionless recording to date . Give me & quot ; Whipped Cream and Other Delights & quot ; ... let me fight & quot ; The Lonely Bull & quot ; ... let me get a & quot ; Rise & quot ; again out of his music . Let me feel that & quot ; Taste of Honey & quot ; ... .let 's put this CD in the closet so no one knows we bought it ! Ouch ! Michael Butts	-1
Wanted to make it clear that 'Die Losing ' is NOT the usual Amon Duul album . Turns out it 's more progressive than krautrock , as the band is well known for . I would only recommend this title to fans that have the first six to eight Amon Duul II lp 's and wish to add to their music collection . Also turns out that Hawkwind resident poet , the late Robert Calvert is on this CD . Tracks that I thought were decent include `` Urban Indian '' , `` Visions Of Fire '' , the title cut `` Die Losing '' and `` Drawn To The Flame , Part 2 '' . Read somewhere this release is actually a compilation , also that one-time Amon Duul II bassist Dave Anderson and drummer John Weinzierl had a major disagreement that 'Die Losing ' was never really finished . Listen for yourself and you decide . Nice cover , though .	-1
Ms. Zayas completely ruins the intended phrasing by playing much to fast on some of the etudes , namely op . 10 no . 1 . Sure , she does n't have a wrong note on the album , but who cares ? Her interpretations are totally dishonest to the score , she takes liberties with the tempi that she has no right to , and , overall , her playing is totally insensitive .	-1
I am stuck with a 1987 copy . Extremely poor quality . I sold my record collection last summer , and bought the cd to replace . What a mistake . This CD is horrible , the vinyl copy I sold sounded lightyears better . Otherwise the music is a great piece of Robin Trower work , if you have the album . Bought this copy from Rhys George , double charged me and will only give me half back for a return .	-1
Here we have an album by Star Trek 's `` Uhura '' . Sure , she can sing , but to be perfectly frank , most of the songs here are n't very good . Most of them have `` outer space '' themes , and they are pretty cheesy . And can you handle TWO versions of Nichelle 's tribute to Gene Roddenberry ? ( one is sung , one is spoken , both have the same backing track . ) The CD concludes with a 25 minute interview with Nichelle , which is sort of interesting to hear once , but I ca n't imagine too many people will want to hear it more than once . This CD will really only appeal to Star Trek fans , who of course are the only ones who would buy it anyway .	-1
While Nichelle Nichols has a beautiful voice this CD makes the vocal stylings of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy seem positively polished and understated by comparison.Seriously.I was a `` Star Trek '' fan when I was a kid , and have over the years developed a penchant for peculiar outsider music , so after hearing the other `` Star Trek '' albums and being hopelessly amused by them I had to investigate this one . The reason I had n't gotten around to it earlier , you see , is that I expected it to be much better than the Shatner and Nimoy recordings , and thus , less entertaining as kitsch . Boy was I ever wrong . The problem here is n't so much that Nichelle has a bad voice or is a terrible singer ( neither is true , ) but the material and production are extremely amateurish.The album consists of nine songs , one poem , and a long interview . The interview is interesting enough to sit through once if you are interested in `` Star Trek , '' but the songs are what really makes this into a monstrosity . The concept album is always hard to pull off , and the pervasive theme here is ( surprise ! ) space . Pink Floyd fans can relax : `` The Wall '' is not going to be bested by this album . More surprisingly , neither will Bobby `` Boris '' Pickett 's 1962 frightfest , `` The Original Monster Mash : '' I would rather listen to `` Blood Bank Blues '' by Pickett 100 times than to listen to Nichol 's `` Star Rock '' ever again.The songs span many musical genres , but what they have in common ( besides the space theme ) is that the sound quality is awful and the instrumentals are beyond cheesy . Think lots of early-generation drum machines and electronic keyboards . The disco synthesizer-intensive `` Star Rock '' is probably my least favorite song on the album , and is , believe it or not , about hydroponic farming in space . The excited chorus contains endless variations on the line `` There 's nothing in the world like an Agronaut ! '' An Agronaut ? Yes . On the other end of the cosmos is the ballad `` Gene '' dedicated to the visionary creator of `` Star Trek '' Gene Roddenberry . She likes this song so much that she sings it once and then speaks the exact same lyrics over the backing track and calls it a poem later on . Two versions for the price of one ! The rhythm-impaired `` Hauntingly '' takes as its muse tribal music from some distant part of the Crab Nebula apparently , and involves a number of high notes that Nichols has absolutely no business exploring . `` Ancestry '' is no better , pairing a very basic rhythm track with ridiculous lyrics jammed in to the music with little thought for the concept of meter . `` You 're Out of This World '' is a Rasta-tinged electronic ballad of extraterrestrial romance , while `` Rock the World '' is a horrible techno song that reminded me of `` We Built This City , '' only infinitely worse . ( Yeah , I did n't think that was possible either . ) Finally , for all you Trekkies and Trekkers , Nichelle presents a punched-up version of the `` Theme From 'Star Trek ' '' complete with lyrics that should never have seen the light of day ( be forewarned that only dogs can hear all of the final note . ) Despite being one of the worst recordings I have ever heard , I gave it two stars for two fundamental reasons : first , Nichols seems sincere and makes as much with this material as anyone could , and with the credibility of having been Lieutenant Uhura ; second , there is some absurd pleasure to be gained for those who appreciate outsider music , bad music , and high camp . This is an extremely difficult CD to listen to , but if you enjoyed the songsterings of other `` Star Trek '' veterans for what they are , you will likely appreciate this too .	-1
Stay away from his cheap videocassette copy . That 's right , this is a plain Video Cassette copied onto a DVD , it looks [ bad ] and the sound is garbage . A new , cheap ... copy is coming ... It 's got ta be better than this garbage .	-1
The third entry into the Hellraiser series is probably the weakest , deadlocked with Hellraiser : Bloodline which followed this film . In this installment , we learn of Pinhead 's ( Doug Bradley ) past and origin , and after freeing himself from his confines , goes on a bloody rampage for no particular reason . Terry Farrell ( Star Trek : Deep Space Nine ) plays a reporter who is all that stands in the path of the carnage , and by the time it reaches it 's conclusion you 'll be amazed how formulaic this movie is . What made the original movie and it 's first sequel so good were their un-slasher like conventions . Pinhead was actually more menacing the less you saw him , where as in Hellraiser 3 he becomes more like Freddy Kruger in the later Nightmare on Elm Street movies ; a less menacing figure and a more menacing voice . The cenobite makeup is great , and the gore effects are nice as well , but the story that made the first two films worth watching gets lost in the haze here . Look for metal greats Armored Saint performing in the film .	-1
This is another of those sounds , rhythms and beats albums that leaves one wondering what is the point ? There is a movement about whose members create albums composed of samples and sound patterns often with kitschy faux lounge music tempos and neo-cha cha cha overtones most of which do n't have much merit . This is one of them . Listen to the samples available here on amazon the actual songs themselves do n't get any better . So , if you really , really like what you hear and really , really want to hear 4 minutes each of every track then this is the album for you . If you would like to hear some music in this vein that is really and truly inventive , clever , respectable and perhaps even virtuous check out the artist known as URSULA 1000 , he 's pretty darned great . ( Oh , and did I say witty and charming ? } As for this one . Definitely not worth the price of admission .	-1
Warning ! I love The Flirts but I never buy CD 's from Hot Productions anymore . They both look and sound cheap . It 's known among music fans all over the world that the sound quality is awful on their CD 's , so stay away from them !	-1
I bought this set at a bargain price years ago , when I got my first CD player -- my gift to myself but within my budget at the time . I 'm hardly an expert in classical music , but I 've always loved the 9 symphonies and wanted to have the full set all in one . Unfortunately , I just listened to it again ( after a hiatus of many years -- I tend to listen to more blues and old rock ) , having just gotten new speakers -- - and it 's essentially unlistenable . I have to agree with M.A . Scott -- - the sound quality of this bargain-basement unremastered set offsets any skill of the performers . I ca n't comment on the latter , as I said , as I am no expert -- although I can tell what I like and what I do n't . Perhaps Krips was a genius , or not -- - but regardless , until the set is remastered , one ca n't tell . At this point , I 'm willing to spend more money so I really can appreciate the music . And reviews on amazon are very helpful for geting a sense of what 's available . I think I may spring for the new Haitink cycle . As for this one , you get what you pay for , which in this case , is more noise and less music . [ Note that this is NOT a comment on the composer or orchestra -- just the sound quality of the recording . ]	-1
Just wanted to let you know that your two previous reviewers are being kind when they talk about the bad sound quality , when horrendous would be the better word for this boxed set . I bought this for $ 4.99 at a used cd store back in about 1990 , but picked it up because it sounded like a supreme bargain to be getting 5 cds for $ 5.00 , but with the terribly boomy bass , and atrocious treble response of these cds I had to ditch this set quickly , so I took it to one of our pawn shops in town , and sweet talked the lady owner , and told her how revered and great this Beethoven boxed set was ( I was lying through my teeth because I needed to get rid of it ) that she agreed to buy it for about $ 8.99 , I got more for it than I paid for it , and could just finally be rid of this disaster of a set once and for all . Even when a performance and interpretation is superb , sometimes it 's hard to tell when the sound is this bad . These performances are definitely nothing to write home about , and I think I 'll just stick to Krips Mozart and Schubert , they far surpass this set in every conceivable way , and are just a delightful listen , so just stay away from this set because there are so many other sets of the complete Beethoven Symphonies like Zinman , Harnoncourt , Cluytens , Jochum , Szell , Klemperer , and at least four different boxed sets by Karajan . If this ever is back in print ( at least I think it 's out of print ) they would definitely need to give this a super remastering to make it a little more attractive for buyers.P.S . T.Lin who has the review after mine on April 19th must have been listening to some other complete set because he 's definitely off his rocker to give such a glowing review on this atrocious Krip 's effort . I do n't know if he has a new and better recorded issue , but if he 's talking about the box set that is pictured on this entry , he 's not a very good judge of classical music or has extremely bad taste , but believe me about not buying this because of the terrible sound quality . Sometimes terrible sound quality is a dealbreaker when you 're considering a purchase , and when there are infinitely better recorded sets out there why even mess with this Krips set . Even if this was a superb interpretation and well played it would n't be worth purchasing until they remaster it well and clean it up , kind of like they did with Szell 's Brahms Symphonies 2 and 3 , which in it 's previous incarnation sounded so terrible , but when it was astonishingly remastered in the late 90 's , it ended up sounding better than the best DDD recordings . Unless something like that happens with this Beethoven Krips set , just leave this one alone .	-1
Miklos Rozsa . I found that this may have been a work done in earnest but I 'm afraid this album just does n't cut it as this is one of film 's greatest scores and it deserved much better . And it finally happened with the Tadlow recording of the complete score . Buy this one if you want but the Tadlow is the definitive one to get and definitely worth the money . Sorry , but that 's how I feel .	-1
Intersting that all reviewers want to dish out the 5 stars here . Im a fan of this artist and her singing is so unique and beautiful you will want to cry . In Tornoto , she is a treat to hear live . The production here is good , and some tracks are excellent . Actually her singing is amazing and rivals and/or exceeds many of the top Divas in music ... But ! ... A New Day is one of the worst songs I have ever heard ... repetitious , unrelenting , horrifying , I sometimes put this track on repeat and wait until somebody screams . How did that track ever end up here . Takes two stars off the album , leaving it with 1 . If you are into the worst songs ever , if you are into unlistenable music ... 'A New Day ' is a masterpiece of cheese . CD worthy of a collection for the right and wrong reasons . See also 'The Henry 's ' and check out her sister ( I think ) actress Catherine Ohara .	-1
I do love this band and I do own everything they have done but this is one lousy piece of crap of an album . Come on now , even the band was embarrassed by it so that must tell you something.Although , Perfect Water is one of their best tunes and you ca n't not sing along to Dancing in the Ruins , the rest of this is utter cheese.I actually laugh when I put it on . It 's like a joke movie soundtrack .	-1
I 'm a hard core BOC fan , this CD like a few others in the mid/late BOC outings was too studio produced , it could really be a Billy Idol CD or any other number of mindlessly produced albums from the mid/late 80 's , especially since they used Tommy Price-Idols drummer , he 's too tight , too tick-toc , BOC should flow , without Pearlman & Krugman they falter . Although I like Perfect Water there 's a better version on A Long Days Night , but who am I to tell you what you like ? Listen to the samples and decide for yourself . Imaginos is a great album , this is not .	-1
Through bad luck , I `` won '' this CD at my office 's Christmas white elephant gift exchange last year . I laughed and proceeded to put the CD on . Shrieks of horror ensued shortly thereafter.This might ( MIGHT ! ) be funny or cute for about , oh , 10 seconds . But 20 songs for over 40 minutes is something else - pure torture . If this CD were played at GITMO , it would be torture.You can even like cats and absolutely hate this screeching racket.Buy it for a joke or buy it to torture someone . But please , please , please do n't buy it as a real gift for someone . Not if you love them .	-1
what a stupid album . the people of made it where high at the time .	-1

Insane Clown P*ssies ... or Posse , I mean , love to always attack people from the south in their trashy `` music '' . Calling us rednecks , bigots , hillbillies ... and other insults . But yet , they ( ICP , Juggalos and Juggletes ) `` claim '' that they are all about love ? ? ? Give me a f-ing break ! ICP and their little cult of followers , are nothing but a bunch of hypocrites . People from the south are so much more kinder , giving , humble and good hearted , then the people up north ever were . Up north , all there is , is a bunch of cold hearted , self centered , stuck up jerks . Down south they treat you like FAMILY . Big difference . ICP likes to talk alot of crap about the south , but I can PROMISE you , that they would n't run their mouths around a bunch of crazies down south , armed with shotguns . ICP are cowards . Just like all the rest of the cRappers out there !	-1
i am a moby collector , and i have 25 cds and records , and this is the one i put in once and never listened to again . if you want some of moby 's early music , buy early underground . it 's a collection of tracks released on singles and remix singles . it 's a much better collection . it 's easy to see why only two of these songs were released as singles . it 's absolutely nerve-wracking . it sounds like a boiler room exploding from the beginning to the end . the only two songs that are halfway decent on here are stream and go . and i 'm not a fan of go . not recommended unless you 're an absolute moby maniac and you have to have all his CDs .	-1
The number of four and five star reviews is disproportionate here . There 's a reason that most Beck fans do n't count this as one of his `` real '' albums . It does n't even deserve the adjective `` experimental , '' since that would imply that this is some kind of serious effort . It isn't.I gave it two stars because two songs amused me . ( Watch the video for `` Satan Gave Me a Taco '' on Youtube . )	-1
This CD has two modes- Blue Grass read neck sound crap , and distorted joke noise that sounds like ween.Anyone who give this more than one star probably also likes dark ambient noise , and therefore has zero credibility .	-1
Snoop 's flow and delivery is as great as ever on this album but it is also true to say that no matter how good an MC is , he 's often only as good as his producer 's beats.DJ Pooh is no Dr.Dre.The beats on this album are really tired and unoriginal.Gold Rush is the best track on the CD , even though Snoop 's flow is a little slower than usual.Snoop 's admiration for Slick Rick is never far away.Sixx Minutes features an interpolation of Rick 's 'The Show ' , obviously following on from Snoop covering Rick 's 'La Di Da Di ' as 'Lodi Dodi ' on Doggystyle . Elsewhere Snoop does an OK cover of Biz Markie 's 'The Vapors ' and gives possibly the worst Tony Montana impression ever heard on 'Downtown Assassins'Tha Doggfather is pretty poor but that 's understandable.Snoop was obviously going through a lot when this album was recorded ; in court on a murder charge , Tupac was murdered , Death Row was falling apart and Dre had quit the label.But , unfortunately , Snoop 's subsquent albums ( Da Game Is To Be Sold & Not Be Told , The Last Meal and No Limit Top Dogg ) failed to live up to the brilliance of Doggystyle and The Chronic.Snoop 's still one of the all time greats though .	-1
Basically I got the album for one headlight and 6th ave. heartache ( two stars for those two songs ) . I tried listening to the whole album once , and not just those two songs , and the album as a whole is pretty dull except for a few songs . It sounds too monotone , his voice , the instrumentation , everything ! It has simply been tossed aside in my CD collection . You want some music with substance ? Try listening to the Smiths , U2 , depeche mode , or the cure .	-1
Friend ? introduced me to this satan worshiper ? and sum years later I listened to my roommate in college and threw it in the dumpster -- anyone in my opinion that goes on MTV and appears occult , then opinions will be , but honestly , as I threw the album away i felt a presence lift out of my body .	-1
i do n't see the hype of this album . it 's nowhere near as good as Portrait . the majority of songs on this album are just mindless anthems of hate . a few good tracks are & quot ; minute of decay , mr. superstar , and deformography & quot ; the irresponsible hate anthem and antichrist superstar maybe good if you are one of those people stuck in a self-pity party and mad at the world . 1996 is just a useless rant about hating the world , i just do n't see the point . Portrait is a great album as is mechanichal animals .	-1
This is for those who:1 . Want to burn in hell2 . Really think this guy is talented ( but is not ) 3 . Enjoy worshipping satan.Come on guys , this is junk . Everyone of his albums and everything he does is sick . Demented and out of touch with reality.Almost worse than Cannibal Corpse .	-1
Marilyn Manson is one of the sickest most evil people ever ! ! I do n't know how anyone could listen to his disgusting adhorrent awful music . You have to be like really insane and crazy to like this nutcase . The things he does and stuff he says is not even describable . UH ! ! ! ! Enough said ! ! ! ! ! ( i hope you like hell & quot ; Brian Hugh Warner & quot ; )	-1
Oh my god this is horrible . This is some of the worst `` music '' I 've heard in quite a long time . Please just go away .	-1
Alright , first off , I 'll admit , I 'm not a Bush fan ... but I know good music when I hear it.I 'm an enormous fan of early 90s alt/rock . So I 'm well aware of the real copy-cats ( oxymoron ? ) and the `` copy cat '' labels that falsely get put on bands for releasing an album at or around the same time as a legendary `` classic '' .There was a lot of bands out there with some GREAT talent that were never really given the respect they deserved because they were buried under the labels that dedicated grungies , news , and media constantly gave them.I wo n't name names for the afformentioned above , but unfortunately Bush is one of those that got MORE respect than they deserved . Gavin Rossdale ( while having a talented and teriffic voice ) writes lyrics that are incomprehensable , boring , and repetative . If you thought Sixteen Stone 's lyric library was bad , Razorblade Suitcase has even more in store for you . Razorblade does n't get too much better on the musical end of things , either.Throughout Razorblade , the rest of the band seems to give their songs a half-hearted attempt - managing to pull off multiple three-chord rock songs laden with guitar noise and ( very much un-needed ) feedback and squeeling . Backed by only a couple ( thank God ! ) half-hearted solos , this tops the cake making the whole album completely uninteresting . While almost every song on Razorblade has a promising intro or start-off , the same thing happens over and over - the song loses touch with what it could have become and backfires completely . Rossdale ruins everything with his elementary lyrics and scratchy voice ( which could have been used more sparingly and at more efficient times ) .This is the kind of thing that killed true rock n ' roll . THIS is what gives grunge and alt-rock a bad name.When I listened to Razorblade for the first time , one thing that stuck in my head about the album was that it kept drawing me in and forcing me out . With each intro of a new song , I wanted so desperately to keep grip on what i just heard , just to like the song . But as with every song on the album , any form of decent melody or aspiration was always lost 20-30 seconds into the piece . I finally got sick of being dragged around and decided put it away and I never listened to it again . ... Until just recently . After all those years , I finally realized what I was missing out on ... ... absolutely nothing.From a production standpoint , this is an `` In Utero '' clone . I guess it helps matters to know that Steve Albini produced Razorblade ( as he did with In Utero ) . Perhaps this is his style . If I had n't known that Bush had worked with Steve Albini on this record , I could have called up Dave Grohl and told him to sue their asses for copying their album . And I 'm in no way a Nirvana fan , so do n't take that route , please.So take it for what it is . Razorblade Suitcase is an album that promises much , but delivers little . Posing as an `` In Utero '' clone , it seems to only deliver half of what I had ever hoped , even AFTER setting my expectations lower ( after all , it IS Bush ) but even Bush disappointed me at Bush 's level.Three-chord grunge at its best.Kudos~Jared	-1
The Lady of Rage was a vital component of the Chronic and Doggystyle albums . Dre knows how to bring different rappers together to produce a perfect blend of voices . The production on this album is good by the likes of DJ Premier and Daz Dillinger , but The Lady of Rage just does n't have the talent to pull off a solo album with so few guest appearances . Only a few rappers are capable of that . The Notorious BIG ... I ca n't think of another . Even Snoop Doggy Dogg has always relied heavily on having a large crew of rappers to back him up , and he was the front man of those two albums , not just a supporting rapper like rage was . I 'm surprised Rage has made a second album . I wo n't be buying it . I bought this because I was in need of another Chronic/Doggystyle fix but this is n't it . I believe that music can be judged by how often you want to listen to it . I never feel like listening to this .	-1
And quessition to the dude below : Why 'd u have to bleep out a letter in Starfish ? It 's not a bad word at all !	-1
I was introduced to Limp Bizkit by their second album , & quot ; Significant Other. & quot ; The band 's debut , & quot ; Three Dollar Bill Yall , & quot ; seriously ticked me off when I bought it . Not only is the production lousy , but everything on the album is out of control and unstable.Wes Borland is definitely a great guitarist , and this album is plenty enough evidence for that , but his heavy riffs and hooks do n't mix well with anything . Fred Durst 's lyrics are fast and unpredictable , and sometimes unintelligible ; half the time you ca n't understand him . The album is NOTHING like the band 's later efforts ( & quot ; Significant Other , & quot ; & quot ; Chocolate Starfish & quot ; ) , and instead it seems to emulate all the other rap-metal acts that were scurrying around in the late 90 's . The result : 60-some minutes of noise . The record 's only big hit was the cover of George Michael 's & quot ; Faith & quot ; ... and Fred Durst still managed to squeeze a & quot ; Get the f*** up & quot ; into it .	-1
Yes Apparently repeated listening causes impotence . Seriously though this is thye apex of Limp Bizkits art , if you can call it that . Difficult to absorb in one sitting yet devoid of any underlying integrity this is an album that will sit umcomfortably in your collection . Until the day your girlfriend drops you for owning it . Take my advice buy Gentle Giants & quot ; Power and the Glory & quot ; and see just how drastically Limp Bizkit have failed in their artistic vision . Anyone showing this band sympathy should consider their reasons and question their self esteem . Avoid at all costs .	-1
Before Fred Durst managed to sell out and drag the reputation of Nu Metal with him , Limp Bizkit released this album . While the album is n't terrible like Chocolate Starfish , New Old Songs and Results May Very ; 3 Dolor bill is n't that great . The songs Counterfiet and Pollution are actually pretty good , unfortunately Durst turned out to be both of these . Stuck is a song that is fun , but once again nothing special . The rest of the songs fall along these lines except Indigo Flow ( it was recorded at Indigo Ranch ) , all it is Fred thanking everyone who helped get them this far , but its quite pointless . Everything is a song that is over 15 minutes long , is very quiet/boring and you ca n't make out what is being said . The shotgun effect found on Leech is actually quite funny , that demo is actually pretty cool . But once again I say that this is limp bizkit 's only good album . Everything after here was a downward Spiral . This is the only Limp Bizkit Album I ever bought . If you are interesting in what the & quot ; good Bizkit & quot ; sounded like , just download it . Limp Bizkit will be remembered as Korn 's Curse . Korn is one of the only good Nu-metal bands out there . This album is sub par to everything Korn has done .	-1
Oh my god ! This is the most amazing heavy metal album ever ! So brutal , and yet so technical ! Wes Borland is the most amazing guitarist I 've ever heard . His solos are so fast and complex , he makes Yngwie and Eddie Van Halen look bad . Sam River 's bass playing puts Les Claypool to shame , and John Otto ? Oh man . Move over Neil Peart , there 's a new drum king in town ! Fred Durst is a god ! His lyrics and vocals are just so powerful . Geoff Tate only wishes he could sing and write like this guy . Forget Iron Maiden . Limp Bizkit ruuuules ! Okay , here 's a real review . Limp Bizkit is the worst band of any type of music , period . Wes Borland is not a very good guitarist at all . Granted , his work here is better than his later stuff , but still , it 's nothing I , a guitarist of average skill , could n't play . John Otto is a horrible drummer , who ca n't keep a rhythm going for anything . My drummer in my band could make him look bad without even trying . The bass player is okay , but trust me , my bass player is way better . Oh , and Fred Durst ca n't sing , scream , or rap.I listened through this whole thing , and tried to see what was good about it , but I could n't . I 'm an open-minded person who listens to a lot of different kinds of music , but this I just do n't get . If you want a metal album that 'll really impress you , get some Iron Maiden , but not this .	-1
To not know that looooooots of people do n't like/respect Limp Bizkit would be the equivalent of not knowing people disliked Adam Sandler 's 2001 Little Nicky , that Huckleberry Finn has been a banned book , or that Allen Iverson is a basketball player of questionable character.Why is that ? In other words , what do people say about Limp Bizkit ? Let 's start with the negatives : - drivel- heavy amount of cursing- `` wish they were black '' / bad-boy lyrics- inappropriateness for children ( `` middle school bathroom '' lyrics ) - 2-3 chords per song- redundant song structure throughout album- no key changes within songs- receives the brute of the `` angry teenage America '' complaints from parents- Limp Bizkit lovers ca n't spell ( there 's a review on here that states that and then calls it a day - no joke ) But if this is album with nothing enjoyable to offer , no one would listen to it . So let 's examine the pros : - groove- catchy , especially the singles- high production/sound quality- impressive array of guest performers ( not until later albums ) - accessible , ever so slightly than Korn- various vocal styles ( rapping , screaming ) - overall uniqueness ( name a handful rap rock bands ? ) ( I credit previous reviews for much of the above lists . ) The bottom line is that you got ta know what you 're getting if you 're looking into Limp Bizkit . Limp Bizkit is a band I avoided like the plague while I was heavily into the mainstream ( 1999-2000 with my favorites being Evan & Jaron , Mandy Moore , Lifehouse , The Crystal Method , ATC , Fuel , Local H ) because of their cursing and lyrical content and saw no way I , as a 13-14 year old , was ever going to explain to my mom and dad how I could stand to listen to such stuff . ( Now I 've heard all of their material up through Gold Cobra . ) Then a friend introduced me to Nightwish ( Finnish power metal at the time ) in November 2001 and by the end of 2003 I was into melodic death metal and black metal and now I listen to just about any metal Europe/Japan/Brasil throws at me ( Emperor , Dissection , Stratovarius , Evergrey , Blood Stain Child , Angra , Domine , Primal Fear , etc. ) . During this time , I was of the ones who would curse out Limp Bizkit as being the most mindless band ( along with Korn , Marilyn Manson , and a few others ) one could conceive.But I 've had a revelation in these 10 years I 've been into European metal ( and that I 've grown up and graduated from college ) : Bands write what they want to and it 's our choice as the listeners what we do and do n't listen to . If we do n't like what we hear , we should n't be so dumb as to still listen to it ! Duh ! We should be bright enough to look elsewhere , as I have the last 10 years.Here I am 10 years later looking at Limp Bizkit once again and now I 'll tell you what I hear this time around . I still have no idea who 'd want to listen to such angry music , at least without the historical background that actual rap ( that is , African American rap ) provides us . What is Limp Bizkit so angry about ? At least black metal bands +believe+ in something ; they have religion to hate , churches to burn , and Satan to praise . And guided passion goes a long way.Limp Bizkit 's songs reek of ego , and a self-proclaimed ego at that . As said in the lyric `` book '' ( it folds ) , vocalist Fred Durst wrote all of the lyrics while the music is credited to the band as a collective whole . Little is printed there - as far as the lyrics are concerned , it seems just the choruses are there . ( Why ca n't mainstream bands print +actual+ lyric books ? ? ? damn they should take a lesson from Rhapsody [ of Fire ] ) So I went online to get the lyrics . I 'm going to go into a select few individual songs . I figure I 'll start with Sour , a song I heard for my first time on a compilation CD waaaay back in 1997 when it first came out and literally the only CDs in my collection were Jock Jams releases . I had n't even owned a Backstreet Boys album yet and now I have over 700 CDs including a small handful of limited quantity black metal albums , such as the 15-year anniversary release of Vinterland 's Welcome My Last Chapter and Winter Funeral 's B & eacute ; nis Les T & eacute ; n & egrave ; bres , Mon me.If this album had a title track , Sour would be it , for the last words before the first chorus are `` three dollar bill . '' The song starts off sounding like it could come off a Streets of Rage soundtrack ( remember that game for Sega Genesis ? ) . Aside from one use of `` s*** , '' this is a total legit breakup song - not offensive , not arrogant , groovy , and I can identify with it . I think that 's the key thing here : here is a song the listener can actually identify with +++before+++ having listened to the song , as opposed to sheer anger/hatred/violence songs like Break Stuff from Limp Bizkit 's next album ( where the stereotypical `` angry American teenager '' is going to say `` what ? break stuff ? well hell yeah , let 's go destroy stuff ! '' because Limp Bizkit said so ) . Kudos for this song.Let 's go back two songs to Stuck . Polar opposite ( almost ) . I am repulsed by the spelling of fat as `` phat '' well before we even get to the meat of the song . Shortly thereafter , I hear `` I get paid to take the microphone and slay the stage / Stay away from all the bros. in my band . '' You got ta be kidding me . Can someone explain to me +why+ I should stay away from the ... what bros ? Hammer bros ? Boomerang bros ? Super Mario bros ? This is the egocentric side showing that I do n't care one bit for . I ca n't identify with this ! No way ! Nor can I find any reason I 'd want to indulge in this ! What does an attitude like this accomplish for one in life ? The part that bothers me the most about this is how calmly Fred Durst raps these lines . If you 're angry , then sound angry , dammit ! When he does start to scream several lines later , it 's a general anger and the context is forgotten . This is the fakeness/ '' wish they were black '' showing . I 'd be willing to bet that a good deal of fans of this song ( or haters , for that matter ) only hear either the rapped verses or screamed chorus and do n't put the pieces of the puzzle together to see the whole picture . The concept ( s ) in this song would ( I feel ) be more appropriately featured in a hardcore song screamed at the top of the vocalist 's lungs . Passionate lyrics need passionate music to accompany them , right ? Seems like someone forgot that when he wrote this song . ( Take this song Betrayed by Antestor , for example . Christian symphonic black metal . asks questions rather than states/complains anger . If it was between this and Limp Bizkit to play for a 12-year old son , it 's Antestor . ) And by this point , all I want to do is argue against the lyrics that the rest of the song just goes in one ear and out the other.This album is comprised primarily of the latter type of songs . Unfortunately for me , that means it 's a hit-or-miss album on a song-by-song basis . The album is n't horrible . The album is n't great . I still shake my heads at the 1-star and 5-star reviews alike ( see the above list of pros and cons ) . I 'll keep giving it a spin from time to time . And as I understand ( this being my only Limp Bizkit album ) , their later albums feature much more offensiveness . This is a good starting point for anyone wanting to expose him- or herself to the band , as is the debut album of many mainstream bands from this era ( Chumbawamba , 3 Doors Down , Linkin Park , Backstreet Boys , etc. ) . I just wish it showcased more of the rest of the band ; if this +is+ rock , let 's hear some more guitars and drums ( Faith has a moving groove , though ) .I 'll close the review here hoping I 've shed some light on the phenomenon that is Limp Bizkit , coming from my unique perspective ( which , as you 've probably guessed by now , is primarily but not limited to European metal - I love a good Chopin piano piece or a well-mixed trance mix to offset the metal ) .	-1
Limp Bizkit seems to be a bunch of immature kids , especially Fred Durst . The whole Rap/Rock thing can be good , but try being yourself when you do it . LImp Bizkit just fronts with a tough guy image .	-1
wow this is the worst album ever and i mean ever ! ! ! nu-metal sucks - thank god for thier flop album Results May Varyso than limp bizkit can die and retire	-1
All I have to say is that this cd could have been better . I have been a fan of these guys since I heard Nookie at a friend 's house and I decided to purchase both cds . I did and liked Significant Other better . Fred Durst has a cool voice . The lyrics are awesome on this album but the music could have been better . This one was also heavier . Rap meets heavy metal . I would buy Significant Other first and if you REALLY like it buy this one too .	-1
You ever have those friends that all start going on and on about this great band they have started listening to , and how cool the bass player is 'cause he plays bass so loudly due to his mommy and daddy not buying him an amp ? ... and then praise him like it makes him something special ? Trust me , it does not make him one of the greatest bass players of all time , he may be better then the alternative rejects who thought 6 string guitar was so hard they switched to bass 'cause it 's easier , those kind of talentless so called musicians that followed the trend of , learn 3 chords , and violate them.On this particular album here , the track those friends at the time flocked around was Load Up The Cannonballs and Shake Hands With Beef.I think my initial reaction was to just stop in my tracks and blink a few times wondering how the heck you come up with a title like that ? By the time it was over , and those friends at the time had over played it , I personally rate that song up there with whoever wrote `` Push The Little Daisies To Make Them Come Up '' as part of the top 10 worst songs of all time . Then the top 5 of the worlds most annoying songs . And top 3 of the worlds most overrated as something special as judged by people who are not musicians and can see it for what it really is list.The rest of the album was a snore fest too , no memorable tracks what so ever , except for the one i mentioned cause it 's the worst thing this band has ever put together .	-1
There are only two good songs on this C.D. ! Do n't get it , it is a waste of money .	-1
Considering I play frisbee with this CD now , this is without a doubt one of the worst albums ever put together . I play two chords on a six-string , can I be in a band , too ? Gavin and all those guys can go to hell for all I care . ( I do n't know the other guy 's names because Gavin gets so much attention . Hell , when & quot ; Glycerine & quot ; came out , I thought Bush was a solo artist because Gavin was the only damn person in the video . ) If I could , Deconstructed would get a big fat 0 from me.I could not have been more happy when I listened to this CD . See , I never really liked Bush to begin with , but when millions of teenage girls swarmed radio stations with requests for Bush , and you could not walk into a grocery store without seeing some teen magazine with Gavin 's mug on it , I began to hate the band immensely . I have problems with people who overrate bands for whatever reason . So , with all the girls screaming that & quot ; Gavin is God & quot ; and the critics being too chicken to tell this band off , you would think that Bush actually had talent . Which they do n't . Gavin has ABSOLUTELY no range as a vocalist . Nor does he have any talent as a songwriter ( except he does n't write the songs here ) . And I 'm not even sure he actually plays his guitar . None of the other members put in any inspiring performances on their instruments . The mere fact that this band is so popular makes me want to move to another planet . And everyone thought they were rebels for listening to this stuff ! Unbelievable .	-1
An album like this usually comes when the band is all out of ideas , or has hit a creative slump . Linkin Park a few years back had this same exact idea with & quot ; reanimation & quot ; , which also flopped in the eyes of the fans and critics.This album would be fine if Bush made it available to the fan club members , or offered it for a reduced price , such as $ 5.99 or so , but to charge basically full price is a joke . This album is only targeted at current Bush fans , and Bush fans only.There 's certainly no need to buy this album unless you get it for $ 1 or so , and you like the remix of the song & quot ; Mouth & quot ; which got decent airplay on radio all over the country .	-1
No real rhyming skills at all . The reason why he was so popular is because he was different than what was already out there . He was rico suave for one hot minute and then he become pobre estupido the next . No one even remembers who he is . Someone told me Gerardo paved the way for Pitt Bull , but I do n't know about that .	-1
It is a strange bird who would buy this new . One would have to be a ) trapped in a 10-year time warp , b ) an impulsive & quot ; retro & quot ; ( as in , liking old stuff -- NOT retro music ) teenybopper , and/or c ) opposed to buying used CD 's as a principle . This has wandered its way down to the dollar bin , and I quite reluctantly bought it . Considering how horribly mindless it could have been , I was impressed . Amusing regardless , it 's neat 'cause I bought JT ( another chunky , nonblack & quot ; rapper & quot ; ) 's album & quot ; Kick the Funk & quot ; for $ 1 , and this album 's hit , GV , samples JT 's song & quot ; Swing It & quot ; and now it 's full circle 'cause I bought this for $ 1 too . Zowie . Old folks must despise the butchering of & quot ; Wildside & quot ; , the title track and in fact the whole album are chock-full of self-centered self-righteousness , and & quot ; I Need Money & quot ; rounds out the low points of pop filler material . One could do worse , and I 'll admit that while this is neither real rap nor real dance music , the two are melded competently . All Mr. Mark needs is some Preparation H to wipe that painful smirk off his face .	-1
After hearing Tragic Kingdom , I wanted more . When I bought this album , I wanted my money back . Sure , Gwen Stefani 's voice is great as usual , but the songs were short , badly writen , with no musical quality or good lyrics . The word I would use to describe this album is- Silly . ( Do n't waste your money ! )	-1
I was expecting something way different from this . I loved Tragic Kingdom , but this , no way . The type of music and sound is totally different . There 's no rock ! And the lyrics are really stupid ( like on track 2 ) . I do not recommend this CD . Specialy if you are a fan of Tragic Kingdom .	-1
Given that this was No Doubt 's first album , I will cut them some slack . I know that they were more into ska when they started out , and that is obvious on this album . Most of the songs are corny and juvenile ( I 'm not gon na be mean and say they were downright & quot ; stupid & quot ; ) , but there are still great vocals ( props Gwen ) , guitar riffs ( Tom ) , bass parts ( Tony ) , and a steady drum beat ( Adrian ) . I also notice the keyboard parts Eric contributed to this sound . But this CD is so much different from how they were in '95 , or now . I did n't like any of the songs , really , but since they were young and inexperienced in the music biz , I will not rate them too critically . ( Note that the only reason I said these things are because I prefer their rock sound to their ska sound ... I do n't like ska . ) In conclusion , it is clear TO ME why this album did not sell too well . ( Do n't worry , I still love you NxD ! )	-1
Really ... I have to be honest ... & quot ; What 's Up & quot ; is really the only good song on here . Sorry . The last song was ok I guess ... although I ca n't remember it too well . I 'm looking for things to impress me but I 'm just not finding it .	-1
Hey , the title says it all . The music sucks , the lyrics are absurd and the vocals are painful to listen to . Highly recommended for listeners with self-masochistic tendancies . Here 's a clue - when you can easily find a hundred or so of a used CD for less than two bucks , it 's gon na suck ! And 4 non-talented-non-blondes really do suck and they suck big time with a capital S ! A `` friend '' recommended this to me . Thank God for Amazon 's sound clips or I 'd be doin ' life without parole now ! Needless to say , I 'm now happily less one tone-deaf , musically inept friend . If you got to this review via a personal recommendation , start searching for dark and sinister ulterior motives from that person . They are not your friend ! I repeat - NOT you friend ! ! ! Do n't comtemplate even a nanosecond about buying this awful , nauseating , nails on the chalkboard CD ! DO N'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ( ... and the usual caveat about not being able to give zero stars ... )	-1
What is so edgy and interesting about this album ? This does n't even sound like industrial music ( as many would have you believe . ) NIN was good for one `` EP '' ; BROKEN . Those half a dozen songs blow this crap out the water .	-1
This looks to have been Prick 's first CD out ( of just ) two releases , as I barely remember hearing about how this band was the support act for the Nine inch Nail 's 'Downward Spiral ' second leg of their U.S. tour . Prick was - basically - one member - guitarist , vocalist & songwriter Kevin McMahon . Nothing to get too thrilled about here , as its so-so industrial metal . A couple of the disc 's decent tracks are `` No Fair Fight '' , `` I Got It Bad '' and the ( quite relevant ) `` I Apologize '' . Just might appeal to fans of God Lives Underwater , Gravity Kills and Stabbing Westward .	-1
In one phrase : NO TALENT.In one review : Bush , a polished British contribution to grunge , is extremely unoriginal and not very talented ( notice on the album that singer/guitar player Gavin Rossdale ca n't sing and play guitar at the same time ) . The music of Bush 's first release , Sixteen Stone , is extremely tired-sounding . There are absolutely no fast-tempo songs , and the guitars are the muddiest and messiest I 've ever heard . There are very few guitar solos , and the ones that do exist are very elementary . I 've been told by several people that Bush is a British knock-off of Nirvana , and I agree with them . Their sound is too close to Nirvana for comfort , and it smacks of musical plagiarism . Overall , the music of Sixteen Stone has the precision and prowess of a high school garage band.The lyrics are the most embarassing aspect of the whole album . It appears that Gavin and crew tried to sound ambiguous-mysterious-sexy-sounds-like-a-jumble-of-words-but-on-purpose , and the attempt falls flat . I know that many grunge/alternative artists purposefully make their lyrics out to be very ambiguous , [ ... ] If there were choice cuts ( which there are n't ) , I would choose the singles : `` Comedown '' , Machinehead '' , and `` Glycerine '' . The rest of the album is less than filler material - it sounds like songs that my brother 's old ninth-grade band decided NOT to play at parties.The best aspect of the album is the Gillian Spilchuk painting on the inside of the album . I wish I had a print of that to hang in my home.Do n't bother with Bush 's later albums - nobody else did .	-1
For anyone who ever lay awake at night contemplating the above question , this CD provides the answer .	-1
This album was nothing . No wonder no one remembers this group . The only reason I remember them is from the song & quot ; Breakfast At Tiffanys & quot ; the song that VH1 played to death a few years ago .	-1
I loved the original version from `` The Lost Highway '' . I only found out that I had to buy that soundtrack to find the original version not featured on this overwritten piece . To make a long story short , buy `` The Lost Highway '' soundtrack .	-1
I remember I bought this CD hoping for the original version of Perfect Drug , and I got 5 remixes that were odd and interesting , but not the actual song . I had to buy an import release that had a 6th track that included original version .	-1
If you liked `` Dog Eat Dog '' , which was an excellent rock music album , you must avoid this disc at all costs . End of discussion .	-1
`` Purpendicular '' just is n't that good of an album in my opinion . If ever there was an album that merited an `` all right '' , this would be it . The material is n't very strong , Gillan sounds a bit tired , and the whole affair just does n't quite cut it . The album 's sole saving grace is Steve Morse . He plays with a vengeance , recalling more the Bolin glory days than Blackmore , but placing his indelible stamp on everything . A breath of fresh air that Purple sorely needed , but sadly the band does n't have the songs this time out to warrant his effort . One of the weaker Deep Purple albums but still worth hearing if only for Steve 's wicked riffing .	-1
Just Read The Subject ... That Statement Consists Of My Words Towards This Album , It Just Sucks ... What Happend ? Why Did n't George Lynch Do Something About It ?	-1
do not go into listening to this cd expecting to hear the Dokken from the glory days ... you will hit someone in frustration if you do . This is not Dokken . They should be sued for false advertisement . and before some of you die hard fans start in with your `` oh they 're just starting down a new road '' ... well , the road they 're on is the road to hell . This album sucks , and it is reflected with boring lyrics and even more more boring and mundane riffs and solos . If sound clips are available , just listen and hear the proof for your self . I went into this as a blind purchase expecting at least to hear some trace of the Dokken I remember from the Back for the Attack days ... nope ... nothing even close . To sum it up ... pass on this one and just treasure your Breaking the Chains , Tooth & Nail , Under Lock and Key , and Back for the Attack cd 's .	-1
Original band members still playing for this album should hang their heads very low indeed . The Judas Priest name definitely should not be attached to this horrendous effort . And I 'm only speaking of the singer-the music here is as heavy , fast , and intricate as anything any metal band has done . Wicked intros too ! But the vox of the clown trying to `` sing '' is laughable . And do n't say I did n't give him a chance , 'cuz I did . I know it ai n't Rob , okay ? But while Rob actually sang the high notes , this idiot just screams and wails anywhere in the song he feels like . It 's like his nuts are in a vice , and someone tightens it when a high note is approaching . It 's really pathetic , and fans deserved so much better . Would 've worked extremely well as an instrumental offering , no vocals at all . Do n't waste your $ $ $ $ on this . Want heavy fast Priest ? Get Defenders or Painkiller . For those wanting masterpieces , get Point Of Entry or British Steel . They were on the right course with these . Screaming too , of course . Ripper Owens , huh ? I 'd like to rip his throat out !	-1
THis is another band , another completely different project , another logo , another singer , stupid lyrics by Tipton , new record company . So , it should have another name ... Why Priest tries so hard to sound like just another average nineties metal-band ? ? ? Why ? ? ? ?	-1
I though about not even reviewing this album , because I do n't really consider it to be Iron Maiden , in the truest sense of the word . Blayze Bayley is awful . It 's not so much the fact that Bruce is gone , ( Paul DiAnno material is great ) - it 's just that Bayley is a terrible singer.Anyone who thinks this album deserves more than one star is just rationalizing the situation , or they 're not true Iron Maiden fans . I read an interview with Steve Harris back when this came out , and he said the band listened to *thousands* of tapes before deciding on Blayze Bayley , from the band Wolfsbane . Funny , I never heard of them before . Apparently , thousands of tapes were not enough ! In Brazil , they had a singing competition , and the winner was current Angra vocalist , Edu Falaschi . Edu would have been a much better replacement . Most humans would have done a better job.The awful vocals ruin the songs . The only popular track was 'Man on the Edge , ' and all I can really think about is Blayze , who sounds like he has a mouth full of marbles , as he sings the chorus - `` Falling Down , Falling Down , Falling Doooooowwwnnnn '' . What a nightmare . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Who wrote these lyrics , Pauly Shore ? `` The car is an oven and baking is wild . '' ( it 's almost worth it just to hear this line ) '' We are Lord of the Flies '' ( me fail English ? That 's umpossible ! ) '' You 're searching in the darkClutching at straws to find a way '' ( do n't ask ) '' I get in from work at 2 a.m. and sit down with a beerturn on late night TV and then wonder why I 'm here '' ( it would be depressing if it was n't so silly ) Oh , but then there 's all that deep and meaningful stuff like Edge of Darkness ... except that the band stole nearly every lyric from the first five minutes of Apocalypse Now . Despite this , it appears that there are a couple people out there who that think that this is some sort of dark melodic masterpiece because it has Blaze mumbling incoherently before each song starts up . Guess what , half-a**ed lyrics that repeat `` I 'm sad '' and `` the world is kinda messed up '' are not deep and philosophical.This has nothing to do with Bruce not being here , because Maiden made two incredible albums with a completely different vocalist at the start of their career . It 's true that Blaze is a terrible singer here , but he 's not even the biggest problem . There are the inept lyrics , the complete lack of effective guitarwork , some of the worst solos I 've ever heard , extremely repetitive song structures ( this is NOT a progressive metal album as some say ) , and most of all , shoddy production . How a band like Maiden could release an album with such inconsistencies and overall chop in its sound is beyond me . Were they trying to sound raw like the grunge bands of the time ? Granted , Sign of the Cross is a decent song- better on Rock in Rio , where the song is played with some authority and inspiration- but everything else sounds almost exactly the same . The same plodding , completely out-of-key riffs over and over . So for all you holier-than-thou people giving this album 5-star reviews just because you think people hate it for not having Bruce , think again . Does The X Factor try to be a masterpiece ? It does , but it fails miserably . Some albums can get away with crap production if they are well-written , both musically and lyrically . Some albums can get away with bad writing if they sound inspired , dynamic , and interesting . The X Factor gets away with nothing ; it 's a complete disaster .	-1
Let me compare something here . Listening to a classic maiden album ( Iron Maiden , Killers , Number of the Beast , Piece of Mind , Powerslave , Live After Death Somewhere in Time , Seventh Son of a Seventh Son , Fear of the Dark , Brave New World , Dance of Death ) is like going out to a really nice place to eat with a beautiful woman . Yet , listening to this album , is like spending a night with your dumbass buddies eating bad fast food . Enough said .	-1
Well Its 1995 when Maiden release this cd with new vocalist Blaze Bayley . I remembered when the single & quot ; Man On The Edge & quot ; came out and thought it sounded like & quot ; Be Quick Or Be Dead & quot ; Part 2 which was cool . Then I got the album and at the time was dissapointed it collected dust for a while but afterwards I started listening again and it got someone better . Not a powerful performance by Maiden very dark , almost barely audible cd . Next to No Prayer this is the worst . Blaze 's second and Final Studio release blew away this one Virtual XI was classic Maiden . This barely holds 2 stars .	-1
Well , CD prices are reaching an all-time absurd high standard . Everybody knows that THE X-FACTOR is a joke , one of Maiden worst albuns ever , with songs cloning each other , uninspired performance by the musicians ... .well , a total waste ( except for SIGN OF THE CROSS ) .	-1
I can only understand that only die-hard Maiden fans could possibily affirm that this ( ... ) is the best Iron Maiden album ever ! ! ! MAIDEN released absolutely nothing worth your money since SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON . The nineties were a total mess in their previously immaculate discography , mainly thanks to the exit of Adrian Smith and , later , Bruce Dickinson . The bands clearly sounds tired in X FACTOR . I 'm not gon na take time to talk about Blaze . Just the songs . They are and endless pool of boredom . Ok , I admit it sounds darkier , another vibe , but the does n't mean it 's good . Both Maiden CMC albuns ( this one and Virtual Eleven ) are below standard material . THat 's the simple reason they hired Dickinson and Amith back ! !	-1
A bit better than their 'Live 1986-97 ' disc ( see my review ) , as 'Ultraphobia ' was the band 's fourth effort . Seriously , Jani Lane and crew - will simply never match the success of their first two records 'Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich ' ( '89 ) and 'Cherry Pie ' ( '90 ) . This CD , anyway seems to be a bit bluesy and perhaps even a pinch heavier than Warrant 's three previous albums . Tunes here that may take one by surprise include `` Crawl Space '' , the catchy `` Undertow '' , `` Family Picnic '' and possibly `` Stronger Now '' . If you really liked Warrant 's first two previously mention CD 's , then you should definitely get something from this title .	-1
This is the worst album to bear the Beach Boys name they 've ever released . The band has abandoned all hope of having anything interesting to say lyrically and has decided their only hopes of `` mattering '' again is to find the proper assortment of surf/beach/chick cliches to stitch together . If you need proof of their complete lack of creativity , track 1 is a Sly Stone cover , track 2 is a remake of their first ever chart single coupled to a semi-metal guitar and 80s drum machines , track 6 pastes some new lyrics onto the hook for the Danleers ' `` One Summer Night '' , track 8 is a Shangri-Las cover , track 10 covers the Drifters , track 12 is a gimmick cover of the `` Sunflower '' track with TV star John Stamos ( who 's a band fan ) .It 's hard to know where to start explaining how bad this is , but we 'll suffice to say that `` Summer of Love '' is the worst rap song ( yes , worse than the thing they did with the Fat Boys , where at least they had the sense to not do the rapping themselves ) from a white guy ever , if not the worst committed to record , complete with `` scratching '' . I leave you with the lyrics..if you still feel obliged to drop the money on this bomb , it 's your fault : '' Summer of Love '' ( by Mike Love/Terry Melcher..so as to give discredit where discredit is due.. ) I ca n't wait til summer ( yeah ) Cause it 's gon na be a summer of loveHey now ( well it 's a love thing ) People all around the world in every nationLike to get together for some excitationsIf you 're a girl appreciates her recreationWhy do n't you let me take you on a love vacationYeah I 'll take you to the moviesBut I 'm no fool ( wah wah oooo ) First I 'll get you on the beachOr in a swimming poolDoing unto others is the Golden RuleBut doing it with you would be soVery coolGirls are always ready for a summer of loveGoin ' out and lookin ' for love ( girls are always ready ) Girls are always ready for a summer of love ( sum sum summer summer of love ) Goin ' out and lookin ' for love ( sum sum summer summer of love ) I ca n't wait til summer ( yeah ) Cause it 's gon na be a summer of loveHey now ( well it 's a love thing ) Everytime the weather starts to gettin ' hotterDo n't worry about it toss your clothes and hit the waterWe 'll be California dreamin ' bay watchin ' everydayJust off the Malibu in surfin ' U.

I too expected to see more shots of the incredible New York studio musicians who recorded this music . Instead , I saw boring , out-of-date , psychedelic graphics ... ho-hum ! 5 stars for the musicians and Dave Grusin 's burnin ' big band charts , 1 star for the DVD . What a waste !	-1
I am highly disappointed in this album and the efforts of Johnette Napolatino and her band . This album is basically made for the Spanish speaking fans of Concrete Blonde .	-1
My rating is really 2 1/2 stars . There are some good songs here , but not really enough for 3 , especially considering this album clocks in at 55+ minutes.Coming on the heels of the excellent Some Fantastic Place , Ridiculous is a major disappointment . Lots of bland mid-tempo numbers that sound like Difford & amp ; Tilbrook are sleepwalking . I waited a few weeks and many listens to write a review because I was hoping some subtle gems would reveal themselves ( as on the vastly underrated Play album ) , but most of these songs continue to unimpress me.Surprisingly , the biggest offenders are the songs which prominently feature Chris Difford 's vocals . Usually , Difford sung ditties appear as rare and entertaining treats in the Squeeze catalog . There are a whopping 4 of them on Ridiculous and all are substandard . In addition , Keith Wilkinson , who came up aces on Some Fantastic Place with & quot ; True Colors & quot ; , can only muster the dull & quot ; Got To Me & quot ; this time around. & quot ; Electric Trains & quot ; is the catchiest song here , but it is somewhat sabotaged by trite and pandering lyrics . & quot ; This Summer & quot ; , & quot ; Daphne & quot ; , and & quot ; Great Escape & quot ; are all very good , and perhaps & quot ; Sound Asleep & quot ; qualifies . So Ridiculous is still a worthwhile pickup for fans , but certainly not one of Difford & amp ; Tilbrook 's better efforts .	-1
It seems odd that I would rate an album that I love so much , so low . Song of Norway , a relatively obscure musical film from 1970 starring Florence Henderson , has never had a first rate DVD , nor its soundtrack a CD release ( although the film has been on VHS a couple times ) . Those wanting to experience the soundtrack had to look for the LP . The film and its soundtrack are favorites of mine , so you can imagine my excitement when I saw the soundtrack was finally davailable for download here on Amazon . So I downloaded it ... FAIL . Not only does it not appear to be mastered from original sources ; it sounds almost exactly like my LP that I transferred to CD 3 1/2 years ago . Just the minute clicks and pops are in different places , and I can tell by the fidelity that this most certainly comes from an LP.This mp3 download is not bad . Not at all . The fidelity is good and the music is clear . Those who do n't have access to the LP would do just fine by purchasing this download . It is satisfying overall , but for a musical soundtrack from as recently as 1970 , I would expect reissue producers to revert to the original tapes , not a 40 year old LP . But then again , this release does not come from either a major label , nor the original label ( or successor to it ) of the LP release , so who knows . If you already have the LP or your own CD transfer from it , do n't waste your money on this .	-1
I am reviewing the entire album of this name ... .This disc seems very patched together ; not a cohesive piece or album like Zoolook , Rendevous , or Chronologie . If you are new to JMJ , I suggest one of those first , or his earlier Oxegene.A lot of Revolutions sounds cheesy and forced . When I listen to this disc , which is rare , I pick out a few of the better tracks and skip the rest .	-1
I tried very hard to give these three albums a fair listen and all I can say is , see a doctor before listening to this one and be ready to dial 911 in case you pass out in sheer shock . On the other hand if you like listening to hours of continuous havoc than this is the album for you .	-1
The title of this album is right on target -- was Herbie trying to tell us something ? Producer Rod Templeton scored some memorable hits for the likes of Michael Jackson , but here there 's little in the way of memorable tunes , the production is by-the-numbers even by the slack early-80 's pop standards , and Hancock is little more than the stock keyboard player on a mismatched gig . I support Herbie 's right to record anything he wants , including this disc . However , I do n't think at this point in time that it will have much appeal to anybody , no matter what genre of popular music you prefer .	-1
I bought this album because of & quot ; Seems So , & quot ; and that is still one of my top fifty songs ever . However , the rest disappointed me ; it was just as Beatles-derivative , but nowhere near as good . I advise downloading & quot ; Seems So & quot ; somewhere else and not bothering with the rest .	-1
This CD is really overated.1 . First , think of the voice : it 's plain and monotonous ( listen to the voices George Fisher can get in Monstrosity 's Imperial Doom ) .2 . Second , the music : Songs sound very simillar , there are no much difference bteween them . Even in an early Death album you can guess what song they 're playing . The guitars are muddy , and the drums go the same thru the entire record.I recommend you to buy a Death , Indwelling or Monstrosity album . You 'll be more satisfied .	-1
Chicago ( or , as they were known on THIS album , & quot ; C.T.A & quot ; ) : Tuneless songs ... amateur vocals ... ..a horn section that sounded like it was lifted from a Holiday Inn somewhere south of Atlanta , GA ... OK , like Milli Vanilli did n't say , & quot ; Girl , You KNOW It 's TRUE. & quot ; But the one thing that blatantly shows ( heck , & quot ; displays , & quot ; or better , & quot ; throws in your face & quot ; ) just what a bunch of pre-fab commercial nincompoop sludgemongers these creeps were , was their very own self-introduction on the left side of that fold-out album cover : & quot ; With this album , we dedicate our lives and our energies to the ( giggle ) revolution. & quot ; THIS , from the & quot ; band & quot ; that gave you & quot ; Color My World & quot ; and & quot ; Does Anybody Know What Time It Is ? & quot ; But re that & quot ; revolution , & quot ; guess I 'd better start rolling some bandages or something , huh ? OH ... ... you mean there WAS N'T a & quot ; revolution ? & quot ;	-1
Let me preface my review by saying I am a huge Chicago fan . I saw their Christmas concert and wanted to wave my candle and help some young lovely body-surf the audience . I had a few of their albums and did n't think I could go wrong with their first two . I was wrong ! This CD is pretentious and self-indulgent . Titles like & quot ; Poem & quot ; , & quot ; Free Form Guitar & quot ; ( hey , look , I can play , let me show you ) , and & quot ; Prologue & quot ; should have tipped me off . & quot ; Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is ? & quot ; is the only cut on the CD that is indicative of things to come . Thankfully they did n't play any of the rest of this hodge-podge in their set.Skip this one , children !	-1
The two-track stereo album master of Chicago II has been an abomonation ever since 1970 . When the album came out in 1970 I asked people : `` '' Why did they make this album sound like it 's being played on an AM radio station through a cheap transistor radio ? '' '' The problem is the two-track stereo album master of this great album is perhaps the worst album master in rock history . In 2003 , the DVD-A of Chicago II was released and that DVD-A comes from the original 16 track multitrack studio tapes ... ... not the horrible stereo album master . The 16 track multitracks sound absloutely fantastic . They should just destroy the 2-track stereo of this album and release a new remix straight off the 16-track . People would be blown away as if they are hearing the album for the very first time .	-1
& quot ; Hot Streets & quot ; reminds me of a jigsaw puzzle that does n't have any pieces that fit ! Yes , there 's a lot there but it just does n't come together.The biggest misfit on this album is Donnie Dacus . Dacus is a pretentious guitar player and a lousy singer . After seeing him on & quot ; Saturday Night Live & quot ; with the rest of the band 22 years ago , I came away with the impression that Dacus is a Pete Townshend wannabe -- and a sorry one at that ! What Dacus lacks in substance he tries to make up for in flash . But that 's not saying a whole lot either.Why the surviving band members chose this latent hippie for a lead guitarist still baffles me . Dacus ' style -- if you want to call it that -- does n't fit in with the group 's chemistry . After listening to this album , you 'll see why.The only songs where Dacus does n't bollox things up too much are on & quot ; Hot Streets & quot ; and & quot ; Alive Again. & quot ; On & quot ; No Tell Lover , & quot ; Dacus is more of a background instrumentalist so , for all intents and purposes , he 's irrelevant . For the most part , though , & quot ; Hot Streets & quot ; and & quot ; No Tell Lover & quot ; fit into the group 's mold and they keep this album from being a total bust.However , I 'd advise anyone who is a long time fan of the group to avoid this album as it would be out of place in your Chicago collection . Instead , you might be better off downloading a few of these songs on disc or going to your library to rent the CD . All in all , this is a lackluster if not forgettable album .	-1
An insult to Ian Hunter fans everywhere . `` Invisible Strings '' is the only song here which bears repeated listening . And Ian 's version of `` Red Letter Day '' is vastly inferior to Scott Folsom 's . The non-Hunter songs are a joke . Shame on you Ian ! Mott the Cat .	-1
No Bomb Squad , no slamming furious beats , no dense layered production , and basically no outstanding songs . I picked up my first PE album in '90 with FEAR OF A BLACK PLANET , ( never even heard their music , just curious as to all the talk of them ) , picked up their masterpiece next : IT TAKES A NATION OF ... , and bought APOCALYPSE 91 on the release day . I believed that their genius had no end ... until this album . The melodies and beats are forgetable , the songs are below average , the messages that were so provacative , intelligent , and ahead of their time now sound dated , tired , and old . Lyrically , Chuck D sounds like he needs another 6-pack of creative juice . The profanity which was rare in their songs now has become more prevalent . Do n't believe the hype from anyone praising this tired , God-awful CD.I guess all good things have to an end . Sad . Actually , Chuck has nothing to be embarrassed about on this CD , he did a fine job of that on the MTV music awards shortly after the CD 's release when he said `` Free Mike Tyson '' and was roundly booed . Why Chuck ? Just cause he 's black ? Way to go Chuck .	-1
Get double or nuthin by Erick Sermon or Enigma by Keith Murray if you want laid back bassy beats , becouse the beast on this albums for most parts are horribly annoying ... I like Redmans newer stuff but not this one ...	-1
Boy am I gon na get some hate mail for this . I must say that these songs ARE good and fully developed ( whatever that means ) and all ... it 's just that Mssrs D , Flav , X , Griff , and the others have decided to attach this MONSTROUSLY annoying BLEEEEEEEEEEPPPP noise one beats three and four of EVERY SINGLE LINE THEY SING ! ! And it RUINS the ENTIRE album for me.Oh yeah . And the Farrakhan lyrics . What 's up with THAT ?	-1
Bad . I 'm sorry , but whew ! I will listen to something else .	-1
... mainly because i think less of LL as a person now , not necessarily as a rapper ... what a letdown . i ordered this for 75 cents ( no joke ) off half.com after watching ll cool j preach his way through deep blue sea . i got it because i remembered & quot ; mama said knock you out & quot ; and & quot ; going back to cali & quot ; , and i remember liking them , but jeez , man , those are the only two tracks worth listening to on this entire friggin ' cd . and this is the greatest hits ? most upsetting of all is that j comes off as a huge jerk ... the lyrics here are even more chauvinistic and disrespectful than i would have expected from a more typical street-rapper . some of the songs are scarcely listenable the message is so embarrassing . the good news is , of course , that & quot ; knock you out & quot ; is even more badass than i remember .	-1
I 'm surprised that Warren G survived THIS era ! The lyrics on the album are bland and you would think that it was just another copycat album of `` G-Funk Era '' if you did n't know it was Warren G rapping on it ! I gave it a 2 because 1 ) he 's Warren G and does derserve some credit for trying to punch back and 2 ) because of couple of the songs were very decent , but most of the album was pitiful.The tracks that made the album worth listening to were `` Annie Mae '' , `` Smokin ' Me Out '' , and `` Relax Yo ' Mind ''	-1
This is the beginning of Warren G 's slump of sub par albums . The highlights on this album are few and far between , with one hot track , `` I Shot the Sherriff '' . Unless you absolutely need to hear more Warren G , I would steer clear of this . Warren 's lyrics are pretty bland and meaningless , which was ok on Regulate ... The G Funk Era because they were accompanied by tight beats , but here the beats do n't make up for the poor lyrics . Warren 's worst album .	-1
Everything about PHENOMENON ( the production , the samples , the guest appearances ) tells you that LL intended it to be a blockbuster release , one that confirmed his position as the one old school rapper who was still very relevant in his second decade as a performer . The album was a commercial success , but it artistically fails to satisfy . LL obviously spent a lot of time putting the disc together ( with every production trick in the book ) , but failed to project much energy in the writing and performing areas.He sounds flat out exhausted on the title track ( # 55 Pop , # 16 R & B ; , # 14 Rap ) , which also suffers from possibly the most repetitive hook that LL has ever committed to vinyl . Several songs suffer from overobvious samples ( as is the case with `` Candy '' and `` Hot , Hot , Hot '' ) , while other tracks ( `` Nobody Can Free You , '' the whiny `` Do n't Be Late , Do n't Come To Soon '' ) are blatant copies of songs from MR. SMITH . The hit `` 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 '' ( # 75 Pop , # 24 R & B ; , # 10 Rap ) features plenty of guests ( Redman , Method Man , Cannibus , and DMX all contribute ) , but the disjointed track has no central melody and sounds like four different songs stitched together.On the plus side , `` Starsky & Hutch ( with Busta Rhymes ) and `` Wan na Get Paid '' are energetic and fun , and the hit `` Father '' ( # 18 Pop , # 12 R & B ; , # 1 Rap ) is a real classic . With the combination of a haunting instrumental ( a sample from George Michael 's `` Father Figure , '' used very effectively ) and LL 's intense performance and lyrics , `` Father '' is the only track on PHENOMENON that truly can stand next to LL 's best work . Nearly everything else is misguided , at best .	-1
As a music cd , it was fine . But I wanted to get the cd complete with ALL the photos that were in the LP album . At the library the cd had all the photos that were in the original album . The version of this cd did not . There was no way for me to know this . For this reason I was not satisfied with it .	-1
Did anyone at CBS/Sony listen to the finished product before they started shipping it ? The CD layer is painful ! Highway 61 is n't much better , leaving me totally astonished . This steals the dubious honor of `` Worst Remaster Ever '' from Supertramp 's Breakfast in America - quite a feat . How many years do I have to wait until they get it right ?	-1
I know that the song that kicks off this album went as high as number 2 , and then was banned immediately because of the use of the word `` Stoned '' . It was 1966 , and I guess `` Stoned '' was one of those dangerous words because people would associate it with Marijuana , or LSD . However , it could also be used for Alcohol too , but I feel that Dylan was actually singing about `` Judging '' . No one will ever really want to admit to being a judge of people because it 's not politcally correct , and in the Bible it talks about not judging because others will judge us . Some can be blind though , and actually get off on judging others because they do n't do things the way we do them . Let me count the ways : Stone you when you try to be so good : No one wants to be shown up by a goody two shoes , and other times especially if a person was bad before trying to be good no one is apt to forgive and forget.Stone you when you try to call home : I know my wife would always quiz me when I was on the phone with people to see if I was saying the right things , and it drove me Nucking Futs.Stone you when you live all alone : Remember it was 1966 the night before the sexual revolution . Society still pressured you into marriage even though you felt you were n't ready . Women who lived by themselves were deemed witches , and or lunatics.Stone you when you 're walking down the street : Some people just ca n't help but titter when observing people out in public , and it 's because it 's only different from what we do.Stone you when you 're riding in your car : Teenagers drive fast and wreckless . They 're no good.Stone you when you 're playing your guitar : Get a haircut , and get a real job , or You 're playing too loud , or how about That 's terrible playing.Dylan does n't offer any hope in this as with the line `` Well I would not feel so all alone ... everybody must get stoned . '' He makes it sound like a noble brotherhood . Unfortunately , human nature makes us long to do this dirty sin . However , with judging being very blatant back then these days it 's more subtle , but it 's still done . I remember Good Friday of 1992 , and I was in the back room of the supermarket I was working at , and that song came on the radio , and the guy started singing `` Well they stone you even when they say they do n't . '' I laughed because it was funny , but looking back I 'm seeing it as the truth it is . People still like to judge each other , but as it 's not politically correct anymore it ca n't be blatant . For example the KKK who was feared 40 years ago now is a diluted watered-down shell of it 's former self as the public now instead of hiding in fear now Bronx cheer them as they drive down the street . In closing I guess I can understand why the song was banned ... not that I agree because when they banned this song it was a travesty . It shows that people just did n't care that what they did as far as the judging went was sinful , and/or it struck a cord in the heart , and it was something they did n't want to give up ... like the Pharisees were horny to stone the adulterous woman , but Jesus squashed them with `` Let he who is without sin cast the first stone . `` , and of course they all left mumbling under their breath because they were angry they did n't get to do what they wanted . Judging people is one of the last guilty pleasures we do n't want to give up . As for the rest of this album ; I found it to be as close to psychedelia as Dylan got , but despite a couple of decent tracks it 's a waste of time .	-1
This dude only knows how to sing vowles , here 's my impression of him singing misty & quot ; ooo aaaa eeee , III aaa hhelleee aaa a iiieee uuu aa eee & quot ; translation & quot ; look at me I 'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree & quot ; . If you like a singer to sound as though his mouth were full of something , and singing chritsmas songs go ahead and buy it , but he 's too hard for me to understand any of his words , he needs diction lessons , he 's got a speaking imparment . Too bad these are nice arrangemets ( the only reason it got two stars , and for the great songs selection ) . This cd as is true wit hall mathis cd 's has great camp value , his music is so campy , it 's so bad it 's almost good ( another reason for the 2 stars instead of one ) . This cd is a great gaga cd to play at parties everyon will love the gag , it makes for a good pink elephant gift too a great gag gift ...	-1
How does it feel to have some cavedwelling sourpuss whining at you like Fran Drescher in a third-rate sitcom ? I do n't like it , no sir . Judas here swaggers like he do n't know the humble souls what picked him up and carried him on their shoulders to this stage . Mysticism out of burlap and sterno . This poet who 's too hip to be called a poet , let 's refer to him as a wiry amoeba , brims with chauvinism , as well as the elitist view that anyone who is not climbing the ladder of success only has themselves to blame -- could n't be anything more going on ( why is oil listed on the stock exchange again ? ) .Dylweed throws out meaningless riddles like , `` the commander-in-chief answers him while chasing a fly '' and `` the sun 's not yellow , it 's chicken , '' and then tosses in an angry retort to people who wonder what 's his deal . He 's like a Forrest Gump starvation artist who convinces some Hindus to join his hunger strike and then , 60 days in , says , `` I 'm done starving , you 're on your own , '' and splits , no one the wiser to what the protest had been all about . Cue party whistles.Well , you sold your Packard to get this far , so now you 're out here on this vacant stretch of road , sandwiched between an abandoned gin mill and a cemetery , wondering how this Edgar Allan Poe of ragtime revisionism swindled you with his self-righteous ramblings .	-1
In my time I 've asked many many Bob Dylan fans what it is that appeals to them so much . The result is invariable . they say `` The lyrics man , the WORDS . Dylan is a lyrical genius . He 's a genius poet '' Well if it 's the words you love so much why not just visit a lyrcis database on the internet and just print off your favourite song lyrics instead of spending piles of your hard earned cash listening to second rate folk and roots music ? I hope you found this money saving tip helpful .	-1
This re-release of a 1966 vinyl LP is typical of early CDs - questionable sound quality and a dearth of tracks . However , in keeping with the trend to re-release these early CDs with added tracks and better sound [ e.g. , Sarah Vaughan , Donovan , and Elvis Presley CDs ) , this is a good candidate.The large group founded by Randy Sparks boasted some notable talent during their time [ Barry McGuire , Gene Clarke of The Byrds , Kenny Rogers in 1966 , and Kim Carnes in the late 1960s ] , and from 1962 to 1965 they put six singles onto the Billboard Pop Hot 100 , three of which also made the Adult Contemporary ( AC ) charts and one more that scored only on the AC charts.Here you get just four of them : Green Green ( # 3 AC/ # 14 Hot 100 in summer 1963 and their best , with McGuire on lead vocal and b/wThe Banjo ) ; Saturday Night ( # 29 Hot 100 in November 1963 b/w The Wheeler Dealers ) ; Today ( # 4 AC/ # 17 Hot 100 in June 1964 from the film Advance To The Rear and b/w Miss Katy Cruel ) ; and Chim , Chim Cheree ( # 20 AC/ # 81 Hot 100 in May 1965 from the film Mary Poppins b/w They Got ta Quit Kickin ' My Dog Around ) .Missing are their first hit , Woody Guthrie 's This Land Is Your Land , which reached # 93 Hot 100 in December 1962 b/w a Randy Sparks solo , Do n't Cry , Suzanne , Silly Ol ' Summertime , a # 92 Hot 100 in August 1964 b/w The Far Side Of The Hill , and their last hit single , Brother , which came in 1971 for the Gregar label , peaking at # 36 AC b/w I Still Do . None of the B-sides are included either , With these added , improved sound quality , and some informative liner notes , some enterprising outfut like Ace of London could turn out a welcome 5-star multi-track CD . Meanwhile , it does n't seem right to have one of the seminal large folk-country groups of that era [ along with The Rooftop Singers , Randy 's other group The Backporch Majority , the Serendipity Singers , Shacklefords , and Greenwood County Singers ) treated so shabbily.There are a lot of us out here waiting for some quality releases .	-1
I do n't think this is considered a major Streisand album . I always think Barbra Streisand was angry in the sixties because a lot of her singing sounds shrill . I want to be able to recommend her 1960s catalog but I ca n't without reservations . I think the one song I can say I really like on this disc is `` Once Upon A Summertime '' .	-1
Love Barbra 's voice , ca n't stand the songs on this album-totally boring ! I own a copy of every album she 's released I believe but this one ? I think I played it once , and once was enough ! Rejane	-1
Take a cue from the album cover illustration -- this is not a traditional , reverential choral Christmas album . I did n't like it , and I do n't think it 's one of Percy Faith 's best at all . Even in the category of more jaunty Christmas albums from that era , it 's not even half as good as Ray Conniff 's `` We Wish You a Merry Christmas '' album.I 'm just saying , know what you are buying when you order this . Preview the music , note the illustration , and make your decisions accordingly .	-1
I do however feel that I am rather skeptical to dig deeper . I just hate harmonicas too much . I read about Bob Dylan in April of 1981 , and was right up my alley as he wanted to march to his own drum , and not please his parents 's wishes when his heart was n't in it , and how he started the thing called protest music because he was disenchanted with the injustice of the Murder of Emment Brown 8 years earlier . However , all Dylan wanted to do was play , and not be cast into a box . When he went a different direction with `` Another Side Of Bob Dylan '' the protesters , and folk purists got all over him . I know the music I first heard was really horrible stuff ... .for starters I could n't get past his voice , and how bad it sounded . His best vocal work was done a few years later on `` Nashville Skyline '' . It was n't until I heard the song `` Positively 4th Street '' that he caught my attention , and so did Pat . `` Positively 4th Street '' is a non l.p. single that made the top 10 at the end of 1965 , and the lyrics still got me puzzled as the fact there 's talking about the rich bored housewives , or a shallow girl who only pretends to like him for his music , but not ready to give up her sercurity of practicality . Well meaning her parents feel Dylan 's demon possessed , and if she wants to stay under thier roof get rid of the Dylan records . I have no idea what 4th street he 's talking about here ? , or if it 's a metaphor for `` Rich and Affluent '' . The rest of the music is really terrible the worst being `` Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35 '' , `` I Want You '' `` Just Like A Woman '' , and `` Mr.Tambourine Man '' . As I said it 's the harmonica thing .	-1
Dylan has at least 10 albums that are better than this . You 've heard all these songs on the radio anyway , but what you hear on the radio is far from his best stuff . Here , in no particular order , are the 10 I would buy before this , even if the songs here were not available elsewhere : Bringing It All Back HomeHighway 61 RevisitedBlood On The TracksBlonde On BlondeThe Bootleg Series Vol . 1-3InfidelsOh MercyTime Out of MindLove and SleepThe Genuine Basement Tapes ( which you wo n't find on Amazon ) Greatest Hits Vol . 2 ( MUCH better compilation ) Okay , that 's 11 , but I could n't help myself . This should get you started . Even better , go see him in concert .	-1
I 'm a big Simon & amp ; Garfunkel fan , but this is definitely my least favorite of their records . Somehow it just misses . Bright spots are & quot ; America & quot ; and & quot ; Mrs. Robinson & quot ; but besides that ... The guys do n't seem to be working together much . Paul wants to do his own thing , and some of these songs sound like they should be on a Paul Simon album . And Art Garfunkel is obsessed with growing old ... which is charming for a while but gets , pardon me , gets old . They have better albums . Any of them .	-1
What really fascinates me in the fetishist who think this is the only BS & T that mattered . The reality is Clayton Thomas was a better singer than Kooper could hope to be let alone Steve Katz 's lame vocals . Also the band as a band played better behind D.C. Thomas . That being said this album has its moments . Of course the highlights are I Love You More than You 'll Ever Know , I Ca n't Quit Her and House in the Country . Beyond that this album is hit and miss . Anything Katz sings turns pathetic . Why they let the guy sing I 'll never know . Something 's Goin On is another keeper with a nice jam . My Days Are Numbered starts off with a nice groove but the chorus is really cheesy . Somehow the people that complain avoid D.C. Thomas turning the band Vegas never complain about this chorus . The other highlight is Jim Fieldler 's bass playing . Of course the Overture and Underture are cool cause they reference the good songs and as well they sound good musical . After that , you 're own your own . I always poo pooed this record and upon listening realize that it has its moments but its very inconsistent . Calling this a masterpiece I 'll never understand . The next album w/ D.C. Thomas sounded sonically so much better and tighter . I always think its great to hear such as the clip you can find from Woodstock of D.C. Thomas singing `` I Love You More than You 'll ever know . '' A great tune with a far superior singer .	-1
I have listened before this outstanding perfomance and decided to order in lp , we keep it from around 2 months without playing from the moment we bought this one and amazing when we played for the first time this unit came completely destroyed unlistened , the records does no have any major scratch but all surfaces seem to be treathed with some kind . Of chemical product and the complete sounds at very low output and severe noise , a complete fraud .	-1
This review is NOT a review of the great Laura Nyro 's `` New York Tenderberry '' but of the RECORDING QUALITY ! They are telling you that this is the 2008 edition . It is NOT ! It is the 2002 issue which has HORRIBLE recording quality . VERY TINNY sounding . Horrible . The label Pure Pleasure Records added the album into their catalog , on 2008 . The re-mastering was made by Ray Staff using the original analog tapes , and brings the original artwork in a gatefold cover . Just be aware of the fact that although Amazon is describing this as the 2008 issue , IT IS NOT ! I already had the 2002 before I bought this . It 's the same one . I FINALLY got my hands on the 2008 version . It is PERFECT !	-1
I do n't know what to say ; I really do n't . Ordinarily , I delight in having contrarian opinions ( but only when I feel they 're warranted , thankyouverymuch ) , but here ... what can I say ? I 'm a big Cohen fan ; I have all his stuff , and his first album may well be my favorite CD ever . But ... geez . No matter HOW many times I listen to this , I simply CAN NOT get into it . It 's my least favorite of his albums , by far . That is not , of course , to say there 's nothing I like here ; indeed 'Story of Isaac ' is very possibly my favorite Cohen song -- it 's simply an incredible piece of music . & quot ; Thought I saw an eagle/but it might have heen a vulture & quot ; just sends chills down my spine every time . Along with a number of other parts . Furthermore , okay -- ' ... Nancy , ' 'The Partisan , ' and 'Tonight will be Fine ' are n't bad ( I almost feel obligated to include 'Bird on a Wire ' in that list , but I 'm just not feeling it -- it would almost certainly be my least favorite track on any given Cohen 'best of ' ) . The REST though -- my god , it gives new meaning to the word 'bland . ' And even the lyrics -- which , at least , are usually a high point even in a bad Cohen song -- seem pretty monochromatic . Or maybe not -- when I see them written out , I think , okay , that 's not bad , but in the context of the songs ... there just ai n't no life in them . A shame.Out of ten songs , one classic , three 'okays , ' and six that might as well have been left off . Thus , two out of five . Though I want to emphasize again that I 'm not happy to have this opinion . It 's just that ... well , what can I say ? Would it make up for it if I noted that I think Death of a Ladies ' Man is a great , underrated album ? Probably not , eh ? Well , it 's true . I 'd buy that one before this , although 'Story of Isaac ' alone makes it ultimately worth the purchase for the committed .	-1
I am an audiophile not an engineer so I can only report what my ears tell me . The original Columbia recording sounds much better . The vocals sound muddy and compressed although the guitar is very clear so if you just want to hear Johnny 's licks this would be fine . For me Johnny is one of the top blues SINGERS of all time and this is and has been one of my top three favorite albums since the first time I heard it . I 'm hoping repeated plays may groove into the vinyl and release the great overall sound of all the music and players on this gem but at first blush seek out the original .	-1
We owe much to the Firesign Theater , for their pushing progressive social agenda and redefining entertainment . They stood out in their time ( the 1960 's ) , which was very hard to do in view of exceptional competition . Yet , they do not necessarily pass the & quot ; classics & quot ; test , that is , the reaching out and grabbing of audiences with the current day mindset . Any popular history of America , especially in the chapter covering the 1960 's , has to give the Firesign Theater its due . Whether you want to pay for them here and now is more in question .	-1
Self Portrait is , as you probably know , not really meant as a serious album . Bob Dylan wanted to remove that `` spokesman of a generation '' tag that so many of us associate him with and ... this is how he got rid of it ! Mediocrity from beginning to end . Well , with a few exceptions . `` All the Tired Horses '' begins the album and reveals this is no highly exceptional Dylan experience but rather , well to be honest -as hard as this is to say about a musician I love to pieces and especially the fact it was released in 1970 when most artists were at the top of their game- a waste of your time . It contains repetitive female vocals with strings and sounds pretty bland . Reminds me of the first half of the Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid soundtrack . `` Alberta # 1 '' is bland , straight forward , bluesy and features no creative arrangements whatsoever . `` I Forget More Than You Will Ever Know '' reminds me of your typical slow-paced religious country yuckage that artists such as Charlie Rich were doing at the time . `` Days of 49 '' is the best song here and definitely fits in with the mid 60 's lyrical style that Dylan was so darn incredible at , and maybe I 'm crazy but the verse melody reminds me of Neil Young 's `` Running Dry ( Requiem for the Rockets ) '' but played in a rockabilly style . `` Early Morning Rain '' is a slow-moving country ballad that 's not quite good enough by Nashville Skyline 's standards , which probably explains why it 's here instead . The piano is pretty and that 's the only compliment I can say about it . Despite all the people that believe it 's a highlight , I fail to see why . `` In Search of Little Sadie '' has Tom Petty-like vocals and ... I ca n't even identify what genre this is supposed to fall under . It morphs into blues around the 1:20 mark but before that ? What IS that ? Really cool vocals though- hey , I 'm the first in line for uniqueness so no matter how it 's expressed ! `` Let It Be Me '' is generic balladry junk . At attempt at soul perhaps but does n't work . `` Little Sadie '' is an improvement since it 's a fast-moving country rocker . Sort of filler-ish and too short , though . `` Woogie Boogie '' is the *definition* of filler- a generic blues riff sets the pace for a boring instrumental , and the sax solo at the end is completely unnecessary . `` Belle Isle '' is another country ballad with pointless orchestration that just increases the unnecessary amount of sappiness . `` Living the Blues '' is more short country blues . Probably the best song on side two since at LEAST the vocals are decent . Side two has made it perfectly clear that it does n't have a reason to exist because this selection of songs is just really mediocre . This version of `` Like a Rolling Stone '' is live and of course does n't even try to stand in the same league as the Highway 61 Revisited version thanks to the rushed , less than stellar vocal performance taking place . Again , do n't even THINK about comparing this to the superior Highway 61 Revisited version . `` Copper Kettle '' is gently sung filler material with delicate female vocals in the background . It 's unmelodic too . `` Got ta Travel On '' ( yes , PLEASE Dylan , travel on to bigger and better places ! ) is a decent country song and not much different from the Allman Brothers Band classic `` Melissa '' ( at least the two songs sound alike during the verse melody ) .Now arrives MORE questionable material . `` Blue Moon '' is at least alright because Dylan puts his own unique spin on a familiar doo-wop classic ( unintentionally perhaps , since the only unique thing about it is his voice ) . It 's slow-paced and forgettable though . I DO love the violin at the end and how it plays the verse melody for a few seconds . Pretty cool moment that is . `` The Boxer '' is a good song that actually captures the spirit of Simon & Garfunkel 's `` The Boxer '' but unfortunately does n't extend the `` la la la '' chorus at the end so there 's no emotionally devastating build-up in this version . That 's one of the reasons I think so highly of the Simon & Garfunkel version . `` The Mighty Quinn '' has now been turned into a piano-rockabilly version of a classic Manfred Mann song . Vocals sound a bit off to me . Not just anyone can sing this particular vocal melody and Dylan obviously ca n't . `` Take Me As I Am ( Or Let Me Go ) '' is another country ballad . Ca n't get into it at all . Honestly with all the country ballads scattered throughout Self Portrait , putting a really average one like this near the end is just insulting to the fans . `` Take a Message to Mary '' surprisingly has a VERY good melody that 's basically a perfect pop song at its core . `` It Hurts Me To '' is acoustic country that 's actually pretty good . I ca n't say I appreciate Dylan 's country/gospel/blues on most of Self Portrait but he surprises me here . `` Minstrel Boy '' has an intro where the vocals are completetely out of tune ! Uh oh ... that intro serves as the chorus . Yikes . The chorus is honestly nothing but barely adequate drunken nonsense with a distinct lack of foresight . We should n't have to hear this kind of mediocre garbage , Bob ! `` She Belongs to Me '' is an average version of a classic . `` Wigwam '' has humming serving as the verse melody and Spanish horns in the background , but this other version I 've heard with high-pitched orchestrated female vocals is better . I actually love this song but the million does question is this REALLY want you want from Bob Dylan ? `` Alberta # 2 '' is a beautiful ballad that does a fitting job ( or a tricky job , hehe ) of ending a below average album . It 's highly melodic and the piano arrangements are organized tastefully.Overall , well the truth is , the country songs feel like leftovers from the MUCH better Nashville Skyline album , and there 's lot of other mediocre songs tossed in for additional disappointment . Only for the biggest of Dylan fans .	-1
To say that this album is uneven is actually giving it more credit than it deserves ; it 's uneven like the Titanic plunging stern first into the Atlantic . Yes , there are a few noteworthy tracks , but for the most part it 's a forgettable collection . Dylan must have really been at loose ends to put this one together .	-1
BS & T ; was riding high with their previous BS & T ; album going gold and creating several hit singles.That all came to a screeching halt with the release of this turkey.There is only one decent track on the album , the cover of Laura Nyro 's `` He 's A Runner '' and the rest of the covers are AWFUL.The Stones ' `` Sympathy for the Devil '' and Traffic 's `` 40,000 Headmen '' are absolutely ruined both by David Clayton Thomas ' singing and the awful musical arrangements that back him up.Special scorn must be reserved for `` Lucretia MacEvil '' - not only is the music and singing uniformly awful but the lyrics of the song are trite , childish and inane.That song literally killed the musical career of BS & T ; - sure , they staggered along after its release but they never again reached the popularity they achieved with the previous BS & T ; album.Do your ears a big favor and do n't listen to this album .	-1
I never really cared much for New Morning . Though it 's a fan favorite , I always saw it as Dylan floundering in his ill-advised country rock period . This LP cuts dangerously close to being a total disaster . I mean , when was the last time you listened to Winterlude ? How about Went to See the Gypsy ? How 'bout Time Passes Slowly ? One More Weekend ? Sign on the Window ? The Man In Me ? Three Angels ? Father of Night ? For me , the answer is `` A loooong time ago '' .There are a handful of songs worth salvaging here . Three , to be precise : If Not For You is good fun in spite of its trite lyrics , If Dogs Run Free is an interesting beatnik poem , and the title track is worthwhile . But even then , none of these compare to Like a Rolling Stone or Subterranean Homesick Blues ... or even a few middling cuts from Nashville Skyline ( which I do like ) , like ... oh , I do n't know ... Peggy Day and To Be Alone With You . All in all , New Morning is strictly for the hardcore fanatics who believe everything by Dylan makes it a masterpiece simply because of the name . I 'm a big Dylan fan , but not THAT big .	-1
As in the awful `` BJS '' album , the singer tries to find out what all the fuss is about in the youth market . The result sounds like a parody album . On some tracks , it sounds like a bad Karaoke performance.In particular , `` Free the People '' is painful , especially when compared with the Delaney and Bonnie original . Bonnie Bramlett , as idiosyncratic a singer as she is , still shows much better range than the famous Barbara.Likewise , the Randy Newman covers are vapidly done , with none of the menace or energy that Randy brings to his songs.This album is basically a form of Muzak . Live high energy music filtered and sanitized for the housefrau set.Barbra sounds much better when she sticks to corn and schmaltz.Fer cryin out loud , this piece of crap was in stores RIGHT NEXT TO THE ORIGINALS ! Do yourself a favor and listen to the originals . If you can stand her versions , you might find something new to enjoy as well !	-1
It 's funny , reading the main reviews on here praising Barbra 's letting go and being more relaxed on this record than on her previous ones.I actually found myself thinking how pathetic some parts of the singing are because she is trying to do that , some `` sighs '' at the end of verses for example . Really awful . This seems to be the only album out of concept of what she usually did , starting with the graphics of the titles.Free The People is ok , but the Flim Flam Man song is dire , of course she did n't write it , but why sing it ? ? ? Was it a novelty song of some kind ? 71 's Macarena ? All the songs on here that I have heard other sings sing , I find her interpretations the worst . If You Could Read My mind was done much better by Vikki Carr ( I 'll Be Home as well ) , Just A Little Lovin is light years away from Dusty 's , just like No Easy Way Down . Time And Love , done much better by both The Supremes and Diana Ross solo.Funnily enough , in my opinion of course , she sounds the best on I Do n't Know Where I Stand .	-1
Hard , fast , staccato , neurotic , near-rhymes ( if he 'd rhymed ill at ease with possibilities - RH `` To Keep My Love Alive '' which I expected him to do - but he did n't - knocked out a near rhyme instead ) , witless , tuneless - stopped after the much lauded `` Coffee In A Cardboard Cup '' - typical KE songs for shows - like `` Cabaret '' and `` Chicago '' - think the stage scores for both are terrible - and love the movies - have `` Chicago '' on DVD . Though overall and in spite of it , think they 're overrated and third rate . Kander can occasionally come up with a tune ( Sondheim ca n't ) and Ebb is sometimes funny ( Sondheim never ) . Bought it to hear Mildred Natwick , Lillian Roth and Han Conreid - never recognized their voices - did n't read the liner notes though , maybe they come on later . `` David Suskind likes big words.What the hell does 'peurile ' mean ? `` It means `` 70 Girls 70 '' ! Too bad years ago I saw Fred Ebb sing `` All That Jazz '' on TV while Kander played the piano . Turned my stomach to watch him . One of the most incompetent contrived lyrics I ever heard anyway , no matter who sings it . Now whenever I hear a KE song , any song , I see Ebb again and I hate it .	-1
Only Barbra could make an album featuring Jim Gordon AND Billy Preston suck ! This is especially incredible considering it was recorded at the peak of their careers.This album seems to be a cynical attempt to capture the never to be repeated energy of the era 's rock music , sanitize it , package it and sell it at the A & P ; to suburban moms.Compare , for example , the lame `` Space Captain '' on this with either the Joe Cocker original , or even the Black Crowes 1990 's cover.Compare this with the other albums which came out in this era , and you will see how hopelessly dated , programmed and dead it isThis album is a shameful corruption of a magical time , and a painful listen as well .	-1
As anyone with ears and eyes will tell you , do n't buy the U.S. version as the sound ... and the cover art of this great album is lame in the current U.S. version . Instead , buy the European version , which has great sound and the cool original cover art ( of a weird American Flag ) and booklet color photos . You can get it from amazon.co.uk , the British arm of amazon.com , for a very reasonable price ( $ ) and they will ship it to the U.S. for less [ $ ] . ( If you order other Brit-only items , you 'll save on postage . May I recommend Jesus and Mary Chain 's Psychocandy or Sly 's Fresh ? ) Anyway , I ordered my copies of Riot and Fresh from amazon.co.uk and I am completely pleased with them . Give it a try !	-1
While the artistic quality of Simon and Garfunkel 's music on this CD is not in dispute , this must rank as one of the worst re-releases on record.Not only is it a re-issue of the first CD Greatest Hits collection , from the medium 's mid-1980s infancy , but it 's a re-issue of the original vinyl LP , from 1972 . Everything identical - sleeve , tracklisting , order , running time of 44 mins 30 secs.There are much better retrospectives of their work around , more comprehensive and better value despite the higher outlay . I can not imagine why they have decided to re-issue this now , or who they 're aiming it at , other than conoisseurs of blue jeans , flat caps and moustaches , perhaps .	-1
They completely screwed up `` Homeward Bound '' . They do n't tell you it 's live . As you know the music in live recordings are almost always altered in some way .	-1
& # 34 ; Story of My Life & # 34 ; ... ... ... .. How can that not be included ? First song ever by Bacharach and David , monster hit for Marty and one of the prettiest ballads ever recorded .	-1
MSFL has some grudge against quad\multichannel . this disc could have included the quad mix , which is very fun , the opening saxophone travels around all four speakers . Abraxas , Santana III and Caravanserai are are made for quad , 2 channel listening is a waste of time .	-1
I am a huge fan of Mobile Fidelity editions in both , gold cds and sacds . Unfortunately Caravanserai is not the best release from Mofi . Sound , image and instrument definition were so poor that I thought there was a problem with my stereo , so I played a couple of other sacds titles to check my gear ( B & W , Macintosh ) and fortunately they sounded as good as always . I wish I could return this sacd back to Amazon ... !	-1
This stuff is brutal , folks ! C'mon , how cheesy can you get ? Gentle Giant ? Prog rock at its most grating !	-1
I must have been out of my mind when I purchased this CD . I purchased Octopus at the same time and that is an awesome CD . The three friends cd is a little off . Missing Piece is a fine piece of work but it is difficult to find . I do n't recommend this CD unless you worship Gentle Giant .	-1
I do n't ask much of my remastering peers , but when Sony allows distortion to be added , maybe from an old analog mixing console , I become annoyed . Nothing severe , mind you , but if you want perfect sound , stay away from this CD ( I found mine in a local budget bin ) . At a minimum , on my favorite song , Your Mama Do n't Dance , I hear added distortion and other abnormalities . Shame on Sony for hiring amateurs .	-1
I consider myself to be a great fan of the Byrds , including the latter-day Byrds after everyone was either fired or quit except McGuinn . Clarence White deserves to be the `` Sixth Byrd '' , since he 's been playing on Byrds albums since `` Younger Than Yesterday '' . My problem is not with McGuinn 's new lineup of players . My problem is with the track selection.If Columbia is going to feature the faces of these four guys on the cover , then they should not have featured any of the tracks from `` Notorious Byrd Bros. '' or `` Sweetheart of the Rodeo '' . Those two records do n't need to be plucked from anyway . They should stand alone and left intact as classic concept albums . They rightfully belong to the likes of Crosby , Hillman , Gram Parsons and Mike Clarke , not Battin and Gene Parsons , whose faces don the cover of `` GH Vol.II '' . Columbia should have recognized that `` Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde '' started the last phase of the Byrds , where McGuinn was the only remaining original . Therefore , this record should have reflected the best of the Byrds since `` Dr. Byrds '' .With that being said , I also do n't approve of the inclusion of some very terrible songs like `` America 's Great National Pastime '' ( this song in particular does not deserve to be under the Byrds title . I have no idea why McGuinn allowed for this to happen ) , and `` I Wan na Grow Up to be a Politician '' and `` Citizen Kane '' . Let 's get real ! These are not good songs ! Again , I love the latter-day Byrds , so I 've come up with my own version of `` Greatest Hits Vol II '' . I hope some of you fans will agree:1 . Ballad of Easy Rider2 . Chestnut Mare3 . Your Gentle Ways of Loving Me4 . All The Things5 . Drug Store Truck Drivin ' Man6 . Just a Season7 . Gunga Din8 . I Trust9 . Kathleen 's Song10 . Mae Jean Goes To Hollywood11 . Glory , Glory12 . Bugler	-1
If you are looking for tunes like `` Mississippi Queen '' which have cool guitar solos and and hummable tunes , then this is not the album for you . HOnestly , these songs sound like tracks that were left off an album because they were so-so . None of them are memorable , though the bass playing is very nimble and inventive . In fact , I found myself paying more attention to the bass playing than anything else.On the other hand , if you are a diehard West fan , you might enjoy hearing this . I would try other West efforts before going with this one . Sorry to be negative , but this one clearly did not do it for me .	-1
This contains only a few of their hits . There are better and more complete anthologies out there . This is for the rookie listener only .	-1
But it is pretty boring. & quot ; Superstition & quot ; is the highlight and you can get it on Best Of Beck .	-1
This album is one of the biggest disappointment in the history of blues music . Imagine three great musicians joining forces to create a garbage music like this is a serious crime on the part of the producer . not a single track was worth a centavo in your pocket.I still can not imagine mike bloomfield doing a thrash like this.My serious recommendation is for the public to avoid this album .	-1
Here 's one of the reasons to avoid greatest hits/best of collections . These are some truly great tracks which have been savaged by some label-hired editor , who cuts large chunks off songs for no particular reason.Everbody should own a copy of & quot ; Samba Pa Ti , & quot ; by the way , one of the truly great guitar tracks , overflowing with delicacy and intensity . A truly erotic instrumental track.One of the best guitar solos in rock , on & quot ; Black Magic Woman , & quot ; ca n't be heard here though , because the studio hack whacked it off the version on this CD.Buy the original albums and hear the real deal . Columbia blew it on this one .	-1
I really hated this one . It ended up in the used section like within a few weeks . The singer 's awful . The promise of a Fisherman almost takes off , but it just does n't go anywhere .	-1
All of Bob Dylans music just blows and it sounds worse nowyour voice is boring and your voice is ignoring .	-1
A friend of mine had this record . And I absolutely love Carolina In The Pines . A song that I could probably listen to about 500,000 times in a row . And this is the original version . Not the one that is on his best of album . And I like the song Secret Mountain Hideout . I dont dislike the rest of the album . I just dont really like it too much . Including the song Wildfire . Although as I 've gotten older I understand the lyrics better . I was 15 when it originally came out . And the line There 's been a hoot owl outside my window . I understand that now . But at the time I thought what the ? I do like his best of album . That and the Tonight We Ride cd are the only things I have by him . I would recommend this just for Carolina .	-1
Wife and I listen to a lot of Barbra , but this one is a travesty . I had to hear each selection done by a classical singer after hearing this just to get my head straight .	-1
Everybody thinks that Barbra Streisand has some sort of gargantuan ego . I 've never met her . Have you ? Her singing on this album is flawless . But who the hell wants to hear this ? In the first 10 or 15 years of her career , she made smart and wise moves and then those that guided and goaded her convinced everyone that she could sing classical . Or sing in the French language . Or Italian . Or Yiddish . Or , as of late , Portugese.The rumor/legend that she can sing `` anything '' is preposterous.Relying heavily on wonderful orchestral arrangements , Streisand really does n't quite cut the mustard here.But you got ta give her credit for trying !	-1
A friend of mine bought this set , and while some of the unreleased audio tracks are interesting ( hence the extra star above one ) , a true Floyd/WYWH fan is better served by spending their money on a used Columbia 20-bit Mastersound edition of WYWH ( sadly out of print , but still available on the used market ) . I 've done careful evaluations of the Mastersound edition against all of the other versions available , and there is no comparison except for perhaps clean vinyl LP of WYWH on a top-line McIntosh tube system.Think about it . What do a scarf , set of coasters and three marbles have to do with this album ? It 's a desperate and cynical attempt by the music industry to resell classic albums over and over to `` completists , '' when all they really need is the music itself , not a $ 100 box full of useless swag.Listen to the lyrics to `` Have a Cigar '' again and hear the irony of it being associated with this ridiculous consumerism-driven box set .	-1
I found one of the most depressing albums of all time , and it was under my nose . There 's only one real saving grace off this album , and that was `` Shine On You Crazy Diamond ( Part One ) '' It was a rather dark , stark , and yet beautiful piece , but I ca n't say that for the second part of the song which you have to endure through 3 horrible songs just to get to . `` Welcome To The Machine '' is boring as well as depressing it seems like it 's never ending like `` Tuesday Afternoon '' `` Have A Cigar '' is also long-winded , and depressing , `` Wish You Were Here '' it 's not the greatest , but it 's also not that bad either . I also realized that there was some conflict going on with the group , and Capitol Records after `` Dark Side Of The Moon '' wound up being so successful , and made the group move over to Columbia Records , and a perchance meeting with former frontman Syd Barrett during the recording of this album was also noted . He was only 29 when he saw them again , and it looked like he aged 35 years by then . Which is the same spirit I got when I heard this album all the way through on December 18 , 1993 . It was a boring Saturday night in Florida , and I had nothing to do with myself except to put my brother 's Floyd cd collection onto cassette tapes . I do n't wish to be there again .	-1
they put out one album too many . maybe they wanted to be pop stars . maybe they were just bored . something happened . they went way downhill with this one .	-1
I consider myself to be both a Dylan fan & amp ; a fan of The Band , but I do n't see what anybody loves about this ho-hum collection of churned out ( it sounds as if they were just killing time or something ) dirges . Even Robbie Robertson said this stuff stinks . I agree .	-1
Very weak album by Dylan . Totally lost . only & quot ; HURRICANE & quot ; is great track , altough een this one is tediously , overwhelmingly long !	-1
Argent were a strange band , in general : while they started out being HEAVILY melodic and Zombie-esque , Rod and Russ slowly started to move in a more progressive direction after their debut . Sadly , this ( surprisingly short ) collection is mostly of that later period ; indeed , most of the Argent songs known by anybody ( Hold Your Head Up , God Gave ... ) are n't really indicative of what they could DO . I suggest passing this up , and instead picking up their first two albums ( Argent/Ring of Hands ) ; trust me , if you dismissed them after hearing this , you 'll be more than pleasently surprised .	-1
Some serious issues with this release.It 's the epitome of budget hour.Skimpy short and there are absolutely no liner notes or credits whatsoever.In addition , this was released not long after CD 's came out so sonically it 's very lacking and in desperate need of a remaster.Argent needs an updated Anthology that improves the audio and adds a few cuts that better represent the band .	-1
This has to be one of the skimpiest compilations ever made . Based on the success of Rod and companies biggest hit `` Hold Your Head Up '' the rest of the cuts are mediocre at best . Hold out for Three Dog Night 's version of `` Liar '' , the Kiss version of `` God Gave Rock and Roll to You '' and anyone else 's version of `` Time of the Season '' . Its amazing that the Zombies classic with Rod playing on it can be messed up so badly . So much for inovation . I wonder if Colin Blunstone gave his ok for it . I think not .	-1
Not a good Stills record , and probably the first nearly worthless record the man made . & quot ; Different Tongues & quot ; is a pretty song , but this is music from a once-astonishing musician who had lost his way musically . You 'd be better off buying anything recorded before this .	-1
... when they cut out the instrumental portion of & quot ; Angry Eyes & quot ; ? I was furious when I discovered that fact after buying the CD ( I got it before reading the reviews here ) . Yeah , yeah , some of their other nuggets like & quot ; Vahevala & quot ; are here , but messing up & quot ; Angry Eyes & quot ; totally tripped me out . Save your money unless you have no use for & quot ; Angry Eyes & quot ; but if you ask me ( well , you did n't , but I 'll say it anyway ) , that 's the magnum opus of this band .	-1
It 's a bummer . Santana has just emerged from the 70 's fusion movement having played with some of the best jazzmen around . However , this is not in evidence on this unfortunate hodge-podge or rock , disco and mediocre Latin music.It 's an early example of Santana 's penchant for cashing in on the current trends , fully `` actualized '' in the new millennium . Do n't look for Tito Puente or Miles Davis here . The only thing of value here is the Brazilian-flavoured `` Let the Children Play '' medley . I am glad they included it on the followup live album Moonflower ( a temporary return to form ) and thankfully , skipped the rest of this nediocre album.Those who like Santana 's more adventurous , jazzier side , are advised to stay away from this , and get Moonflower , Amigos , Caravanserai , Welcome and of course the first 3 albums . Also , some of his solo work is excellent .	-1
Both the front two musician play some clever an interesting stuff , guitar sound good , playing generally very good , keboards yes again very cleverly played , a littl forward in the mix maybe , but some inbalance is to be expected on a live record , but never does it seem to me that a group is playing the music , there is now synergy , just cleverness for cleverness ' sake . I listen to it occassionally for Freeway Jam . The nearest it gets to tight ensemble playing . As for the singing to quote a little from a vocoder monstrosity & quot ; put your hands together & quot ; ... .. over you ears . One good track , but you can ignore the rest . Pity really as the whole band can play music .	-1
I do n't know what the guy in the product description is talking about but clearly he know 's little about music ! This album albeit borrows heavily from the ideas of Led Zeppelin ( hey , so did myriads of other musicians ) is a brave second effort from Heart and I think is their best album . `` Barracuda '' is a classic rock standard while the other tracks are also very good and it 's hard to find a weak track here . The album flows like a good album should and the end product is clearly greater than the sum of the individual tracks which is rare indeed . It also sticks to a theme and pulls it off very well ( Gypsy-style , exotic music ) . The only reason this gets 2 stars is that the sound quality is not good and this clearly needs a major remastering job . I recommend not getting this version but by all means get the remastered one which would get 5 stars from me .	-1
Barbra is my favorite singer in the entire world almost to the point of obsession . So believe me when I say that this is a bad album . The songs are simplistic and vague in their subject , and Barbra 's vocals do n't soar like they do on most of her recordings , and when it does it sounds strained . She also is particularly nasal on this recording for some odd reason . This is unfortunately the trend with the albums done while she was dating Jon Peters , or when Peters produced . Avoid it !	-1
The 70 's produced a lot of horrid music and this is a shining example . I read people here calling this & quot ; classic & quot ; . That makes me wonder if eithe A ) the definition of the word has changed or B ) the stats about increased drug abuse by Americans are indeed true . This an overproduced silly and dated sounding mish mash of violins and bad guitar playing . The lyrics are utterly forgettable as well . This disc can usually be found as a super saver for $ 9.99 . Take your 9.99 and go see a good movie . This is a waste of time and money , even the cover is stupid ... .	-1
Buyer beware ! This is without question a `` must have '' album for every serious rock-and-roll CD library but - omg - do *not* spend even one penny buying the old , original version of this CD unless ( 1 ) you already have the 2001 digitally remastered edition and ( 2 ) have somehow cultivated a need to know the difference between the two.The sonics of the original `` Bat Out Of Hell '' CD is unlistenably pathetic , brittle , and harsh - most likely due to the use of p**s poor source tapes and equalization intended for producing vinyl LPs - not CDs - a common practice in the 1980s when CDs were rushed to market in order to meet the public 's demand for digital versions of its favourite recordings - after all , digital is better , right ? Not necessarily - and *definitely* not in the case of this classic album.I was *so* glad to finally see this album reissued in digitally remastered form ( with 2 bonus tracks ) in 2001 . I keep my old , original CD around though as a prime reminder of how far the music industry will go to sell utter ( ... ) at full price to blindly faithful , unsuspecting people every time a new audio technology appears with a reputation of being the best that 's ever been.As for the *music* contained herein , you 'll be hard-pressed to find anything better . ***** ( 5 stars easy )	-1
cThe songs are pretentious , over the top drivel , the singing overwrought , over emotive , and pompous , and the production is shrill , bombastic and self-indulgent . It might be tempting to simply dismiss this criticism given that this was released in the 1970 's , after all , but such does n't was . 1978 was indeed a superb year in music given such great albums by the likes of The Clash ( `` Give 'Em Enough Rope '' ) Elvis Costello ( `` This Year 's Model '' ) , Patti Smith ( `` Easter '' ) , The Ramones ( `` Road to Ruin '' ) , Bruce Springsteen ( `` Darkness at the Edge of Town '' ) , and others . An anomaly on an absolute nadir in popular culture . Maybe both .	-1
This is over the top and overly precious in every way . If you like musicals and do n't like rock , this might be your album to buy so you can think ( incorrectly ) , `` Oooh , I 'm a rocker , too . '' Other than that , run away . This is a high-school theatre version of Big Rock .	-1
Art has always had a very difficult time choosing quality songs for his great voice and this album is no exception . Most of these songs are BAD ! Watermark has no great songs ( most of Art 's albums have at least 1 or 2 ) and a couple of ok songs ( Crying in My Sleep , Saturday Suit , All My Love 's Laughter ) but the rest are very forgettable and VERY boring . That is the risk you take with singing all Jummy Webb tunes -- they are usually very boring in general with little melody to differentiate any of them . And I always thought the version of Wonderful World here ( the only non-Jimmy Webb tune ) was HORRIBLE ! His rendition of She Moves Through the Fair is TERRIBLE too ! ! Get `` Breakaway '' first , and then if you like that pick up Fate for Breakfast or a Best of collection -- `` Garfunkel '' or `` Simply the Best '' ( Import ) are the best choices available . His new collection `` The Singer '' has way way way too many poor selections and drags . Better yet get a Simon & Garfunkel album !	-1
Was anyone really clamoring for a fifth digital incarnation of The Stranger ( chronologically confused as a 30th Anniversary Legacy Edition - `` 31 '' years after the original 1977 release date . ) The Stranger is a solid period piece but hardly rises to the timeless stature of Born To Run or Hotel California somewhat calling into question the motivation for tendering this very pricey re-release . With no shortage of ways to own The Stranger still available across all formats it is extremely hard to justify this `` legacy event '' as anything more than a highly cynical money play rolled out by an individual who has been commercially dormant for the last fifteen years.To a certain extent I feel for Joel as many of these classic compositions have been muzaked into the public domain by every wedding band/DJ since the dawn of time - unfortunately rendering many of them generic but also making it virtually impossible for the all-to-frequent re-release of these songs to refresh our appreciation for an `` album '' that has never really gone away.As for the companion live CD that completes the package it is at best , a very average accompaniment to a very lazy offering . Joel would have been better served by looking at how Rhino executes `` legacy '' - alternate takes and unpublished songs that failed to make the original line-up would have made The Stranger 2008 a far more important contribution to his work . As it is , there are simply better , more complete releases already offered in Joel 's live catalogue - Songs In The Attic immediately comes to mind.Bottom line - there is not nearly enough new here to justify either the cost of the release or the narcissism that provoked it . Sorry William .	-1
Jeff Wayne 's War Of The Worlds is one of those albums whose legend far surpasses it 's content . This album is well known and well recieved within prog rock circles , but not well known outside of them . I remember being very taken by it upon first listen as a young man ( the artwork accompanying the album is priceless ) . It was quite the novelty hearing a rock opera with Sir Richard Burton narrating . But beyond the novelty , there is n't much substance.In 1978 this album had what seemed to be a stellar cast . But in hind-sight , most of these performers had passed through the apex of their popularity and rellevance . Most all the muscial performers had spoken dialog as well as singing parts , except Heyward , who does most of the vocals . And of course there is Richard Burton , whose classically trained , stacatto voice is perfect for this style of recording . His performance carries the show , which does n't say much for a rock album . Most of the dialog using Lynott , Essex and Covington ranges from banal to over-rought ( Lynott 's 'parson ' is played way over the top and is somewhat embarrising given how big a Thin Lizzy fan I am ) .That is not to say that there is n't some fine moments here and there . Heyward 's Forever Autumn and Thunder Child are the only two songs that really stand out musically speaking . Forever Autumn is a wistful lament expressing seperation and loss , and while not directly related to the story , it does serve the plot well . Thunder Child is a minor masterpiece , melding story line lyrics and Burton 's impecible narration with pop/rock hooks . If most of the album resembled this work , it might actually be the classic everyone thinks it is . But the people behind the console have to take a hit here as well . A superb , etherial instrumental like The Red Weed is marred by narration instead of being a stand alone song , save for the lead-in by Burton . The mixing job as a whole is somewhat clumsy . The goofy dialog ( along with the disco trappings ) should have been scrapped and more attention paid to the quality of the music.Jeff Wayne may have had the vision and the ambition , but lacked the chops and flair of a Rick Wakeman , nor did he have the composition skills of an Alan Parsons . And I 'm afraid that time has n't been kind to this release . Instead of being a period piece as it was intended to , it 's sound is inexorably linked to the year in which it was recorded . Maybe an updated version of this story is in order- ( ( hello Rick Wakeman ... ) ) It was a good idea that never was realized to it 's best potential .	-1
My GOD ! ! ! What is this bonus track doing in this remaster ? ? THis is , simply put , the worst thing I 've ever heard by Judas Priest ! ! A drum machine , I ca n't believe ! ! The rest of the album we all know , of course , it 's classic .	-1
Ringo Starr 's BAD BOY offers three worthwhile songs : & quot ; Hard Times , & quot ; a solid rocker ; & quot ; Heart On My Sleeve , & quot ; a from-the-heart pop tune ; and & quot ; Tonight , & quot ; in which Ringo delivers an affecting vocal about new love . Beyond that , it varies from so-so to so-what . The production value on & quot ; Who Needs A Heart & quot ; and & quot ; Monkey-See , Monkey-Do & quot ; grew on me through the years , although I would n't include either on a best-of collection ( and Ringo has n't asked me to compile one ) . Ringo Starr 's BAD BOY is for the fan who wants to have everything . Those who would like to hear one of his best albums should try TIME TAKES TIME , RINGO , or GOODNIGHT VIENNA ; the latter two now include superb CD bonus tracks .	-1
This is a huge disappointment . Every song goes absolutley nowhere . David sounds like he is just learning how to write songs ( where is the melody ? ? ) and what is here is very empty and meandering . Some of the guitar playing is good but overall there is not one good song or melody here . Skip this and get his 2nd solo album About Face which is excellent !	-1
Even the new Legacy Edition of Some Enchanted Evening [ includes a DVD ] ca n't make Some Enchanted Evening compelling.After not hearing it for 20+ years , my take has n't changed : the only thing that _still_ moves is `` Astronomy . '' Part H.P . Lovecraft , part Robert E. Howard , part Heavy Metal ( the magazine ) and part Heavy Metal ( the music ) , it 's eight and a half minutes of Humboldt Select , drawn out bliss . The `` 2.0 version '' of Astronomy on the Imaginos LP is pretty interesting ( actually , that LP is way underrated ) , and the Metallica cover on `` Garage , Inc. '' is worth a spin.The DVD 's very sub-par picture quality is not really a problem . However , the audio quality is . It sounds like they used a couple a mics flown in front of the stage . For completists only .	-1
Santana completely sold out here , delivering an awful collection of mainly arena-rockers . And even if this were otherwise a masterpiece , I 'd still dock a full star on the account of Open Invitation . Is it his worst song ever ? Quite possibly . Even at his prime , Santana could n't write lyrics , and this is just a mess of bedroom cliches set to an awkwardly thumping , bombastic pop-metal backdrop . And forget ANYTHING about creativity - Santana 's classic blues/rock/Latin/jazz guitar tone is dispensed of completely for the most part.Speaking of selling out , how else could somebody explain the awful disco epic One Chain ( Do n't Make No Prison ) ? Seriously , disco and arena-rock ai n't Santana 's thing . The cover of Traffic 's Dealer is awful , stripped of even remote energy or excitement - same goes for his cover of Buddy Holly 's Well All Right ( via Blind Faith ) , which is at least better than Invitation , One Chain , or Stormy , so stupid it 'll make your IQ lower while you listen to it . Okay , not really , but I do n't like the song regardless . You 'd expect the two instrumentals to save the day here , right ? Well , one of them does : the exciting Wham ! , which is even then a more commercial Soul Sacrifice - the other , Life is a Lady/Holiday , is a Europa ripoff so blatant Carlos should 've sued himself for writing it . I 'm gon na be the early Santana purist here - the debut , Abraxas , III , Love Devotion Surrender , Caravanesari and even Festival blow this out of the water .	-1
well it was free , and santana gets to do some tasty soloing , but ... this is mostly unlistenable , lousy songwriting , uninspired playing and worst of all is the mix/recording , sounds like a 128bps mp3	-1
I followed Fogelberg 's career from the debut in '72 though this title in '80 before finally giving up on him . Every album has a few great cuts but for someone more drawn to his rock 'n ' roll side , the drippy ballads and folkish muzak just got to be too much to bear . On this , his sixth album , Fogelberg 's stylistic swings reach the breaking point - he rocks harder on the songs & quot ; Face the Fire & quot ; and & quot ; Phoenix & quot ; than he ever has before , but with & quot ; Longer & quot ; and & quot ; Heart Hotels & quot ; he lets his sappy romantic side go way overboard as well . Hard to believe a fan of one side of Fogelberg can stomach the other . I recently burned my own & quot ; Best of & quot ; CD for Fogelberg - 2 or 3 songs from each of the first 6 albums . Now I 'll sell the albums and never miss them a bit .	-1
Thanks , Sony , for the rip-off low-quality remaster with & quot ; Bonus & quot ; tracks . Hellbent for Leather is one of my favorite Priest albums but this remaster sounds just as shallow and tinny as the original release . The bonus track is musically identical to & quot ; Rock Hard , Ride Free & quot ; except for different lyrics in the chorus . & quot ; Riding on the Wind & quot ; is fine , I suppose , if you enjoy live recordings . This is the worst sounding so far of the 8 Priest CD 's Sony has remastered.If you 're thinking of buying this particular remaster for richer sound and better bass then skip it . If you 're buying it for the bonus tracks then you 'll probably be happier putting on the & quot ; Defenders & quot ; CD.If you 're a hard core fan and just HAVE to have it , prepare for disappointment . All of the jewel-case spines in your collection will match though ... Oh , except for the first two recordings which are still owned by some nut-job label : be careful not to be fooled into buying the latest re-issues of & quot ; Rocka-Rolla & quot ; , & quot ; Sad Wings ... , & quot ; or & quot ; Best Of & quot ; ! ! !	-1

There are four TOP album not even a fan needs ... the first live album 'Live and In Living Color ' ( especially since 'Soul Vaccination ' came out ) , Dinosaur Tracks ( I used mine for a coaster ; there was a reason these songs were n't released ) , 'Power ' ( released on an off-label duing their fallow years ) ... and this one , their swan song for Warners.At this point in time , the band did n't know what they wanted to be . Music was changing , and they ( or Warners ) felt they had to change , too . This was over-synthasyzed , over-produced , and not at all funky . It was out of date then , and even more so now . They would n't recover till 'Monster on a Leash ' more than a dozen years later when they thankfully seemed to find themselves again.By the way , you still ca n't beat the Tower live . I see them at least twice a year.If you 're new to TOP , buy 'Soul Vaccination ' , 'Back to Oakland ' , 'Urban Renewal ' , 'Tower of Power ' , and any of the Epic albums , in that order . Then you can go back and pick up 'East Bay Grease ' , 'We Came to Play ' . and 'In the Slot . 'But leave this one off the list .	-1
With the exception of track one and the rocker & quot ; Stay Out of Trouble & quot ; , this recording falls far short of the production and songwriting quality of previous efforts ( Especially Leftoverature and POKR ) .A lot of pointless riffs and bombastic noodlings make this a hard listen , except for the most dedicated & quot ; can hear no wrong & quot ; fan of fans .	-1
I 've grown to like and hate this album over the years of being a fan . I think its an anomaly ( besides the early mid 80 's wash-outs Revolution by Night and Club Ninja ) within the Cult 's discography of a record that took an exit down the road of commerciality . Tom Werman ( Cheap Trick ) was chosen to produce this piece and although Mirrors does display growth within the band , its just far too driven away from what made them an interesting group to listen to . Dr. Music opens the record , but is immediately thrown off by a disco-ish vibe with female back-up singers and the rhythm sections ' time signature beat . However , Great Sun Jester follows and although it has a somewhat dated sound , the lyrics are a treat to get lost in , and Eric Bloom 's vocal is very powerfully effective . In Thee is written by keyboardist/guitarist Allen Lanier and is a soft song about life on the road and estranged relationships ; it 's a bit too soft and smooth , if you ask me . The title track is a typical pop/rock tune that sounds like Foreigner , again with female back-up vocals to smooth its commercial appeal . Moon Crazy is by Joe Bouchard but it just does n't quite cut it with its pop-like sensibilities and underwhelming lyrics.Buck Dharma comes in with The Vigil and although its an interesting song and is the longest cut on the album , it just seems to be somehow , un-epic and not quite getting there . I Am the Storm restores a little bit of that pattened Blue Oyster sound with a more rocking melody but has a darkness about it as well . You 're Not the One ( I Was Looking for ) by Albert makes my jaw drop every time I hear this track . Its BOC trying to be The Cars , for christsakes ! I do n't get it . Lonley Teardrops is another Lanier tune sung by Buck but again is very lightweight in its arrangement and perfomance . There are times when I happen to find myself actually being drawn into this release , but those moments are rare . As it stands , for the most part it is one of their weaker releases . Far too much of a transition attempting to become something they 're not . 2 Stars	-1
First off the music is amazing . The music gets a 5 star review . The vinyl pressing is bad . It is a shame since it was cut by Chris Bellman . I had to send it back due to non-fill issues throughout . Hopefully they will do another pressing . If you can , get the Drastic Plastic pressing cut by Kevin Gray .	-1
I could never finish listening to this album . Dylan butchered and bastardized his songs so badly here that it made the album unlistenable . After getting partway through side three on the cassette version , I tossed it into the trash can . Like another reviewer said , Dylan has every right to re-write his songs , but to do it in such a shoddy manner is almost unforgiveable . I would give this album no stars , but it was n't on the rating scale . The quicker this LP goes out of print , the better . Bob Dylan does not need to be remembered for this abberation .	-1
No one who heard Street Legal or Dylan at Budokan should 've been surprised when he became a raving fundamentalist Christian . That 's because a ) Street Legal is a brilliant and powerful chronicle of a guy who 's losing his grip , and b ) Budokan is evidence that he 'd lost it to the point that his songs no longer meant anything whatsoever to him . Certainly , nothing could make that clearer than his obviously facetious comment about how much his songs still mean to him before `` The Times They Are A'Changin ' . '' Not even for completetists .	-1
Dylan has spent the last 40yrs trashing his legacy , nowhere worse than here -- the abysmal Budokan shows , lounge versions of his best material served up like McDonald 's cheeseburgers . I do n't know what 's sadder , Dylan as a raddled-out parody of himself or the legions of fans who continue to believe that he has anything to do with the guy who lit the world on fire back in 1965 .	-1
Starting with September Morn , all of ND 's CDs have been very uneven and this is one of his worst . This has a few songs that are listenable and the majority is so BORING ! ! ! ! I wish they would put out Greatest Hits Vol . 3 with all of his great songs since September Morn that are n't on Vol . 2 including That Kind , The Sun Ai n't Gon na Shine Anymore , On The Way To The Sky , Right By You , The Drifter , First You Have to Say You Love Me , Front Page Story , Heartlight , In Ensanada , Turn Around , You Make It Feel Like Christmas , Sleep With Me Tonight , The Man You Need , Story of My Life , It Should Have Been Me , ( I 'll See You On The Radio ) Laura , Me Beside You , Best Years of Our Lives , This Time , If I Could n't See You Again , If There Were No Dreams , Do n't Turn Around , Hooked On The Memory of You and a couple from Tennesse Moon and Three Chord Opera . Now that would be an AWESOME CD and you would n't have to waste your hard-earned money on awful CDs like this with only a couple good songs ! ! ! !	-1

Just about the Clash 's worst album ; ( I think the lumpen 'Sandinista ' is better because it 's got the fabulous 'Somebody Got Murdered ' on it . ) 'London Calling ' is as bland and dreary as it 's title suggests.I thought London was burning with boredom ( Dial 99999 ! ) , but now it seems it 's just ... calling . Oh well.It starts brilliantly with the title track but then it 's downhill fast , Lack-luster forays into r+b and reggae , rockabilly and jazz ; drifting and meandering all over the place in a vain attempt to find some badly needed cohesion - some sort of direction in among the painfully forced 'diversity'.It 's a well known rock truism that Strummer and Jones were n't getting on at the time this was recorded , and you can tell - it sounds like they were in different rooms ! It 's sad to watch this once-great song-writing team align against each other in such an obvious ( and childish ! ) way . Strummer with his slurry 'rocka ' pose , and Jones with his toe-curling 'Americanisms'.Strummer did n't recover 'til 'Combat Rock ' and before you start scoffing , compare 'Straight to Hell ' with ANYTHING on here and it 'll be the stronger song by streets.Anything containing the inexplicably awful 'Guns of Brixton ' just HAS to suck a big one ( now THERE 'S a song worth a giggle or two ) , and along with 'This Is Radio Clash ' , their poorest song in a frustratingly inconsistent canon ( if ever a group 's output was justifiably labeled 'peaks and troughs ' it 's the Clash ) .If only 'London Calling ' the album was as good as 'London Calling ' the song , we 'd have something special on our hands ; as it is , we 've got something tired , a bit derivative , and really rather tatty . 'London Calling ' was voted the best album of all time in a poll ; It 's not even the best Clash album .	-1
This album is a critics ' darling , and perhaps the most overrated album of the rock era . It would have made a decent single album , but as a double , it 's like sitting through a bad movie . Part of the problem is that the first Clash album truly is one of the greatest rock albums of all time . Even `` Give 'Em Enough Rope , '' which often gets bad reviews , is a great record . By the time LC came out , the Clash were billing themselves as `` the only band that matters , '' and critics were accepting it as fact . This albums makes it sound as if the Clash were buying a little too heavily into it , too . It is a major dropoff from their earlier work and even when viewed on its own , LC is an uneven , uninspired effort . While it 's often named as one of the top albums of all time , it was n't even one of the best albums released at its time.This was the really the first chink in the armor of the Clash , and they continued losing steam as they went on.Songs like `` Koka Kola , '' `` Four Horsemen , '' `` Death or Glory , '' and `` Right Profile '' are so tedious that you have to wonder if the Clash believed they could do no wrong . I ca n't listen to them anymore . The title cut , `` Spanish Bombs , '' `` Revolution Rock , '' and a few others are superb . Some are just filler . The rest are definitely not 5-star songs.This would have been about a 4-star album had it been a single album . As it is , the only reason I can see that it got such rave reviews is that the critics were trying to make up for having overlooked the Clash when they were truly great.Buy the first two Clash albums instead , borrow this one from a friend and burn the good cuts . You 'll be able to pick them out easily enough .	-1
The SACD version of this great album is no improvement over the regular CD . It does not sound remastered or even an improved resolution at all . In fact I a/b listened between this and regular the CD and could not decide which one I liked better . It really should be no contest.Your money is better spent elsewhere unless the price comes down to a few bucks over the regular CD ( it 's currently 4 or 5 times the cost ) . The best part about this is the nice mini lp sleeve with lyrics insert . Wasted money , disappointing audio quality , lesson learned and passed on to you.Content gets 4 stars , audio quality 2 , value 0 .	-1
What are these guys that give this reissue 5 stars on ? The sound of this release by AF sounds aboslutly very very bad . Murky , dark , veiled , flat , no top , no bottom , no midts . It sounds bad , bu any standard . Period . AF release bad sounding reissues without exception . I will NEVER buy a AF cd again . The Sony remaster for 1/4 of the price sound much better .	-1
Good God , Metal does n't get any more sterile than this . What do people see in this crap anyway ? The riffs are uninventive , the song structures are unimaginative and the drumming sucks . This album might sound & quot ; killer & quot ; to someone who 's either been listening to Metal for about a day or is just incredibly stubborn . For those of you who have n't been living under a rock though , do n't bother .	-1
Judas Priest is one of the most famous metal bands , a lot of people consider it to be one of the best metal bands ever ... Are they right ? Of course ! British Steel is one of the most famous metal albums , a lot of people consider it to be one of the best metal albums ever ... Are they right ? In my opinion , they are n't . Personally , I consider this album to be one of Priest 's worst and one of the weakest famous metal albums . Besides , I do n't really consider it to be a metal album , it sounds more like hard rock to say the truth.This album is extremely overrated . I ca n't believe that Priest went from awesome albums like Stained Class to this only 2 years later ... They went from awesome metal songs with great riffs to simple hard rock songs with average riffs . I fail to understand why so many people consider it to be Priest 's best album . My guess is that most of those people prefer 80 's mainstream hard rock over 80 's metal.The bad : The songs on this album are so ridiculously simple ... Most of them have only 4 riffs in total and those riffs are nothing special compared to most of Priest 's riffs from the 70 's . Ok , there 's nothing wrong with simple songs , but the songs are n't only simple , they 're also nothing special or in other words , they are n't like most of Priest songs from the 70 's . Breaking The Law is so overrated , I used to like it , but I got bored of it fast ... Some people think that it has an awesome chorus , but what 's so awesome about it exactly ? Its one of the least melodic choruses ever ! Just say 'breaking the law ' 8 times and you have the chorus . Living After Midnight is pretty catchy , but its just a generic and cheesy rock song ... Ok , I guess that it was n't generic in the 80 's , but its just a very average song . United has a catchy chorus , but that 's it . You Do n't Have To Be Old To Be Wise and Steeler are extremely forgettable.Did I mention that this album has some of Priest 's weakest solos ? Now I did . I guess that I should also mention that its one of their least melodic albums.The good : The best song on the album is definitely The Rage . Its actually a great song , it has a cool intro , a great main riff ( the best riff on the album ) and the verses are pretty catchy ( the best verses on the album ) . Rapid Fire , Metal Gods and Grinder are n't bad either , but damn , they 're really nothing special , they 're really simple , there 's nothing really original about them and they are n't anywhere near as good as most of Priest 's songs from the 70 's . I know that I 'm repetitive with that , but it has to be said.So , its 50/50 , half of the album is very average and the other half is just good . There 's nothing really bad on this album , but there 's nothing awesome either , its just very average overall.Now , I have a question ... How can anyone prefer songs like Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight over songs like Exciter , Beyond The Realms Of Death , Victim Of Changes , Sinner , Starbreaker ... ? Ok , I understand if you 're a fan of 80 's mainstream hard rock , but otherwise I don't.This album was nothing more than an attempt at becoming more famous . Thank god that Priest redeemed themselves with Screaming For Vengeance . Even Turbo is better than this album.Do I recommend it ? Well , I guess that most of the people who look at this site have already heard it , but if you have n't , I do n't recommend it , but I ca n't really tell you to avoid it because a lot of people like it , so maybe you 'll like it .	-1
Since 1977 Cheap Trick has been my second favorite band of all time , behind only The Beatles . From their debut LP in 1977 up through the release of 'Dream Police ' two and a half years later , Cheap Trick was at their creative peak and produced a body of work that stands among the best rock n roll ever . The 'Dream Police ' LP that preceded 'All Shook Up ' was somewhat of a disappointment also and although it sold well critics and fans were somewhat let down . But on 'All Shook Up ' the fans ' and critics ' worst fears were confirmed . After several years of relentless touring and cranking out one great song after another , Cheap Trick 's creative fires had all but burned out . Except for the songs 'Ca n't Stop The Music ' and 'High Priest Of Rhythmic Noise ' this album is n't worth the 30 minutes it takes to sit through it . Besides the weak songs , this album is also poorly produced and just does n't sound good . With all due respect to the legendary George Martin , his work here is n't very good . The guitars sound terrible and Martin 's attempt to incorporate orchestral elements into the band 's raw sound just does n't work.If you want to hear the 'real ' Cheap Trick , skip this dud and get any of their first four releases ( 'Cheap Trick ' and 'In Color'from 1977 , 'Heaven Tonight ' from 1978 , or 'Live At Budokan'from 1979 ) .	-1
Meat Loaf may of been the headliner , but the groundbreaking BAT OUT OF HELL album ended up doing as much for it 's quirky composer . that `` songs by Jim Steinman '' blurb may of seemed like an act of gold-star tokenism , but it announced in it 's own way that there was another `` new talent '' riding this crest as well . and it was a talent that would flourish , most obviously in the form of hits he would shortly pen for Air Supply ( `` Making Love Out Of Nothing At All '' ) and Bonnie Tyler ( `` Holding Out For A Hero , '' `` Total Eclipse Of The Heart '' ) .if only he 'd stuck to his strengths . i do n't say something like that lightly because i 've always admired , even envied , musicians who can write , produce , and arrange as well as perform , actors who can write scripts and direct as well , etc . i like to see artists spread their wings when the can pull it off . but the fact is , Steinman couldn't.industry legend has it that when Meat Loaf 's voice gave out on him , Steinman stepped into the spotlight to keep the album from begin scrapped . certainly a noble sentiment in it 's own right , but it backfired . Steinman 's thin , reedy voice might 've worked out for the sort of songs people like Fabian and Frankie Avalon sing , but it does n't come anywhere close to the epic grandeur his own compositions cried out for . it 's as if the stuff was sung by Micky Mouse.it 's potenitally killer stuff - most of these songs would turn up on later Meat Loaf albums , after all - but Steinman just does n't have the gravitas to sell it .	-1
I just flat out do n't like this album . It has nothing to do with the Christian theme as I loved Slow Train & thought the tour to back it was one of his best . My problems are the sound is n't very good & these just are n't very good songs . The problem with a lot of Christian albums is that the artist is so overcome with the message that they think the message is enough , blinding them to the fact that for maximum impact the music has to shine , like on Slow Train . These song , while earnestly sung , just fall flat . This , along with Dylan and Self Portrait are about the only Dylan albums I do n't listen to regularly & pretty much keep them just to keep my collection complete .	-1
For everyone who thinks Babs is as special as she does .	-1
It 's shocking how quickly Weather Report ran out of ideas . `` Weather Report '' and `` I Sing the Body Electric '' were rough but interesting , and then they put out two wonderful albums , `` Sweetnighter '' and `` Mysterious Traveler '' Immediately after that , the stream dried up . Jaco Pastorius is one of the major culprits . His bass playing is technically brilliant , but devoid of ideas . `` Night Passage '' is mostly aimless soloing over uninteresting tunes and arrangements . I think I 've listened to it three times , and I ca n't imagine why I 'd listen to it a fourth .	-1
The explosion of fusion in the 1970s provided a venue for jazz artists to not only reach a wider audience , but also to dip into spin-off projects that served two purposes ; keep fresh product on the shelves in record shoppes and to dabble in cross-over appeal , as FM radio was still powering forward with room in many formats for different styles from musicians with proven track records to quickly move units into the hands of customers and not into dusty cut-out bins.Stanley Clarke and George Duke were riding a crest of incredible popularity with jazz , rock and R & B ; fans , which makes the mostly plodding nature of the first volume in their collaboration quite disappointing . Leaning heavily on the sounds from Earth , Wind & Fire , the 1981 release plays it safe on most of the nine tracks that clock in at a skimpy 36:16.The cover of the classic garage band tune `` Louie , Louie '' is embarrassing , as the funk is nothing but junk . `` Wild Dog '' finds the duo sizzling , with Clarke delivering heavy bass lines as if he is smoking the chords on a Fender Stratocaster . An interlude - the smartly titled , `` Never Judge a Cover by Its Book '' - paves a direct path to clubland with `` Let 's Get Started '' and `` Winners . `` The Duke ballad `` Sweet Baby '' is about as good as it gets with the pace taking a romantic angle - though `` I Just Want to Love You '' and `` Touch and Go '' consist of interchageable parts - and the closer `` Finding My Way '' having enough punch for AOR playlists.Due to the elements that the pair brought into the studio , there is no way that a record company suit would question the stuff contained on the master tapes . But even when the skies seem cloudless on Earth , a little Wind can bring the Fire contained in heavy rains that will wash away the plans to what appeared to be a slam-dunk artistic endeavor .	-1
This CD is actually a 1981 album collection issued by Epic after her 1st 4 solo albums 1977 - 1980 . That 's why there are only 8 songs , as it was originally a vinyl and cassette release . Hence , it 's missing a lot of Patti 's career songs , hits and highlights that made history [ ON MY OWN , NEW ATTITUDE , OVER THE RAINBOW , IF ONLY YOU KNEW , LOVE NEED AND WANT YOU , SOMEBODY LOVES YOU BABY and on and on ] . It does contain the # 1 hit by the group Labelle LADY MARMALADE , Patti 's first solo hit JOY TO HAVE YOUR LOVE , and her anthem YOU ARE MY FRIEND . But LITTLE GIRLS is hardly an essential song . This is just a sample of Patti 's late 70 's work . A real best of would be the CD : PATTI LABELLE 'S GREATEST HITS to get or the Half Labelle/Half Patti Solo collection : LADY MARMALADE : THE BEST OF PATTI AND LABELLE .	-1
This album is an exercise in self-indulgence from start to finish . Spilled across three lps/2cds is a collection of songs and fragments that fall into three categories : reggae-based music that likely could have been an expectable single-disc album ; rock-based material of mediocre quality and several song fragments , instrumentals and aural pastiches the appearance of which only go to prove that no one was thinking of quality when Sandinista was being produced . An album of this size ( 36 tracks ; not all of which I consider songs ) is a tough row to hoe for any band . One of the most successful multi-disc albums was Dylan 's ` Blonde on Blonde . ' It was but two discs with an 11 odd minute opus talking most of one side of the four . The White Album , another two disc effort , is still the subject of debate and conjecture , marking as it does the early signs of group fragmentation . I have to feel that most folks will agree that The Clash were not in the same league with Dylan and The Beatles . The level of arrogance and pretension in their making a three disc product can only be seen as the aural equivalent of Michael Cimino 's ` Heaven 's Gate . `` For the band claiming the moniker `` The only band that matters , '' one has to wonder more about the question of `` what matters to them ? It is not , however , the musical styles with which I have issue . Except maybe the third grouping which I felt were , at best , the sort of cuts one expects to find as additional tracks on a reissued classic album.Instead , it is the imagery of this band that troubles me because I have no faith in it being anything more than style over substance . Wearing their fashionable political views on their fashionable clothing , these poseurs always seemed to be at ease talking the talk but never walking the walk . Always image conscious and eager to please as many as possible , The Clash apparently decided to take the approach of throwing everything they had against a wall and hoping much of it would stick ; that is to say have all of the material accepted by some part of their audience . This approach is a betrayal , no ; it is dishonesty IF you feel The Clash had any modicum of belief in what they were doing beyond revenue generation.And while I understand that Barrett Strong hit the nail on the head with ` Money , ' I still expect folks to live by the words they use . Look at Bono or Jon Bon Jovi to see how a rock star can hold political views and live by them as well . Perhaps the only complementary thing I can saying about this work is that perhaps it was a rite of passage needed to reach ` Combat Rock . '	-1
The music is very good.. There are a few throwaway songs throughout but it is a solid 3.5 star Clash album.The 2013 vinyl pressing is really bad . It is a shame since it was cut by Chris Bellman . Like the self-titled lp , I had to send it back due to non-fill issues throughout . Hopefully they will do another pressing and correct the problems that plague the current available version of Sandinista and The Clash .	-1
( Written By Metalhead Ted ) 1981 was a strange year for Judas Priest-On one hand , they were n't a household name yet in The States , but theirprevious masterpiece , British Steel , was their most successful album yet.There was the problem right there ... How do you follow up a landmark album like `` British Steel '' ? Well , it did n't happen in my opinion . Yes , `` Point of Entry '' has two really outstanding tracks : `` Desert Plains '' and `` Heading Out to the Highway . '' That was it . The rest of the album has been described by Priestfans as `` mediocre '' or just plain , `` weak . '' So what happened ? I will try to make sense out of it if I can . Somebody had the idea that Priest neededto engage the US in a big way . The time was right . So maybe they should try and write some tracks that could be more `` radio friendly '' or have a `` mainstream '' sound . ( Was this the imposing voice of CBS suits or was this Priest 's management ? We 'll never know ) What resulted was a disappointing and very lackluster album . Ironically , it went gold and even hit # 39 on Billboard . So the fans did like it , a little bummed maybe , but they went out and bought it . Radio embraced `` Heading Out ... '' and I think it was considered a success , overall . Priest toured the US to support it , but I really do n't think it had the effect they were dreaming and planning . They had to grind out the '81 tour and hope for bigger and better things to come ... 1982 would prove to be the year when the lightning hit .	-1
Sorry Leonard ; I was very disappointed in this.Always wanted a really good copy of this great piece of music.This is not it.Way too Broadwayish , broken up so much that the melody NEVER gets to play through.If you know of a good one please let me know !	-1
My CD of this pop-minimalist , actually , contained two discs : the first resp . the last Ph . Glass CD I 'll ever hear in my life . Try Steve Reich 's Music for Mallet Instruments , Voices and Organ instead - the peak of this ( overrated ) style.Klaus	-1
First off , this cd may have been released in several versions , or also in a remastered edition . My version is Columbia CK 37335 . The sound is simply dreadful . The music has been subjected to massive treble cuts in order to hide faulty source material on nearly all the tracks . The highs waver in and out on many of these tracks ! The sound is unimaginably lifeless ! ! Too bad they did n't use better tape sources , or even the original vinyl on this one .	-1
Art has always had a difficult time choosing quality songs for his great voice and this album is no exception . It has no great songs ( most of Art 's albums have at least 1 or 2 ) and a couple of ok songs ( A Heart In New York , So Easy To Begin , Ca n't Turn My heart Away ) but the rest are very forgettable and VERY boring . That is the risk you take with all Art 's albums ( except Breakaway ) -- they can be very uneven and boring in general , with little melody to differentiate many of the songs . The songs Scissors Cut and In Cars are HORRIBLE and unlistenable ! Get `` Breakaway '' first , and then if you like that pick up Fate for Breakfast or a Best of collection -- `` Garfunkel '' or `` Simply the Best '' ( Import ) are the best choices available . His new collection `` The Singer '' has way way way too many poor selections and drags . Better yet get a Simon & Garfunkel album !	-1
OK , I 'll admit it . I bought this cassette when it first came out , and I thought it was the coolest thing ever . Although I never went so far as to dress like Adam Ant , I definitely wore this the tape out from repeated play . I listened to it again just recently and realized that , like many things in life , my memories proved better than reality . The album just simply does not stand the test of time . With the exception of & quot ; Stand and Deliver , & quot ; and maybe & quot ; Prince Charming , & quot ; these songs are pretty weak . It 's an interesting snapshot of a moment in history , but not one that will be long remembered .	-1
Only a Loverboy fanatic would have the gall to declare this CD & quot ; one of the best ever. & quot ; Most over rated , most mediocre , maybe . But & quot ; Get Lucky & quot ; , like Loverboy themselves , gets a lot of mileage from very little substance . On this CD , & quot ; Working for the Weekend & quot ; and & quot ; Lucky Ones & quot ; have a lot of pop , a lot of drive and enough hooks to carry over to some of this CDs other more redundant and uninspired tunes . & quot ; Take Me To The Top & quot ; is probably one of the worst written songs that made it big , with lyrics straight out of an easy opening can . But like so many other Loverboy tunes , a song with a nice hook can smother or smooth out some of the cheesiest lyrics . The fact that Loverboy 's life at the top of the charts was as brief as it was is no coincidence . It was just a matter of time they were shown for what they were - average talent hidden behind pretty hair and clothes . No band used spandex more effectively , and the legions of gorgeous dressed alike beauties at their concerts are a testimony to that fact . But , I digress . The fact is Mike Reno had one of the best voices in the business . He just did n't have much depth as a song writer . When the hooks his band would come up with ran out , so did the band 's popularity . This CD is full of examples of just how deep this band , and CD is not . Loverboy could put on a good show in concert , where they could play only their best tunes . But their CDs , like & quot ; Get Lucky & quot ; mostly consisted of one or two catchy tunes surrounded by filler grizzle .	-1
Dylan is at the top of his game and the sound is much improved - too bad so much time is wasted on The Band and their mediocre songs when there was a legend present . If it was all Dylan would be 5 stars , ZERO stars for The Band .	-1
From '77- '79 the Clash were a great , if different , punk band . Then , they left behind their punk roots and recorded a masterpeice called `` London Calling '' . To this day it is still acknowledged as one of the greatest albums of all time . This , on the other hand , is horse manure . The Clash always experimented with different styles of music , but c'mon , did we really need disco ? Instead of this dreck , buy their masterpeices : `` London Calling '' , `` The Clash '' , and the less good but still great `` Give em Enough Rope '' . Avoid this , `` Sandista '' , and especially `` Cut the Crap '' .	-1
I got ta admit , hearing the songs & quot ; Rosanna & quot ; and & quot ; Africa & quot ; on the radio back in 1982 was quite enjoyable . Both of those songs ended up getting stuck inside my head for quite some time . But when I finally got around to purchasing this album , in 1987 , I was quite disappointed . Most of the songs here sound fake , artificial , and phony . Yes , I know that all three of those words mean the same thing . But this album is so chock full of emptiness that I need to be redundant in my choice of words to describe it . Most of the songs here are supposedly about love , but in reality , I find it difficult to believe that the majority of the songs here are based on genuine feelings . Instead , it sounds as if a bunch of people sat down at a meeting , pulled out a book on how to write songs , and used some kind of a formula to compose most of this album . A lot of the music here is downright empty and bland . And when I do get any feelings from it , it 's usually the feeling that I am about to regurgitate my last meal . In particular , the song & quot ; I Wo n't Hold You Back & quot ; makes me feel especially queasy . Overall , this is a pretty bad CD . But even today , I do admit to having a certain fondness for & quot ; Rosanna & quot ; and & quot ; Africa. & quot ; That probably has more to do with nostalgia than anything else , though .	-1
A few good songs , but overall not a keeper for me . ( Note - I am very picky in my record evaluations , and give a thumbs up -- four or five stars -- only to albums where I can play the whole record and delight in hearing every single song . )	-1
I think even Michael Jackson does n't understand how this average recording turned out to be the best seeling record ever . It 's an average albun , not bad at all , but nothing special . There are three or four great songs , the rest is plain boring .	-1
An encroaching eighties deadened production aesthetic really took its toll on the once vibrant jammers , producing another stinker in the midst of a cold streak and justified in all sell-out criticisms when witnessing continuously calibrated-for-airplay Journey-isms at the expense of organic Latin fire ( tacked on and rehashed for appeasement occasionally though it may be ) .	-1
Do n't waste your cash on this terrible remaster . This is the last remastered album / disc i will buy . Everything is mastered so compressed with the thinking the everyone listens to music on mp3 players , well that is NOT the case ! There are still people who care what the music actually sounds like . This is just another thin glassy sounding remaster that sounds terrible on a real stereo or a high quality car stereo . Very , very disappointing ! ! ! This Is Supposed To Be HEAVY Metal & It Sounds Like Tin Foil .	-1
I know alot of people love this album , and think it 's priest 's best album , but I think this record is over rated.THey were a more influential band before they released the Point of Entry album.Everything after British Steel in my opinion is second rate material.Not to say that I dont like some of the records released after British Steel , but they were not the influential band they were before the `` Point of Entry '' debocle.They tryed to reclame their Metal sound on this Record but they half-assed it.it 's just way to poppy.I love the title track , the song `` Electric Eye '' and `` Riding on the Wind '' but I think the rest of the album is prety weak.I think the hit single off this album `` you got another thing comin '' is a louzy song .	-1
Roger , oh Roger , why did you destroy the Pink Floyd name with this garbage ? This is a concept of poor songwriting and craftsmanship . This album was nothing but a Roger Waters solo album and it had nothing to do with Pink Floyd but more of the selfishness of Roger Waters to bore us of war stories . He pretty much compromised a boring biography for good songwriting whcih is sad.Here is the true concept of this CD : The Post war dream - ROger 's dream of destroying Pink Floyd album the masterpiece Animals . Unfortunately , the other Pink Floyd members won their war and the Wall came out.Your Possible Pasts - Definitely sounds nothing like Pink Floyd 's past cuz it sucks so bad.One of the few - One of the few of the worst tracks on this album which is terriblewhen the tigers broke free - The Tigers broke free because their ears could n't handle the crappiness of this album.the heros return - there must 've been a david gilmour solo worth listening to on this track . the rest sucks.gunners dream - his dream was to shoot waters for writing this garbageparanoid eyes - I 'd be paranoid too after hearing this track and somebody caught me listening to this.get your hands ... - yeah , get your hands on the eject button and burn this CDfletcher memorial home - Thats where Fletcher is now since he killed himself after hearing this album.southampton dock - Thats where David Gilmour tried to throw away the crappy demos of this album.the final cut - the end of a great band is evident here . the final cut has been made.not now john - not now john , this album is giving me a major headache ! two suns in the sunset - the end of a great band . the two suns have split in the sunset . one is the horrors of roger waters ' bad solo albums and the other is polly samson writing all the lyrics for gilmour floyd.this album is worse of an abomination than anything collins did with genesis without gabriel or was it ? Run , Run , RunRun Like Hell cuz this album is bad !	-1
Let me first say that I love Pink Floyd ... But I have tried and tried and tried to listen to this album and I can never make it all the way through . Every song sounds like sorry half baked discards off of the Wall . There is no cohesive melody in any of the songs , Final Cut just meanders along in drowning waters . At this point it almost sounds like Floyd parodying themselves with Floydian gimmicks and lyrics . There is very little of the usual musical inventiveness going on here . This album is in pure cookie cutter mode .	-1
I was just out of college when this album came out in the early eighties . Everyone I knew tried to like it . ( Right out of college everyone 's broke so no one wants to give in to buyer 's remorse . ) I still put it on from time to time to see if my opinion has changed and have bought it multiple times including the 2004 remaster . It 's really a 2.5 star album . Musically and melody-wise it 's subpar , and lyrically it 's even worse . But it 's still of interest because of Roger 's backing group which includes some of the members of Pink Floyd ( who ca n't stand the album ) .Compared to the other Pink Floyd releases , even the soundtrack lp 's `` More '' and `` Obscured by Clouds '' are much more interesting . However , this one 's really a Roger Waters solo album and , as such , it 's the best of those.The problem is that Waters ' solo albums are , ahem , not exactly great.There are some people , however , who enjoy famous rock stars throwing left wing temper tantrums . If you like that sort of thing , as Rolling Stone magazine does , then this would be your cup of tea .	-1
This is Floyd 's worst album . Waters ' lyrics are great but the music ( instrumentation ) is lacking . Anyone who thinks this is their best dont like music , they only like lyrics . Pass on this and just read a book . By the way Rogerless Floyd is better than this , and its a good thing too because if they would have ended when this came out the would have went out with a stinker . Any and every other Floyd album is much much better musically , this is lyrical masterpiece but a musical joke .	-1
I think that the final cut is too overrated . It is not that great . It has 3 alright songs : The Fletcher Memorial Home , Southampton Dock and The Final Cut . The Fletcher Memorial Home appeared on Echoes : The Best of Pink Floyd , it was the only song that came of the final cut . In other words the final cut is not reccomended , I bought it because I collect all Pink Floyd CDs.It is attrochious .	-1
& quot ; The Final Cut & quot ; is probably the only Pink Floyd record that I could call bland . This record has no color , no imagination or essence like their other work . This just shows that when left alone to vent his spleen , Roger Waters can let his stories and concepts surge WAY ahead of the music . Theres nothing here from Gilmour except his fine ( as always ) playing , Wrights gone , and Mason , well , he pounds the skins very well . While other Floyd works like & quot ; The Wall & quot ; , & quot ; A Momentary Lapse of Reason & quot ; , & quot ; Dark Side of the Moon & quot ; , & quot ; Animals & quot ; , & quot ; Wish You Were Here & quot ; , & quot ; The Division Bell & quot ; , and even early so-so experiments like & quot ; Meddle & quot ; and & quot ; Atom Heart Mother & quot ; have certain colorfull , if at times not all conceptual messages and themes . Now I love Roger Waters , I 've seen him in concert , and I have his solo records , but he does have a bit of an ego problem , and the fact that he constantly slogs his former mates for carrying on as Floyd kind of depresses me . & quot ; The Final Cut & quot ; is a good example of what I mean . Take the concept , from Waters one would expect the same brilliance he displayed in & quot ; The Wall & quot ; and & quot ; Animals & quot ; , but instead he wastes the whole album on what is basically a political rant . That would seem to be ok , but coming from him , this album just tends to drag on ( one of & quot ; The Wall & quot ; s & quot ; few flaws as well ) . Mr. Gilmour is essentially a session player here , which is one of the reasons the album suffers . Gilmour does not get the respect he deserves , instead of compliments on his fine musical achievements with post Waters Floyd , he gets attacked for not being an & quot ; addept & quot ; lyrisist . On this album Gilmour contributes no music , he did'nt even want to , and its plain to see why . When Waters gets an idea in his head , being not as musically inclined as Gilmour , he lets the idea take over the record . Which finally brings me to the songs . There are some great tunes here , like & quot ; Not Now John & quot ; , & quot ; The Gunner 's Dream & quot ; and the title song . They are all in the same vain as the pieces on & quot ; The Wall & quot ; , both in rhythm and texture with slow beats and excellent leads . But they just are not memorable , and do n't stand out well in Floyd 's vast catalog . As a Floyd completeist , I do own & quot ; The Final Cut & quot ; , and it 's not a total loss , but definately one of Waters ' lower points , apparently even the best of them stumble once in a while .	-1
Ok , first , I dont want to hurt anyones sensibility , specially Roger Waters fans , they tend to be hypercritical ... ( Altough I think this all Gilmour-Waters confrontation is dull as hell and does n't contribute at all in any aspect ... ) Im a Pink Floyd fan . That meaning , that I truly aprecciate the band really great albums , those who were a result of a colective sound and are their best . ( Excluding The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , which is a complete masterpiece , only contrasted by Sgt Peppers ) . Wish You Were Here is the clearest example of this , with 4 members working it off and making a true masterpiece of music ... So , what happened . My theory is this . ( and please respect it and do n't bash it if ur beliefs are different ) . Roger Waters has too much going on inside of him . Mother fixation , father trauma , the world unjustice factor ... And in some terms that was really ( or is ) great . That made Roger lyrics little pieces of jewelry that we all can relate to . His composition levels were great ( and are ) too , and with Dave , Rick and Nick behind them , they had so much power and become floyd compositions . Tis was the floyd working at full machine . Of course the other guys have some excellent compositions too , but this was an example..But beggining with Animals and finishing with this album , it seems to me that the lyrics overrun the music . That , for me has been Roger Waters problem . He let the lyrics led , forgets about musicianship at all . The oposite thing happens to David Gilmour . While he focus on the music , the lyrics are allright , but not just great.So thats it here . For me , it was a Roger Waters album . Because it did n't sounded like the Floyd anymore , ( there are some theories that say that there is not a PF sound ... come on ! , the atmospheric spacy sound , the guitar work , the lyrics ... ) it sounded more like an pop orchestra Roger Waters album . I personally do n't like his voice , and he knew that in the late 60s and the early 70s ... he let the others sing , while he made a right appearence in one or two songs ... So , yeah , it was a dissapointing thing for me hearing this . After Animals ( 3.5 ) and the Wall ( 3 ) , this was Floyd lowest point , and not . Because this was , and not , a Pink Floyd album.The music here is good though , for an average album , but nothing more than a vehicle for the lyrics . And that 's why these songs were n't on The Wall . They just not reached the standarts of the band . But Mr . Waters took over , and the rest its history .	-1
Like every other album he has ever done , Nebraska is boring painful to listen too . His lyrics are predictable and the music has no life .	-1
Heartlight , a near front to back collaboration with the legendary 80s ' production/songwriting duo of Burt Bacharach & Carole Bayer Sager , would be the last Neil Diamond album to be certified platinum , produce a top 10 hit , and chart in the top 20 for well over a decade ; in other words , it 's the last sample from his popularity 's heyday . By its own merits it hardly deserved the success it provided for the artist , since it 's wholeheartedly plagued by unmemorable MOR material glazed in a slick & dated production , though its most cringe-worthy quality is how passionless Neil Diamond and his backing musicians perform the material ( not like the songs allow much room for vivid interpretation in the first place ) . The album did produce `` Heartlight '' , an early top 10 hit for Bacharach/Sager in the decade , but while they would move on to write and produce many hits throughout the decade , Neil Diamond drifted from major public attention for the rest of the eighties .	-1
This lp should have NO STAR . Its been 25 years since quiet riot started , and to date they havent found the way to make at least ONE good song . I remember when i used to like this album,3 years ago , and now i realise what wrong i was.L.A.glam metal is the best rock : RATT , MOTLEY CRUE , POISON , GNR , L.A.GUNS , WASP , SLAUGHTER , PRETTY BOY FLOYD , BUT NOT QUIET RIOT ! ! ! !	-1
The only single merit QUIET RIOT ever had was paving the way for guitarrist Randy Rhoads shine later in Ozzy Osbourne 's outfit . QUIET RIOT ever played straight commercial songs , playing without any heart following the ugly glam mania that invaded the States in the eighties . This CD has two or three good tunes , the rest is horrible .	-1
The title track is slammin ' , but the rest of the CD disappoints . Juicy Fruit is a classic of the '80 's . Unfortunately , the other songs are mundane and repetitious .	-1
I have listened to all but 3 of Santana 's original CDs . This one is atrocious . AVOID AT ALL COSTS ! I was left wondering if a crappy radio station was playing.Awarded 1 star since mandatory , more like a cosmic dump ... Listen to Abraxas instead . You are forewarned ! : (	-1
The E Streeters sound as lame as a Bon Jovi cover band ( folks , that 's not a compliment ) . With this release , Bruce goes from scruffy Poet Laureate of the blue collar underdogs to heavy rotation MTV hottie . Sad . The `` Live 1975-85 '' set is an even worse sell out . Guess the guy 's Golden Age was `` Wild , Innocent '' to `` Nebraska '' .	-1
This CD is garbage , and I expected much better from Clarke . The ONLY SONG on this CD that is worth while is the wonderful 'Heaven Sent You ' , which is sung by Howard Hewett . In fact , I got the CD for this one song ! ! Do n't pay too much for this CD ! ! ! Get it used ! ! !	-1
I do not know what the other reviwer is on . The sound on this MOFI is poor and lifeless . The Sony sacd sounds much better , more life , more sparkle , more dynamics . This follows a trend in the latest Mofi releases : They generally sound like mentioned above and is not better than the old remasters . USD 30- What a letdown .	-1
7th studio release by Cheap Trick . `` Next Position Please '' , is their first real bad album . Todd Rundgren produced , not a bad idea , but they swung and missed a lot on this album . They did have a few songs i liked in , the beautiful single `` I Ca n't Take It '' , # 41 , and `` You Jump '' , which has a little Move flavor in it . Their cover of The Motors `` Dancing The Night Away '' , is a little rigid . For me this was there first bad album .	-1
During the success with `` Thriller '' , Michael Jackson recorded the `` Victory album with his brothers . Perhaps to capitalise of the success of `` Thriller '' , the brothers teamed up once again . Their last record `` Triumph '' had been hailed as a good effort . To support `` Victory '' The Jacksons went on a major tour , however Michael Jackson performed solo songs as well . The overall sound of `` Victory '' suggests Michael Jackson was n't too bothered with the album . He contributed with merely 2 songs- '' State Of Shock '' and `` Be Not Always '' and wrote `` The Hurt '' with David Paich , Steve Porcaro and his brother Randy Jackson . The `` Victory '' album managed to peak at No . 3 in the UK and No . 4 in the US . Its sales of 4-5 millions was deemed a flop by critics as it was expected to sell by the truckloads due to the success of the `` Thriller '' album and Michael Jackson 's popularity at the time.The album opens with the odd `` Torture '' . The rocky track has Michael and Jermaine sharing lead vocals . The chorus is quite good and the noises in music are a weirdly , but it works quite well with the subject at hand . It was released as the second single , reaching No . 17 in the US and No . 26 in the UK . The video for `` Torture '' had a wax-doll of Michael Jackson instead of the real one . Apparently a fight broke out between the brothers and Michael Jackson refused to appear in the video . ''Wait '' is an up-tempo song sung by Jackie Jackson , Michael makes a short appearance with ad-libs at the end of the song . The `` Victory '' saw each Jackson member sing lead vocals , whereas Michael had been the dominant force in the past . In my opinion having all the members sing lead may have been seen as a good idea , however it is obvious that certain members have very limited vocal range . ''One More Chance '' is a lovely ballad . Quite good if you ask me . It was written and produced by Randy Jackson and it is reminiscent of something Michael Jackson would enjoy singing . Randy sings it nicely and overall it 's probably the best ballad on the record . Janet Jackson would later do a version of this song as well . I have it on a single release with the song `` If '' . Janet Jackson 's version is better than the original , however it does n't differ much from the original . Just imagine Miss . Jackson singing it and you have already heard her version.Written solely by Michael ( additional lyrics by Marlon Jackson ) , `` Be Not Always '' is a dreadful song by my standard . Once again Jackson takes on the state of the world and he does an awful job . I simply ca n't stand this track at all . The word always is repeated at every opportunity and it does get annoying to say the least . Sugary is the best word for it.The lead single `` State Of Shock '' is undeniable the best song on the album . The original version should have been a duet with Freddie Mercury of `` Queen '' . However due to time conflicting schedules , Mick Jagger was asked to do the honour of joining The Jacksons for `` State Of Shock '' It 's interesting to hear the two , Michael and Mick , singing against each other . The music is driven by David Williams ' guitar/bass playing and MJ 's handclasp . Quite simple compared to the rest of the structure on the album . ''State Of Shock '' reached No . 3 in the US and No . 14 in The UK . ''We Can Change The World '' , `` The Hurt '' and `` Body '' are among the weakest tracks on the album . ''The Hurt '' sees Tito singing in a falsetto voice and it sounds beyond horrible . Avoid at all cost . ''Body '' has the most pathetic lyrics `` Girl I Want Your Body/So Why Do n't You Come Home With Me Now '' . It does n't get any better than that . Eh yeah it does.The album sounds extremely dull and the music consists of an extremely overproduced sound . The songs lack strength and there simply is n't enough good songs on the album as a whole . ''Victory '' is mainly for hard-core Jacksons/Michael Jackson fans , who want to get their hands on everything the group or the `` Gloved '' one have ever released . If you have just discovered The Jacksons as a group , you should purchase `` Destiny '' or `` Triumph '' as they are undoubtedly their best `` adult '' albums.Overall Rate : 3/10	-1
Though acclaimed by most critics back in the 1980s , Paul Young 's `` No Parlez '' perhaps more than any album ever made epitomises the declining fortune in the hands of critics that commercial music of the 1980s has suffered in the last twelve years.Nonetheless , this change in viewpoint is totally deserved in this case . Whilst to those critics from the 1980s Paul Young might have appeared to be a truly charismatic white-funk singer , his voice really sounded at times like a rapper trying to sing . The effect really can not be seen as anything other than atrocious to modern ears , especially when the songs move to softer , easy listening passages that come between dated synth-pop that really tried to be hard when Paul Young never wanted a producer who might produce a decent type of funk sound.The rhythms in particular show how hopelessly tied to the 1980s `` No Parlez '' is . The backing vocals in particular appear to be so artificial ( for example the `` please hurry '' section of `` Come Back And Stay '' - the first song I remember on radio ) that nobody who did not grow up when I myself did could gain any insight into anything from them.Just as bad was the way in which most of these songs were set to extended dance mixtures with horrible rap-type intros that do nothing at all bar destroy any melody that was in the songs ( which Paul Young 's later efforts proved to be minimal at best ) . Even when he attempts to sing a ballad that should have been a capella on `` Broken Man '' , the songs goes nowhere.Nobody really needs to accept the way `` No Parlez '' sounds in the 21st century . So dated it 's a museum piece , really .	-1
A plethora of production tricks and a doerth of memorable tunes . This is the sonic equivalent of waterboading .	-1
... It 's a shame that it was not REMASTERED . The whole CD is still at the same levels as the 1985 release.That being said , it 's nice to have the two previously unreleased tracks from the Caddyshack S/T on CD for the first time . The production on this album clearly reflects that it is a product from the eighties , but songs like `` Loraine '' `` I 'll Be There '' `` Forever '' & `` Love Will Follow '' are really strong.Guess I 'll have to buy the album AGAIN when they finally get around to remastering Loggins ' catalog .	-1
Yes , that 's all there is to it . This is sterile , outdated , boring crap that borrows heavily from equally sterile , outdated , boring crappy bands like Judas priest and AC/DC . Listen to Melodic death metal like 90s Death , Amon amarth , At the gates , Arch enemy , In flames , Dark tranquility , and Carcass ' Heartwork instead of this cliched trash . Peace out mullethead Iron maiden t-shirt wearing duuuuudz !	-1
There 's no shame in PRIEST releasing this album . If their only option was to sell out , use puffy hair and thing like that , they even managed to release a stisfactory pop-metal album . I must remember you that this was not a & quot ; phenomenom & quot ; that occured only with the mighty Priest , during the middle eighties : it also happened with SAXON , SCORPIONS , MICHAEL SCHENKER , RAVEN , ACCEPT , and other greta European bands , who tried hard to & quot ; make America & quot ; . In Judas case , they had already & quot ; made America & quot ; with their previous albuns , but probably greedy executive men made up their minds about selling out and making even more money . So , in DEFENDERS OF THE FATIH we have the first clear signs of what we should have to endure with the release of the & quot ; great & quot ; TURBO..	-1
This was definitely my all time favorite album of the early 80 's & amp ; I was ecstatic when it was issued on CD & amp ; included & quot ; Perfect & quot ; as a bonus track ... however this re-issue is a pathetic , money -grabbing , resource-wasting exercise . Time has not been good to Matt Johnson 's sense of judgement . Not only are there no bonus tracks , but one of the tracks is removed for the reissue ? That 's almost as bad as the Peter Gabriel reissues ( deleting material from the live 2 CD set to fit it on 1 CD ) . You can still find the original in bargain bins & amp ; since it still has & quot ; Perfect & quot ; on it , it is superior to this reissue . The original US CD was perfect with & quot ; Perfect & quot ; & amp ; what could have made this an even better issue is the inclusion of 12 & quot ; versions & amp ; b-sides from the singles . ( It 's true the bonus disc on the greatest hits 2CD set included a few , but when a CD can hold 80 minutes of music , it 's really inexcusable not to fill it up when there is plenty of unreleased material that people want on CD ) . Will the UK 12 & quot ; mix of Perfect ever make it to CD ? or the 3 Orange Kisses from Kazan ? Waiting for the Upturn ? ... .I guess I should finally hook up my record player to my computer , extract the original US CD , record the vinyl singles of the same period & amp ; burn my own CD , because as long as it 's in Matt 's hands , it wo n't see the light of day . : (	-1
The first thing you 'll notice when you stumble into the coke-infested realm that is `` Mirror Moves '' is the influence of Phil Collins on the Furs new `` mature '' sound . You 'll remember that 1984 was the year Collins came out of the closet in a People magazine interview , in a big way . Everybody but drummer Paul Wilson ( he was known as `` The Thimble , '' if you get what I mean ) had been in on what Collins himself referred to as `` ram sessions . '' In the process , apparently Dickie B. fell in love with the Genesis frontman . I hope you realize this means that the Butler brothers were gaining carnal knowledge about one another in these hour-long daily sessions.It 's as if The Psychedelic Furs had undergone a mutation involving the shedding of an outer layer , and it is this shell that 's left behind , meandering through imitations of tunes . It 's an overprocessed mess , as well , a painted lady on fire in an El D & iacute ; a de los Muertos procession . It 's like the fat Tom Hanks as Dorf on Golf . Oops , I crapped a baby . Paranoid delusions of self-importance are the mad whisperings within the cells of dis-ease . You should n't listen . You should n't turn their volume up with every gulp of wine and pills . My neck grows legs ; a matter-of-fact funhouse wherein your belly grows fatter with the brutality of time and temperance . Eyes grown blind , but still seeing.You might like this if you 're a Loverboy or Men at Work fan .	-1
There are only two songs on this cd that I reconize . The rest is a waste unless you love Kansas .	-1
... there are a few Pros here and there , but not even Clapton 's guitar and Sanborn 's sax and Kamen 's orchestration ( and a fetching cartoon girl on the cover ) can save this thing . I realize this is supposed to be a real time , early-morning , emotional & confused , waking-dream hitchhiking sequence ( and all of the chaos and intensity that naturally come with it ) . However , and not surprisingly , it just does n't come off that well as a listenable piece of music.I 've tried and tried to like this thing for literally decades now . And try as I might , I just ca n't fully get into it . Sorry , Roger : as much as I hate to say it , this album is basically The Cons of Hitchhiking.For die-hard fans of Mr Waters only .	-1
Gilmour 's second solo album is about as much of a snore as the later albums he would record with Pink Floyd sans Roger Waters , proving once and for all that Waters was the driving force behind the band . Gilmour is an excellent guitarist and a decent singer , but his solo songwriting is fairly pedestrian . Without Waters ' vision , however warped it may have been , he 's just another aging veteran rocker without a whole lot to say . The same blandness that would permeate Floyd albums starting with & quot ; Momentary Lapse of Reason & quot ; reigns here . Ardent fans may love it , but casual fans should forget about it .	-1
LET 'S HEAR IT FOR THE BOY was an album rushed out to the marketplace to capitalize on the # 1 pop and r & b ; title tune . That smash hit and the beautiful `` Black Butterfly '' are the only memorable songs on this album . The rest of the material features weak writing ( `` Next Love '' ) , cliche 80s synth/thudding drum machine fare ( `` Wrapped Up '' , `` Haunting Me '' ) , up-with-people anthems ( `` Picking Up The Pieces '' ) , and an organ-driven gospel piece that falls flat despite Niecy 's angelic vocals ( `` Whiter Than Snow '' ) .The material on BOY pales in comparison to the excellent songs on NIECY , MY MELODY , SONGBIRD , THIS IS NIECY and I 'M SO PROUD . On these albums , Niecy took her time and came up with material that stayed with you long after the album ended . Even her weakest album until this one , 1979 's WHEN LOVE COMES CALLING , had some great moments .	-1
they were catchy for the 80 's but mainly cool for the time . `` Love in a Vaccum '' Sounds alot like a Fleetwood Mac song.the title track is still the Jam . `` Voices Carry '' was the song.overall the Production & Music is dated but when they hit they did it right .	-1
With six platinum certifications under its belt , Metal Health turned Quiet Riot into one of the biggest acts in rock almost overnight . As I stated on my review of that album , the biggest problem for this band was its utter lack of songwriting talent in a genre that was driven by catchy singles . Knowing this , the boys just tried to replicate Metal Health 's sound to a tee , even re recording a second Slade cover , Mama , Weer All Crazee Now , and making it the flagship single of the record . With Party All Night they tried really hard on delivering a memorable raucous metal anthem like Metal Health for the second time , but sadly it fell kind of short , and again , the rest of the songs are just mediocre filler.Despite its major shortcomings , Condition Critical managed to reach platinum level sales , but considering its predecessor 's success it was declared an utter failure by the band , the label and everyone in the music business . Sadly , since the band had signed a record contract that handed the band 's first two albums royalties to the record label 's owner , its members were n't really enjoying the success they deserved . This situation created a lot of resentment , especially on vocalist Kevin Du Brow , who spent most of the mid eighties badmouthing everyone in the industry , from label executives to record producers to other bands he considered were unjustly riding on his coattails . Eventually , this attitude would make him the most hated man in heavy metal ( predating Lars Ulrich for more than a decade and a half ! ) causing a press backlash that brought a lot of band tensions which resulted in Rudy Sarzo 's exit from the group in 1985 . Another consequence of Kevin Du Brow 's constant badmouthing of other metal bands was the loss of a sizable portion of Quiet Riot 's fan base that also supported those groups . By the end of this album 's support tour , the band 's condition was indeed critical , and only a miracle would stop its downward spiral . Since this album has only two good songs , I strongly recommend buying any Quiet Riot compilation instead .	-1
Even amongst much hit and miss recorded material , these choral keyboardings are just a constant bore , even a mild embarrassment , with a few pretentiously exotic bombardments substituting for the album 's most emotionally satisfying moments .	-1
Handel composed water music . Philip Glass composes water-torture music . Certainly , the track-by-track agony of waiting for Glass ' infernal triplets to reappear ( and they do , again and again ) is akin to counting the moments until the next water particle falls . What is it with those triplets ? Glass : & quot ; Oops -- ran out of measures . I know . I 'll insert some triplets ! & quot ; Flutists Paul Dunkel and Jack Kripl do the dirty work on tracks one and two , but elsewhere the cursed triplets are provided by other people , other instruments . Torturer Glass wants to keep his listeners alive , if only barely , by the slightest of alterations . By the time the cartoon-mice voices of The Roches chimed in on track number four ( & quot ; Liquid Days & quot ; ) , I could hear the composer cackling , & quot ; I wo n't let you die just yet ! & quot ; I believe this is when I lost consciousness.Or maybe not . I recall some of the Paris-sewer organ sound of & quot ; Open the Kingdom , & quot ; and I remember muttering , & quot ; Somebody open the kingdom , already ! & quot ; But I remember nothing of track six , which , ironically , is entitled & quot ; Forgetting. & quot ; As ever , Glass offers us a plethora of standard musical devices , from Charleston rhythms to simultaneous triple and quadruple meters , the latter achieved by a rather annoying overlay of accent patterns . Glass uses this polymetric gimmick again and again , with the result that the melodies seem to move against the pulse . It 's kind of like Stravinsky Lite , but the results are too wimpy to recall any of the Russian composer 's masterpieces -- or , for that matter , & quot ; Stumbling & quot ; by Zez Confrey.Glass pays tribute to Disco with track two ( & quot ; Lightning & quot ; ) and Jimmy Webb 's & quot ; MacArthur Park & quot ; on track five . Linda Ronstadt pays tribute to bad soprano singing on tracks three and six . Pay tribute to your intelligence by avoiding this washed-up exercise in minimalist excess .	-1
I wouldnt recommend this one even to Dylan Fans . The sound is terrible , and Dylan voice is at his most nasal . Mick Taylor sounds good , Santana plays in the last song , but basically there are many other live albums better than this one . The acoustic set is maybe the best from the set . But then again , the sound spoils the listening experience . I spent the first 3 songs trying to adjust my stereo trying to get the best sound and by the fourth I just gave up . Its a 3 star record but Ill give it a 2 just for that .	-1
It never ceases to amaze me on how fans of Miles Davis ( few ) claim to really enjoy this piece of garbage ! Truthfully , I do n't even know why this album in particular was reissued . The first track `` One Phone Call/Street Scenes '' , the crappiest track on the album re-caps from when he was arrested by the police while driving his Ferrari . Sting makes an unnecessary appearance on the track posing as a French cop ( gag ) . `` Time After Time '' , and `` Human Nature '' are the only songs worth listening to out of the rest . I 'm not so sure what a genius like Miles Davis was thinking when he put this one out , but this was a big let down . It does , however , feature some great musicians i.e . John Scofield , Darryl Jones , etc . If you 're interested in 80 's Miles , start with Tutu . The songs on Tutu were written by Marcus Miller and way better than this one .	-1
If you 've never heard this album and are a Miles fan.. AVOID THIS ALBUM AT ALL COSTS ! ! This is nothing like any Miles you would know or ever want to know . It 's the cheesiest pile of 80 's rap , trumpet twidling and absurdness ever put to CD . I am still a huge Miles fan , but this seriously knocked my respect for him down a notch or two . Beyond awful- it 's almost painful to hear .	-1
A short-played album which will be re-issued with bonus tracks , the B-sides & quot ; Caught In A Trap & quot ; and & quot ; A Matter Of Fact & quot ; , in the near future . While the album has some high points , this is a somewhat tired Lynne . It 's just too much synthesizers here. & quot ; Calling America & quot ; and & quot ; So Serious & quot ; were two fine singles . The ballad & quot ; Getting To The Point & quot ; marked the end of a group . Otherwise this is just average songs . & quot ; Heaven Only Knows & quot ; starts fine but get 's tiresome . & quot ; Secret Lives & quot ; has the typical Lynne riff in the refrain , but is really a bad song . & quot ; Sorrow About To Fall & quot ; adds a saxophone that makes it more forgettable . & quot ; Endless Lies & quot ; is Lynne trying to be Roy Orbison , which he 's not ! It 's ordinary 80s synth pop with a trio that does n't impress anyone . A sad farewell to an era . I 'd give it 2.5 points .	-1
elo being mostly 70s dynamic people time secret messages & armchair theatre solo are the only worthwhile stuff power turns empty once you pass the so serious track	-1
Everybody remembers `` The Final Countdown '' by Europe and that 's about it . There is good reason for that . Europe stumbled upon a great keyboard riff , and used it to maximum effect on `` The Final Countdown '' , the keyboard riff sold the song.Unfortunately on `` Wings of Tomorrow '' you do n't get a cool keyboard riff , and while the music is n't bad , anytime lead singer Joey Tempest opens his mouth the songs are ruined . Tempest 's vocals have all of the edge and rock quality of Michael Bolton . So while the guitar work is pretty decent , Tempest begins his `` ooohhhs '' and `` ahhhhhs '' and immediately makes the songs annoying , you will get douche chills for certain . I ca n't imagine paying more than $ 2 for this disk , and that would be for the instrumental `` Aphasia '' ... but even that is n't all that great , but to pay over $ 20 for this disk is a complete waste of money .	-1
Granted there are some terrific songs here . But the sound quality is atrocious . There are many other , newer Columbia Records compilations out there with most all these same songs on them . Case in point - the songs taken from `` YEAH ! ARETHA LIVE WITH HER QUARTET '' ( Muddy Water , Trouble in Mind , Without the One You Love ) all have audience chatter and applause on them . We now know that these tracks were not recorded live , that this audience noise was dubbed in to give the album a intimate `` supper club '' type feel . It does n't serve the songs well , and they just do n't sound that good compared to the newer remastered versions widely available elsewhere . Also , the versions of Today I Sing the Blues and Evil Gal Blues are abominations . The original backing tracks were overdubbed after Aretha left Columbia Records with organs and vocals not found on the original versions . Again , I stress , these songs are great . Aretha Franklin began her professional recording career cutting lots of fabulous and funky Jazz and Blues sides , many of which are showcased here . But do yourself a favour , if you want to hear them , and buy The Queen in Waiting , or Jazz to Soul , or the Early Years . You 'll thank me .	-1
Bob Dylan had a bad patch in the mid-80 's . Between 1983 's & quot ; Infidels & quot ; ( which was marred by the omission of several great songs but is still one of Dylan 's better discs ) and 1989 's & quot ; Oh Mercy & quot ; ( which is near-great , just missing Dylan 's & quot ; Top 5 & quot ; in my opinion ) were 3 albums whose most distinguishing feature was a complete breakdown of his usual standards of quality and professionalism . On & quot ; Empire Burlesque & quot ; , & quot ; Knocked Out Loaded & quot ; , and & quot ; Down in the Groove & quot ; Dylan has not lost his creativity , just his ability to distinguish good work from bad and his willingness to work on a song to make it better.The latter two of these albums are still not bad , because they each have several interesting cover songs which make up for Dylan 's songwriting block , as well as OK production and some good vocal performances . & quot ; Knocked Out Loaded & quot ; is redeemed by the epic & quot ; Brownsville Girl & quot ; , and & quot ; Down in the Groove & quot ; , with its & quot ; Traveling Wilburys & quot ; sound , is pleasant to listen to.But & quot ; Empire Burlesque & quot ; is , by Dylan 's standards , simply terrible . The two most complex songs , & quot ; Tight Connection to My Heart & quot ; and & quot ; When the Night Comes Falling From the Sky & quot ; , are mired in aural sludge and Dylan 's vocal is totally disjointed and discordant , as if he recorded each line in a separate session without listening to the background tracks . & quot ; Tight Connection to My Heart & quot ; makes no sense lyrically , and the original version & quot ; Someone 's Got a Hold of My Heart & quot ; ( which appeared on the incredible 3rd disc of the & quot ; Bootleg Series & quot ; 3-disc set ) is HUGELY better written ( though still just adequate as a Dylan song ) . & quot ; When the Night Comes Falling From the Sky & quot ; is actually a very good song , but this is only apparent from Dylan 's absolutely wonderful performance of it on the & quot ; Bootleg 3 & quot ; disc . Here it is much too slow and the decision to switch it to a minor key is unforgivable.The arrangements are bombastic and clueless , full of what critic Michael Gray has called the & quot ; mindless rockism & quot ; that plagued the music scene in the 80 's . And Dylan 's vocals are too weak and unmoored to override them.Most inexplicably , for the first time ever Dylan prints the lyrics on the album , when they are his worst set of lyrics ! It is almost insulting and makes one wonder what personal issues he was dealing with at the time . He was probably ashamed of the songs this record afterwards , since his next two records were largely cover tunes or co-writes.Even so , it is impossible for Bob Dylan to be completely uninteresting . There are two songs here that deserve to survive : & quot ; Emotionally Yours & quot ; and & quot ; Dark Eyes & quot ; . The first is not great writing but is the type of song other artists like to cover and it 's well-sung here . The second , which concludes the album , is actually beautiful , and the clean acoustic performance removes the bad aftertaste of the other songs .	-1
Why on earth would anyone purchase this anthology when these tracks can be heard anytime for free by riding the elevators of office buildings , nodding off in airport lounges , or waiting in the checkout line at Wal-Mart ? Billy Joel is the gold standard of adult contemporary schmaltz ; he pumps out the sludge by which all other sludge is measured . Small wonder ; his gift for writing hooks is amazing , he sings on-key without being interesting to listen to ( which would be distracting ) , his ballads are so insipid that they 're certain to offend no one , and his up-tempo numbers bear an eerie resemblance to rock without actually containing any of the bite or irreverence that are the hallmarks of real rock.As for his lyrics , he is not the poet laureate of shopping malls for no reason . Though he occasionally stumbles over content in his songwriting efforts , as he did in Allentown , he is far more at home in the woozy and comfortable world of words that , devoid of meaning , can roll smoothly from the tongue , scamper along the piano keys , and jump quickly into the cash register where they belong . Examples abound but , has there ever been a song with less of a rock sensibility than Still Rock And Roll To Me ? It is pointless to deny Billy Joel 's gift and his skill , he has demonstrated time and time again that his instincts for rising to the middle are infallible . Many people have found pleasure in what he 's produced over the years . Awful music and wonderful music could not exist without music that is profoundly mediocre , songs that serenade the middlebrow . That is Billy Joel land , the middle of the dial . If he has any value at all , which is questionable , it is that he defines mediocrity and has made a science of it .	-1
During my childhood years when I was seldom far from commercial radio , Billy Joel was probably the most popular recording artist in Australia full stop . Every one of his albums from 1977'sThe Strangerto 1986'sThe Bridgewas among the top 100 albums of the period between my birth and reaching adulthood , and as a result I heard him ( and the other two `` Billy '' s , Idol andOcean ) consistently on the radio.Even as a child when I had developed no ability to think critically about music and did not know in the cloistered confines of suburban Australia how to gain access to music different from what was played on the radio , I was generally suspicious of a lot of what Billy Joel produced - seeing it as motionless and lacking in energy . However , his more upbeat songs I easily tuned into and never lacked anything for enjoyment of his simple pop tunes like `` You 're Only Human '' , `` Big Shot '' , `` The Stranger '' , `` My Life '' and `` Moving Out '' . Even today , it is fair to say that these are the only tracks on `` Greatest Hits : Vol . 1-2 '' that sound anything other than syrupy and dated . Indeed , today the production on most of these songs is at the very least sufficient to prevent them from sounding like the most terribly pompous material on so many albums from the period.On the other hand , I must say that much of Joel 's best-selling album ( the ninth top album of the 1980s ) An Innocent Manwas one I disliked even before I had listened to anything that was not on the chart at the moment I listened to it , and today it sounds even worse . The title tune is awfully flyweight and syrupy , whilst `` The Longest Time '' is one song I would always place high on a list of the worst songs of all time , and I have been turned off trying to remember it for the last two decades . Many of his earlier ballads , like `` Piano Man '' and `` Say Goobye to Hollywood '' ( described as `` fast rock'n'roll '' in one place ) and even `` Just the Way You Are '' have the same problem.All in all , despite the fact that a few moments remain far from bad , Billy Joel is proof of the many problems found in mainstream 1980s music .	-1
The only reason why I gave this album two stars is because Turbo Lover is a great tune ! Sure its a bit cheesy , but I still like . Do n't buy the album , just download Turbo Lover .	-1
Do n't listen to the guys giving this high marks ; they do n't know metal from a hole in the head or they would n't be caught dead admitting to own this thing . Dull , foolish , juvenile , no good playing to be found ; like disco beat era ZZ Top meets silly 80 's false metal . It 's almost impossible to conceive that a band that was this influential in the 70 's sunk to this all time low.They did regain their composure for the almost comeback Ram It Down , and then the HEAVY Painkiller , before Halford had the good sense to call it a day ( the band did n't and got worse ) .	-1
I remember seeing the video for Turbo Lover on MuchMoreRetro , and I can only imagine what Priest fans reactions were to it at the time of release . The stupid synth overdose of an intro , which melted right into a Billy Idol ripoff . It was n't until I later bought the album until I realized how fully crap it was . The cover looked cool ... some kinda puke forming a hand grabbing a handle . And puking is exactly what I almost did when I looked at the back cover as well as the booklet ! Who were these glam schmucks ? Make-up . Big poofy hair . Did I buy a Priest record or a Twisted Sister record ? Anyway , thankfully that prepared me for what was about to come , because I put in the CD , only to be tortured with more useless hair metal . My mom walked into the room and said `` Is that Judas Priest ? COOL ! '' . I threw the CD across the room in disgust.There are two good songs on this CD , which are `` Out in the Cold '' and `` Reckless '' . But otherwise , stay away from this train wreck of an album . Even the song titles are mind-numbingly stupid ( `` Parental Guidance '' ? `` Wild Nights , Hot and Crazy Days '' ? ? ? ? ) .	-1
I only have this album to complete the collection . I really do n't care much for it at all . I did n't like it when it came out the first time.I bought the remaster only because I bought the whole damn set.this is one disc that gets ignored.If you 're a Priest fan you understand ... this is commercial crap.If you wish to 'sample ' Priest by Hell Bent for Leather or `` Sin Stained Class '' . Classics .	-1
I went to the bathroom . When I was finished doing my business , I lifted up the toilet seat to check to see what came out . There in the bowl , swirling about , was the group Europe singing `` The Final Countdown '' . What crap this group was !	-1
This album can be found in pretty much any used CD store for less than $ 5 so the only reason to buy the Friday Music CD is for the remastering . Well , this is certainly remastered . It 's louder , brighter and punchier ... but maybe a bit too much . I 've noticed a trend with Friday 's releases . Their remastering can go too far . The mixes are EQ 'd and widened to sound brighter and bigger and broader and larger , but is that really a good thing when they do n't resemble the original album ? I do n't want the mastering engineer , Joe Reagoso , to reinvent the music I already like into some shiny new sound . It 's not improving an album when it sounds unfamiliar . I 'd much rather have a nice transfer of the original mixes without the heavy handed remastering job.Speaking of the transfer process there seems to be a mastering problem on this CD . The left channel is muffled on quite a few songs . Listen to I 'll Be Over You , Somewhere Tonight , Without Your Love or Tonight or We Can Make It Happen ( among others ) on headphones and you 'll immediately notice the left channel is quite a bit lower and darker sounding . It was n't like this on the original LP , CD or any Toto compilation . Sounds like the tape machine alignment was off or the Dolby tones were n't adjusted correctly or the mastering chain was n't L & R ; correlated . I suspect the Dolby alignment was off since I can hear some slight pumping artifacts . There is definitely something wrong with the playback alignment.That transfer issue alone will keep me from recommending this remaster to my one friend , Lonely Jack , who likes Toto and listens to them in his mom 's basement apartment where he lives with his pet armadillo and vast porn collection.My advice is to find a cheap copy of the original CD with the Bob Ludwig mastering . It does n't suffer from a glitchy transfer or over-mastering . It 's not quite as loud so just turn it up a bit more . That 's why God invented the volume knob .	-1
Weather Report were a magnificent 70s jazz-rock group that broke up six years too late . The band should have said a fond farewell with 'Night Passage ' , and their place among the true greats in jazz history would have been assured . But instead the band carried on , wounded , releasing albums which damaged its reputation , though each LP had its moments . The arrival of CD put the nails in Weather Report 's coffin -- album buyers began to expect 55+ minute recordings , whereas the band usually struggled to write enough quality material to get much beyond 35 minutes per LP.The relationship between Zawinul and Shorter was suffering by the time Pastorius arrived in '75 , and it did n't take long for Zawinul to find a voice on his Oberheim polyphonic which could replace Shorter 's sax . It 's hard to tell that Shorter is present at all on many of the tracks of 'This is This'.There are no compositions by Shorter , and the instrumental lead is often taken by , bizarrely for Weather Report , guitar . But that guitar is played by Carlos Santana . This does n't sound like a Weather Report album . Indeed , the presence of Siedah Garrett got me thinking that it sounds more like a Quincy Jones ' album , of the 'Q 's Jook Joint ' period . ( Zawinul appeared on that album 's predecessor , 'Back to the Block ' . ) I suspect it was left to bassist Victor Bailey to keep the band together for the duration of this recording session.This is a contractual obligation album at least as bad as Monty Python 's 'Contractual Obligation Album ' . But at least they admitted it .	-1
I would compare listening to this album to drinking saltwater . If you are desperate enough to try either , then you are obviously in some sort of drought . I would actually prefer the latter for reasons of taste and digestibility . Since I did grow up in the 80s , I did learn some of these songs before I had any sense of taste . That 's my sad excuse for having purchased this tripe . Ignore the reviews that give this album 4 or 5 stars . Do not proceed with any intention of buying this drool . There are a few hits that are not obviously offensive , do n't misunderstand me , but not aside from the first and last songs . But to avoid vagaries , let 's be specific , shall we ? The title & quot ; Blue ( Live in China ) & quot ; says either that George Michael is self-grandeurizing a l & aacute ; 'look how many people love us all over the world ' , or he is hinting that he had to go all the way to a non-English speaking country to warble such pathetic lyrics after saying in his pompous version of the British accent , & quot ; The next number ... is a song that 's very personal to me ... . & quot ; Another troubling trend that is carried over from the otherwise pleasant & quot ; Make It Big & quot ; album is how the boys do n't seem to understand that they 're making silly pop music and the songs should be between three and four minutes . I guess by leaning on the keyboards for an extra minute at the end of & quot ; Last Christmas & quot ; and repeating themselves ad infinitum they avoided writing more than the bare minimum eight songs per album.Being critical of this is like denouncing fascism , I mean , this is just 80s dance pop , but it 's continually futile attempts at significance makes it SEEM so labored . By all means , skip this and buy one of the imported Greatest Hits albums or & quot ; Make It Big & quot ; . Better yet , if you have a CD Burner , borrow this from somebody and copy the first and last songs only before you use it as a coaster or frisbee . Tack it on at the end of George Michael 's & quot ; Faith & quot ; and it would be a near-perfect pop album . If you must indulge yourself , however , think of this warning as you hear tracks 3 and 4 on your stereo . They just may be the two worst things to hide in that salty closet called the 80s , the Iran-Contra affair notwithstanding .	-1
This is just 80 's radio tripe . This type of . crap is what killed a once great band . Metal Health , pass on the rest .	-1
I bought this CD after watching the movie on late night television . I like a few of the songs but most of it so dated that my 8 year old son howled from the back seat & # 34 ; Turn it Off ! & # 34 ; Yikes . Maybe I should have just bought the few singles that I like .	-1
This album should be called & quot ; AMERICAN RADIO FRIENDLY ROULLETTE & quot ; , so bad it is . YOu could tolerate Udo 's growls before , because the music , the songs were great . BUt in this one , turning commercial , everything collapsed ! This CD has nothing to do with the once very good German band ...	-1
If this rating seems lower than it should be , try to listen to it first before buying as I was able to . Whatever made CT great is n't here . Some albums are quickly cut out for a reason.I worked at a record store when this came out in summer of 1986 . My boss had an advance cassette , and he lent it to me to take home . I listened once , gave the album my undivided attention , and took it back the next day . I could have probably paid him a few dollars for it and kept it , but I did not like it at all . At the time I had seen CT live 4 or 5 times , and owned every CBS/Epic ( now Sony ) album . I was a diehard CT fan.The songs on `` The Doctor '' are all either juvenile subject matter , or based on sex or love . No clever , interesting , or irreverent lyrics , as I was used to hearing from CT. No melodies made an impression . Instrumentation was nothing special . None of the trademark `` hooks . '' This probably sold fewer than 20,000 copies . I feel badly for those 20,000 people except for the ones who posted here and unexplicably like it.The album sounds as if it was made to fulfill a contract . The 80 's certainly were n't CT 's prime , but any CT album preceding this one is much more worthy of your time and money . I do n't know about the music post- '' Doctor . '' Although they have since recorded much stronger material , this is last CT album I heard all the way through . ( Adapted from my review of January 13 , 2000 . )	-1
I got to hear this album during the helm of their Hangin ' Tough success . It sounds like music for the Disney channel . Only Donnie Wahlberg stands out vocally on this album . Joey McIntyre has that high voice and Jordan Knight had a strong falsetto on Did n't I Blow Your Mind . I can tell now that Hangin ' Tough , their Christmas album , Step By Step and Face The Music are their more stellar and better albums . I wanted to avoid this album , but I can see now . I thought that Hangin ' Tough was their first , but I did n't know about this one . This first one was n't their best .	-1
There 's a reason you can buy a used copy on Amazon for less than 2 bucks.This is a hugely disappointing album.I remember buying it when it came out and thinking `` this IS NOT how SRV sounded when I saw him in concert ... this sucks '' .It 's the only album by SRV & DT that I 've not replaced on CD.Ya want Stevie at his best LIVE ? Get El Mocambo.El Mocambo demonstrates to a T why Stevie became the legend he was and continues to be.Long live the memory of Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble !	-1
What an enormous turkey this is ! Why this was n't a career ending album is beyond me . Uninspired writing , singing and playing highlight every track . The whole thing sounds like it came straight out of the can . Good news , no live musicians were used in the making of this disaster .	-1
This CD is n't that funny at all , and is very disappointing considering Robin Williams is usually a very funny comedian . Laughs are very far in between . Robin talks about the Opera House he is performing at , ballet compared to football , fatherhood , childbirth and other topics which may be interesting to a small number of fans but these topics are not broad enough to appeal to the average fan . This CD may be funnier if you have kids and can maybe relate to the jokes , but they 're definitely not funny if you do n't have kids.If Robin Williams was as not as high a profile comedian then the listener 's expectations may not be as high but he is , has told some funny stand up jokes in his time so therefore expectations of a great laugh from forking out money for his album are extremely high . For sensational stand up comedy albums by big name comedians try Steven Wright 's I have a Pony , Eddie Murphy 's self titled album or Jeff Foxworthy 's You Might Be a Redneck If ... ... ...	-1
If you want to be annoyed by incoherent instrumental notes that never amount to absolutely anything , this is for you . Even saying that this `` music '' reflects the mental state of a drunk is a stretch , drunkenness still maintains a better sense of consciousness and purpose . Finding the fortitude needed to endure this tedious absurdity in its entirety is no easy task and one sure to provoke a headache and anger ; because if this album achieves anything , it is being incessantly annoying by having no emotion , energy , melody , or anything that constitutes any musical value . At the end , this is nothing but trash recorded with good audio equipment , over-rated pretentious trash that is ; and the claim of many that this album has elements of rock , funk , and soul is more absurd than the album itself . However , if you are a pretentious fool who likes to pretend to `` get it '' or an individual intrigued by random abstract noise to the beat of an overly monotonous percussion then this is also for you.Here rather are various instrumental recordings that indeed deserve a look . Dave Brubeck - Time Out , Ruben Gonzalez - Introducing ... , Cachaito , Herb Alpert - South of the Border , The Ventures , Ry Cooder & Manuel Galban , Beastie Boys - Mix up ( you 'll be surprised ) , Augustus Pablo - East of the River Nile , Jan Hammer - Escape From Television , etc .	-1
I am attempting to like this . The horrible hiss that fills in between the notes is louder than some of the music . It reminds me of the low quality of initial compact disks and the flat quality and amplified hiss that came in those initial jewel cases.This review is for the Amazon mp3 download .	-1
I really love Pink Floyd . Each of their albums offer a very different selection of songs . However this one is quite bland . The songs all melt together , so I ca n't even say which are good and which are bad . It is obvious that after Water 's left , the band did have to reinvent itself , just as it did after Syd Barrett left after & quot ; Piper at the Gates of Dawn. & quot ; This album is easy to overlook , and I do n't suggest getting it unless you want to complete your collection .	-1
A bad judge in a bad court system allowed Ringo Starr ( Mason and Wright ) and George Harrison ( Gilmour ) to call themselves the Beatles . But since Ringo and George dont have any talent compared to John and Paul ( Roger Waters ) they were forced to go on a scavenger hunt to try to find people to help them sound like Roger Waters . Check the song credits for this album : Instead of the song credits saying `` Waters '' like they do with all the great songs on all the great Pink Floyd albums , the song credits on THIS terrible album basically say `` everybody and their dogs '' . In other words , it would have saved space to simply list all the people on our planet who did NOT have a hand in creating these awful songs rather than actually listing all the people who WERE brought in to try to sound like Roger.Listen to the song on this album called `` Dogs of War '' . That song is the most universally hated `` Pink Floyd '' song of all time . Many people find that it is actually interesting to listen to `` Dogs of War '' and other songs on this album as it is like watching an a car wreck . It clearly shows what happens to a group of people when all the intelligence , work ethic , and creativity are gone.Personally , I actually think it is almost fun to listen to this album for a good belly laugh . It is like watching the movie `` Plan 9 From Outer Space '' . You watch it because it is so bad , it is a decent laugh.You may have noticed that whenever you hear a Pink Floyd song on the radio , it is always a Roger Waters song . Thus we conclude , that although Ringo and George were able to convince a stupid judge sitting in a stupid court to allow the blasphemous use of a sacred name , the public knew better and has responded by not buying this trash.My suggestion : Stay away from this dog of an album .	-1
I am an avid Pink Floyd fan , but I have to say this is BY FAR Pink Floyd 's worst album . The most obvious reason this album is so weak compared to Floyd 's other albums is that Roger Waters is not in the band anymore and the lyrics and music really suffer as a result . Strangely enough , Richard Wright is not an `` official '' member of the band , though he makes an appearance as one of many session musicians . Of course , there has been plenty of controversy over the legal battles between Waters and Gilmour , but David Gilmour deserves plenty of criticism for releasing this album under the Pink Floyd name , especially when one takes into account the minimal contributions of Richard Wright and Nick Mason to this album . Much of the drumming and percussion is actually electronic , and session drummers are playing most of the `` real '' drums . Nick Mason apparently felt out of practice , so he was n't up for playing much drums on this album . Rather than Richard Wright , Jon Carin plays a lot of the keyboards , as well as Bob Ezrin and Gilmour himself . The bass is played mostly by Tony Levin of King Crimson fame . All kinds of other session musicians are featured on this album as well . Gilmour also had plenty of help from other songwriters outside Pink Floyd in writing this album . For me , it 's pretty easy to see , and hear - this is n't really Pink Floyd , folks ! ! ! Anyway , the best song on this disappointing album is `` On The Turning Away . '' This is a memorable song , and Gilmour does a very nice job on this one . `` Learning to Fly '' is also quite entertaining and enjoyable to listen to . `` Sorrow '' is adequate ( the guitar intro is tasteful ) , but the lyrics are not up to par , especially in the context of Pink Floyd 's larger body of work . Aside from a few nice guitar licks here and there , the rest of the album is boring and lacks both direction and imagination . I have always thought that this should have been a David Gilmour solo album , and it 's pretty obvious that Gilmour was just cashing in by using the Pink Floyd name . This album always leaves me feeling unsatisfied , and ex-Pink Floyd leader Roger Waters had every right to be unhappy about its release .	-1
Regarding the success of this album and the ensuing tour , David Gilmour once stated that & quot ; the proof is in the pudding & quot ; . This may be true , unfortunately , however , Mr. Gilmour did n't write the recipe . In case you have to ask , that would be Roger Waters . This work and the multi-million dollar produced concert tour that followed was perhaps the most obvious instance of counterfeit ever in the history of Rock Music . From it 's Wall ( the movie ) inspired cover with Bob Geldof clone and hotel maid to its reliance on earlier Floyd works for song titles ( & quot ; Dogs & quot ; of War , A New [ Welcome to the ] Machine ) , with this album Gilmour showed the world what a mediocre talent could do with a rock legend and a record company willing to back anything remotely profitable . The inspiration for this production was the child of some record executive who said that Gilmour 's first attempt at a Floyd record did n't & quot ; sound & quot ; like Pink Floyd . The album was immediately retooled and writers were actually hired to help make a & quot ; Floyd & quot ; album . What they created was a soulless corporate product that bore the name Pink Floyd , but one that could not possibly live up to the Floyd legacy . The music is sterile and over-produced and the lyrics are ( thankfully ) forgettable . Only Gilmour 's solos shine through as a stirring reminder of a once-great guitarist now in over his head as songwriter and conceptualist . A couple of numbers stand out , namely , ` Dogs of War ' and ` Learning to Fly ' but their inane lyrics and subject matter ( the latter about Gilmour earning his pilot 's license ) hinder repeat listenings . If you make it to track 5 ( ` On the Turning Away ' ) Gilmour 's attempt at social conscience should send shivers ( the bad kind ) down your spine . Nevertheless , Gilmour with Mason ( and eventually Wright ) in tow went on to one of the most successful and profitable stadium tours ever attempted . Armed with a back catalog of FM radio hits they did n't write ( or , at best , co-wrote ) , a stage show conceived almost entirely by Roger Waters during the band 's heyday ( circular projection screen , inflatable pig , etc . ) and a laser spectacular they wooed a new generation of fans who came to see a legendary band ( and , sadly , probably never knew the difference ) . Their 1994 follow-up , ` The Division Bell ' , followed the same formula with even greater success . Momentary Lapse of Reason , indeed .	-1
The only good songs on this album is & quot ; Learning To Fly & quot ; and the guitar intro to & quot ; Sorrow & quot ; , the rest of that song is horrible	-1
I have to admit that I was a big Pink Floyd fan back in the day . Had all their stuff and loved all of it . I kind of lost interest after & quot ; The Wall & quot ; broke out as a huge hit . Recently I purchased & quot ; The Final Cut & quot ; and my love of Pink Floyd was reborn . So I figured I would go ahead and buy the next one . Well , I knew that Roger Waters had left and I was curious to see if David and the boys could carry on without him . They ca n't ! This is just a mindless album . It is a desperate attempt to try to parody earlier recordings . However , after two tracks it starts to blend into one long David Gilmour solo that just does not seem to be going anywhere . Periodically there are shameless attempts at pop commercial singles . I have never been more let down from a band then I was by the so-called & quot ; Pink Floyd & quot ; on this one .	-1
Can Pink Floyd be without Roger Waters and still make awe-inspiring albums ? Apparently not . I 'm a huge Pink Floyd fan , but this is the lamest excuse for a progressive rock album since Yes in the middle 70s . The lyrics are inane , the songs drag , and David Gilmour 's voice gets on my nerves after 15 minutes into the album . `` The Final Cut '' is not inspired either , but this one has even less to offer .	-1
Recorded after the loss of Waters and the loss of interest of Wright and Mason , A Momentary Lapse in Reason is a Gilmour solo album , basically . Bohemian works like Learning to Fly and Sorrow are passionate enough to work well . Sympathetic weeps for humanity such as On the Turning Away or Dogs of War come off as flaky and pompous . Waters knew how to display intellectual tendencies without coming off as pretentious . He also knew how to make music that is timeless while this album , with its high pitched keyboards and its constant unneeded guitar solos , sounds unmistakably 80s . The more personal aspects of Gilmour 's music , heard on his self-entitled solo album and Pink Floyd 's The Division Bell work best . Only for Pink Floyd completionists .	-1
The first album without Roger Waters , the backbone of Floyd since the glory days of Dark Side , is the first for the new and unimproved Pink Fraud . David Gilmour is a great musician , but he could n't write a decent lyric to save his life . Without Waters ' lyrics to inspire him , Gilmour and the rest of the Fraud fall flat with this lackluster effort . There are two good songs , count 'em , two : & quot ; Learning to Fly , & quot ; which would even make an excellent authentic Floyd song , and & quot ; On the Turning Away , & quot ; which is kind of weinie but is still pretty good . I have suspicions that outside man and former cohort of the band that legimately called themselves Pink Floyd , Bob Ezrin , wrote the lyrics to & quot ; Learning to Fly. & quot ; There is no way Gilmour could have written such wonderful words . Pink Fraud 's first album features such awful tracks as & quot ; The Dogs of War & quot ; and & quot ; A New Machine , & quot ; two songs that should have been titled , & quot ; We Need You Back , Roger Waters : Parts 1 and 2. & quot ; The rest of Permanent Lapse of Good Music is utterly forgettable . Fortunately , I did n't waste any money on this piece of trash . My aunt gave it to me because she could n't bare the embarrassment of owning it herself . Unfortunately , I spent almost an hour listening to it . Those who thought the Final Cut a weak musical effort will take it back when they hear this sad attempt to make up for the fact that the real Pink Floyd is no longer with us .	-1
Peter Pan returned to Earth when this follow-up to THRILLER moved only about half as many copies . Jackson 's audience would continue to dwindle with each subsequent release , perhaps owing as much to the Self-Proclaimed King of Pop 's well-documented tangles with law enforcement as the quality of the albums themselves , yet Weird Al Yankovic nonetheless enjoyed tremendous success with his BAD-inspired music video , a rare example of a `` cover '' improving upon an original recording .	-1
Some of the rhythms are not bad on this album , but the production techniques and the quality ( or rather , lack of quality ) of the songs themselves are embarrasingly bad . `` 1-2-3 '' is a prime example . It sounds like it was written in about 2 minutes , if that . No amount of production tricks , cheap or not , can compensate for a tune that is just plain BAD . And others follow suit . This is not well-crafted , durable music for all time . It is dated '80s junk that has not aged well . `` Let It Loose '' ? More like `` Let It Alone '' .	-1
I HAD to write this review . I simply HAD to do it so the average rating of this album would be lower because there might be people out there who want to get some good music and they might end up having something like this ... *shudders*It is very interesting to see that people have rated this album as either excellent or awful . It is interesting that there are people who rate this as 'excellent ' , that is ... because I ca n't believe any Floyd fan could possibly even TOLERATE this album.It 's 80 's at their best.I sat there , listening to song after song , unable to believe Waters ( the very same Waters who wrote 'The Wall ' and 'Wish You Were Here ' ! ! ! ! ! ) could ever have written something THIS bad . It IS bad , let me assure you once again.Do n't say I did n't warn you if you decide to buy this ...	-1
Before I start with the review apparently this album is a `` concept album about a wheelchair-bound boy who tries to stop a nuclear war with his use of the HAM radio ( what ! why is n't he using a K.A.O.S radio ? we are surley screwed now ) . If this sounds absoultley ridiculous to you then you might what to stop here ... .. Musically this album sounds very electronic , I suppose this album could have been good stuff back in the 80 's . Most of the songs on this album would go well with Don Johnson and that black dude chasing drug dealers and what not . But unfortunately Roger probably did n't want his album used on a TV show since the songs are about the real issues ! Unlike Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking Waters actually tries to sing the songs here which is admirable but still terrible . He sounds like a poor man 's version of David Byrne . It also sounds like some of the screaming ladies from Dark Side showed up at the recordings . Half way through this album you want to turn off the `` Radio '' . I think it would have been a better idea for Waters at this stage of his career to release an album called `` Radio O.F.F '' and just have a blank cd .	-1
Okay , I am going to combine two methods of rating ( both track by track and pros and cons ) to establish why I gave this album two stars . Also I part of me wanted to give it one to help balance out some of the higher ratings ; however I chose to just give it what I thought it deserved.Pros- some interesting orchestrations , very very accessable songs ( this doubles as a con ) , there are some really great melodies that I really wish would have been expanded upon.Cons- Overall it is just too mellow , I loved floyd when it was mellow , but this is n't as good . There is no anger , like on Pros and cons , the final cut , or the wall . Less screaming than I like , probably got all screamed out after pros and cons . Too much emphasis on trying to be melody , and song structures are n't too strong.1 . Radiowaves : 80 's pop at its worst , Rog 's voice sounds old on this one . It is hard to take it seriously with the synthisizer.2 . Who Needs Information : A good song , would be a nice relaxing peice , if it were surrounded by some rockin tunes . Probably my favorite on this album.3 . Me or Him : again another nice mellow track , nice flutes . Good chilling music , no climax or cresendo though , unless you count the powers that be , but that is 5 minutes without build or evolution , and the flute riff is n't great enough to justify 5 minutes of it.4 . Powers That be : absolute pop trash , same reason I ca n't stand learning to fly by Floyd mach III . Still more energy than most the album.5 . Sunset Strip : Alright song , if there were n't the & quot ; ooh ooh billy come home & quot ; , I would like this better . Mostly ruined6 . Home : alright , here we go , finally a track I can really get into ! The chorus makes this song for me , very potent . The rest drags towards the end and i would like more drive during the verse.7 . Four Minutes : I am not sure this counts as a song , more like a filler , nothing I 'd ever go out of my way to listen to.8 . Tide Is Turning ( After Live Aid ) : sythetic drums and some of the odd sound sort of ruin it . More slow paced stuff , I had hoped it would have picked up by now . Nice vocal harmonies , the line & quot ; the tide is turning & quot ; wears thin by the end though .	-1
With Radio KAOS , Roger Waters hit rock bottom . ( He rebounded nicely with Amused to Death ) .This is a silly concept album about a boy communicating telepathically with a radio station . Between every song is annoying talk between a typical top 40 DJ and the electronic voice of the boy . This interrupts any possible flow the ablum might have had . Some of the songs lack any melody and do n't have strong musical arrangements to back them up.Even at his worst , Roger Waters is still a gifted song writer . There are two very good songs here and none of them are horrendous . I gave this ablum 2 stars because the talking between songs just makes listening to the whole thing generally unpleasant .	-1
I couldnt realy get into this album.I Tried and i tried but it just didnt happen.Thats the problem with Roger Waters music , you have to get used to it and perhaps i just didnt get it.I actually only bought the CD for `` The Tide Is Turning '' .Man that is a good song , and thats how i gave it 2 stars.But honestly i didnt have the patience to give it a dozen or 2 spins.Maybe i needed to eject some funny stuff into my veins first .	-1
All previous reviewers who trashed the packaging are right . Not only is it highly incovenient but it actually leaves a greasy film on the surface of the CD that is in the foam . Needless to say I was very dissapointed when I got home , unwrapped the brand new ( expensive ) box set , placed the first CD in my CD player and it immediately started skipping . When I removed the CD I noticed that an entire section of the CD had a greasy / stickly film on it . I surmised this was from the foam and verified this assumption by check the other CDs , and they all had the same problem . This was not a coating of dusty or something easily cleaned . Amazingly poor package design . I work for a medical device company and our packaging is subjected to extensive testing any time we change it to make sure it will withstand vibration , shock , drop , aging and the extremes of temperature the devices might be used in . You would think that , while it need not be as extensive for CD packaging , they would do similar work before launching entirely new packaging for a CD box set . Utter crap . Someone should lose their job for this one .	-1
I really dig Wendy & amp ; Lisa.Prince needs them badly.but this disc did n't seem like it then.this was pretty much run of the mill Paisley outtakes.they gave Prince color in his work and gave his work a Freshness but there was a reason why he was the Leader.this disc shows why they were better behind the scenes.but Fruit at the Bottom changed all of that.Waterfalls was a cool song but Nobody had any idea How tight these Women were until the other albums Emerged and they continued to Grow while Prince fell off big time.but this Album did n't show how Important they were for Prince 's Revolution .	-1
Considering he was one half of the excellent Wham ! great things were expected from Mr Michael when he went solo . Unfortunately the pressure must have got to him as this album is a disaster . Fans of classics such as Wham Rap , Bad Boys and Club Tropicana Drinks Are Free will be bitterly disappointed . It seems obvious to me that Andrew Ridgeley had been carrying Mr Michael for years !	-1
I am truly a fan- but I recently listened to an old cassette of this album and struggled to get through it . Except for a few tracks ( On My Way to You and All I Ask of You ) , this album is embarrassing . It has not aged well and ranks , in my mind , as one of Barbra 's worst efforts . I actually threw the tape away- a first for me !	-1
THIS IS BAD ( except a couple of songs where the real Anderson comes through ) .This is not soulful . This is disco pop of the late 1980s ( when disco had evolved away from the Bee Gees and Donna Summer ) .Released in 1988 , this was recorded when Anderson left Yes for the second time . It is 47 minutes long . The original CD sound quality was OK ( better than most of the Yes CDs released in the 1980s ) , but still not great . There is some harshness on the high end , which is a bad thing for someone who sings like Anderson . I have not heard the remastered version , but the original sure could use some fixing.This is more of a producer 's album than an artist 's album . It was produced by Stewart Levine , who produced the jazz/soul/disco band Simply Red . Some are going to argue that Simply Red is not Disco , but that is what Disco had evolved into in the late 1980s until Grunge wiped it off the map . So , many of the songs have that kind of Simply Red feeling to them.The lyrics on many of the songs were written by others , including Lamont Dozier of Holland-Dozier-Holland fame . He has written a number of classic songs , but his writing here is just horrible . Although we all complain about it , Anderson is better off just singing his spacy nonsensical lyrics than this pap.There are a couple of good songs on this CD ( Sundancing and Top of the World ) where Anderson breaks away from the pop and sounds more like he does on his other solo albums.To sum up : -I like Jon Anderson-I like Simply Red-I do n't like Jon Anderson doing Simply Red ( it was like when Eric Clapton tried to do Phil Collins on August ... another project involving Dozier )	-1
As much as I bashed Knocked Out Loaded , at least it had Brownsville Girl . There 's NOTHING I like about Down in the Groove . literally . I usually leave the room when the best song ( Silvio ) plays . To say nothing of the worst ... more of thoes banal love songs ( Let 's Stick Together ; Sally Sue Brown ; When Did You Leave Heaven ; Had a Dream About You , Baby ) and more awful covers ( most of the aforementioned plus Let 's Stick Together ; 90 Miles Per Hour ; Shenandoah and Rank Strangers To Me ) and awful attempts at humor ( Ugliest Girl in the World ) and philosophy ( Death is Not the End ) . Bob 's successes are spectacular , sure , but his failures are equally so . Case in point : this one .	-1
Hot August Night II is the start of the decline of the crooner and the beginer of the talker/screamer in Neil Diamond . Sometime in the late 80 's he stopped singing most of his songs and started to talk or yell the most important lyrics . It was like he last all tone and rythm . I grew up being rocked to sleep as a young child to the original Hot August Night , but this album still gives me nightmares . Every couple of years I put in in the CD player just to give it another try and it always goes back on the shelf , replaced by the original . This album includes his great late 70's/early 80 's songs , but they are butchered , much like his other classics . Having seen him in concert no less than 10 times , each live show is so different , sometimes smooth and classy , other times like this album indifferent , out of tune and careless . It just give rise to the question did the age , number of live shows catch up with him in the 80 's ?	-1
This great work by Schubert is given an unusually tepid performance here . First off , the sonics are terrible and have the cello so far back that it is barely noticeable and so the all-important tremolando on the cello near the beginning of the first movement is negligible . Second , the performers seem to be performning as if someone said to be quiet the whole time : I like mellow performances ( listen to the Chilingirian Qt . play Schubert ) but I kept turning the volume up and it still sounded too quiet . Third , the playing just seems tentative , as if each member was waiting for the other to take the initiative . Considering the caliber of individual musicianship , this was very surprising and a real disappointment . ( By the way , when Ma plays with the Cleveland Qt . in Schubert 's String Quintet in C , the result is quite fantastic . ) I think that in the case of this Quartet # 15 , they just did n't click and the recording engineers did n't help either . For a better recording , in addition to the Chilingirians ( on Nimbus ) , the Quartetto Italiano ( on Philips ) is superb as are the Lindsays ( on ASV ) . Although highly regarded , I would avoid the Alban Berg Quartet version ( on EMI ) as slightly abrasive in upper registers .	-1
How can the Evengelist preach without a bible ? How can Bush rule without the script ? How can How can Philip Glass compose without the arpeggio ? Like so much of pop music , Glass ' repetitive riffs/themes/compositions are born of pure laziness.I imagine the string player rehearsing for a Glass recording : `` Wait a minute , did n't I write this whole section myself years ago in high school while practicing my minor chord fingerings ? `` I admire Dennis Russell Davies and his wide canvas , but how does he hold in his vomit after years and years and years and years and years of performing Glass compositions ? Were Glass ' symphonies used in Abu Ghrab to solicit information from enemy combatants ? ( I would have signed on the dotted line to stop the bleeding in my ears . ) I asked this question years ago , and I 'll ask it again : what is so interesting/great/new/appealing in hearing the same series of notes played over and over and over and over and over -- oh wow ! , he just added one different note ! -- and over and over and over ? Britney Spears does that , and she 's easier on the eyes.Prince said `` there 's joy in repetition '' -- true , when the action is lovely . Yes , there are many places in Akhnaten where I lifted my head from my hands and thought `` wow , this could be beautiful . '' But those damn arpeggios returned and mowed down the flowers with the weeds.Philip , throw away your crutches and walk on your strong two legs !	-1
I 'm disappointed in this CD . I had bought `` Sarah for Lovers , '' and was enthralled so much , I hoped Brazilian Romance would be equally wonderful . It 's not . This was probably made during Ms. Vaughn 's waning years . No disrespect to Ms. Vaughn . `` Sarah for Lovers '' is what you want . Forget Brazilian Romance , take Sarah for Lovers . You wo n't be disappointed . Its silky smooth and if you loved the sixties era during Frank and Ella and the rest of the gang , you 'll love this . Its definitely retro romance to the highest !	-1
This record is just weak , whiney brit pop . Let 's see Paddy make a record as ambitious and glorious as & quot ; the Wild , The Innocent & amp ; The E Street Shuffle & quot ; or make it onto the cover 's of Newsweek AND Time the same week . Ever heard McAloon called & quot ; the future of rock n ' roll ? Never will , big mouth !	-1
I have always liked Sade 's albums . She has some good songs on 1988 's Stronger Than Pride . But what keeps this album from being superior is that boring second half . It may fit for Sade herself , but the second half put me to sleep . Every time I hear it , that section has some boring , stale ballads . She could have made this an EP instead and kept songs like Paradise on it . The Sominex album of 1988 -- just mostly dull .	-1
Patti Scialfa has a similar voice to Beth Orton and Stacey Earle . I can see that some people like this girlish approach but I prefer a deep and strong voice over a tender and fragile one , any day . The material on this album `` Rumble doll '' is n't that good , but I must say that I really love the captivating song `` Baby do n't '' , and I think `` Charm light '' is rather good . The rest of the songs do n't stick out at all , and they have a tendency to melt , or blend , together . I would n't say that the songs are particularly bad or so , but the main problem is that they do n't excite you in any way - they do n't even upset you . The best time to put on this album is while you have friends over for dinner , and need something soft in the background , something that do n't interrupt with your conversation .	-1
Buy this CD , then you 'll smash it into the ground due to anger ! ! Very bad . This was the last record with Dave Holland on drums . Glenn and K.K . are playing better than never , but the songs are silly . Exception : the cover of Johnny Be Goode sounded amazing and the solo in the title track is something that belongs to the history of metal !	-1
I wanted to like this when it came out , I really did . Big hair , songs about sex , 2 guitarists , etc . but it 's just too cheesy , and the keyboards make it sound even more so . From `` Screw It ! '' onward they became a much better band with a little more edge . My personal favorite is `` Cockroach '' but they 're all quite good ( with the exception of this release ) . Great band , bad album ... hey it happens ...	-1
Danger Danger was one of those bands from the '80s who could 've been huge if they played their cards right . They never did join the ranks of Motley Crue , Poison or Ratt so obviously they did n't . Where did they fail ? Where it counts . The songwriting.DD2 had the looks and talent to be a lot bigger than they were , they just did n't have the tunes . Naughty Naughty and Bang Bang ( what is it with this band and `` twos '' ! ) are highlights on this debut , but except for those two songs nothing else here sets Danger Danger apart from the vast group of `` Hair Bands '' from that era . And that 's where the band failed . Unlike the above mentioned bands DD2 never found its own idenity , and ended up sounding exactly like many bands from the '80s . They could 've done better !	-1
This is the worst metal record I have ever heard . Danger Danger were a decent live band , but their studio debut is 100 % grade A cheese . The keyboards are what destroys this record 's chances . Keyboards add to a band if you know how to use them to the benefit of the album . This was forgotten for years in my record collection . It was overshadowed by the superb debut of Skid Row . If you want a record you ca n't hardly sit through , by all means bye this . It 's only real value is as a collection piece for hair metal historians .	-1
THis is Accept turned radio friendly . I do n't miss Udo here ( as a matter of fact , it 's clear that the band could have reached much higher if they had a real singer in front of the stage , not just a guy screaming and growling all the time.. ) The new singer is good , but the songs are a pitful attempt to go commercial..	-1
I can not believe all the positive reviews this cd has ! ! ! It is terrible ! Even if you can get past the fact that udo is not there , it just plain sucks . The singer is very poor with no range . The songs are very weak with no exciting choruses or melody . The lyrics are stupid , just do n't buy it !	-1
Yes , at one time I was into this band . Yes , I am now ashamed and know they were nothing but clowns in leather suits who changed their feature music flavor more often than Baskin Robbins changed the flavor of the week . In Warrant 's case , that would be considered the flavor of the weak.What did I and my buddies ever see in this group , I wonder now . I heard `` Heaven '' last week on a station called The Brew , and recalled how we all went gaga over this phony spandex laden , eyeliner , hairspray bent crap . Truth is , the guys in Warrant were so untalented and so ugly without their getups , they would n't have made little girls scream and cream without all that junk they did to themselves.For two years before they got a contract with Columbia , I kept hearing how great this band was and could n't wait to get this album . It promised to rock . When I got it home , the rockers were trite Boston and alleged `` southern rock '' ripoffs , and most of it was whiny Jani Lane 's tribute to his skanky ex-girlfriend Becca Bramlett ( Yes , skanky Bonnie 's daughter ) . The vocals were bad and , outside of some badly choreographed video moves and a few half-baked power chords , this album was nothing special . Most tolerable tracks ? Ummm ... I ca n't remember anymore , but when `` Heaven '' is the only song anyone can remember you for , you know you suck as a `` metal '' band . I certainly can pick out the worst songs . The opener , `` 32 Pennies ( In a Ragu Jar ) '' is just so unspeakably awful on every level , you need a bomb shelter to protect you from its fallout . `` So Damn Pretty ( Should Be Against the Law ) '' should be retitled So Damn Awful Should Be Executed for Public Harrassment . Truly , the best song on here is the cocky , self-assured strut of `` Big Talk '' but it does n't ... uh ... warrant buying this bad debut or any of its followups , which I collected until that awful grunge album they put out in the mid-90s.You know ? It 's funny that I always remember Jani Lane and his silly white hair , always posing with those baggy Olsen Twin blue eyes of his , hands together as if he was praying . I guess he was praying for a better singing voice . See ? God DOES N'T always answer every prayer !	-1
I 've only listened to a few tracks before storing in my to-listen-to-later stack . P.P . is a borderline case for me , but I like Tennessee Waltz . What we have here sounds like an overdone re-recording of 50s and 60s hits -- heavy on the violins , choruses , and other syrupy forms of overproducing . Do I detect the heavy hand of Mitch Miller ladling on the schmaltz ? Reminds me of the way the fun Sons of the Pioneers were sugared o'er in their later years .	-1
Pink Floyd are easily one of my top ten favorite bands but even great bands can make horrible albums . In the case of Floyd , it 's this embarrassingly awful funeral home that was used to promote their late 1980s tour . Hardly delicate , listening to this album is like being stuck on an elevator hearing dinosaurs fart.The main problem I have with this album is that it is just simply BORING : dull , lifeless , uninspired and pedestrian to the bone . This is quite a shocker when you consider that Pink Floyd were one of the best live rock bands in the 1970s . There is nothing transcendent about this record ; not even attempts by the band to innovate their classics on stage . Then again , that 's probably a good thing because when they DO try , the results are embarrassing . Take note the hideous saxophone solo on `` Shine on You Crazy Diamond '' ( Dick Parry , we miss you ) and the agonizingly slow rendition of `` Comfortably Numb '' , where Roger Waters ' vocal parts were replaced by a bunch of average vocal harmonies that would make George Martin vomit . The worst offenders , by far , are `` Money '' and `` Run Like Hell '' : the former is extended into an insufferable jam featuring horrible bass playing by newbie Guy Pratt and the latter substitutes the original 's eerie menace for macho chest-beating that is exhausting rather than exhaustive . Roger , where are you when we need you ? Not surprisingly , the most listenable songs on this album are the ones from A Momentary Lapse of Reason ( 1987 ) but that 's not saying much because most of the songs from the record were horrible in the first place . The only songs from this album that actually improved from their studio counterparts are `` Learning to Fly '' , which removes that awful synthesizer riff from the original ; and `` Sorrow '' , which boasts even more impressive guitar playing than before . But whatever positives this album has ( which is very few ) are shattered by the negatives ( which are plenty ) .Anyone who considers Delicate Sound of Thunder as the comprehensive overview of Pink Floyd concerts are clearly misguided ; as stated before , in the 1970s , Pink Floyd were a force on stage and their best concerts rivaled that of Led Zeppelin . It 's not just because they had Waters ; when they were together , Floyd produced dazzling and unforgettable music . In fact , there are many bootleg albums out there to confirm this ( most notably Animal Instincts ) . But Delicate is not one of those albums . Far from comprehensive , Delicate confirms the inaccurate belief that Pink Floyd were a boring dinosaur act whose reasons for touring were for financial rather than artistic reasons.Delicate Sound of Thunder is not the best place to start if you want to get into Floyd concerts , that 's for damn sure . Check out Animal Instincts or even their Live 8 reunion and the difference in quality between those shows and Delicate are absolutely staggering . Avoid this Sound of Blunder at all costs.Strong recommendation to avoid .	-1
The 1 star is for my utter dissapointment with this remaster/release ! Journey itself is a great band , and deserves 5 stars . As an audio and music enthusiast in my 5th decade , I know my sound . This recording is utterly flat , tinny , shrill , and devoid of dynamic range ! If you Google 'the loudness wars ' , you can read all about how recording companies have RAPED many commercial recordings ! In fact , there are some great YouTube videos on 'the loudness wars ' out there . Call your record companies and complain about this ! I have many times . Incidentally , my high-end system consists of tubed preamplification , McIntosh CDP and amp , and Magnepan 1.7 speakers . So not only can I hear some great detail and accurate timbre , I can hear how bad a remaster or recording is almost immediately after hitting 'play ' on my CDP . I have many many other CD 's that ARE recorded and/or mastered with great care , sound , dynamic range , etc . Lastly , there is a huge , glaring omission of one of Journey 's best songs here , mainly 'Anytime/Feeling That Way ' ! SHAME on the record companies for releasing great music in a truly compromised , sonically inferior fashion !	-1
I guess that makes sense , since Journey 's music is incredibly slick and processed - it represents the triumph of commerce over art , which plagued rock music until the early '90s . Some people might have enjoyed this back in the day ( you had to - radio stations played them incessantly ) but for anyone that enjoys it , it 's a total guilty pleasure - how many people do you know that blast Journey out of their car windows , or wear their shirts ? I thought so.Credit where it 's due : Neal Schon was a heck of a guitar player , and Steve Perry actually can sing . However , the band could n't write songs to save their lives , and Perry 's voice was better suited for Broadway instead of a rock and roll band . Sure , the songs might have had memorable choruses , but at their core they were completely empty - dependent on repetition of the chorus to the point where it will make you scream.Subject matter is a weak point with this band - there 's such a dearth of inspiration with these songs . Apparently the only thing that they were capable of writing about were relationships - that means there 's plenty of drippy & quot ; I 'll love you forever & quot ; stuff and breakup songs as well . For a band that is as popular as these guys have been , listening to these songs will make you wonder what everyone sees in them.In summary : Pick up this album if you enjoy hearing overwrought , hackneyed , slick corporate rock . There 's more cheese on this album than you 'll find in the state of Wisconsin !	-1
Decent chick band favorite of the 80s . My favorite track is Wheel in the Sky . For similar Christian metal check out Stryper or Danzig .	-1
So far , I have yet to patronise the cheapest whorehouse in Texas ; by all accounts , its Madame plays this disc in the foyer.Zubin Mehta - he who inspired a generation to don chicken-man suits - has surpassed himself here . This is a landmark recording . It warrants commemoration and eternally so.Is there a more vulgar survey of Wagner in recorded history ? What is one to say of a conductor who has no feel for orchestral sonority , who underwrites the crudity on display throughout the Funeral March - listen to the cacophony upon its summation - and imparts noise but not tension to proceedings ? Is it possible to cheapen Forest Murmurs from Siegfried beyond recognition ? Guess ! I am no student of the New York Philharmonic but god help it if this endeavour is meridian . Mehta is clearly ignorant of Richard Strauss ' maxim : never encourage the brass . Accordingly , the urban fantasies of Charles Ives come to mind in the Immolation Scene : let 's clatter up the fire-escape together ! Speaking of which , Lucifer himself surely cast Montserrat Caballe as Brunnhilde . Is she actually singing in German ? Who can tell ? If you have ever wondered , `` Should Wagner be sung like Rossini ? '' your search ends here . Fast for a day before you listen to this : surely you value that lounge-suite.Petronius ' two greatest creations , Trimalchio ( the ex-slave with more money than taste ) and his hound Scylax ( `` protector of the house and household '' ) would flee from this degrading spectacle . Their latter-day equivalents , Sir Les Patterson ( Australia 's Cultural Attach & eacute ; to the Court of St James ) and cashed-up uber-bogan Shane Keith Warne ( ciggy in mouth ) would do likewise.Heed their collective wisdom .	-1
WARNING : In the previous 37 reviews listed here , many are for the Argerich/Dutoit recordings . Amazon needs to shift them to the appropriate place . This review is of the Perahia/ Mehta recording.Perahia 's piano sounds fine , and his playing is as lucid and dynamically refined as ever it was , BUT . . . these are concertos , and it 's not at all clear what the orchestra is contributing , so a vital context for Perahia 's playing is missing . The orchestral openings are unrefined and too recessed in sound , and once the piano enters , the orchestra seems to disappear for long stretches or to be audible only as a soupy wash well back in the aural picture . The idea that Mehta is contributing to the shape and texture of these pieces just does n't come through . I 'm fully aware that Chopin is n't Brahms or Schumann , but still . . . he went to the trouble of writing for the orchestra , and we need to hear it . It needs to be closer in the aural picture ( I would n't want the piano further back -- it 's just fine ) , and it needs to have a more focused sound from the engineers . And it would be nice if Mehta could contribute some sense of direction . Galliera for Pollini and Abbado for Argerich ( on EMI and DGG respectively ) serve the pianists better . So , for that matter , does Ormandy for Ax . I know that these were live performances , but this was around 1990 , so there 's really no excuse for CBS/Sony 's poor showing here .	-1
Sure Jason Bonhams Dad was the almighty drummer for Led Zeppelin but this cd is not that great and never thrilled me at all.Aside from the fact that Jason got a singer that sounds alot like Robert Plant and wanted to cash in on that Led Zepelin sound this is one lame CD.People were always ragging on Great Whites Jack Russell because he sounds a lot like Robert Plant but because Jason Bonham is in the band it 's ok for him to have the Robert Plant clone.The music and tunes are so-so but I wouldnt waste my money on here to own a copy of this cd .	-1
This is by far my favorite Michael Bolton album . It blows .	-1
This album does n't really hold up quite well , even if Soul Provider and How Am I Supposed to Live Without You are on it . The rest of the album has too many dull power ballads that did n't grab me . But keep in mind , this was summer 1989 when a series of adult contemporary ballads by Bolton , Richard Marx , and Grayson Hugh were hits . I still think that he got better with & quot ; Time Love and Tenderness & quot ; and & quot ; The One Thing & quot ; ( his best album ) . Otherwise , I do n't know how you 're going to go through this drivel of mostly bland songs . A few of them put me to sleep . Bolton just lacks passion on most of these songs to me .	-1
Earth , Wind & Fire 's first greatest hits album is so musically well constructed it 's almost worth those who own the albums already to have it.The same is n't true with this one-tune 's like `` Love 's Holiday '' , '' Serpentine Fire '' , '' Mighty Mighty '' and `` Boogie Wonderland '' are classics but the overall album does n't flow together half as well as the first.The juxtaposition of era 's is jarring too-the production and style of some of the songs have too much of a range and makes it seem well ... .dated in parts.Better to purchase the chronological and extensive 'Eternal Dance ' box set-it has ALL the hits in the proper order and is frankly better mastered .	-1
Yeah , do n't blow any money on this one at all . It 's not a good idea . But I 'm sure you knew that already . For the uninitiated , Dylan and the Dead is a live album , pairing Bob Dylan with the Grateful Dead . But here 's the problem : Dylan was way past his peak when this album came out - he released this atrocious thing right afterEmpire Burlesque , Knocked Out Loaded , andDown in the Groove , if you needed proof - and while I do n't know much about the Dead ( though I dig the Dynamic Duo ofWorkingman 's DeadandAmerican Beautyjust fine ) , I 'm just gon na guess that they , too , were kinda washed-up by 1988.No pun intended , but everyone sounds dead on this release . Bob Dylan 's voice sounds absolutely terrible . No emotion , no personality , nothing . He just sounds bored with himself . The Dead display zero energy , and do n't really provide anything interesting , outside of a few nice-ish guitar parts on the occasional song . As such , the classics get butchered . Ever heard a bad version of `` Knocking on Heaven 's Door , '' `` I Want You , '' or `` All Along the Watchtower ? '' Try the ones found on this album . They 're awful . `` Knocking on Heaven 's Door '' especially suffers from lagtime . It does n't have anything resembling a vocal melody , even in the faintest . Dylan lags way behind the Dead , mumbling his way through one of the all-time classics . Dylan makes `` All Along the Watchtower '' sound like the absolutely brilliant Hendrix version , and while that worked onBefore The Flood [ Live With The Band , 1974 ] , it fails epically for Dylan here.And why did he decide to drag out `` Joey '' on this tour ? It was a bad enough song in the first place , with Dylan 's whining all over it , but it sounds even more wretched here , because at least the original had a fairly interesting arrangement , with the violin fills and accordion and all . There 's nothing even remotely interesting about this take on `` Joey . `` The ironic thing is he does one of his very worst songs pretty well . I 've never been a fan of `` Got ta Serve Somebody '' - in fact , I just about hate it - but by taking out the electric piano and backup singers , he manages to make it somewhat decent . Some of the decent guitar parts I mentioned in passing earlier really come out here . They also come out on `` Slow Train . '' Of course , neither of these songs are anywhere near as good as even the weaker material on some of Dylan 's best live albums , but whatever.But neither of those small highlights makes Dylan and the Dead worth a purchase . This is just another failure from Dylan 's weakest period . Gerf . Awful , awful stuff . Skip it . If you must buy it , buy it for the cover . What is it with bad albums that have cool covers , anyway ? At least it 's not a bad album with a bad cover a la Knocked Out Loaded .	-1
My friend recorded this onto a cassette when I was 17 and I thought it was ok . I used to love the vocalist 's singing style . I found it in a record shop on vinyl and bought it just to see if my memory of the album ( as really good ) was correct . I must say that the vocals are quite laughable - lots of vibrato and falsetto . The guy can sing in parts , I guess . The guitar is technically proficient but strangely lacking . I can take it or leave it ( in fact I have left it in my mother in law 's attic ) - along with much of the rest of the 'true metal ' of the 80s . Anyway , being a metalhead is myopic .	-1
I used to listen to this album every day . I knew all the words . Hell , I even choreographed a dance to & quot ; Step By Step & quot ; and tried to convince my dad that & quot ; Tonight & quot ; sounds like a cross between & quot ; Ob La Di , Ob La Da & quot ; and & quot ; Penny Lane. & quot ; Although there are no limits to Step by Step 's missteps , I have to give them credit for stepping outside the bounds of gooey bubble gum pop and into the kind of territory that will end your teen idol career as fast as it began . Unlike the Kids ' self-titled debut and Hangin ' Tough , this swan song to teenage stardom incorporates a surprising diversity in music styles ... & quot ; Step By Step & quot ; reassures the Kids ' loyal audience that they 're still in the pop game , but it really serves as a Trojan Horse to dupe those dumb teenagers into shelling out their parents ' dough for the rest of Step by Step -- essentially , a collection of failed experiments the session musicians could n't even save , like the Rico-Suave-esque reggae swamp , & quot ; Stay With Me Baby , & quot ; and the softcore rap , & quot ; Games. & quot ; And let & quot ; Tonight & quot ; and & quot ; Where Do We go From Here & quot ; serve as a extreme caution to any boy bands foolishly ambitious enough to make any attempt to musically pay homage to the Beatles ... please take heed of these atrocities and aspire to more attainable standards , like , say ... Bananarama.Another bonus : whereas on the previous albums , Joe and Jordan took the Lennon-McCartney vocal-hog reins , on Step By Step , all five New Kids are utilized to their fullest potential . Danny Wood can ( sort of ) rap ! And he 's not the only one ... judging by Donnie 's searing , dis-filled rhymes on & quot ; Never Gon na Fall in Love Again , & quot ; he would probably school his younger bro Marky Mark in a rap-off on 8-mile Road , yo . And contrary to popular belief , Jonathan Knight is not a mute ... like you and me , he can sing a lame-o hack job of & quot ; Happy Birthday & quot ; really really badly ... who knew ? So what brought on this sudden collective effort on the mic ? In some circles , it was believed that the New Kids overthrew Maurice Starr 's authority over their careers and kicked him to the curb , thus allowing Jordan and Joey to go on tour with the Stylisitics and the rest of the New Kids to step into the recording studio for the first time ever . Another branch on the grapevine contended that because Joey had ventured past the age of 14 , suddenly his soprano pipes lost in a battle with a new , deep , ugly voice called puberty , and the other Kids had to make up for his absence , since Jordan could n't do it alone ( what with his inevitable fledgling solo career on the wings ) . The New Baritone Joey was brave enough to go on the record with & quot ; Where Do We Go From Here , & quot ; but try to get through the track without cringing and longing to listen to & quot ; Please Do n't Go Girl & quot ; on repeat . With Joe all grown up and forbidden to sing , Jordan single-handedly carries the group vocally with his stellar Barry Gibb impersonations , particularly on & quot ; Step By Step. & quot ; As usual , it is his voice that makes the New Kids . I ca n't help feeling cheated that he did n't do a Justin Timberlake-style rise to solo stardom . He could have really rocked my body.Like watching old Baywatch episodes while tight-rolling my stone-washed jeans , tucking the cuffs under my socks , and slipping on my lace-free Keds , I always find a buried fondness in my heart for treasures I onced loved but am now embarrassed to admit it . This is the way I feel about the New Kids on the Block 's Step By Step . Please let the one-star rating I 've bestowed upon this album serve as a testament to its enduring significance in the boy band genre for generations to come .	-1
When this album first came out back in '89 , I did n't know if I should laugh or cry . I just could n't believe that Alice would stoop to this . Desmond Child is without a doubt the worst thing that has ever happened to him . Some people just have the wrong idea about how Alice Cooper is supposed to sound , and Coop listened to the wrong guy this time . Variety used to be one of the best things about Cooper albums , but here you get none , only monotony . This is a textbook example on how not to do it if you 're a serious artist , and I had always thought that Alice was . -But the & quot ; hairspray-period & quot ; of any artist is always the lowpoint music-wise , and such were the late 80 's . ( The worst album is still & quot ; Raise Your Fist ... & quot ; . ) - Admit it Alice , you know I 'm right . Was this really the album you wanted to make , or did other people want you to ? . Whatever , Trash stinks .	-1
Yes this is what happens when Desmond Child is coupled with Alice what we all get is this hair metal 'opus ' . Crappy lyrics , songs that have never ending bon jovi-esque choruses ( 'bed of nails ' anyone ? yuck ) and not too mention the music ; all pointless emotionless guitar solos and the synth sounds are some of the worst I 've ever heard , has anyone noticed that synthesizers somehow sounded better in the 70 's ? Alice seems content to snarl through the whole thing too , not once does he go out of that range gone are the days when he emoted.Just for context I like everything Alice did up until Dada , this and to a lesser extent hey stoopid are the absolute nadir of Alice 's catologue . It 's no wonder that none of this s*** crops up in Alice 's setlists anymore except poison.Also please stop saying this is heavy metal , hair metal is some trashy ball-less hybrid at best.If it 's some consolation things get better after trash and stoopid in fact skip these two and go straight to last temptation .	-1
While `` Trash '' has some excellent songs on it like `` Hell Is Living Without You '' and `` Bed Of Nails '' , the album seems too commercial and too ballady , esecially since it 's the follow up to Cooper 's heaviest album `` Raise Your Fist And Yell '' . In my opinion this is the only Alice Cooper album not worth owning .	-1
If you 're a Vollenweider fan , I guess you 'll get more out of ` Dancing with the Lion ' than I did . Some of the tracks are all right , but some are almost cliched new age pieces ( one track , ` Still Life , ' has these atrocious Kenny G.-like saxophone solos ) . To me , this is just a rather unoriginal follow-up to ` Down to the Moon ' - althogether a stronger album and a much more tolerable new age release .	-1
I was looking forward to this so much . I had heard a lot of good things about Winton Marsalis and was looking forward to some smokey hot holiday jazz . No such luck . The minor chords , the complete lack of spirit , what a bummer . I can not imagine being more disappointed . You can tell the musicians know how to play their instruments . Why did n't they ? Bah humbug on this loser .	-1
Business as usual : There are selections missing from the original double LP edition . In my LP version of this compilation , is included `` Long Walk Home '' , one of the best instrumentals I 've ever heard with a neat 50s sound.. In this CD , is gone ! WHY ? ? ?	-1
Poor representating of the band.Go with Toto or IV for a good Toto CD .	-1
Even by the standards of anonymous 1980 's arena rock Toto were pretty faceless ( quick , name one member without looking it up ) making generally bland , generic rock that offend only those who were offended by calculated inoffensiveness . This approach led to a total of 14 chart singles many of which were so forgettable that they are n't even included on this greatest hits collection ( quick : can anyone hum a few bars of `` Make Believe , '' `` Without Your Love , '' or `` Stranger in Town '' each of which cracked the US Top 40 , yet none of which are included here ) ? Still , every once in a while the band managed to click with a 45 rpm that stuck in one 's consciousness for more than 20 seconds after it was over . `` Rosanna '' is one of those annoyingly catchy songs that slowly loosens the grip sanity has on your brain -- like Edgar Alan Poe 's `` The Tale Tale Heart '' is plays relentlessly in your head zapping away brains cells one by one while `` Africa '' managed to sustain memorability with a graceful melody and became the band 's lone # 1 hit.Both of those songs are here for anyone willing to plop down the bucks for this collection , but that 's still a lot of dough for a measly two songs and a truck load of filler , no ?	-1
Many have complained on these Amazon pages that this Streisand collection is a mixed bag , and I 'd have to agree . Although every time someone has to compile a Streisand greatest hits package , it 's never an easy task . You 're dealing with one of the best entertainers in the last 100 years who has remained ( for the most part ) uniformly consistent in her excellence.The producers prob did n't want to repeat some of the songs from her last greatest hits outing , but guess what -- they ended up doing that anyway . Almost half the songs here are repeats from the `` Memory '' compilation , which goes all the way back to late 1981 . We have the usual `` Cats '' , `` Phantom '' and `` Guilty '' album cuts here , but seriously , do we really need another `` Woman In Love '' or `` Guilty '' ? While adding `` By the Way '' ( from her 1975 LP ) was a surprising move , there could 've been so many great songs chosen from Babs ' 1970 's & 1980 's catalog . Babs had a successful decade as the 1980 's wore on . How about adding `` Till I Loved You '' ( her light , fun duet with paramour at the time , Don Johnson ) ? Although her `` Emotion '' LP from 1984 did n't particularly sell well , it had a few great tracks , namely her duet with Kim Karnes `` Make No Mistake , He 's Mine '' and the breezy `` Here We Are At Last '' . Either track could 've easily made its way onto this collection.Instead we get the obvious choices from the `` Guilty '' LP . Even adding the track `` Promises '' instead of `` Woman In Love '' or `` Guilty '' would 've been a breath of fresh air . Instead of `` By the Way '' ( not particularly memorable ) , how about `` Lazy Afternoon '' , the title track from the same LP ? A bold song choice that would 've elicited lots of `` ooohs '' and `` ahhhs '' is `` I Wo n't Last A Day Without You '' ( from her `` Butterfly '' LP in 1974 ) , the Paul Williams-penned classic that has been covered by everyone from the Carpenters to Diana Ross , but Babs ' version is one in a mil . The arrangements and Streisand 's interpretive ability really shine . But of course putting exciting choices like `` I Wo n't Last A Day Without You '' would 've been asking too much from the folks at Columbia Records.Even picking `` Somewhere '' for this collection was a safe , predictable choice . How about the other great tracks from the Broadway Album , there were so many . `` Send In the Clowns '' easily matches `` Somewhere '' in its intensity and profound message , but is left out . What we have here is another sad , sad waste of opportunities by Streisand 's record company . We 're treated to the same old , `` tried & true '' lame choices . Over and over again . So much for entertainment value . As it stands , this botched greatest hits collection merits 2 stars at most . The record execs just want their $ $ $ profits while repackaging the same boring choices for the masses . But then , what else is new ?	-1
Folks -- avoid this . The first album sounded fine and this is just an attempt to cash in on the new & quot ; remaster & quot ; phenomenon . Madonna , Pet Shop Boys and Blondie have all just reissued part or all of their catalogs as rematsters-but here 's the up side for them . The albums NEEDED to be rematstered and include bonus tracks . In the case of Blondie , the albums were n't even available anymore . Dangerous is readily available and was recorded using state of the art technology . The original sounds fine . This edition continas no new tracks , no interviews , nothing extra . THe other three ( Off The Wall , Thriller and Bad ) at least have extra tracks , and the first two were probably in need of some serious remastering . Dangerous should just sit on the shelf .	-1
this album sucks . having mick jones of foreigner any way involved with your record post-1980 is the kiss if death and the sure sign of selling out , and sell out they did . totally cheeseball anthems and power ballads galore . if you dig richard marx , by all means , BUY IT.their early records are great ( anything 1977-1983 ) , and the newer stuff ( rockford is fantastic ) is much better than this fluff .	-1
Aic 's best and it sounds exactally like every other AIC album ... .problem is AIC are not a good band and have yet to release a decent album ...	-1
Now , I 'm a Bangles fan and I loved Sue 's second solo album , but this is pure MOR , David Kahne produced junk ! It 's overproduced : too many keyboards , too many layers of vocals , synthesizers , sounds -- where 's the music ? This is not a rock and roll record , which is a shame because Sue Hoffs can rock . In My Side of the Bed Sue sings of imbecilic situations like `` I drew a heart and I colored it red '' as she was talking on the phone with her guy . Just how old are you , Sue ? No Kind of Love is a disaster ... synthesizers gone haywire . `` No kind of love/no kind of anything that I really need . '' Huh ? Unconditional Love is another blown up ballad with lyrics like `` I want to lie next to you and I want to do everything you want me to but I do n't know how . '' Please Sue - you just asked him to go on your side of the bed ! The album makes Sue Hoffs sounds like a silly , dependent 12 year old girl with no knowledge of relationships , life or sex or yes , love . For all her singing about it on this album ( Unconditional Love , No Kind of Love , Only Love ... blah , blah , blah ) she does n't seem to know a thing about it . Best cut : This Time . - The Bangles should have cut that version .	-1
It 've known the music of Mahavishnu for years . Maybe not since 1974 , but for a while . And I do n't get this album . I never got it , and I still do n't get it . I just ca n't get into this album . Maybe I 'm too stupid to get it ?	-1
First experience with Mahavishnu . Bought based on past John McLaughlin recordings . Ca n't state that I enjoyed what was offered here . Too bad as I was looking forward to expanding my McLaughlin library .	-1
Throughout his long career Ellington was miles ahead of his contemporaries in his understanding of the recording technology of the day , and his records nearly always sounded better than those of other bands . But you wo n't know it to listen to these CDs . These discs sound like the music was recorded through tin cans attached with strings . The treble is truncated at about 4 khz , and the bass is lopped off at about 250 hz . Consequently , there simply is no life left in these vital recordings . No punch at all . Sharp transients are mushy at best . And with no foundation at the bottom end.Attempting to correct the sound with a 10 band equalizer helps , but not much . After Sony engineers did their hatchet job , the audio spectrum simply is no longer there . The original 78s sound much better than these disgraceful CDs . Some of this material was released on Columbia LP boxed sets with better sound , back in the 1960s and '70s . This release emphatically demonstrates a pathetic and irresponsible pandering to commercial interests and should be boycotted by all lovers of fine music .	-1
OK , great , let 's take some of the finest early works of the thrash/punk crossover metal movement and rework them into happy-happy-joy-joy sing-along tunes . Listen to the new version of `` I Saw Your Mommy '' and try not to lose your lunch at the backup vocals ( yes , you read that right ) . This was the most ... attempt at a cash-grab I 've ever encountered . No wonder Rocky quit ! AVOID THIS AT ALL COST and get the ORIGINAL first album and be amazed . Or buy this pile of dung and be repulsed at the ... attempt to feed off a fanship that needs a hero at this point . Word to Mike Muir : get back in touch with the people that put you where you are now .	-1
Other performances in this cycle are exeplary but this interpretation of Beethoven 9 is in some ways one of the weakest performances in this cycle . The choir pronounces german with little or not uniformity and the consanants are not together . On top of this the Baritone has very little power unlike the Karajan Walter Berry combination . While the slow movement is quite nice there is really little happening ... whereas the Fricsay Beethoven 9 had an incredible power ... I think there are alot of better budget alternatives ... including Furtwangler in Bayreuth on EMI which sounds incredible for its time ... .Szell is simply not shaping phrases or even attempting to mould phrases . In other words this is one of the worst and least exciting 9ths on record ... go to Herbert K. or even Bohm to see what I mean . As for the Fidelio the solo horn is off pitch most of the time ...	-1
This recording of Brahm 's 1st Symphony is musical garbage . George Szell was well known and critized for his precision . When dealing with classical greats like Mozart and Haydn , George Szell is one of the first conductors I seek after . I recommend his recordings of Mozart 's 39th , 40th , and 41st . But ! ! ! George Szell 's abilities as a Romantic Period conductor ( Brahms ! ) are lacking in the highest degree . Listening to this recording is like having to look at van Gogh 's `` Starry Night '' painted with nothing but straight lines . As for BOXED SETs of the Brahm 's Symphonies , Otto Klemperer 's recording comes with my highest recommendations . Otto Klemperer KNEW the work of Brahms like few else . He even chided himself for writing pieces that sounded more like Brahms than like Klemperer . His recording of the Brahms Symphonies is available on EMI Classic 's 'Great Recordings of the Century ' label .	-1
The sonority of Kathleen Battle 's voice just does n't pair well with the `` voice '' of Wynton 's horn . It ( Kathleen 's voice , that is ) just does n't have the mettle ; the texture . How the conceptualizers behind this record missed it is beyond me . Given the end result , there was only so much recording engineers could do with what ended up on tape ; to wit sonorities that are a world removed from each other . Very disappointing , very disappointing.Hope brother Wynton got laid for all the huffin ' n ' puffin ' he put on that big ol ' horn.My name is C. Rex , Thump , thump , thumb ... .Short Review - `` Baroque Duet '' with Wynton Marsalis & Kathleen Battle	-1
As far as a patriotic cd goes , this is one that you will probably want to kill for . Just kidding ! This is a great selection of patriotic music . The orchestra gives a great performance of these masterful songs . I personally rather listen to beautiful romantic love songs than patriotic songs , but this music is an important part of American history and i think we need it.I WOULD LUKE WARMLY RECOMMEND THIS CD	-1
I seem to be in the minority here , but this album did very little for me . There are a few good songs , but overall I think it is weaker than both `` Constrictor '' and `` Raise Your Fist And Yell '' .	-1
saw him in concert a few weeks after the release of this- luckly he didnt do any of the songs on it- there is 1 good song t.v . talking ... makes it better then world gone wrong or down in the groove or good as I been to you- or even new morning a cd thats often left off of dylans worst lists but has only 1 decent song if not for you	-1
This album has its fans , but I have to side with the majority . I listened to it a dozen times , and I 've tried approaching it as if it was a 'children 's album , ' like some claim . It 's still full of stinkers . Most of the tracks are virtually non-descript or flat-out awful.A toddler could boogie to `` Wiggle Wiggle '' - it 's a good , nonsense song for kids - and the title track is a nice nursery song , albeit a bit too slick . `` God Knows '' has its moments . But the rest stinks.If you 're a bootleg collector , there 's three tracks you should seek out . An earlier version of `` Born in Time '' was originally recorded for 'Oh Mercy ' but left off the album . THAT version is a THOUSAND times better than this one . The original versions of `` T.V . Talkin ' Song '' and `` Handy Dandy '' are very different from the released versions here , and they are definitely worth hearing , especially `` Handy Dandy , '' which could 've been a great children 's recording .	-1
I 'm a huge Dylan fan -- -own everything he ever released.In my humble opinion , this is Bob 's worst . Just a really bad CD . 'Nuff said .	-1
This is worth buying only if you 've got spare cash . Otherwise you 'd be better off buying any one of the other great albums Dolly has recorded . e.g . The Grass Is Blue It 's too short and too Christmassy . Now , If Dolly were to write her own Christmas songs ...	-1
yea there are some good tracks here but too much filler . it 's average at best overall .	-1
How did the mighty fall with this album ! Until this LP , Weather Report had released an unbroken sequence of wonderful records , culminating in the commercial but brilliant 'Heavy Weather ' . Then suddenly the band seemed to turn its back on that masterpiece with this over-layered , synth-dominated album.Their only rival in the jazz-rock supergroup league , Return to Forever , had released the execrable 'Musicmagic ' a year earlier . Perhaps in the spirit of punk , every band felt it had to go through a major internal upheaval and re-invent itself . But nothing had prepared Weather Report fans for this , which frankly ought to have been released and judged as a Zawinul solo album . Measured against say , 'Dialects ' , this album sounds pretty good.I saw the band in concert in Oxford on the 'Heavy Weather ' tour in the fall of 1977 . The rhythm section was still Pastorius-Badrena-Acuna , and there was no indication of disarray in the ranks or of Shorter being squeezed out . Perhaps the only clue was the empathy that clearly existed between Pastorius and Zawinul . Just a few months later Zawinul was in his favourite Hollywood studios recording this album , bringing in musicians almost on a session basis . So we get Pastorius on bass , Pastorius on drums , Pete Erskine ( not yet a fully fledged member ) on high hat , and Shorter somewhere down in the mix . 'Mr Gone ' was the first and almost the last time I ever bought an LP on import -- these were the days when the band would release in the States about a month before the UK release . I was immensely disappointed . I felt the band had broken the bond of trust with their fans.In the sleevenotes to the magnificent 'Jaco Pastorius ' remaster , Pat Metheny recalls how in Florida in the early 1970s , he and Jaco would discuss at length how much they disliked jazz-rock . And yet , with this , only his third album for Weather Report , Jaco appears on first hearing to have sold out to commercial interests . But in truth , the bass lines are actually rather good . If Sony could release a version of this album with the keyboards entirely stripped out -- so we just hear drums , bass and sax -- we would have something to marvel at .	-1
Weather Report made many interesting ( and some great ) albums during their career , whether or not they fit cleanly into the `` jazz '' category . However , this album is neither interesting nor even good . Sadly enough , despite the considerable talents of the musicians ( Wayne Shorter , Joe Zawinul and Jaco Pastorius ! ! ) this album consists largely of experiments that DO N'T work.Granted , there is an interesting moment here and there ... but be forewarned . Even if you have no problem with so-called `` commercial '' music ( and as an admirer of Stevie Wonder , Marvin Gaye , the Beatles , etc . ; I do n't ) this is not the Weather Report recording to get . `` Black Market '' and `` Heavy Weather '' are much better choices for Weather Report 's `` commercial '' albums .	-1
OK ... I do n't get it . I always thought that I 'd adore Mott . Quite honestly , all I 'd heard was All The Young Dudes , but I 'm a complete Bowie fanatic and have been for a good 20 years . Being that I was only 3 , though , when Mott had their heyday , all I 'd known was All The Young Dudes . Still , they had everything right going for them , and their reputation was excellent . Plus the majority of the Bowie-produced All The Young Dudes album is here , plus nearly all of their other acclaimed albums , Mott and The Hoople.Wow . What a disappointment . Maybe you had to be there when this was big , but I would say upwards of 80 percent of this is just horrible . Bad Dylany impersonations , dumb lyrics ( they 've milked the words `` ballad/hymn '' and `` dudes '' for all they are worth ) and ( because of Mick Ralphs involvement ) -- worst of all -- too much macho Bad Co.-inspired boring rock.No spark here , aside from All The Way to Memphis , ATYD , Sea Diver , their version of Sweet Jane and maybe Whizz Kidd.REVISION : I like this . It 's not fantastic , but it 's good . I just had to spend some time w/ it . I 'd rate it three and a half stars at this point . I Wish I Was Your Mother and Ballad of Mott are amazing songs . In fact , pretty much everything from the Mott album is fantastic ( except Violence ) . There 's definitely a good single CD here -- two CDs is a bit much , but I Wish I Was Your Mother is n't on the single greatest hits CD , so you 'd have to buy that plus the Mott album . Or this and shave off what you do n't like .	-1
Mott 's version of You Really Got Me was one of the greatest instrumental covers of all time . It 's missing from this compilation .	-1
I do n't buy MP3s any more and my tape copy needed replacement , otherwise I would not have gotten it , probably wont get any other album of hers , as I am just not interested in more than an occasional radio run	-1
Amazon reviewer Beth Bessmer needs a memory refresher . `` Here We Go ( Let 's Rock and Roll ) '' was also a single off the disc and also a big chart hit . Perhaps she meant to say she felt the other 2 are the only `` necessary '' ones here ? HIGHLIGHTS : Sure , some of the lines in Freedom Williams ' rap are corny ( `` It 's your world and I 'm just a squirrel/tryin ' ta get a nut to move your butt '' ) but that 's part of the charm of the title track . It still holds up well as a floor-filling dance tune that 's a pop song first . Martha Wash 's scatted vocal at the coda just seals the deal . `` Things that make you go Hmmm '' was more or less an attempt to piggyback on the popularity of Arsenio Hall at the time . The lyrics about infidelity recall the style of DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince . It 's worth listening to the bonus track ( seemingly just a string of TV/movie clips strung over a house-ish track ) to try and figure out the sources.LOWS : The interminable `` Groove of Love ( What 's This Word Called Love ? ) '' ... wake me when it 's over . Hedonism anthem `` Live Happy '' shares this 'wisdom ' ( `` Some people say how can you live this way ? /Living only for today/Tomorrow may never come our way/So I 'm gon na try to live happy ! `` ) .BOTTOM LINE : The only absolutely critical song here is `` Gon na Make You Sweat '' . It 's available on several compilations : Try ASIN B0000C0XP3 if you want a good R & B ; based comp of that era , ASIN B00004Y6WD for a decent 90s dance disc , or ASIN B00005B53Y if you want a mix of 90s hits cross genre ... everything from Amy Grant to Mr. Big . These are just some of a HUGE number of hits for the song so if you do n't like any of those 3 discs , odds are you can find one you love ( or at least like enough to get it used ) . Get it on a compilation .	-1
2 1/2Solid , if predictable and bloated continuation of Waters post-Floyd era suffers from self-importance , essentially still taking many ideas from mainly The Final Cut and recycling with a fair amount of success .	-1
I do n't think Mountain 's studio work ever approached their live performances . This just sounds thin , with the high point being Pappalardi 's vocals in the title track . Leslie West plays much better on Leslie West Live . His guitar is the real star of this show , and his vocals get better all the time . This album does n't capture the overwhelming sound the big guy generated . It seems like he was trying to be just another member of the band , and that 's a waste . For a great kick , check out his acoustic versions of The Animals and Bob Dylan on You Tube . Mountain was just his warm-up act . He 's better not than he was then .	-1
I have this album and it 's predecessor & # 34 ; Climbing & # 34 ; on vinyl . I decided to buy used CD 's to haul around in the car or just for casual listening on my home based system . The recording of this CD is to me poor . The mixing is not done nearly as well as & # 34 ; Climbing & # 34 ; . The bass is weak and the mids and highs are tinney and shrill at times . The live bonus track is terrible . I saw Mountain when they were doing their tour for & # 34 ; Climbing & # 34 ; and it was quite an experience . That LP is just as full and great sounding as they were live . This album misses the boat in my opinion . It 'll probably end up in my garage sale box . The song writing is no where near as good as & # 34 ; Climbing & # 34 ; . The cover art is the best part .	-1
21/2 SCOOPS OUT OF FIVE . OBVIOUSLY SOME VERY TALENTED PLAYERS HERE , SOME MOMENTS OF COMPLEXITY HERE AND THERE , BUT THE MATERIAL IS POOPY . FOR MY PERSONAL TATSE , THIS WOULD GET A BIG FAT LONELY STAR , BUT IT 'S NOT REALLY BAD MUSIC , I JUST COULD NOT GET IT . THE PRODUCTION IS TYPICAL OF EARLY 90 'S , WAY OVERDONE , SHINY , ARTIFICIAL , THERE 'S NO PROPER SPACIAL IMAGERY AT ALL . CAN YOU SAY COMPRESSION ? YUCK . NOT THE GREASY , SWEATY FUNK FROM THE 70 'S . MADE ME THINK OF BEING IN AN ICE CREAM PARLOR AT TIMES . WERE THESE TRACKS LEFTOVERS FROM BAD 1989-90 SESSIONS OR WHAT ?	-1
i do n't understand the five stars ratings for this record , for me it is really average ; the bad news first : i do n't like his voice and it rather detracts the music than the contrary , plus personally , and that is purely subjective , i think he plays with too heavy strings ; 'Little Wing ' is a bad endless version , way too repetitive ( the fact he did n't understand that playing the same musical theme over and over again was to turn this great song of Hendrix into such a repetitive thing is beyond me ) ; the good news : the sky is crying , May I have a talk with you ( raw and bluesy , my favorite track ) , Life by the Drop ( a simple but nice bluesy ballad ) , the instrumental Chitlins con carne , are good though i find his guitar playing on the excellent 'May i have ... ' a little bit repetitive , he seems to play the same melodic theme , with some bits of variations over and over again ; however the four songs that i quoted are worth a listening .	-1
To me , this will always be `` That album that was released on the same day as Nevermind by Nirvana '' . If you do n't have any Prong records , I recommend just about any of them before this one . Well , except for Scorpio . That one 's even worse than this . If you 've really got your dander up , find copies of Primitive Origins and Force Fed and just leave it at that .	-1
Another reviewer said & quot ; The Spin Doctors ' album Pocketful Of Kryptonite is sure to amaze and appeal to most people of even mediocre musical taste. & quot ; I would change that to & quot ; ONLY to people of mediocre musical taste. & quot ; Bland , white-boy funk for people who would n't know soul if it bit them in their non-moving white butts .	-1
I love there studio albums from the days of Airto and Connors up to the classic lineup of Corea , Clarke , DiMeola and White . But , this live double header is to artsy fartsy for me . And who the hell is that woman singing ! And why ! This is classic fusion jazz ! It should be insrumental for crissake ! Save your money . I wish I did.J . Guida	-1
I 'm sure many will disagree , but frankly I found little to enjoy in this Verdi Requiem.As much as I love the London Symphony Chorus , I was very disappointed at their sound . The bass section was particularly distressing - they literally sounded like untrained amateurs . In their entrances in Requiem and the Libera Me fugue , they did n't even sound like basses.I have never heard a chorus so closely miked before - you could actually hear the male choristers inhale just before Rex Tremendae . This only made their ragged sound all the worse . And the `` 4 voce '' passage in Libera Me ( `` Quando coeli movendi sunt '' ) was just plain sloppy.I realize this is not a Harnoncourt-style `` religious '' approach . But I found the endless swooping among the soloists very distracting . Oddly enough , Martina Arroyo 's Libera Me was totally devoid of any theatrics to the point of sounding almost lifeless . The overall intonation also seemed to stay just a hairline off consistently.I generally love Bernstein 's records - I grew up with them . But this is not one I would recommend.Two stars for the obvious `` star '' power of the cast - but not for much else . For Verdi 's Requiem , try Giulini , or Muti , or even Solti instead .	-1
You know that I 've heard tons and tons of Bruckner 7th 's , and until now , I had never heard a really terrible one , but the usually great Szell is pretty awful on this one with the great Vienna Philharmonic . I 've heard about 100 cds from Szell and this was the first one that was terrible . I hate to downgrade this conductor who is on my list of the top five or six conductors ever , but it does n't sound like he had a very tight rein on this Vienna Philharmonic , or they were bored , or they were just not very responsive to his leading , or who knows what , but it just comes off as a boring snoozefest , to be quite honest . Basically , Szell just plays the notes but without any of the spirituality that this music needs . Just playing the notes will never make a great performance . Two of the three other reviewers of this are exactly right , and your first reviewer ( who gave this a full five star rating ) either has n't heard but one or two other versions , thus he does n't know the piece well enough , or he just has terribly bad taste in music , but do n't listen to his review because it 's far from the truth . It would have been nice if Szell could have lived far past 1970 , because I think that he could have improved on this recording and had some great performances of some of the Bruckner Symphonies with Cleveland during the Bruckner boom of the 70 's and 80 's . Also , the sound quality of this Salzburg Festival recording , is pretty poor , but not as poor as the performance turned out to be . I do n't usually like live performances because the sound quality is inferior compared to studio performances , but occasionally they can turn out to be quite good ( especially the newer ones ) . I 'm trying to sell my copy on Amazon for about $ 2.50 , which is the going rate for this poor performance , and do n't make the mistake of aquiring it .	-1
This recording of Brahm 's symphonies is musical garbage . George Szell was well known and critized for his precision . When dealing with classical greats like Mozart and Haydn , George Szell is one of the first conductors I seek after . I recommend his recordings of Mozart 's 39th , 40th , and 41st . But ! ! ! George Szell 's abilities as a Romantic Period conductor ( Brahms ! ) are lacking in the highest degree . Listening to this recording is like having to look at van Gogh 's `` Starry Night '' painted with nothing but straight lines . The highest quality recording of Brahms 's 'Third Symphony ' that I 've heard was recorded by Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra . That recording comes on a disc that also includes and excellent , excellent rendition of Mendelssohn 's `` Hebrides Overture . '' As for BOXED SETs of the Brahm 's Symphonies , Otto Klemperer 's recording comes with my highest recommendations . Otto Klemperer KNEW the work of Brahms like few else . He even chided himself for writing pieces that sounded more like Brahms than like Klemperer . His recording of the Brahms Symphonies is available on EMI Classic 's 'Great Recordings of the Century ' label .	-1
I bought this cheap as a remainder soon after it was released in 1991 and only played it in the background a couple of times . Recently I wondered why I had not played it for years.Listening again carefully , I think it is one of the most pretentious guitar recordings I 've ever heard . He plays beautifully , but leaves me absolutely cold . I realize many people love it , so all I 'll say is if you 're new to this artist , listen to the samples a few times before buying it , just in case .	-1
But I 'm still not a grunge fan though , this cd does have some good songs , but As far as I Concerned , I Stopped listening to grunge in 1993 , when it got more depressing and ridiculous , Alice in chains is the only thing I Like not this .	-1
What is down ? ? First off I love grunge rock , its dark brooding power cords define my tortured life and I love playing it on a sunny day while I golf with friends at the country club . Anyhoo , a friend told me I shood check out Pearl Jam and said I should play their new one they just putt out with a dvd called `` 10 '' . Wow , this was nothing like the good grunge bands , the singer is indescipherable , the guitarists play no good memorable rifts , and the drumber is just hitting old peanut butter cans , gross ! ! LOOK People , stick with TRU grunge bands , you know bands like Puddle Of Mudd , Nickleback , Theory Of A Deadman , 3 Days Grace , Default and Mudvayne . Go Bengals , 2009 Football Champs , Who-Dey ! !	-1
I bought the Super DeLuxe Edition Box-set and the Legacy Edition CD . I originally bought `` Ten '' the day it came out in 1991 . It 's been one of my all-time favorite records ever since . Pearl Jam released many great songs after this but no collection quite as grand . I 've always been in the fan club and I seen them perform at least 10 times . I 've been proud when they succeeded and supportive when they went up against the man , but I can not follow them down this path . Eighteen years after the initial release there is no good reason to try and make these classic songs sound better . It 's a weakness that all successful bands face but the very best avoid . As an artist I understand the urge but as a fan I 'm let down and slightly offended . Please do not do this with the rest of your catalog . Look at your peers , this kinda thing always ends bad . This will be the last re-mixed CD I buy from you but I 'll try to forgive .	-1
At the beginning of the 1990s , the very time I was moving from childhood to adolescence , there was supposedly a huge makeover of the popular rock scene by which the glam metal that had previously dominated the charts was replaced by a much harder and starker sound that became known as `` grunge '' .In reality , however , the `` grunge '' of the 1990s actually had all the worst aspects of the hair metal of the 1980s , only turned into a new form . Instead of simply overproducing the rhythm section to create an artificially dense drum sound as was typical of such 1980s bands asWhitesnake , grunge turned this overblown sound into harder guitar that people thought was far more emotional and passionate . In fact , when listened to carefully , grunge has as little emotional depth as most hair metal , even though the singers generally sing with a rougher voice.In contrast to the totally noisy - and for me completely unlistenable - sound ofNirvana , Pearl Jam did at times emphasise melody rather than overblowing their sound , at least in their earliest days before the band began to try to hide from the commercial acclaim it had won . This is seen to some affect on `` Alive '' , which even if it does not do anything that previous pop songs did not , still sounds quite heartfelt and energetic . However , the band fails by and large to build on this level of power in the rest of `` Ten '' , wiht the result that on the whole it can not be called a serious success .	-1
right first off a disclaimer i 'm a huge fan of pearl jam i love there second album `` vs '' a classic i just do n't see the point in everyone saying this is the only pearl jam `` grunge '' classic when really is pretty lame affair so they had there foot on the distotion pedal more than there over-rated whiney companions `` nirvana '' but hell it does n't make what they do good , it fact if you had asked me a year ago what album was my favorite by pearl jam i would of said this..but as i grew so did my variety in taste and i went to there second album `` vs '' and dis-regarded this with the other grunge albums `` nevermind '' and `` in uetro '' by nirvanaand i went back to soundgarden 's `` badmotorfinger '' METAL CLASSICalice in chains `` dirt '' drugged up classicso when i next want to listen to peal jam 's `` ten '' i 'll dust of the cobwebs and go back to the radio-friendly ticket master protest	-1
This DVD is a revisionist version of reality . `` Oceans '' has been edited to remove Eddie 's ex-girlfriend 's name and there 's an entire song missing , an amazing rendition of `` Rockin ' In The Free World '' written by Neil Young.So many fans have waited years for this performance to come out on DVD . Thanks for nothing . I 'll stick to my bootleg copy with the TCR timer ; suggest you save your hard earned money and do the same .	-1
I 'm not going to buy the CD again , I already own it . I do want to buy the unplugged DVD , though . Why should I pay for 2 CD 's I do n't want just to get the 1 DVD ? Because the record company wants the higher price . Once the die hards have all bought this 3 disc set , however , the DVD will be released as a single item for $ 10.99 . On that day , I will buy the DVD !	-1
My least favorite Mariah album is by no means her worst . Its just that this is one of those CDs that do n't really cry out to you - `` Play Me ! '' . In fact , other than the single choices here , there is very little that interests me . I would rate it a couple notches higher than her debut album , but for some reason find her debut definitely more interesting than this one . The lead single , `` Emotions '' was a No . 1 single for Mariah on the Billboard Hot 100 , but it was also the only single from the album that made No . 1 . Many Mariah fans consistently list this as one of her best achievements , but I think this is purely for associative reasons , as sonically the album sounds dated and rather generic.My personal favorite track is the timeless `` Ca n't Let Go '' . Despite breaking Mariah 's streak of back-to-back No . 1 singles ( at the time in 1991 , this single stalled at No . 2 ) , it remains one of her finest artistic achievements . The same can be said to a lesser degree of the gospel-R & B ; track `` Make it Happen '' that these days is considered a classic by the gospel-loving community at large . `` If It 's Over '' was another single off the CD ( though it failed to make an impact on radio ) - this song was also better covered by Mariah herself on her `` MTV Unplugged '' CD a few years later.The main problem with this CD is that despite containing ten songs , at least six of them are forgettable , which is not a good thing for any album , let alone one by Mariah . The greatest issue with this is that most of the weak tracks take up the back-end of the CD , and it really sags ( I dare most listeners to sit through the last fifteen minutes of this album without getting really , really bored , or cringing ) . It 's the worst of the Adult Contemporary genre times five , and sounds really dated . Subsequently , I would have to say that Mariah is definitely the kind of singer who could take even this average album to No . 1 , but if you listen to her entire catalog , this album and `` Charmbracelet '' stand out as being less listenable than the others.Two Stars .	-1
The other three reviewers loved this recording , but my own personal response was surprisingly negative ( for a great conductor like Ormandy ) . I just plain did n't like it , and because of it - it was the only recording I had - I did n't really appreciate the symphony either . I *did* learn to love this great symphony when I heard the Eugen Jochum 1964 recording with the the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.Obviously , this is not a music review from an informed critic , but if there is someone out there whose response to the Ormandy was as lukewarm as mine , I can not recommend the Jochum more highly : it is luminous and wonderful . Get it !	-1
Yikes , have n't looked this up but ca n't fathom it running on broadway for more than 100 performances . It is original , will give it that much !	-1
Whatever you do , do n't buy this album . Florence Henderson is so over the top that her performance in this makes her performance in `` The Brady Bunch '' seem like Eugene O'Neill and Jose Ferrer should have been put out to pasture like the dead race horse he seemed to mimic in his singing ( if anyone can call it that ) . And Noel Coward just did n't have it by that time in his life as can be witnessed by his other late show the cloying `` Sail Away '' . Only Tessie O'Shea in an Alfred Dolittle imitation gives this funeral pyre its needed light . I would n't pay 24 cents for this Cowardly frey into self-delusion and self-parody .	-1
This CD can only be described as `` a sonic orgy '' or `` a celebration of sound efects '' . I 'm very disappointed at this compilation . A good example of this cacaphony ( as one reviewer puts it ) is `` This land is your land '' . I have to stop this piece after the first 90 seconds , the orgy then takes effect . The choir , on the other hand , deserves high marks for the songs it seems to have sung countless times , like `` Battle hymn of the republic '' or `` The Star-spangled banner '' . But , as I have said before , the habit they have of adding orchestras and brass choirs is a distraction from the singing . In that way , they may be typically American , where bigger seems to be the equivalent of better . I still love the art they displayed in the LP 'A Mighty Fortress '' . That is the choir at its very best .	-1
This CD has a great selection of songs from a top-notch choir . Unfortunately the instruments are so loud that you ca n't hear the singing .	-1
Tha title says it all . This is strictly for tha kids . It does n't fail at being just that so I guess this album was a success for them . They did have a few tracks on here that transcended age but not enough to pay for . This is a good listen if you wan na take a trip down memory lane though.Notable Tracks : JumpWarm It UpI Missed The Bus	-1
Do n't get me wrong . The Kinks along with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are my all-time favorite rockers . My wife and I even took one of our sons to a Kinks concert -- his first concert ever.But & quot ; Phobia & quot ; is an absolutely terrible CD . I 've had it for a few years now and can not bear to listen to it . Ray Davies ' magic touch is on hiatus . The songs have no melody and the lyrics are weak.If you want to get a more representative example of the Kinks ' great music , buy & quot ; Arthur , or the Decline and Fall of the Britsh Empire , & quot ; & quot ; The Kinks Kronikles , & quot ; or & quot ; Preservation Act I and II. & quot ; But stay away from & quot ; Phobia. & quot ; You 'll thank me in the morning .	-1
Good recordings . Nice songwriting . Not nearly as good as Petra with Greg X Volz . I just ca n't feel it.I have listened to it several times and nothing was captivating to me like with the previous band 's lineup . I prefer the version of `` More Power to Ya '' recorded and released previously . I much prefer any remade songs on here to one 's done by Greg before . This is not personal . I 'm just being honest.I have this item on my shelf and captured it to Apple iCloud . Still , it 's not likely I 'll be listening to it .	-1
I was appalled to find out that , despite including 86 songs in this 4-disc collection , it excludes more than 30 of Mathis ' charted hits , including dozens that made the Top 40.Given that he only had 19 Top 40 hits ( plus another 33 that made the Top 100 ) , it 's appalling that a career-spanning collection like this could leave so much out . To me , for a collection like this , you start with all the A-side hit singles , then add some interesting album tracks , some favorites by the artist , and then sprinkle in some rarities and live performances . And preferably remix the stuff for stereo , when formerly only mono tracks have been released , and the master tapes are available . But to omit nearly 3 dozen charted singles ( many of them Top 40 hits ) is unforgiveable.You got ta wonder who 's running the show at Legacy to screw something up like this .	-1
I bought this mostly because I was interested in this band and the reviews on here made it seem pretty good . I probably should have actually listened to this band first , because this album is pretty boring . I would n't recommend this , it 's pretty tasteless and depressing .	-1
Motorhead 's record company had spent a lot of PR money on Head 's previous cd & quot ; 1916 & quot ; in hope it would break them into the heavy metal mainstream ala Motley Crue , Scorpions etcDespite the quality of & quot ; 1916 & quot ; , it did not happen because Motorhead is too down and dirty for many of the & quot ; poser & quot ; metal guys and girls that supported such mainstream bands in that period.This recording was a final attempt to pay their record company back and save their recording contract.In other words they let record company dictate what was to be played and how it should sound.The result was a lacklustre affair devoid of the Motorhead frenetic energy and crunch that made them a cult act with a devout following.Compared to their other recordings , they sound tired and not really enjoying what they are doing.After this release , they were dropped from their major record label and recorded the brilliant & quot ; Bastards & quot ; on a small record label , which brought back their classic energy and crunchIf there was a 10 rating , I would give it 4/10 only because at least the sound quality is good , unlike some of their other cds , such as & quot ; the Watcher & quot ; where the sound is really a bad bootleg	-1
This group of people suck and any reject thats listening to this stuff is bad I want that dog Zack aka the 15 year old to shut up give the Beatles what you wa n't but do n't diss rap it is just as good as the Beatles.The Beatles will and will forever be over rated even thought they are good and the paper came out last week and said Mc Cartney is the best BeatleI HEARD SOME of this reject crap and said this truly sucks .	-1
omg this is so boring and drepressng it 's like pain of savlation but it 's worse you should listen to real bands like nightwish symphony x dream threatet shadow gahllery vandane plas twitlghting and manowar this is boring and it sucks pluse they do n't shred.also three furries u suck u think ur smrt but u like boring bands like pearl jam and tool u probably like paun of salvation too u should listen to prog it is real thinking musci for real thinking men .	-1
The guys of warrant always said that the lost of their succes was because of the grunge bands ( I ALSO HATE PEARL JAM ) , but this lp is not like & quot ; DRSFR & quot ; and & quot ; Cherrie pie & quot ; . This lp has some good songs , like & quot ; machine gun & quot ; , & quot ; the hole in my wall & quot ; and & quot ; sad teresa & quot ; , but also has horrible songs , such as tracks 3,4 and 7 . SO , LOOK AT YOUR BAND , MAN !	-1
The most apalling thing to me is that I just typed in `` Bach Inventions '' on Amazon.com and this is the first album ... as if there were no other albums to buy . And it makes me even sadder because I spent a whole semester analyzing these , and though my teacher brought out so many wonderful aspects of these inventions , he would then turn and play Glenn Gould , who never articulated any of the points we discussed in class ! I realize that Glenn Gould was a great self-promoter and spoke as if anyone who opposed him was an idiot ( which is a great way to make people think you know more than they do ! ) but in fact , it 's obvious that he never bothered to look at a copy of CPE Bach 's book on keyboard playing , or he 'd be embarrassed at these interpretations . If you want to get more out of these , and really HEAR the interesting ideas in each piece , try Gustav Leonhardt 's recording .	-1
Lots and lots of notes ... ... whenever I listen to Gould 's `` 48 '' that 's the overwhelming experience I get . I happen to think that this is a Bad Thing and that the measure of a great performance of any work is the unequivocal sense of a 'thing '' - a `` one '' rather than a `` many '' . With great playing the individual notes dissolve into a unity ; you do n't attend to them any more as your attention is fixed on the individual entity that they make up en masse . With great playing the piece sounds simple , not complex ; you learn it with ease , not with graft . With great playing you do n't notice the mechanics of the performance ; the piece seems to play itself rather than being performed by an agent.And on all these counts , Gould 's `` 48 '' fails . You hear piano-playing rather than music ; the nuts and bolts of a machine rather than a `` being '' ; the sense of a capricious `` will '' directing the music rather than a surrender to the music 's natural ebb and flow . Gould 's `` 48 '' is brusque , unsentimental , and putatively objective ; he 's obviously trying to purge it of any extra-musical connotations but in doing so he makes it sound as if it 's Bach strained through a Stravinskyan aesthetic . In his hands it lacks Holiness . Gould rarely gives the music time to breathe as he rushes through one prelude after another . When he occasionally slows the relentless pace down he just becomes static ; even when Bach is at his most-communing stillest he has a sense of pulse . And the fugues lack majesty or real cumulative momentum as Gould seems to abandon musical sense to the dictates of textural clarity.Now I 'm aware that for many Gould 's Bach is definitive ; that it 's full of life , clarity , and buoyant optimism . I wonder if they 're confusing clarity of texture with musical clarity , `` life '' with its semblance of mechanical activity , and optimism with an `` ever onwards '' juggernautal haste.If you want Gould rather than Bach get this . If you want Bach rather than Gould I suggest you try Richter instead .	-1
The two sides of the coin : As a musician , I 've learnt that music is a thing such pressured water , it tends to say to our heart how should it sound , even if the interpreter does not deliver the right way , so , we can grasp the original music as it should be played . Beethoven 's music is not the superficial music played here , without ANY heart . Where 's the deepness of Beethoven ? Gould could reduced Beethoven 's music to a mount of fast , precise cascades of notes , that 's Glenn Gould 's way , not as the music should sound , so , my advice , get this recording as a reference , if you already know the Sonatas played by other pianists , such as Alfred Brendel ( he 's a true Beethoven interpreter ) . This Gould here sound mechanic like a Standard Midi file made on computer . Does this man has heart at all ?	-1
The live versions of the UNI years are auful , which happen to be his best songs imho ! This `` greatest hits '' is anything but that ! Skip this one . While a huge fan of ND , the live versions on this CD sound awful do to his voice being ravaged from years of heavy smoking . Too bad . Buy the box set for all this hit in one place plus many cool songs that never made it to the albums . Scotch on the Rocks is a cool song that turned into Love on the Rocks . There is a nifty little ditty that has a typewriter instead of a drum keeping the rhythm . Skip this set and go for the box set In My Lifetime . Worth the cash ! And also Hot August Night . A true milestone in Neil Diamond 's long career .	-1
While I love Diamond 's early work , I was very disappointed to find that almost all of the early songs were live versions that do n't hold up as well as the original studio versions . What 's worse , this fact was n't clearly marked on the CD , and I did n't find out until long after I bought it and was finally able to play it ( I was traveling at the time ) . A couple of other reviewers have hit the nail on the head -- these are n't the songs that we came to know and love as they played on the radio . Diamond is a great performer , but recordings of his performances are n't as strong as the performances themselves . And when we 're talking about extremely strong studio recordings that stuck in your head -- every note -- the live versions sound like poor copies by some Neil Diamond wannabe . This album is a travesty , and it 's NOT a greatest hits album .	-1
Live albums are a bit of a contradiction . If you want to enjoy live music , go to a gig - or at least get a video ! Listening to this and watching the wallpaper is n't much fun.Basically most live albums are there just to help revive the fans ' flagging memories . This is even more true of MIDNIGHT OIL . The charismatic , larger than life , brow-beating presence of Peter Garrett , is reduced , on this album , to a mere voice ... Unless you 've met the man and he made a lasting impression on you , you wo n't really be won over by these songs.The oilers have a cymbal-heavy boppy poppy industrial sound which places you immediately in an Aussie mining camp somewhere in the Western Desert , which is where you do n't want to be unless you 've got a truck-load of Fosters or Castlemaine XXXX . Sometimes the music even starts to boogie - like at the start of 'Pwderworks , ' until the words come crashing in and impose their own monotonous rhythm - and sometimes it just gets turgid as it tries to keep up with the far flung sentiments of St. Peter ( Garrett ) 's shiny dome . 'Dreamworld ' a fey , hippy-ish melody that grows a hard jangly edge , and the expansive 'Beds Are Burning ' come out best.We get songs about politics , pesticide and pollution , and very little about the humanity these things concern . Pete , why could n't you have thrown in a few songs about babes and pina coladas ?	-1
I hate rap and pop music , and much of the other stuff is too mellow for me . But I do enjoy the Cult 's song , and I am a pretty big Ozzy fan as well . But the song that really makes this album shine is closing number `` Light Comes Out Of Black '' by the metalgod himself , Rob Halford . The song is very reminiscent of Priest in their Painkiller era . Overall , get this , burn the Halford song onto a CD , then sell it .	-1
I 'm sorry even though Neil is one of the Giants of Rock and Pop ; his christmas renditions on thisalbum are awful . He murders White Christmas and Santa Claus is coming to town . Some people are meant to do a christmas album but Mr. Diamond is not one of them . His Ego got the best of him by recording this album .	-1
Anybody remember CCR 's `` Pendulum '' ? Tired of hearing his sidemen complain that they wanted to do `` their thing '' Fogarty went ahead and let them do it , thus creating the album referred to as `` Fogarty 's Revenge '' . It sounds like something similar must have happened here , because as brilliant an artist as McLaughlin is , this recording is little short of embarrassing . Any other explanation begs the question `` Did anyone imagine that ` Planetary Citizen ' would be a hit ? '' Believe it : Mac was just playing the good sideman , sitting back and letting Armstrong dig his own grave . Narada Michael Walden 's contributions at least had their moments ; `` The Way of the Pilgrim '' is pretty good , and his vocals on `` Gita '' and `` In My Life '' ( not the Lennon-McCartney standard ) are n't bad . The less said about `` River of My Heart '' the better.And if you 're letting your sidemen commit artistic suicide , there 's little point in wasting your own best work to try and pick them up . So McLaughlin uses `` his time '' on this album to play around with some kind of `` pitch-to-voltage converter '' device that he perhaps did n't have complete control over yet . The results are certainly far-out enough ( check out Inner Worlds Pts . 1 & 2 ) but not especially melodic . Okay , so `` All in the Family '' is pretty good , as is `` Lotus Feet '' , but these compositions still are n't nearly up to Mahavishnu standards for this period.Maybe the biggest failure of this outing is that it does n't have a coherent band sound . Mac is all over the place , perhaps searching for new directions , perhaps just not caring , and while Walden tries to stay in character , Armstrong 's funk is heavy-handed and completely out in left field . When the early Mahavishnu got funky , they did it in 7/4 or something crazy like that ( and still managed to get you groovin ' ) . Is it really possible that Johnny Mac was so disgusted with his sidemen that he intentionally let them put out a sub-standard album ? Decide for yourself . But let 's point out that after this release , McLaughlin renounced his Mahavishnu-ship and started a career as a solo artist .	-1
The vinyl re-issue of this simply sounds bad . I expected more from these guys . This is a great album on CD and I 'm not quite sure how they managed to bungle the vinyl reissue so badly . I really wish I did n't have to write a 1-star review for this . It 's easy to find plenty reviews speaking to what a great album this is , and it is , just not the vinyl reissue .	-1
Jeez , these guys are obviously HUGE fans of the Urban Dance Squad ; In fact so much that Mr. Morello memorized almost every of their riffs from his coke trips to Amsterdam . Too bad he had to saddle them with juvenile political rants from some disgruntled chicano who got beat up as a kid by his white boy neighborhood .	-1
this is awful material ! the songs tell about justice ! the riffs are quite Ok but i would like to have more intelligent lyrics like slayer 's ! ! !	-1
Ah , Rage Against The Machine , the foundres of rap metal . If ever there was a title which should never be celebrated , this makes for a strong contender . Here , my friends , is the album which , along with Korn 's debut , is virtually solely resposible for the total mangling of metal during the 1990s . Yep , you heard me . `` Rage Against The Machine '' is ABYSMAL.The music Rage Against The Machine have to offer on their debut is crude beyond belief . Guitar and bass playing mostly consists of ugly , amelodic , childishly simplistic riffs churned out in maddeningly repetitive rhythms . These are so utterly unmemorable , so unimaginative , so utterly devoid of anything whatsoever which makes music worth listening to that I ca n't help but wonder who the hell is buying this ? Almost to add insult to injury , sometimes at the start of a song we 'll hear a slightly touching melody or a riff with a trace of passion , only for it to be utterly obliterated after about ten seconds by more banal slop , lacking any momentum . Honestly , after 52 minutes of this I wanted to end my misery and make the song `` Bullet In The Head '' a reality . It is n't even the lack of technicality that kills this album - one of my favourite albums is Bathory 's `` Hammerheart , '' one of the least technical albums ever written . The long and the short of it is this : the riffs on `` Rage Against The Machine '' are just simply badly written . Hell , they 're just BAD , period.It does n't help that RATM fail to think outside the box in the songwriting department either . Indeed , the traditional verse/chorus cycle is not deviated from in the slightest . The upper limit of the intricacy demonstrated is when the guitar and the bass begin trading lines ... that 's it . The fact that the likes of this is hailed as genius by so many I find to be a blatant insult towards bans who try to make at least some of their songs original and interesting . Even Poison The Well , who I attributed as incompetant songwriters in a previous review , at least TRY to integrate something different into their song structures once in a while.Let 's talk about speed , shall we ? Oh , wait what 's that again ? I seem to have forgotten after listening to 10 tracks of mid-tempo , energy-derived crap . This can be largely put down to the fact that the drummer ( seemingly solely reliant on the bass and snare drums and a single crash cymbal - I repeat : unimaginative ) never varies from simplistic eighth-note rhythms , the double bass peddle nowhere to be seen . The fact that the guitar work seldom ventures into up tempo regions , let alone shredding , is n't exactly much consolation . `` Rage Against The Machine '' is cited by so many to be a passionate and furious album . I , on the other hand , had to stick on `` Death Is Certain ( Life Is Not ) '' by Dark Angel after three tracks , simply to remind myself what a true musical expression of passion and fury sounds like lest this stuff leech my soul out through my ears.And then we come to the vocals . Zack Delarocha , on this album , prooves definitively that rapping is an abomination and should be banned from the face of the Earth . The last thing this already appalling composition requires is his incessant whining over the top . No , it gets worse ; incessant whining WHICH DOES N'T EVEN SYNCHRONISE WITH THE MUSIC . When it gets to his screaming parts , I ca n't help but notice his voice sits ludicrously high in the mix ; probably a failed attempt to disguise the fact that he sounds prepubescant . Christ , once or twice we 're even treated to hearing his voice crack ! The only - and I mean ONLY - redeeming feature of this album is Tom Morello 's solos . While these break no new ground , contrary to what the fans may have us believe , they are in keeping with the tone of the music , satisfyingly technical and even - god forbid ! - pleasant to listen to . We can only be thankful that now he 's with Audioslave , a band who are at least half-decent and where his talent can find fertile soil.However , not even Morello 's skill can save this monstrosity . To all of Rage Against The Machine 's , I beg you ; there is a whole world of passionate , well written , innovative music out there which does more than just sloppily tack two or three other styles together , throw in some angry lyrics and call itself revolutionary . As Delarocha is heard to claim on the track `` Fistful Of Steel , '' `` Sometimes silence makes me sick . '' My only answer to that is ; `` What a pity . ''	-1
Now when I first heard that the Manhattan Transfer came out with their Christmas album , I was hoping to hear some jazzy upbeat songs . When I heard most of the album , I was very disappointed . Many of the songs they sing are too slow or somber -- especially & quot ; Let It Snow & quot ; . They sing mostly traditional Christmas songs with little or no variety -- which after five minutes of listening to , it put me to sleep . Very much set in stone . Shame on you , MT ! I was really looking forward to some & quot ; swingin'and singin ' & quot ; tunes . This holiday album did not meet my expectations .	-1
Can the songwriter of The Lion Sleeps Tonight still sue Billy Joel for plagarism on that crap song River of Dreams ? It 's all about soul ? she dumped you dude.Ouch .	-1
This CD was a Big Seller upon it 's release in 1992 , boasting a Plethora of Big Hits , along with some New Songs . Looking back through 2005 Eyelids , it 's hard to hear why these songs were so Huge ... .The CD starts off well , with Hits from the Primitive Love Album , but as One keeps listening , He realizes that None of these songs have Passion or Depth , a few catchy Melodies and Pleasant , if Plain Vocals . The Dance Numbers at least keep You awake , but the Years 1988-92 found Estefan leaning on Ballads , and One was barely distinguishable from another ; on top of that , the 4 New Cuts feel like padding , to fill a CD 's worth of material for a Christmastime Release ... a Couple of Hits are missing , too ( i.e. , Bad Boys ) , so to summarize , Nothing truly Bad here , but precious little on Target ... .	-1
Here we have it : a retrospective of a hit factory featuring one of the most untalented singers ever to dominate the charts . Estefan 's voice is severely limited in range and power . She would never have passed an audition for even the local church choir . He talented producer husband is solely responsible for her success as she lacks a voice , is only average looking , can barely dance , and is easily upstaged by any other female singer that she appears with ( her singing with other & quot ; divas & quot ; shows how limited her talent is to an embarassing degree ) . So what is it about this era that allows people without talent to rise to the top ? I think it is the incredible synthetic production technology available that can make a star out of anyone . Remember the old disco single , & quot ; More , More More & quot ; ? The producer on that one took a frog voiced porn star and gave her a number one hit with plenty of help from the control dials . On her follow up he eliminated her voice completely and just used her name . Think the audio equivalent of digital special effects . There is no stopping a decent , catchy melody , however , and not even Estefan 's thin little straining voice could keep some of these numbers off the charts . ANYONE could have sung these and made them hits . Estefan brings nothing to them as her voice has nothing to add .	-1
I usually like PJ . This is so forgettable , I have forgotten which tracks are which . I liked Ten , as it had the more memorable songs . But this ? It 's more filler , which has four good songs , the rest being forgettable . & quot ; Rearviewmirror & quot ; happens to be my favorite of the tracks on this album , giving it the credit . & quot ; Daugher & quot ; is one of the other good songs , and these two were the only ones good enough for that extra star . But they did prove me that they could do better . My one-star is saved for No Code , despite a cool album cover.Back to Vs. this album is for hard-core PJ fans/grunge fans or people who like attention span music . Not that I do n't listen to attention span music , but I just did n't like it . Look at the other reviews , you 'll prolly agree with those .	-1
I was very dissapointed in Vedder when I heard this album . It got me the feeling that I know I 'm not a Pearl Jam fan and will never be a hardcore fan of them . I could n't listen to this album at all . The songs all sound terrible ( for me , at least that is. ) . It also has some terrible acoustic tracks on this that I could n't take . Sorry , but for me , this is simply a waste of money.However , I still LOVE Daughter the best and I wish I could go back and give it an extra star because it 's a ten-star song from a one-star album .	-1
I was really disappointed in this version of Black Market Clash . The songs that were added do n't measure up . They water down what was one of the Clash 's best efforts . I have to search to find the jems . Stick with the original Black Market Clash . You 'll love it ! I think they messed with the mix too . Sound quality is weak !	-1
I enjoy Dylan , but this album is incredibly BAD . The Jewish kid from Minnesota does his best to sound like an aged Negro blues man from the Delta , but just sounds like a toothless drunk singing with a clothes-pin over his nose . This is hilariously awful , but judging from all the positive reviews , it just goes to show yet again that once you 've reached the pinnacle , _anything_you produce will be met with general acclamation , no matter how far your talent has degraded .	-1
It was just the last Saturday when I decided to listen this so well commented album ; but I must confess the disillusion was pitifully over my hopes . Horowitz played a percussive Scarlatti overshadowing the nave expression and the angelical mood immersed in these miniatures , on the other hand the excess of staccatos and the thundering fingering definitively wrecked any possibility of incorporeal lyricism.A true shame ! Recommended only for the hard fans of Vlada .	-1
I do n't know what the inspiration behind a big-band Monk record was . Commercial greed ? Nah . This came out in 1968 , remember ? If Monk was in it for the money , he would 've jumped on with the fusion bandwagon , which would just be creepy . Need to try something new ? Well , Monk had already pioneered jazz beforehand . His producer being a moron ? Yeah , sure , sounds good . As I alluded to before , this is Monk with a big-band . Arranged by Oliver Nelson , who was best remembered for arranging TV themes . Do you see where this is going ? To bad-idea hell , that 's where ! Probably just to prove he was the one in charge , Teo `` I 'm the boss and you 're my mindless minions ! Bwahaha ... '' Marceo wrote and contributed a couple of the worst tracks ( `` Just a Glance at Love '' ; `` Consecutive Seconds '' ) , though Monk can be blamed for a couple of the originals as well ( overcooked pastrami like `` Reflections '' and `` Little Rootie Tootie '' ; `` Monk 's Point '' , which has none ) . And what 's up with these rerecordings of Monk 's old classics ? `` Straight , No Chaser '' may have started off promising , but it ends up as a bunch of clich & eacute ; d , lifeless horn blasts ; `` Let 's Cool One '' sounds like it could have been performed by a crooner , like Bing Crosby or whatever ; `` Trinkle Tinkle '' is an idiotic , disgraceful mutation . The one song I enjoy is `` Brilliant Corners '' , which is given a swinging , enjoyable rendition : elsewhere , this is easily Monk 's worst . You may get it by accident because you have it confused with Monk 's Dream or Monk 's Music . Try not to .	-1
Perhaps my expectations were too high , or perhaps it 's the feeling you get when one day you realize that you 've fallen out of love -- but this album made me very sad to listen to , it did n't move me at all as her earlier albums had done . The Precious One was , after all , flesh and blood . And either out of ideas or out of her depth considering this was produced by Ms. Bush . `` The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same / you 're not to blame . ''	-1
`` Rise '' is a textbook case of former members of a group using the name of their now-defunct band to cash in on that name . If some members of Bad Brains wanted to record an album without founding members ( of course most notably HR ) they have every right to . It 's when they use that beloved band 's NAME to promote the product that fraud has been perpetrated on their fans . After Ian Curtis ' suicide the surviving band members continued to record with the NEW name New Order . That is simple ethics . If they recorded under the name Joy Division without Ian Curtis that would have been less than righteous.Besides the questionable morality here , the music on this album just is not very good . At all . Stay away . There are many great `` real '' Bad Brains albums out there to enjoy . To name a few , try `` Bad Brains '' , `` Banned In D.C. '' , `` I Against I '' or `` Black Dot '' .	-1
please do not buy this . she has a great voice , but the only song worth anything on here is the 'i know what you 're doing ' single ... .	-1
No its not them its me from sampling this bull ! @ # $ ! ! ! I wouldnt buy this if it came with a Peurto Rican Chick that the only word she knew in English was Yes or if Bush helped the Gas Prices Go Down ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Do Not Buy Dont Listen To YO	-1
Do n't waste your time on this one . It was one of their early cds from when they still had n't perfected their songwriting craft . It 's really just a bunch of screaming and noise . It makes a gg allin record sound like Emerson Lake and Palmer by comparison . If you want to hear some good aerosmith I recommend Get A Grip or the Armageddon soundtrack , so you can experience the classics like `` I Do n't Wan na Miss a thing '' and `` Crazy Amazing Crying Crazy '' If there was a zero stars rating , believe me this worthless album would get it . I want my 12 dollars back steve perry ! > : (	-1
Like many other reviewers , the band was in decline on this batch . The record starts off strong with the gritty Title Track and I Wan na Know Why ( probably the best track on the collection ) . However , afterwards its very much hit and miss with more of the miss quality . Kings And Queens is fairly creative at elast with some noteworthy piano , strings , and Tylers best vocal performance on the record . Get It Up is a cool track but the rest is mediocre or even abysmal . Choose Toys in The Attic or a compilation isntead .	-1
This release drew the line for me with Aerosmith . There music on this and the following material up to date contain complete chaos . Aerosmith lost their rhythmn they once possessed on the prior four cds that were all five-star efforts . This album along with the latter day Aerosmith stuff is just noisey as far as I am concerned . I have the first four releases ( Aeromsith , Get Your Wings , Toys in the Attic and Rocks all 5***** ) , but they no longer impress me except maybe for a track here and there . Or maybe I am just old !	-1
This is n't there best of . It is n't anywhere near it . WHy did they even make a best of that early in their carrer . This has good songs but it is n't worth the money . Buy `` Oh Yea : Aerosmith 's Biggest Hits '' or something with more songs because this is n't veryfullfilling with only 10 songs and some suck . They do a cover for Come Together originally by the beatles and it 's terrible.2 best songs : Last Child & Sweet Emotion2 worst Songs : Come Together & Kings and Queens	-1
Great songs , but , come on ! this is a Greatest Hits CD , and theres 37 minutes of music ... There should be at least 15 songs on here . Not 10 . Yeah , theres classics on here , Dream on , Same Old Song and Dance , Walk This Way , Remember ( Walking in the sand ) , and a good Beatles cover of Come Together . But I 'm reviewing the CD . Not enough songs . Look for other Best Of Aerosmith 's .	-1
Not only is this Aerosmith 's worst release , it 's one of the worst cds of all time . The production , playing , songwritig , singing , and anything having to do with cd , is horrible . This was the first Aerosmith cd ( record ) I ever bpought . I would not touch Aerosmith with a 10 foot pole for years to come . Luckly PUMP caught my attention when it came out , and I started buying their stuff . I have even listened to the cd , thinking maybe it was the record that made it sound bad , NOPE .	-1
Times were hard for Aerosmith . But what matter when you buy an album is if you like the songs or not . I do n't care if the badn members wer overdosing , if the record company was putting pressure on them , if the members are gay ... I just do n't care.And , as for the music on the album , oh boy , Aerosmith had the talent to produce anything better than this [ stuff ] , even without Perry and Whitford on board . Just it .	-1
Aerosmith 's live CD , & quot ; Classics live & quot ; is okay , but it needs a different style than just that Aerorock . I guess that 's what you 'd expect .	-1
This is the better of the series , but that is n't saying much , considering poor playing , poor production , and poor track selection on & quot ; Classics Live 1. & quot ; A couple of the usual suspects are here ( & quot ; Back in the Saddle , & quot ; & quot ; Walk This Way & quot ; ) , but the interesting stuff is Joe Perry 's & quot ; Let the Music Do The Talking & quot ; and the first Tyler-Perry collaboration ( and one of Aerosmith 's best songs to date ) & quot ; Movin ' Out. & quot ; But even so , & quot ; Classics Live 2 & quot ; is almost as dull as the first . Overall : 4 out of 10 .	-1
Sorry , but no big deal here , other than good professional musicians . Halford suely tried to & quot ; modernize & quot ; his sound and wrote some intelligent lyrics , but the great ammount of aggressions is lost due to bad vocals . No wonder FIGHT lasted so few .	-1
This review written by Harold Rome was a very disappointing recording . The satire of the songs did not have the punch they might have had . The music was forgettable and the performances were adequate .	-1
Not sure what happened here ... these guys had such momentum with their second album , and its as if someone stole their mojo . Its no surprise that this genre died out to grunge , because all the good bands of this era started to lose their edge . Sad really , Id rather have bought something else .	-1
I bought this CD on a whim , figuring `` with these musicians , it ca n't be bad ! '' Well , it can.The biggest and most readily apparent problem is Stoltzman 's clarinet playing . He gets so carried away in the more dramatic passages of this music that he throws restraint to the wind ; he plays so aggressively in some sections , and with such shrill tone , that I occasionally cringe to listen to it.As for Ax and Ma , while their playing is perfectly good , they seem to have become infected by Stoltzman 's rambunctiousness and at times the whole thing sounds like a three-way ego contest . Surely there must be better recordings of these pieces available . ( Apparently , this recording won the 1996 Grammy for best chamber performance . Just goes to show that the Grammys have a lot more to do with whose name is on the cover than what 's actually on the record . )	-1
When I listen to this cd , it seems to me that I am listening to the same song all the time . There ai n't no subtilities in this music.We ca n't say that the signer sings , I would say that he cry out loud.This music is dedicated to those who are frustrated and I am not.If you like rock mixed with rap , you will love it but I did n't .	-1
It seems like Jeff Buckley attempts to sound like a crossing between Elton John , Gary Moore , Montserrat Caball & eacute ; and Muse , with a twist of progrock.He does not succeed in any of those attempts.His very little voice - whining and weeping , turning to distorted screaming during the refrains - is only partly compensated by the all but original acoustic guitar play , and only little more by the progrock inspired drums and electric guitars.Therefore , Jeff Buckley is at his best when he does n't sing.But he does . So ... The only OK song on 'Grace ' is the final 'Dream Brother ' . And still , it is only OK , not exactly brilliant .	-1
Only one word can describe this album -- Atrocious . Jeff Buckley ? ? Ha -- more like Jeff Suckley .	-1
Got this cd based on the song Hallelujah and everyone giving it such great reviews . Let me just say I am completely disappointed . I listened to it twice to give it the benefit of the doubt and found there are are only 2 or 3 songs I would ever wan na hear on this album ever again .	-1
I like Harry Connick 's voice quite a bit , and I think he 's a very talented musician , but with this album , I had to question his taste . I was prepared to love it , but one after another of the arrangements just proved too annoying for repeated listening . After one Christmas season with this CD , I ended up selling it at a yard sale . In other words , even if you like Harry Connick , you might not be so fond of this work .	-1
I love Celine Dion 's music . Even though Mariah Carey is my all-time favorite I still love Celine 's incredible voice . However she does have her misses ... like this album . I am a huge fan of her Self-titled , `` Falling Into You '' and `` Let 's Talk About Love '' albums . Unfortuantely I did n't enjoy this . It did n't seem like it was from the heart . it seemed like it was made for mass appeal like her debut album . The only songs I really liked was `` The Power of Love '' -- one of her best singles . I 'm being VERY generous for giving this 2 stars . The only reason I 'm doing it is because of the `` Power of Love . '' I 'd reccomend `` Celine Dion '' , `` Falling Into You '' or `` Let 's Talk About Love '' over this anyday . D-	-1
C & eacute ; line did not do well with this album . Nearly all of its songs are bland and nonemotional . They have no energy or feeling to them . The only good songs on this album are & quot ; The Power Of Love & quot ; , & quot ; Misled & quot ; , and & quot ; When I Fall In Love & quot ; . The album is definitely not worth buying unless you are obsessed with C & eacute ; line , as I am .	-1
The name of a song by a truly & quot ; progressive & quot ; band , Hatfield and the North , clearly states , to me , what this band is all about , & quot ; Rifferama & quot ; . Echolyn , although talented musicians , come from the & quot ; more is more & quot ; school of prog , the more notes and time changes , the better . I fortunately grew out of that phase but it seems as though Echolyn has not , according to this CD . I 've heard it stated that , & quot ; complex time changes and fast riffs draw a listener in but melody makes them want to stay and come back time and time again & quot ; . Hopefully , on their next outing , Echolyn will take that into consideration . To add ... although , once again , quite capable musicians , there was nothing about their music that was original or & quot ; progressive & quot ; . Bands like Van Der Graaf , King Crimson , Yes , Tull , etc . all developed a very unique sound , either by instrumentation , vocals , writing and/or a combination of all but the new wave of & quot ; prog & quot ; bands have n't done that making them less than & quot ; progressive & quot ; . Echolyn needs to re-examine/reinvent themselves so they may become a truly & quot ; progressive & quot ; band .	-1
For me the immediate musical connection I make with the film Philadelphia is that it features ( in the party scene at the 74 minute mark ) a genuine live performance by the gay male acapella group The Flirtations - starring the remarkably gifted singer/songwriter/composer Michael Callen . They sang their very camp arrangement of `` Mr Sandman '' , which I 'm happy to own on their truly brilliant CD album which was recorded in 1992 ( and released in 1994 ) : `` The Flirtations Live : Out on the Road '' The Flirtations Live : Out on the Road . I believe that it is simply and blatantly a massive wrongdoing for the soundtrack album of Hollywood 's first major gay-themed film to have excluded this openly gay group , who were not only supremely talented musicians , but also vital gay community activists . Michael Callen died in 1993 ( the year of the film 's release ) from AIDS related illness . He was open and honest about being HIV positive and maintained a high profile among ACTUP ( AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power ) activists who demanded government action on drug research and hastened availability . Michael was also a pioneer proponent of the concept of `` safe sex '' through condom use in order to limit the spread of HIV.There 's a 4th February 1994 Entertainment Weekly article by Melina Gerosa ( in their issue # 208 ) in which she writes : `` If you enjoyed the 30 seconds of a cappella singing during the party scene in Jonathan Demme 's Philadelphia , do n't rush out and buy the soundtrack album . The group seen in the film is the Flirtations , and their campy , customized cover of `` Mister Sandman '' -- with revised lyrics that include `` Give him two legs like Greg Louganis/But make him public about his gayness '' -- is available only on their album Live : Out on the Road ( Flirt Records ) .While the all-gay vocal group may not share space on the Philadelphia CD with Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young , head Flirt Jon Arterton says the group is getting mainstream attention . ''We 're attracting more and more straight and & 'homosexually challenged ' people every day , '' Arterton , 48 , says . That includes director Demme , who saw one of the Flirtations ' posters while filming in Philly . ''I thought , 'A gay a cappella group ? ' '' recalls Demme . ' '' We got ta have 'em . ' '' The fivesome -- Arterton , Cliff Townsend , Aurelio Font , Jimmy Rutland , and Michael Callen ( author of 1990 's best-selling Surviving AIDS ) -- formed in New York in 1988 , but their big break did n't come until 1991 , when National Public Radio began playing their first album , The Flirtations . The network was swamped with would-be fans , who were directed to the only places you can find their albums : progressive and gay bookstores ( and select Tower outlets ) . Later that year , on Donahue , the group serenaded the first televised gay wedding.Being excluded from the soundtrack album was a disappointment ( `` We kept waiting , but they never asked , '' says Arterton ) , but the Flirts have since faced a much graver loss : the AIDS-related death last December 27 of Callen . ''I wish he could have seen the film , '' says Arterton , who notes that the group has no plans to replace its beloved soprano . ''He was such a media whore -- it would have been very like him to dish it . ''Today , 16th October 2013 , 20 years since the release of the film and the death of Michael Callen , I 've just viewed the newly arrived Blu-Ray edition of Philadelphia and I 'm happy to report that it looks and sounds magnificent - but I wo n't be bothering with the drastically incomplete and inadequate soundtrack CD .	-1
Just a few minutes ago i wrote a review of STP 's `` Core '' , where i mentioned something about cherishing songs for all your days to come . This is a pure example of an album that i will cherish for all my life.It is simply amazing , mind-blowing , breath taking , you name it . All of it 's songs are excellent . Starting off with `` Rotten apple '' , a very , very beautiful song that has those amazing vocal harmonies between Layne and Jerry and a true sense of intimacy . My favourite ! ! Then , there 's `` Nutshell '' , also very beautiful and giving you a mixed feeling . You can feel both happy for it 's beauty as well as sad because it is truly a `` preety-sad '' song . `` I stay away '' reminds me of good times spent in a place in Lisboa called `` Bairro Alto '' , where me and my friends used to hang out and there was this joint that played this album over and over . So this song always reminds me of those great summer nights spent there having loads of fun , preety much s***faced but for those who know the place , you know that 's the feeling . And for me it 's the optimistic `` lift up '' of the album ! `` No Excuses '' is probably the most known song of them all , but that does n't take away the credit that it has for being an awesome song . Hypnotic as only Alice in Chains knew how to make'em . `` Whale and wasp '' is a very curious song , because i picture it as a wave of light , with peaks and falls . The funny thing is that i relate the peaks to the wasps and the falls to the whales . If you listen to it , see if any of this makes sense ... '' Do n't follow '' is to me the weakest song of the album , because it is very much clean cut , without that depressive edge that AIC gave to their songs . But it is still a great tune , although from all the 7 it is probably the one i would skip . The lyrics also feel like `` Over now '' , a statement of Jerry 's feelings towards Layne 's addiction , and that 's where the true value of the song is . `` Swing on this '' sounds a bit like `` Hey guys , are n't you tired of nice songs ? '' `` Yeah , let 's do something weird and agonizing again ! '' `` YEAHH ! ! '' . Again , those criptic harmonies and the sense of heroin on the lyrics , plus a faster pace make it a sore goodbye for the album . Very good , especially the chorus and it 's cynicism . `` Let me be , i 'm alright/Ca n't you see , i 'm just fine/Little skinny , okay/ I 'm asleep anyway ! '' . The whole song sounds like a reply to `` Do n't follow '' I wo n't reccomend this album for the fans , because i believe they have it ( and i was lucky enough to get `` Jar of flies '' and `` Sap '' in the same pack ! ) I reccomend this album for all who like good music . This is great music . And sadly it seems that i rated this as a 1 , when i wanted to rate it as a 5 !	-1
I purchased all of Larsin 's releases ... this past week , to add to my collection . This is a tired sleeper , even for a child . I removed it from my collection . As far as her other c d 's , they are ok ... .but nothing really stands out , or hooks you . Lotta Love , is the winner . If you were to buy just one c d ... I think her Best Hits would be your best bet . Love her vocals , always have . She just never found a formula that would work for her .	-1
`` Pinocchio '' was surely considered impressive at it 's time of release ( 1940 ) by critics and the audiences alike ; however , in present day it looks outdated and goofy compared to the recent advances in animation that are created by Pixar . Like Pinocchio , `` Illmatic '' is nothing but novelty , and only nostalgic to businessmen who are in their 40s by now . With outdated social issues taking prevalence in most of the songs , one can only feel relieved at how far rap has come since this album was released ! Lil ' Wayne , Nicki Minaj , Black Eyed Peas and Eminem have thankfully revived this once dead genre , so I suggest that everyone gets with the times and listen to those talented folks instead.P.S : Where are all the lyrics about hoez ? Uuugh .	-1
I 've been an ST fan for 20 years so it pains me to admit that I do n't care for this album . The only song I would say is & # 34 ; good & # 34 ; is & # 34 ; Do n't Give a F*** . ST tries to do something different on every album , which appreciate and respect ; sometimes it works and sometimes it does n't . SFL , for the most part , feels over-thought and tired to me . This album is not a representation of what ST is capable of so DO NOT get this as your first ST album . ( Of course , if you are already a fan then you 're going to probably buy this no matter what anyone says so whatever ... ) .Not recommended .	-1
Oh come on Luther . For someone with such a voice , such an angelic , thick as honey and smooth as silk voice ... why must you resort to this madness ? This is BENEATH you , Luther , this endless droning on as you just barely do justice to these & quot ; timeless & quot ; classics ... and do n't you KNOW Luther ? Do n't you KNOW that everyone else in the world has done this before you ? Is there such a dearth of originality in your production camp that THIS is the only thing you could come up with ? Spare us . Go back to the drawing table ; try and find A House Is Not A Home somewhere in the endless , blank sheets ... ENOUGH . This album is just not good . Not good at all . What 's become of you , my friend ?	-1
The interest here lies more in the ideas behind these pieces than their actual execution . Take the symphony for 100 metronomes . One hundred metronomes are wound up and then allowed to wind down until they all are silent . The 19 minutes here of that are unlistenable-it is nothing more than maddening tick-tocking with no interesting occurences either by chance or design . The pieces for barrel organ and player piano are played at incredible speeds-but to no purpose whatsoever . This sort of playfulness may have been amusing to Ligeti at the time but to the listener it is not at all entertaining . This is one of those experimental music albums that you listen to once and then put away forever .	-1
I must add a word of dissent to the other reviews . Aside from the more abstract Dance Rhapsody 2 which is quite good , Ormandy has little sympathy for the Delius idiom . The slow section of In a Summer Garden is insensitive at this fast tempo , and phrasing is stiff and unyielding in the other works . Ormandy favors thick , pasty sounds , and revels not in the potential for Delius magic . This is certainly not a Delius recording I would recommend . although the VW is decently done .	-1
This this ... oh wow words dont describe it ... its just horrible he makes Bocelli look like a real opera singer ...	-1

This is great for people that suffer from insomnia . If you want to hear to a great instrumental soundtrack , listen to the on from the movie & quot ; The Big Blue & quot ; .	-1
This collection contains too much filler and does n't sound so good . My advice : Buy the original albums . Secret Treaties and Agents of Fortune are my personal favorites , but several others contain good material . The biggest problem with Blue Oyster Cult is that , after 1976 , their material was uneven . Godzilla is a great tune , but Spectres is not a great album . And so on . Although this collection contains a lot of fine stuff , it 's difficult to recommend . A better starting point for the novice would be the albums listed above . Verified fans will probably want a more inclusive , better sounding collection .	-1
Waters without Gilmour is melody-free and as mean-spirited as they come . Conversely , Gilmour without Waters is brain-dead and tedious . This record is vastly overproduced and under-composed . Somewhere along the line Gilmour even lost his beautiful guitar tone , and traded it in for a sterile-sounding roar . It 's hard for me to tell one song from another on this record ; the only emotion I feel is a vague sense of relief when Gilmour stops singing the dreadful lyrics he and his girlfriend concocted to bridge the gaps between aimless meanderings . Roger Waters was n't the Pink Floyd , but this is proof that David Gilmour is n't the Floyd either . Just bloated , brainless corporate rock , as psychedelic as Quaker 's Oatmeal and a lot less interesting .	-1
It 's not bad , but it 's not Pink Floyd and that bothers many . I 'd much rather hear Gilmour 's solo albums than this bombastic self parody . I believe they did this and the tour to pay for Nick Masons Jaguar collection and Dave 's barge studio expenses . So The big deal here was Rick was now a full time member , whoopie ! He should have been he only co-founded the original group	-1
Some may argue that Pink Floyd without Roger Waters , is a bit like Beatles without John Lennon . Some unkind souls might even suggest that it 's a bit like Beatles without John or Paul . Without its erstwhile bass player and chief wordsmith , this is music without its former intellectual edge , bite and urgency . What 's left ? Sleek musicianship , a hip brand and a reassuringly expensive , car-stereo-friendly sound.The Division Bell has its moments and David Gilmour can still work the magic with his guitar . But the thing is , without Waters ' artistic vision and wit to provide a thematic backbone , the resultant music is comes across as mere sheen and veneer . To me this sounds more like a David Gilmour solo album than a Pink Floyd work.Musically the band retreads old ground on much of the album . On Cluster , it 's back to Wish You Were Here and the group tries to breath new life into the atmospheric intro formula of Shine On You ... part 1 . On 'What Do You Want From Me ? ' we revisit Dark Side of the Moon territory , completely with gospel backing vocals , trademark guitar solo & agrave ; la Time . David Gilmour handles guitar and vocal duties with aplomb but the package is bathed in so much reverb that the group sounds like it 's playing down the far end of the Grand Canyon.On Take it Back , Pink Floyd come on like a cross between U2 and Dire Straits , while on Great Day for Freedom tired imagery and a pedestrian melody remind us once again how important Mr . Waters was the formula.High Hopes probably constitutes the quality core of this record , an impressive dirge that captures the spirit of Comfortably Numb , though even this song is let down by a tediously repetitive middle section.To sum up , this record sounds big and expensive and sold in bucketloads , but for me , it lacks the substance and inventiveness to satisfy the 'serious ' Pink Floyd fan.On a final note , many of the five star reviews here seem to be simple marketing input . There 's a word for it but I forget what it is .	-1
Take some `` Wall '' -like guitar plucking , some `` Shine On '' tubular guitar noodling , a bevy of `` Dark Side of the Moon '' chorus girls , stir it up with some reunion-with Roger Waters rumor mongering , and what have you got ? That 's right , get out your headphones , it 's the `` new '' one from Pink Floyd ( or more reverently , `` Floyd '' ) . In yet another example of the blatant formula gouging these guys have resorted to in order to keep the `` Floyd '' myth alive , and to further fatten their bank accounts , this lumbering behemoth is more than just a Floydian slip . Equal parts formula and rehash , `` The Division Bell '' is even more exploitative of the `` Floyd '' thing than it 's patently derivative predecessor ... what the hell was it called ... something Floydian with another great cover . The covers are always great . Part of the `` Floyd '' thing . And with the passing of Strom Thurgeson , these guys are really up s*** 's creek . But hey , let 's face it , Pink Floyd has always been perceived as a great band to do good drugs by . And while good drugs and innovative music still go hand in hand , not since `` Animals '' or , arguably , `` The Wall '' , have these guys breached any new ground convincingly . And that 's forgivable enough , for at the end of the day , every band is selling their schtick , and a band 's sound becomes their aural identity . But just imagine the fate of a new unsigned band trying to get over with this old bag of tricks . Pink Floyd used to get away with it because they usually delivered something new and interesting , love it or hate it . So in 1994 , the goofy sound effects , the English voice monologue , the overused back-up singers , etc. , all the perceived Midas touches all hark back to the cash cow of their career , `` Dark Side of the Moon '' . For anyone who remembers the experimental hits and misses of earliest Pink Floyd , after these architectural school dropouts deserted the only real musician in the band , Syd Barret , who put them on the map , ( then replaced him with another real musician , Gilmore ) , then found worldwide success making records about how Syd lost his mind , it 's easy to see why Roger chose the path he did , despite his interminable `` Wall '' rehashes . What has become lamentable in his wake is the awesome waste of talent and the sound arsenal of Gilmore and Floydco.Notice how there 's no song review yet ? Well that 's because you 've already heard these songs in previous , sometimes several previous incarnations . Not only do these songs sound lazily conceived , you got ta wonder just how lazy the Floyd CEO 's themselves are . For over twenty years Pink Floyd operated as a four piece live and in the studio , with maybe a guest singer here , a sax player there , but here there are enough extra players listed to constitute a corporate merger . You got ta wonder , who 's playing what ? One option is to get the DVD of the tour which should be titled , `` The Exquisite Scent of Money '' .Nope , `` Arnold Layne '' or `` Astronomy Domine '' this ai n't . It ai n't `` Sheep '' , it ai n't even no `` Final Cut '' . This is borderline New Age from clever mythologists with alotta juice at the label . And the label knows there are enough sheep out there to plug into this `` new '' disc to cover everyone 's mortgage , including the eight or nine extra Floyds . For an alternative Floyd fix , or at least curious speculation as to what `` Floyd '' might have sounded like in the 90 's , check out Levitation , or anything from The Church . It ai n't Floyd either , but it 's a helluva lot closer to what `` Floyd '' set out to do before falling into their own trap.Here was a chance for post-Waters Floyd to establish themselves as a freshly creative force for the 90 's , and at the same time debunk Roger 's charges of selling out the soul of Pink Floyd . Instead , we 've got `` The Division Bell '' . Plod on , you lazy slackers .	-1
They call the wind Mariah and this obnoxious set of holiday flatulence is proof positive of that.This disc clumsily fluctuates between second-rate Phil Spector and gospel music with equally poor results . Well Mariah is no Ronnie Spector and she 's certainly no Mahalia Jackson , but that does n't stop her from giving in to her werewolf-like `` howl at the moon '' tendencies whenever she opens her mouth.Still , this shrill CD sold millions and gets played to death on the radio and in grocery and department stores everywhere , which only goes to show that there 's no accounting for people 's taste ( or much hope for us as a species , either ) .	-1
It 's easy to hate Christmas songs as they are played-to-death each season . But , `` All I want for Christmas is You '' is one of the worst . It ranks down there with `` Santa Baby '' , and its infamy owes as much to its stale genre as it does to Ms. Carey 's singing style . I mean , she 's great for the dance floor , but Christmas music should not sound bootylicious .	-1
Oh my gosh ... .. The thin raspy weak Mariah is singing again ! This album is sure a let-down to all mankind ... If you thought Christina 's Christmas Album was horrible , wait till you hear this one . Celine Dion , Whitney Houston , Madonna , Kylie Minogue ; Faye , Claire and Lisa of Steps ; Andrea of The Corrs have MUCH richer and fuller voice than hers , so pls , if you think her voice is good , it 's time for you to go for some BASIC vocal training to help you filter out artists like Mariah ...	-1
My taste in action : I thought this was on the sleepy side . Let 's face it , the No . 4 has real drive andboldness . Lacking here .

Its not on the same level as Walter with the Columbia.I wish the eventual new owner of the Sony catelogue ( M Jackson is selling his Sony holdings ) will re-release the complete Columbia SO in the last 6.See my recviews on Mozart , Bohm , Walter , MackerrasAt times I give the nod to Walter , times to Bohm.I guess overall I prefer the Bohm/Berlin set . This conclusion based on todays comapre of the sym 40 . April 15,2006.PaulEDIT : I recall as I listen to the clips , its not on the level as with the Columbia . I had this walter/New York on vinyl yrs ago.Sony for some reason will not rerelease the Columbia in the last 3 syms .	-1
Bessie Smith is victim of a great deal of overheated praise by a small circle of devoted fans . When enough people yell , `` Fire ! '' I want to check it out to see if I am missing out on some great music . Well , I have listened to these recordings and was unmoved . I find the blues musically repetitious - three chords , a seventh chord here and there , the same structure over and over and over . This pattern becomes easy to mock because every blues song sounds like every other blues song . The complex innovations and inventiveness of Jazz and better rock melody composers ( Lennon/McCartney , etc ) are totally missing here . Bessie could sing loudly but I do n't think that she could sing well . Her brassiness and vulgarity might be appropriate in a brothel but I am not interested in hearing a woman singing how she wants a `` hot dog in her roll . '' Keep your urges in the bedroom , Ms. Smith , if you please . Sex is the absolute lowest common denominator in humanity and unless you can present it in a refreshingly witty and elegant way ( Hello , Cole Porter ) , I do n't want to hear or see you in heat . I can watch my dog act the same way for free.Monotonic , dreary , wailing and screeching : welcome to Bessie Smith .	-1
This is what happens when you have complete control of your music making but do n't actually have any musical ideas . Davis was the epitome of self absorbtion and should be most famous for his opinion that `` white players ca n't play on the beat , they 're always behind it . '' And while apologists like Herbie Hancock might claim Davis did n't turn his back on the audience , `` he was conducting the band . '' It 's kind of hard to conduct when you 're simultaneously playing your trumpet with your eyes closed . Maybe if his music equalled his legend then it would be easier to accept excuses for him .	-1
how can someone enjoy the horn when all through EVERY song this constant bass thumping , boom boo boo boom boom boo boom boo boom boom boom boo boo boom STUPID ! that is a stand up bass thats doing that , right ? or is it my uneducated jazz earsNow Sketches of Spain CD . thats what its all about . some bass , but its minimal and in the background , not dominating the songs	-1
I have a Super Audio CD player and I love the format . But I got this DualDisc as a present and was willing to give it a go since I 've always wanted `` Kind of Blue '' on a high resolution format.First of all , Dual Discs are NOT a high resolution sound format ! The DVD side 's sound is merely Dolby Digital or PCM encoded information and no better than any soundtrack on a feature film that is released on DVD ! And the sampling rates are very very similar to CD anyway ! You basically get a two sided disc that HOPEFULLY works on one of your players.As I said , I own a SACD player , a rather expensive Denon that also plays DVD-Audio mind you . And it ca n't read the CD side of ANY dual discs because Dual Discs do n't conform to CD standards . But it will play the DVD side just fine . But what is the point ? If you 're not going to invest in a SACD player than buy the regular remastered Audio CD version.Also , I 've had no problems with copy protection software because I used a program called CD-EX to get my bought music onto my iPod which can rip anything ! Download it !	-1
This band just made the great deal issuing two major hits : `` Say It Is n't So '' and `` Your Love '' .Both songs are included in this album . But beware : Some extra songs and 'new ' hits just recorded in Mono . Most of them are just stuffing material ... Dissapointing !	-1
Released : May 1995 Produced by : TotoWere 1/2 stars available , this would rate a 2-1/2 . Choppy , overlong and ballad-laden follow-up to Kingdom Of Desire , once again released on an indy label in US . Notable for accomplished Simon Philips ' studio debut as drummer . After promising opener `` Gift of Faith '' ( press `` next '' at 5:30 to avoid one of the most repetitive pointless outtros ever ) , kind of lulls listener with mid-tempo tracks that range from good ( `` I Will Remember , '' `` Slipped Away '' ) to simply not bad ( `` You Belong To Me , '' `` The Turning Point '' ) -- until you realize you 're half asleep by track 8 . David Paich lead vocal meter : 1/2 song . Highlights : groovy `` Time Is The Enemy , '' shredding `` Drag Him To The Roof , '' infectious ballad `` The Road Goes On , '' and jazz-fusion ripper `` Dave 's Gone Skiing '' ( whew ! ) . Can be programmed into a much more effective album simply by avoiding about 5 songs . Additional vocals by Jenny Douglas-McRae and John James , who toured with band to curtail loss of Kimball and Williams vocal range . Aficionados only .	-1
The wonderful , multi-racial CHAMBERS BROTHERS are yet another example of the shameful way in which the major companies can treat a great musical heritage : Former band members have been in litigation against Columbia Records and its parent company , Sony for more than two decades now . Like many other artists of the 60s , the CHAMBERS have apparently not seen a dime from Columbia for many , many years.All the while , Sony/Columbia has been repackaging CHAMBERS BROTHERS product in a bitpiece way since the advent of the cd format : one morsel here , another scrap there ! After ( commendably , surprisingly ) re-releasing `` The Time Has Come '' with bonus tracks in 2000 , no further material has been forthcoming ; instead , fans are being treated to shoddy-at-best re-issues that often overlap - this `` best of '' collection being just another example of such heartless business policy . It is highly doubtful that former band members have seen any of Sony/Columbia ` s cd sales profits diverted their way ... Meanwhile , none of the Columbia-era CHAMBERS BROTHERS albums ( save the first , as mentioned ) are currently in print : Used cd copies of `` Love , Peace and Happiness '' , which was licensed by Columbia to GNP/Crescendo in the 90s sell on the internet for upwards of $ 100 ... and all the while , former members of this great psychedelic relic most likely have to scrape together a livelihood.My personal experience with this fine vocal group BTW contrasts markedly with the stingy corporate policies I just described : My ( then- ) girlfriend and I saw the CHAMBERS BROTHERS play a small L.A. club at the very tail-end of their career , in 1984 . They performed in front of an audience of perhaps 5-10 patrons ( ! ) .The CHAMBERS BROTHERS worked their way through material spanning their whole ( even then ! ) mighty 25-year career - and they played their hearts out for 90 minutes in a display of pure professionalism : An experience I will not forget.Oh yeah , right , `` hearts '' : You people at corporate headquarters wouldn ` t know what I ` m talking about , now would you ?	-1
I had n't listened to this for years , but lately I 've been getting out my old LP 's and checking them out . I was surprised at how bland this recording is . & quot ; Birdland & quot ; is one perky tune , sure , but the rest sounds so generic . My wife said it reminded her of John Klemmer . The advent of Jaco Pastorius was the beginning of the end for this band . He was a truly gifted bassist , but his musical ideas were nothing more than run-of-the-mill . Once Wayne Shorter decided to spend the rest of his career coasting , Zawinul and Pastorius took the band into increasingly dull directions . & quot ; Heavy Weather & quot ; does n't stand up over time .	-1
The first album with McGuinn and all sidemen . It shows . The Byrds name really should have been put to rest before this , in fact , this is closer to Clarence White 's `` Nashvlle West '' group than it is the Byrds . ; the songwriting is poor , in fact only two songs , `` King Apathy '' and `` Bad Night at the Whiskey '' are up to any Byrds standards.The cover material is weak , and the 2 movie songs are just as bad , in spite of some nice guitar work by White . `` Drug Store ... '' now sounds contrived and foolish , and the closing medley is just plain awful.The audio on this cd , while a bit better than the original lp , is still terrible ; McGuinn 's guitar is inaudible most of the time , the drums and bass are muddy , and there 's just an overall muddy sloopy feel to the sound , totally unlike previous lps which had stellar production.Maybe a better producer would have made them come up with better material as well . Bassist John York has stated he 'd like to go back and remaster this ; it would n't hurt , at least soundwise.Save your money , but the first 5 Byrds albums.You wo n't be sorry . This is only recommended for diehards .	-1
Word was the Byrds were distancing themselves from the slick folk-rock formula that had made them pop stars , and were into something different , something funkier , like `` Music From Big Pink '' by the Band ; like Bob Dylan , loose and electrified as on `` Highway 61 Revisited '' and `` Blonde on Blonde '' ; and with Dylan 's producer , Bob Johnston , turning the dials.Funkier Byrds ? Why not ? Chris Hillman , the last of the original Byrds ( besides McGuinn ) , had checked out , replaced by John York . Clarence White had already replaced the departed Gram Parson , and Gene Parsons had replaced Kevin Kelley who had replaced Michael Clarke . The Byrds were a new band . Why not pursue a new musical direction ? Imagine how it must have been : after all the arguments and fights with David Crosby ; and having to re-record several of the vocals on `` Sweetheart of the Rodeo '' to offset Gram Parsons ' dominance . The relief McGuinn must have felt making an album and not being challenged at every turn . Bliss ! The new Byrds went into the studio , and did it McGuinn 's way . And McGuinn in turn , trusted Bob Johnston completely with production . Same with the album artwork . McGuinn had the concept and trusted the creative guys at Columbia to get the cover right . `` I trust everything will turn out all right , '' McGuinn used to say.Not this time . Imagine McGuinn 's disappointment . The sound mix Johnston produced was not at all what McGuinn had in mind , and the album cover missed the mark completely . And then there was the single , `` Lay Lady Lay '' sounding like some gospel group with an all-girl choir , yet another of Johnson 's bad ideas . Was this really the Byrds ? McGuinn said he liked the new Byrds ' album . What else was he going to say to the press ? Years later , however , it was a different story . He admitted he 'd been bitterly disappointment with `` Dr. Byrds and Mr . Hyde . '' The song selection was n't the best , and the singing sounded rough and not at all like the Byrds . The only consolation was the showcasing of Clarence White 's flawless flat-picking . Johnston got that much right . Next time , McGuinn would call in Terry Melcher and restore the Byrds ' sound . Next time . Luckily , Columbia Records still had faith in the Byrds ' franchise and there would be a next time.In hindsight , `` Dr. Byrds and Mr. Hyde '' was yet another bad career choice , after the equally bad career choice to go all country with `` Sweetheart of the Rodeo . '' The critics may have applauded the changes , but the critics do n't pay the bills . The kids who buy the records pay the bills , and they were n't impressed in the slightest ( instead , they were standing in line to buy `` Crosby , Stills and Nash '' ) .	-1
I 'd long been led to expect that this was a dog 's dinner of an album , at least as far as Byrds albums go . While not quite that poor , this is absolutely not any place to get an introduction to The Byrds . However , if you know what came before , it makes some kind of sense after a couple of plays and a bit of supplementary reading . While leagues short of the kind of ecleticism that characterised the Beatles ' White Album , the dual proto-heavy rock and country rock at least makes an intriguing listen , but the album ultimately fails to deliver a lasting impression.The lighter 'Mr . Hyde ' songs are generally stronger , particularly Old Blue , a traditional song given a Byrds arrangement with some wonderful picking by Clarence White , which is a genius turn of running order , tucked in on the heels of a rather turgid proto-heavy rock run through of one of Dylan 's lesser songs , This Wheel 's on Fire . The final two cuts of the orginal LP , Bad Night at the Whiskey and Medley are also heavy turgid filler to my ears , but feel free to disagree.Three songs , the best of which is King Apathy III , combine the two styles - although the others , Child of the Universe and Candy , are far less effective . But ultimately even King Apathy 's ode to quitting the city for the simple country life is far less effective than Neil Young 's identically-themed 'Here we are in the years ' from the same year.Of the bonus tracks , only the alternate take of This Wheel 's on Fire and a pleasant-enough version of Dylan 's Lay Lady Lay add anything to the experience . Some other reviewers here will tell you this is a full-on five-star album , but in truth it 's for committed Byrds fans only and is best listened to only once you 're familiar with the first 6 albums .	-1
time out is great ... the rest of cd is garbage ... . dave brubeck is a one hit wonder ... the rest of his music gives you a head-ache	-1
Here 's a great example of an album that has not withstood the test of time , indeed , it 's odd to recall how controversial it was when it was released . Herbie Hancock is a monster by any measure , a prodigy who emerged as a major player in the Miles Davis quintet and solo works like the unforgettable Maiden Voyage . He seemed to enjoy controversy ; with Davis he was on the frontier , flirting with something exciting , neither fish nor fowl , neither jazz nor rock , ultimately dubbed fusion . Years later , he tried to kluge fusion and funk with Head Hunters . The album was fabulously successful ; the sales numbers were unthinkable for a jazz album . But then , it was n't even close to being a jazz album , and not a fusion album either . As a funk album it barely has enough energy to get out of bed , if it played the Apollo Theater it would get boo-ed off the stage in under three minutes . What it does have is inoffensive catchiness ; Hancock decided to strike up the bland . These days , the music one hears while waiting to visit the dentist is more interesting than this .	-1
I 'm beginning to think that the mastering engineers and producers at Mobile Fidelity have only one ear ! Why would they release a stereo album from 1975 in Mono on SACD no less ? ! This is not some pre-stereo mono recording . It never was released on LP in mono . I do n't get it . Yes , we know all about the `` back to mono '' camp , but this is going too far ... .	-1
I 'm going to get a lot of angry comments for this review , but I have to say it . This album is awful . I bought it as the two-disk vinyl version and it sits , lonely and unplayed , in my record cabinet . This was my introduction to Miles ; luckily , a good friend gave me his jazz collection a few years later and I was shocked to discover that Miles really was a genius , just like I 'd been told . Compare this to Miles Ahead or 7 Steps to Heaven-I do n't hear any beauty , any real music in any of this . Miles deserves credit for having the guts to perform this , but it just did n't work . It 's hard to believe this is the same musician as the one who worked with Gil Evans or John Coltrane .	-1
The CD is OK. & # 34 ; The Best of the Capitol/Blue Note Years & # 34 ; is a much better CD . & # 34 ; Cookin with the Miles Davis Quintet & # 34 ; is also better .	-1
Davis plays some of the best trumpet of his career , the arrangements and orchestration are impressive , the sound is impeccable , but with the exception of Track 5 `` Solea , '' it just does n't swing . The nod to Spanish classical music might have looked good on the charts , but of Davis 's collaborations with Gil Evans , this one I can do without .	-1
Old and great fans of Billie Holiday , but this sound track is scratchy ... ..voice sounds bad , as if the singer is attempting to relive the golden years , but the voice is just not up to it . Did not enjoy listening , and could not even listen to the entire CD it was of such poor quality .	-1
Notorious Byrd Brothers is a great record , though as Mr Goodwin notes , the recording is kind of muddy . I bought this SACD recording on Mr Goodwin 's recommendation . He will not want to meet me for a few weeks . The Mobile Fidelity SACD issue is frankly no better in any way than the Columbia Legacy stereo mix . And if you can hear any difference between the mono and Stereo mixes , then you are concentrating 100 % on every note being played , and probably being victimized by your imagination . The cover says the record is SACD . So you should expect a better quality of sound on SACD equipment . NOPE . That is not what you get . On my SACD Pioneer player , the `` SACD '' sound is no better than the Columbia Legacy issue . A mono mix that is really the same as the stereo . And a sound that SACD did not improve . And an attractive cover . That is what you get when you buy this .	-1
One of my favorite Byrds albums . However this reissue , like so many reissues , loses all of the tone of the original album . This was a groundbreaking album in some respects , one of which was the use of brass on a country rock album . Unfortunately on this reissue all you can hear on some songs is the brass . Horrible remix . I 'm afraid this is another great old album that is lost forever in the remix/remaster machine .	-1
So he sang some simple blues songs and played his simple guitar licks and died young . And thus begins the pattern that if you die young your importance and talent become magnified far beyond what it would have been had he lived another 20 years and drank himself into obscurity . Forget the hype and get real .	-1
I 'll admit , I like `` Shame '' and `` What Do I Have to Do ? but the rest of the album is pretty much filler and useless to me . Industrial ? Heck no ! I would n't lump Stabbing Westward with the likes of the late KMFDM , Razed In Black , the Electric Hellfire Club and Frontline Assembly . Pseudo industrial bands like Stabbing Westward and Gravity Kills give industrial music a band reputation with their poor attempts at sounding hard and angst ridden . Stabbing Westward would be eaten alive and spit out if they ever crossed the path of real industrial bands such as the Electric Hellfire Club .	-1
Da Brat may go down in history as one of the greatest female emcee 's in history , but that does n't mean I have to like her . This is a great CD production wise , but lyrically it is wack . She has a nice flow though . NOT RECOMMENDED .	-1
I got this CD as a freebie from Columbia House many years ago . I listened to it , was very disappointed , and I threw it away . Her remakes of Vickie Sue Robinson 's & quot ; Turn The Beat Around & quot ; and & quot ; Everlasting Love & quot ; along with other slow ballads were among some of the CHEESIEST remakes I 've ever heard . Hey , the cheesier , the better , I guess . That is why I 'm not a big fan of remakes now these days . I prefer the original .	-1
Gloria takes some classic songs from the 60 's and 70 's and sings them her own way . Bah ! For the most part , most of those songs were better as originally song . I think I only enjoyed 2 or 3 songs on this disc .	-1
I bought this CD for the song It 's Too Late . Had I realized that the whole CD was all remakes I would n't have purchased it . Most of the arrangements are disappointing and not even as good as the originals . Although , I like a lot of Gloria 's music this CD will be taken to the used CD shop my next trip . Do n't waste your money on this one ! ! !	-1
The worst thing a publisher can do is put together a compilation that makes you think you 've heard it all - fine - but unfortunately does n't leave you wanting to hear more . This compilation does n't really aim at the potential fan of his music , and instead aims a little lower , for the broad market . The result is not as satisfying as it should be , and worth skipping entirely ( as are most compilations ) . Fortunately The Real Deal : Greatest Hits 2 makes up for it . Check it out instead for the best possible introduction to Stevie Ray Vaughan 's music on one CD - it 's excellent . Needless to say , if you then want to hear more , check out the original albums . Or , you could just start there instead .	-1
To get truncated works in such an expensive collection is a waste of money . Go for sets by established artists and begin to enjoy the works in their entirety . Many of these sets go for far less then this movie soundtrack and are valuable for presenting the complete works as Beethoven intended . One can not pay homage to a master composer by deciding to play unrelated snippets of their works . Particularly when the works are put together as complete units with the unique genius of Beethoven . You may as well listen to Beethoven with ocean sounds as this . I did a quick search on Beethoven in amazon and these titles came up immediately : Beethoven : Symphonien Nos . 5 & amp ; 7 / Kleiber , Vienna PO -- Ludwig van Beethoven ( Composer ) , et al ; Audio CD Beethoven : 9 Symphonies , Overtures / Bernstein , Vienna PO -- Ludwig van Beethoven ( Composer ) , et al ; Audio CD Beethoven : The 9th Symphony / Solti , Chicago SO & amp ; Chorus -- Ludwig van Beethoven ( Composer ) , et al ; Audio CD Beethoven : The Piano Concertos / Ashkenazy , Solti -- Ludwig van Beethoven ( Composer ) , et al ; Audio CD Artur Rubinstein - Beethoven : Piano Sonatas - Moonlight , etc -- Ludwig van Beethoven ( Composer ) , Artur Rubinstein ( Performer ) ; Audio CD.All of these , accept the complete 9 Symphony set , cost less then this CD . Even that however , is a bargain at 56 dollars for 9 complete Symphonies . Do yourself a favor and get a complete recording of any of the works you enjoy . You will then go on to purchase more .	-1
For all practical purposes , Neil Diamond is a legend in the music business . With over 30 years of music under his belt , Neil built a reputation from delivering lots of emotion with his vocals and being one incredible songwriter . By the time 1994 , Neil did not have the selling power for his albums that he had during the peak of his career . However , Neil was still a major force when he came to live performances . Much of Neil still being a force was because the power and emotion he brings to his music translates well . In 1994 , Neil released `` Live in America '' . This was a live double CD from his 1992-93 World Tour that was in support of his `` Lovescape '' and `` Up on the Roof '' albums ( actually most of the tracks are in support of `` Up on the Roof '' as 25 of the 32 tracks fall between 11/2/93-12/21/93 ) . The bad news is - this CD really does n't live up to the expectations one would expect from a Neil Diamond CD - and in fact disappoints . Unfortunately , since this is a Neil Diamond produced CD - and this is Neil Diamond 's performance , Neil must take most of the blame for the product that has been produced.The premise of the `` Live in America '' CD is that it is not actually a live concert . Instead , 32 of the `` best '' performances that Neil did during that World Tour are assembled together . They are ordered in virtually the same order that they were sung during the concert , but they are not from one show . This is a big negative in my book right out of the gate . Artists who usually try to put together a `` best of '' consisting of live performances from different shows usually do not produce a good product . A Live Album has so much more power when it is a live recording from a single night . In recent years , artists such as Rush ( `` Rush in Rio '' ) , The Bee Gees ( `` One Night Only '' ) and Fleetwood Mac ( `` The Dance '' ) have struck gold because they have released a live recording of a concert from a single night . By capturing the magic in a single night , there is so much better continuity in the concert and really makes for something special . On `` Live in America '' , the selections are taken from 26 separate nights spread over 17 different cities . While it might seem like a good idea on paper , the continuity of the concert really suffers . What makes things worse is that on each of the 32 tracks , there is a fade in and fade out of the crowd - this makes it seem like there are 32 separate tracks . Plus there is no feel for the encore , etc.There is another problem with this CD . Neil just does n't sound as good as I would expect . Neil has got a terrific voice , but the power of his voice just does n't carry out very well . Neil 's singing sounds like `` talking '' on many of the tracks . On the tracks where he is actually singing , it does sound like that Father Time has caught up with him . To his credit , despite the poor vocals by Neil the power and the emotion is still there . It would have sounded so much better if he had some solid harmonies around it.There are some good points in the collection . Neil 's performance of `` Red Red Wine '' is very interesting . Neil decides to do a reggae version in honor of UB40 . He pays tribute to UB40 for taking it to # 1 and has some fun in doing the reggae version . Although I probably would have rather heard Neil 's version - the UB40 version does make for something different . Neil also does a couple great duets with some of the background vocalists in the band . The duets of `` Hooked on the Memory of You '' ( with Linda Press ) and `` You Do n't Bring Me Flowers '' ( with Raven Kane ) are outstanding . The versions of `` Cherry Cherry '' ( the guitar is terrific at the beginning ) and `` Heartlight '' ( I like the vocals ) are very good as well . Since much of the Tour was recorded during the holiday season of 1993 , Neil includes three songs in tribute to the holiday season . These songs are : `` Missa '' , `` Soolaimon '' , and `` Holly Holy '' . These three songs are included as the first three tracks of the second CD.Another good point is that there is a horn section that toured with Neil and many songs include the horn section . Apparently this is something new because Neil asks the crowd to give a `` warm welcome to our new horn section '' just before `` I 'm a Believer '' . `` I 'm a Believer '' and `` Sweet Caroline '' are two of those songs that Neil seems to `` talk '' through , but it is the horn section that probably saves both of these songs . The horns are also used on what I think is one of the strongest tracks delivered on this CD by Neil - `` River Deep , Mountain High '' . This is an old Ike and Tina Turner song and Neil switches the lyrics slightly to come from the `` male point of view '' . Neil 's version is terrific - especially live . The horns really add a lot to this track as well.Finally , on the positive side are the liner notes . There is a fold-out booklet included that contains the liner notes . The liner notes do n't include the lyrics , but lyrics are n't typically included on live collections . Credits for the band as well as all of the tour and production personnel are included . The date when each track was recorded as well as the location where it was recorded from are included . The songwriting credits for each of the tracks are listed . Neil includes a short personnel note on the making of the CD . Unfortunately the liner notes do n't do enough to save this collection . The deep Neil Diamond fan will like this collection , but for someone looking to get some of Neil 's greatest hits , I recommend going elsewhere .	-1
`` Lady Marmalade : The Best of Patti and Labelle '' is a 1995 chronological collection of 16 Epic recordings , 8 by Labelle ( tracks 1-8 , 1974-1976 ) and 8 from Patti LaBelle 's early solo career ( tracks 9-16 , 1977-1980 ) .The songs included here are good , but the legacy of the group Labelle deserves better . For a real collection of Labelle hits , see `` Something Silver '' a collection of songs taken from their first three albums , released 1971-1973 on Warner Bros. and RCA.Labelle is Patti LaBelle , Nona Hendryx , and Sarah Dash .	-1
I really wanted to like this recording when I bought it because I was , at the time anyway , fond of the cast of singers . I had high expectations , of course , for James Morris , Deborah Voigt and Ben Heppner . The supporting cast is quite excellent , Birgitta Svend & eacute ; n , her gorgeous mezzo/contralto too rarely caught on recording or film , was a great attraction . And Paul Groves and Jan-Hendrik Rootering are both fine singers . So why did I hate this recording from the first time I heard it ? In a name , James Levine . I do n't know what makes this man kill off the energy the way he does in Wagner . I 've heard him do marvelous Wagner , always at Bayreuth , but when he 's in New York it 's as if he goes into some sort of trance . He conducts this Holl & auml ; nder as if he were conducting Simon Boccanegra . Levine has always excelled at Verdi and I have several of his recordings of that composer 's works , but Wagner , it 's more miss than hit.This recording starts off very well . The Sony sound is splendid , capturing the Metropolitan Opera much more richly than DGG ever did , and creating a believably `` live '' sound . The overture is full of heavy swells and deadly undertows . Levine opts for his favorite ponderous approach and it works , in this part of the opera anyway . Then things start to unravel . James Morris is in Wotan-mode voice here and it is more the pity that he was not partnered by a peppier conductor . As it is he sounds totally at sea , pardon the pun , and simply shouts and grumbles , it 's impressive shouting and grumbling but the Dutchman 's angst is nowhere in sight . There are some vulgar orchestra balances with which the singers have to contend , as if Levine thought that having certain instruments bray and honk a little on certain phrases would add dramatic effect when all they do is emphasize the strangeness of his aural conception.The real trouble begins with the womens chorus prior to Senta 's Ballade . The Met chorus was notorious for its preponderance of hammy wobblers . Things have since improved , but at the time of this recording the women of the Met chorus were at their very worst , all vying with each other as unrecognized divas with individual wobblers standing out from the ensemble in a very amateurish manner . Levine takes this scene too slowly , over-emphasizing the 'hick ' essence of these Nordic dames at their spinning wheels . There is no energy at all . Then Senta begins at the slowest tempo I 've ever heard in the Ballade . It 's horrible , and Deborah Voigt sings in a completely stentorian manner , as if she were really Isolde in Act I of that opera . There is nothing introspective or neurotic ( both hallmarks of Senta 's persona ) in Voigt 's impersonation . She is a diva showing off , that 's all . And it 's boring and maddening . Levine indulges her in her every whim , dragging the tempo down until there is no momentum at all and the listeners mind goes THUD ! Ben Heppner has found a Wagner role that suits him . Erik is not the voice killer that killed Heppner 's voice , like Tristan and Siegfried . He sings beautifully here and fits in like a finger in glove with the shallow show-off nature of the event.I wo n't belabor the rest of the performance because it gets no better . I have sadly had to relegate this set to the donation bin for the local University radio station annual yard sale . This was a recording that should have been made somewhere else by Sony , with a different conductor . This recording was a sad waste of time , talent and money , yet for the deathless army of Levine lovers he can do no wrong and they can not really hear what is going on in this production.I 'd give it one star if it were n't for the good contributions of 5 of the 6 singers and the superb engineering . As it is it falls into the middle with all the other sad mediocrities that come spewing out of the recording companies , loaded with big name stars and no souls.The Dohnanyi recording of this opera is the one to have if you require modern up-to-date sound . His cast is splendid and the Vienna Philharmonic and State Opera Chorus have this music in their blood .	-1
Self-indulgence and over-indulgence go hand-in-hand with this poorly recorded relic `` Carlos Santana & Buddy Miles ! Live ! '' Hearing this recording again recently , I winced at how bad it sounds . In truth , this one was never a favorite of mine , and now the meandering , pointless jamming , slipshod playing , and all-around poor quality of the recording render it a relic.Perhaps the musicians enjoyed cranking out some tunes inside a dormant volcano while enjoying some of nature 's finest highs , but the novelty does not translate to a pleasant experience for the listener in any setting . I would grant it two stars for historical value but hope I never actually have to listen to this sprawling mess again .	-1
What is this ? I would n't call this a Santana album . It lacks that spritual fire that penetrates the mind and heart and takes you higher and higher and deeper and deeper . It lacks the visual quality that is so present on his major projects . It does n't have the lyrical quality . That `` put your hands together '' ; `` every body say yeah '' ; `` every body stand up '' does n't do it for me . All that audience participation is corny and a coverup for a very poor performance . Evil Ways sounds like a poor cover band version of the song.This is not a good album .	-1
As a diehard completist Kansas fan who had every other album except Drastic Measures ( at the time ) I got this and soon wished I had n't . This is a terrible album that sounds very unlike Kansas and which set the stage for Steinhardt to leave , for Livgren to become a passenger and for the outright awfulness that was to bestow itself in the next album Drastic Measures.With key man Steve Walsh gone , the strange choice of John Elefante joined the band and added songs ( many co written with non-band member and brother Dino ) which were simply 80 's pop-chic and utterly unlike Kansas . The sound just does n't mix with the existing band , even though by this point Livgren seems uninspired and going through the motions as does the soon to leave Steinhardt.Only two tracks , both written by Livgren , esccape my axe . Play The Game Tonight and Crossfire , although far from Kansas classics , they are decent songs which do n't deserve to be dragged down by the rest of this awful album.One wonders why they simply did n't label this John Elefante 's solo album with contributors Livgren et al as that is really what it is . Although far from good this album is n't as bad as Drastic Measures which followed and which was almost entirely Elefante 's album . Both are for completists only.Not recommended .	-1
This widely despised recording actually reminds me of another widely scorned recording - Indian War Whoop - by an equally influential group of musicians , the Holy Modal Rounders . When I first heard Indian War Whoop , a record apparently recorded while the musicians were tripping heavily on LSD , it was unlistenable , and I regretted buying it . But , with later listens , it sort of grew on me . I do n't listen to it often , but when I do , I recognize a real musical core.So too with this mess of a record . It 's really not the Clash , but there are a core of halfway decent songs . It 's not a great record by any means , but not nearly as bad as many would suggest . I suppose , though , that it deserves to be seen as a footnote to the Clash 's , and Joe Strummer 's , otherwise fine musical careers.I could really do without the drum machines , both here , and just about everywhere ( with perhaps a few exceptions , such as Nine Inch Nails , Ministry , and a handful of techno acts ) .	-1
When great bands die they often die in a horribly protracted manner producing albums like this . It is the worst Kansas album bar none.With Steve Walsh and Robbie Steinhardt gone and Kerry Livgrin about to leave and assuming the role of a passenger on this album it really should n't be classed as a Kansas album at all - 75 % of the songs are written by the Elefante Bros , who admitted at the time it was really their album.And that is the problem . Its just not Kansas . The album is truly awful and as much as I 'd like to write something positive about it the only thing I think I could say in that direction is that thankfully they never made another album with the Elefante Brothers.Despite some reviewers here who rate this album up there with Leftoverture there really is no sense beating around the bush - if you like Kansas then you most probably will hate this . Its as simple as that . It sounds nothing like Kansas and is even worse than the preceding Vinyl Confessions album . The best way to describe it is as sounding like a poor man 's version of The Cars - I really ca n't think of a closer comparison.As a diehard Kansas fan and as someone who is n't a great fan of 80 's pop-chic I hated this album from start to finish - even Fight Fire With Fire which the band retain in their live set to this day . With the 3 main protagonists and 2 songwriters of the band gone or twiddling their thumbs on the sidelines it should be obvious to anyone that the unique sound this band had is gone , gone , gone to be replaced by something completely alien . Yes this sound will have its fans but most Kansas fans will certainly not be counted amongst them.Gone are Walsh 's soaring vocals and keyboard viruosity . Gone are Robbie Steinhardt 's vocals and trademark Kansas violin . And gone in body if not in soul is lead guitarist Kerry Livgrin who is left as a passenger on this album penning contributions to just 3 tracks . The remainder are all penned by one or both of the Elefante brothers.Why this made it to the vinyl press as a Kansas album at all is a mystery to me - it is clearly an Elefante brothers album , and as they have made albums of their own it really seems odd to label it any differently.This album may appeal to some - listen to *all* the track snippets above - but if you loved classic Kansas with its soaring vocals , sizzling keyboards , frenetic bluegrass violing and fantastic rock guitar riffs then this album is not for you . This is completely unlike classics such as Song For America , Icarus Borne On Wings Of Steel , The Wall , Carry On Wayward Son , Dust In The Wind etc . If you are looking for sounds like those then look elsewhere.If you like The cars then this album is probably worth 2* but as a Kansas album it only merits 1*.This is an album for Kansas completists only.Recommendation to avoid .	-1
KANSAS ' DRASTIC MEASURES is a prime example of style over substance . While technically proficient , the songs for the most part are curiously empty and easy to forget . MEASURES also does n't really seem like Kansas . Branching out is not unusual or detrimental but losing your core identity can be risky.New frontman John Elefante obviously dominates MEASURES , both as lead vocalist and composer . Although Kansas vet Kerry Livgren shows up , none of his earlier influence is evident . FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE is the best song and a passionate reminder of how good Kansas could be . ANDI is a pleasant change of pace but ultimately nothing special . The remaining tracks seem like fillers on albums by Journey or Foreigner.DRASTIC MEASURES wo n't stand as a crowning moment for Kansas , but it should n't diminish their status as a great force in progressive rock history .	-1
While Tony is one of the best singers of any century , the song selection is not too `` christmasy . '' Actually I found it depressing and annoying . I was disappointed and surprised . ADVICE : Stick with any other Tony album !	-1
Horrible vocals , weak-sauce riffs , inaudible bass , simple drumming , NO SOLOS MELODIES or ANYTHING that classifies this as good music . Jon Davis is the biggest poser ever . Whats wrong with the music industry , is this a joke or something ? Korn SUCKSWant to listen to real metal ? Immortal , In Flames , Old Metallica , Anthrax , Pantera , Led Zeppelin , Black Sabbath or anything in between . No need for this whiny crap	-1
Quite a catchy intro on & quot ; Blind & quot ; But , believe it or not : that 's all there is here . No real potential.The sound is weak and pathetic . And check out that lyrical content range . Songs about fathers raping their sons , homosexuality ( although the lead singer is married to a woman ) , and whatever else you can make out between those huff-n-puffs.You 'll run out of breath paying for this album , which is something I recommend you DO N'T do ! There is obviously a longer future than this for this band ( no doubt due to the simple and easily pleased teen market ) but there is absolutely no room for growth . And for whatever rumors are circulating about KoRn as a sell-out band ? Please ! They sold out before they formed .	-1
I am a tortured soul ... No one understands me ... my dad and mom force me to clean my room , force me to do my homework ... etc. , etc ... woe is me ... I listen to korn to get me through the long , harsh days of high school/junior high , and to get me through the long nights of my parents making me do my homework ... the only people that understand me are in the band korn ... Seriously though , I do n't understand why this album is praised so much . What did it do for anybody besides making 15 year old , zit faced kids depressed ( for the most part ) , and the execs . who marketed this product so brilliantly ? Some argue that this album pioneered a wave of new music . Even though this is somewhat ( not entirely ) true , what did it pioneer ? ? ? It pioneered Nu-Metal ... hands down one of the worst genre 's of music ( with the exception of a few bands ) .I really do n't care about metal having controversial lyrics for the most part , I like to consider myself open-minded when it comes to music , but this album , and ALL of korn 's subsequent albums after this , have the same stupid lyrics/themes over , and over again . Mom did n't love me , Dad did thing 's to me , no one understands me , why me ? , etc.. , etc . This has been going on for 10+ years . They would probably be more respectable if they got a new topic/theme . Davis though , who I assume writes the lyrics , has a lot to complain about . He 's a multi-millionaire , has legions of fans/easy women , ..etc. , etc ... ..No wonder he is so depressed ( note sarcasm ) .Korn also do not have much talent at all . The vocals are equivalent to the sound someone makes when he/she gets shot in the ass . Davis really needs to take singing lessons . The guitarists are just plain bad and they pretty much use no more than three power chords in each song ... In fact , why were there 2 guitarists in this band ? ? ? The bass sounds awful , and I do n't care for the drums.In all though , this album was never good . Try to check out some other worthwhile music that actually means something , and whose band members actually have talent . For real music check out Opeth , Meshuggah , King 's X , Dream Theater , Porcupine Tree , Symphony X , to name a few .	-1
.. to level a rant against this poor excuse for a band , especially since their guitarist Head has recently departed and the nu-metal trend that dominated the late '90s is now going the way of the Dodo.It amazes me to this day that so many people , even those with otherwise respectable taste in music , are so willing to defend Korn 's turgid debut as if it were somehow groundbreaking or original . Maybe if you listened to the likes of Limp Bizkit and Creed every day for the past two years and picked this up just last week , you 'd have the excuse of thinking this is somewhat fresh . The rest of us know better.Korn was merely a dumbed-down take on the sounds of Helmet and Faith No More , with hints of Biohazard and Sepultura 's later output ( most notably Roots , which was released around the same time and features a Jonathan Davis cameo ) . This would n't be so bad in of itself , since the above bands all more or less rule . However , Korn also sees fit to wallow in Davis ' contrived take on teenage angst , resulting in an album that 's as fun as having your genitals hit repeatedly with a nail bat.Davis ' vocals inevitably waver from pitiful screaming to scared-little-girl whining and flat attempts at rapping . Moreover , both guitarists Monkey and Head ca n't even replicate the taut , brutal riffing of one Page Hamilton ; preferring instead to simply bash out the same three detuned Ibanez chords over and over -- thus ushering in the boring , talentless `` no solo '' style of '90s nu-metal.Despite all this , this album might have been worth two stars.. if it were not for the completely inane 15-minute closer Daddy . Whether Davis is really a victim of child molestation or not , the angst in this song comes off as so ludicrously forced and hollow that I seriously could n't stop laughing while mid-listen ( especially at that `` crying '' bit.. oh please ) .There are bands who make depression worth listening to -- Joy Division , Nirvana , Smashing Pumpkins , Swans ... hell , even The Cure on occassion . Korn , on the other hand , is pure bunk , another use-once-and-destroy tool in the marketing frenzy of MTV and mainstream radio . And if you think this is in any way `` br00tal '' or `` dark , '' go pick up something by Godflesh or Meshuggah and see the light . You 're welcome .	-1
It was the 90 's . A miserable childhood had become 'the in thing ' after Kurt Cobain hit the scenes . If you got along with your parents then probably no-one talked to you at school ! And so a myriad of bands have come and gone decrying their childhood and writing songs about their every pain . One band was Korn . They have made a career of singing about child abuse and emotional pain . Although some of this pain might be real , especially for Jonathon Davis , the singer of the band , making a whole career with the same perennial theme in EVERY STINKIN ' SONG just seems tiresome , forced and , perhaps , lacking in sincerity.In my book , Korn are one of the worst bands of all time . There is absolutely no change of pace with them , they drive their bleak guitars , deep-rumbly vocals and squeals of 'PAIN ' into you song after song , you usually feel like killing yourself after a couple of songs . Every song is as bleak and miserable as can be . There is simply no let up.Their song writing stinks , it is usually very repetitive riffs repeated over and over ... and never any guitar solo or any lick that deviates from a very basic riff that is being repeated ad infinitum as if it were programmed by a computer , an evil one ! Their rhythm section is good , and I think it 's their bass guitarist who is quite innovative , he often doubles as a percussion instrument . They often have a lot of undercurrents of energy surging through their music , but the main music is ugly.They later added synths to their mix , and that helped add a bit of colour to their sound , a bit , but it was still the same dull formula . There are a couple of good songs here , 'Blind ' is actually a good song , 'Lies ' is kind of fun , not a lot of Korn songs are ! 'Helmet in the bush ' is interesting . Actually the song 'Fake ' is a really good one and has good lyrics , and 'Predictable ' is a good hard-rock song , does n't necessarily sound like Korn , more like Metallica , I guess . 'Faget ' is one of the worst songs ever , just two power chords repeated over for 5 or so minutes , and some predictable screaming of the word 'faget ' . This album is worth avoiding , as is this band , but a couple of good songs make this worth about 1 star ( rather than zero or half ) . Rating *	-1
How did this crappy band get so popular . There is absolutly zero talent . The guitars are laughable . And the repetitive whining lyrics . Give me a break . This was the album that spawned the worst genre of music since country ! If you think this is good music than I feel sorry for you . Who wants to listen to jon davis cry about his daddy molesting him ? The real tragedy is that his dad didnt kill him while he was at it .	-1
Korn is the worst thing to happen to real metal since Nirvana . Rather than allowing the metal genre to recuperate after the grunge explosion , nu metal borrowed heavily from grunge stylistically and fed heavily off of mainstream support from MTV and major labels , especially Roadrunner Records ; this resulted in real metal being forced to remain in the underground and the periphery of society 's view . The most heavily borrowed elements of Korn 's music from grunge were the angsty whiney vocals , sorry for one 's self lyrics , simple chord progressions , and detuned guitars . Had Korn not brought not-so-heavy metal into the forefront of the public eye , death metal 's decline in popularity during the mid nineties may have been avoided . Korn is not , in fact , any heavier than grunge or radio rock , as heaviness does n't simply stem from how loose the strings on you six ( or seven , as it were ) string , nor does it originate how loudly you can shout inspid lyrics . Heaviness emanates from the technical virtuosity displayed by the band , especially the axeman ( men ) . Korn 's dual guitars are wasted on this album and all that follow , as there are no scorching dueling guitar solos or complex guitar layerings to be found , only simple chord progressions . Korn did not revitalize metal , in fact , they want to be disassociated from the very term `` metal '' today . Really , the only reason anyone regards this stuff as metal is because that 's what MTV has labelled them . If you 're a teeny bopper who believes everything MTV tells you is true , buy this album . Otherwise , stay far away .	-1
One of the blackest days in Metal history has to have been when Rob Halford left Judas Priest . It seems with Halford 's departure all parties involved forgot how to write enjoyable , good rock n ' roll . Priest of course went on to re-record a couple of variations of their Painkiller album ; Jugulator and Demolition with a Rob Halford karaoke contest winner , which had real Judas Priest fans just shaking their heads . Halford 's first solo stop was the band Fight . This is the second album from `` Fight '' , and it 's even more forgettable than the first `` War of Words '' . I remember listening to this thing when it first came out ... and thinking , `` Judas Priest was disbanded so Halford could do this thing ? ? ? ! ! '' Seriously ... in place of the great melodies , the back and forth guitar work , the fantasic songwriting found on any Priest album ... .Halford is now fronting a band that plays 2 or 3 guitar chords as fast as possible , and that 's it . No songwriting , Halford 's unique vocals are wasted . I mean during the 90 's we could have gotten 4 or 5 more Priest albums , I mean real Priest albums with the original frontman ... instead we are left with this forgettable mess . `` Blowout in the Radio Room '' is really the only stand-out song on the disk ... .and that 's because it sounds completely different from everything else on the album . Other than the one tune , there is no reason to subject yourself to this thing . After listening to this you will understand why `` Fight '' only lasted two albums .	-1
Hey guys . Well first I 'd like to tell you that I like all kinds of music from pop ( all kind ) to R & B to rock , to punk rock to rap to country . Ok , I think Mariah Carey is ok , not great like other people may rate her as . But this album [ is bad ] ... . My sister just gave it to me and after listening to it , I know why . Too many high pitched-cant understand a word she 's saying dance songs and sappy ... . whispering ballads . Yes , I like Fantasy and it 's great to dance to ... but ... . if you really evaluate her voice , its not that loud , it 's all squeaky , and it sounds like she 's trying to hard ... . not traits for singing divas . And the ballads ... . [ they 're bad ] . too many ... .. slow ... . useless , boring songs ... .. and her dull voice makes it worse ... .and what is up with the Daydream Interlude ? That song is [ bad ] ... sorry its true , if you hear it , you will think that too . Horrible vocals ... and the high pitch thing she does -- annoying ! ! I mean , that 's considerred singing ?	-1
In going against the mainstream , I know people will always rip scorn uppon my reviews , but I do n't care . I think people who liked this album are the same kind of people who likes MADONNA , MICHAEL JACKSON , SHANA TWAIN , WHITNEY HOUSTON and other media phenomenons around the world . Carey is not a Paul mcCartney , who is a real solo-artist , composer , singer , instrumentist , with an indenpendent mind . Carey has only her stupendous voice , which she is wasting screaming like a banshee intead of singing .	-1
In the year of grace 378 , the legions of Rome were vanquished at Adrianople by a Gothic incursion . The Emperor himself fell in battle . His body was never recovered . Nor did Rome whose death-throes were at hand.For those students who chart the decline of the Berlin Philharmonic from a cosmic phenomenon to first rate-orchestra , this disc is the equivalent of the defeat above - and instead of Flavius Julius Valens being up on the podium , we have Mister Foghorn-Leghorn himself : Zubin Mehta , presumably attired in one of his famous chicken-man suits.While the Berlin Philharmonic had a few shockers under the reigns of Furtwangler and Karajan , it never fell below a certain standard . Here it 's in free-fall . This is ignoble.So where does one start ? The music itself is of various interest ( to put it mildly ) ; the response ( from the strings in particular ) is lacklustre ; the orchestra is clearly ill-focused if not obstreperous - did any of them readily sign up to this ? If the name of the Berlin Philharmonic were not on the cover , I would classify this as a Naxos `` cheapie '' .To be fair to Maestro Mehta , another name should be emblazoned upon this debacle : Claudio Abbado , the man who gutted the Berlin Phil of its unique Klang . Eight years into his imperium , this is his handiwork . Perhaps Zubin can lend him a spare chicken-man suit.When Uncle Claudio joins the Majority , this disc should be his cenotaph . Lest we forget .	-1
Wynton Marsalis will go down as an interesting figure in jazz music . It 's fair to say he 's changed jazz music in a seismic way . But has he changed the genre for the better ? In general , the answer is no -- and certainly not on `` Joe Cool 's Blues '' .Marsalis ' original compositions on this album are competent but lack any fire or startling spontaneity . Meanwhile his father Ellis does very little with Vince Guaraldi 's original tunes beyond meek homage.The best thing about this album is the Wynton Marsalis Septet , who swings through their paces confidently . Overall , the album is clean , sterile , and fairly boring . But that 's Wynton Marsalis for you.On the one hand , Marsalis has done much to take jazz away from the Kenny Gs and Earl Klughs of the world and back to the Duke Ellingtons and John Coltranes . For that , he deserves our thanks . It was Marsalis as much as anyone who drew the line in the sand between `` smooth jazz '' and `` jazz '' . He made it clear that he considered the jazz of the 80s to be a cultural wasteland , at times placing his own brother Branford in the smooth jazz camp.So Marsalis made jazz less vapid . Good for him . He also made it more sterile . I ca n't necessarily argue with his decision to take jazz back to the past , but when he politely honors Guaraldi , Coltrane and Ellington , he also stifles the artistic creativity that has always been at the heart of jazz.Is it me , or does the concept of Jazz at the Lincoln Center ( with Marsalis as artistic director ) completely fly in the face of improvisation and innovation ? Is jazz now destined to go the way of NPR and classical music , where a board of directors is required and mission statements a must ? In Marsalis ' mind , a jazz concert should be like going to the orchestra , with the audience completely buttoned up and silent.I guess I would n't mind as much if Marsalis were n't so pompous about it all . If Marsalis and his new best buddy Ken Burns are to be believed , Miles Davis ruined jazz , Herbie Hancock 's finest hour was `` Rockit '' , Art Pepper never existed , and Roy Hargrove , Joshua Redman and Christian McBride , et al . contributed nothing to last 30 years of jazz . Meanwhile , Marsalis proclaims himself as the finest trumpeter , composer and bandleader in not only jazz music , but in all of American music . So not only is he making outrageous claims , he can seldom back them up.I 've owned `` Joe Cool 's Blues '' for eight years . As with most Marsalis albums , I 'm always dazzled but hardly ever moved . Two stars .	-1
More retro wallowing from Wynton and Company.Music does not thrive when it becomes encased behind glass in a museum , but that 's what Marsalis is intent on doing , in this and every album since Black Codes . The pity is there is a small amount of jazz being made in the world today , mostly in Europe , that is n't warmed-over recreations , but it 's not being heard in the U.S. because of both the Marsalis Mafia and the tepid climate at all the record labels , even the self-proclaimed `` indy '' ones . There has n't been one new idea on the major jazz record label ( in the U.S. at least ) in 25 years . People who think they 're so hip to be listening to this music instead of Sting and Cheryl Crow just have n't realized this yet.Michael Beyer hits it right on the head with his review . This is tired , re-trodden music that would n't have been eyebrow-raising in 1960 , being presented today as vital and fresh and new . ( `` Essential recording '' ? Come on , Amazon ! ) We have to remember that Vince Guaraldi 's original Charlie Brown music was n't all that trail-blazing back in 1965 -- Schulz ultimately had conservative tastes -- yet it sounds lightyears ahead of this tepid cocktail served up in what sounds like a swanky lounge overlooking the Hudson River.Just listen to the `` Peppermint Patty '' on this album and contrast it with Guaraldi 's version from the original Charlie Brown Christmas album , titled `` Christmas is Coming '' there . Guaraldi 's is energetic and played with *dynamics* and tone color , not to mention real `` swing '' and `` groove , '' those holy words Wynton is always bandying about . This performance is Ellis dusting the keys , then engaging in some very cautious choruses where he never shakes Guaraldi 's original ideas and says anything himself . The same is true with the other Guaraldi-homage tunes- '' Oh Good Grief , '' `` Linus and Lucy , '' etc . They 're playing the notes , but it 's very mechanical , studied , like a wax museum portrait . The Wynton tracks are over-written , designed for the leader to show how he can handle multiple voicings ( `` Look at me ! I 'm Duke Ellington ! '' ) rather than to illustrate the playful essence of the Peanuts folk , or just plain swing . You can get away with Duke 's dense voicings when you have Duke 's weightier material , but for these light , simple , childlike tunes the effect is smothering , like dressing a Strauss waltz with the orchestration of Mahler 's 9th.Throughout the improvisation is perfunctory and cautious , albeit with enough technical polish to varnish a museum of bronze busts of Wynton 's heroes . I 'd love to hear Marsalis and his men stop playing cliches just for once . I 've never understood how he can be considered a great or even good jazz soloist -- name one Marsalis solo where he equals the inventiness of an Eldridge , an Armstrong , or even a *Ziggy Elman . * On so many tracks he 's just imitating his heroes ( `` Joe Cool 's Blues/Snoopy 's Return '' = first prize in the Roy Eldridge sound-alike contest ) ; his arrangements , meanwhile , steal a lot ( well , Wynton would say the same thing if the race were reversed ) from such unlikely souces as Chet Baker and other `` cool '' white groups of the 1950s . But I 'm sure all the five star raves here have never heard the original material this is ripped from , and I 'm further sure that Marsalis knows and is counting on that . If it 's new to you , it must be new.The simple truth is Wynton , and the rest of the Marsalis family , have no identity . ( I recently walked in on someone playing `` Cain and Abel '' from their `` Family '' album and thought I was listening to Ornette and Cherry . ) They spend so much time talking about the past because they have nothing to contribute to the present . They sure can `` hustle '' the music , though , or their brand of it . And this is the result : warmed over tunes being accepted as `` essential '' by a generation that 's likely ignorant of jazz history . Wynton knows the limitations of the average audience 's hearing and knowledge . That 's why he wants to preach as much as play , if not more . The antidote : go listen to some real jazz innovators . They 're not hard to find -- Wynton talks about them all the time .	-1
I can listen to Johnny Cash as well as the next person but I was disappointed in this album . There are much better albums by him at Amazon than this one . I do n't know how Columbia managed to call this a 'Greatest Hits ' package because it does n't touch the surface .	-1
Let me start off by saying I 'm not here to bash this album . I am a fan of Ten and Verses , but this was one change from this band I did n't care for.To me their quality of music dropped pretty bad when they made this album . The high points to me were Nothing Man and Better Man . Corduroy had a moment but over all this album was more lyrically driven ( which there is nothing wrong with because music is nothing more than expressing one 's opinion ) . The quality of the music is way too simple coming off their last two albums.This is obviously an opinion from a fan who preferes the old Pearl Jam . Having said this , my opinion is that if you 're a Pearl Jam fan period or a fan of their recent works , this would be the album to get because this is where the big change began . If you are a fan of the old , this album may not be for you .	-1
I 'm a really big fan of pearl jam 's first two album . Upon hearing this album , I was really disapointed . Better man is a pretty good song , but the rest just really poorly done . Songs like bugs and spin the black circle make you wonder what happened to these masters of early 90s hard rock .	-1
This cd was my least favorite by far . I do have all of their cds and I think they are great at what they do for sure , but for me , this cd only had about 3-4 songs that I liked , and out of those songs , none of them are my favorite Jam . songs . The cd is not bad , I just like the upper tempo , more layered songs more .	-1
You people can not be serious . Illmatic was 100 times better than this . If i ruled the world sucks too . Sampling a beat form Whodini . Cd is weakkkkkkk . Pick up Illmatic or Gods son . Those are good this one is n't though .	-1
I have been a fan of Dusty Springfield since I was a kid . Son Of A Preacher Man was my introduction to her work , but I 've heard many other recordings that I enjoyed.I popped this in the CD player while reading the liner notes . On balance , this was a project that a lot of promise . It was recorded primarily in Nashville , with the full support of Columbia Records , a label clearly experienced with pop music . Then the music started , and the worst thing that could have happened , did.The music was boring.Sure , she sings competently . Even after a brush with cancer , she appears to have a good portion of her voice left . However , competency is not the same thing as passion . At her best , Dusty sings with passion . It 's not here very much , and when it is , the passion is drowned out by the layers of pop production - background voices , synthesized strings , drum programs and everything else . Her voice , at her best , is great in a solo setting : plenty of pitch range , plenty of emotive range , plenty of dynamic range . However , add the layers , and that distinctiveness starts to become obscured.There is nothing wrong with the musicians . They are all competent . Some show passion in spots - Kirk Whalum 's soprano sax on the cut Go Easy On Me is an example . However , there is n't much synergy and there is n't much spark.The instrumentation is Dusty , keyboards , including piano , organ and synth on various cuts , multiple guitars , bass , drums . With the layers and the overdubs , it becomes a very dense sound.The songs themselves are primarily medium tempo or ballads and there is nothing really stirring about them . There is a duet with Daryl Hall called Wherever Would I Be where Hall , an occasionally interesting pop artist , sounds like a lounge singer and Springfield nearly sinks to that level . The rest of the songs are unexciting , despite all the production efforts.I 'm speculating here , but this could have been the project from the Twilight Zone . There are 10 cuts and the liner notes credit 10 different recording studios : 6 in Nashville , 2 in New York , and one each in London and Hollywood . I do n't know what the sequence was of the recordings . It seems to me that these recordings were pieced together from musicians who did not work together with regularity and it shows.I usually criticize albums produced after the early 90 's with less than 50 minutes of music . This has 41 . In this case , it 's a mercy killing . Hard to imagine the quality of the items that did n't make this CD and the amount of recording effort in these 10 studios that was n't used .	-1
`` Nostalgia is death , '' Bob Dylan said in an interview once to Robert Hilburn . You can see it in this collection . Springbean was a product of the late 1970s and ever since has just been repeating himself . As Phil Spector recently said about Springbean 's career , he has `` protected himself with three new songs and 25 old ones . '' With minor variation to the quote , it could serve for this release.It 's a cynical compilation of the multi-millionaire working-man-poseur 's most superficial songs , with a few previously-unavailable numbers thrown in to entice die-hards to spend their money.The new `` modern '' mastering of it is wretched , from the engineering school of `` Turn everything up in volume and boost that treble to 11 . `` The best Springbean song that 's missing here ? `` On the Dark Side , '' which Stephen King recently put in his list of all-time best rock and roll songs . If that had been included , they could have eliminated half of the selections they did pick .	-1
Why , Bruce , Why ? I used to think you were lookin ' out for the workin ' man like me . Now you seem a bit like the kind of person you used to protest . I have nine of your albums now , and I just needed a Greatest Hits to complete a library of the Springsteen songs I grew up listening to on the radio.Unfortunately , you did n't deliver what you promised in the record 's title - Greatest Hits . Had you at least been forthcoming and named the record `` A Few Hits , A Few Of My Favorite Album Cuts , And A Few So-So New Songs , '' I would n't have felt quite so disappointed.Thanks for `` Born To Run , '' `` Hungry Hearts '' and `` Dancing In The Dark . '' But on what planet was `` Blood Brothers '' a hit , or in any way worthy to include instead of `` I 'm on Fire ? '' Why the tedious `` River '' instead of `` Tunnel Of Love ? `` If this were just a `` Great Songs '' record , I would still ask why the new throw-aways `` This Hard Land '' and `` Murder Incorporated '' are included , rather than the brilliant `` Tougher Than The Rest '' or hard-to-find `` Trapped ? '' I should probably add a star for not adding the nauseating Tom Cruise dialague to the beautiful `` Secret Garden . `` Honestly , why put 18 tracks on a Greatest Hits record , and only include 7 of your 12 top 10 songs ? I concede that part of the your problem is having such a wealth of great material , but that fact only makes this record more frustrating . If you were a `` one hit wonder '' instead of a legend , it might be understandable to release a Greatest Hits record stuffed to the gills with filler . `` Bruce Springsteen Greatest Hits '' should have been one of the best records ever , period . Instead it is one of my biggest disappointments ever . Actual `` hits '' are replaced by personal favorites and unmemorable new recordings.Oh , so disappointing .	-1
I do not understand how this no talent loser ever made a career out of the slop mislabeled music . Honestly I have no beef with `` The Boss '' other than the fact that I can not stand terrible music , and this is most certainly *the worst* music ever made PERIOD ... . Everything about it sucks.1 ) The SongwritingThe songs have no melody whatsoever . There are no memorable hooks , nothing to grab onto melodically , which is pretty important considering he is considered a songwriter . Additionally for those of you that try to compare him to Dylan by using the defense that Bruce 's music is more about the lyrics ... Do n't even try that with me . Bob Dylan is a lyrical genius . Bruce 's lyrics are nothing but cliched psuedo-patriotic atrocities . Give me a break `` wrap your arms around my engines '' haha . And thats probably his best song by far Born to Run that is . It really pisses me off people could even Compare Dylan and Springsteen ... .thats like comparing The Beatles to The Backstreet Boys ... 2 ) The MusicianshipThe E street band is the epitome of all that is wrong with sell-out commerical bands blaaaahh . Horrible sappy piano parts ( walking in memphis ) Disgusting Sax solos ... .Not cool.3 ) The Production ValuesPlease tell me who thought that deeply tuned heavily reverbed snare drum sounds good ? Good grief that is irritating ... .Every single song all you hear is smack , smack , smack , smack ... .There is more to a drum kit than a snare that sounds like it was sampled from some of the worst 80 hair metal bands ... .In SummaryWithout one doubt in my mind Bruce Springsteen is the single worst artist in modern music..His songs were written for unsophiticated people who have even less taste in music than the average Contemporary Country listener . His music was made for those people who have not only terrible taste in music but have the mentality of jingoistic ROTC brainwashed 14 year olds..	-1
Greatest hits ? How about renaming the title to Bruce Springsteen : Songs Nobody Listens to Anymore . Ever since Bruce changed his name from John Cougar Mellencamp his career has gone down hill fast.Also , what 's with the guitar on the album cover ? Sure , he 's decent at playing piano , but trying to make him into some rocker who plays guitar is a bit of a stretch.While Born In the U.S.A. is a great song , and it 's been widely used in political campaigns , the song is ludicrous considering this man is a Canadian citizen . His single claim to fame is a song about being born somewhere that he wasn't.Do n't buy new , buy one of the 300,000 used copies for .99 cents if you must .	-1
First of all , this isnt Pink Floyd . Unless you think Ringo , George , and 34 studio musicians are the Beatles , you should have a problem with a band calling themselves Pink Floyd without the genius and songwriter who created all of Pink Floyd 's really great stuff.Secondly , this album brings nothing new from the last phony Pink Floyd concert album , A Delicate Sound Of Boredom . In fact , here is how to save yourself some money . Get Delicate Sound Of Boredom , then picture David Gilmour even fatter and balder than before and ... wala ... you have this album . This is nothing more than court-approved identity and song theft .	-1
There 's something really disheartening about hearing a band lose their identity so totally as what 's on this . I guess this is their attempt at Seattle 's version of neorealism , mixed with surrealism ( this sounds like Kings X ) . It 's like seeing Donald Trump come back from an ashram with a full beard , sandals , flashing a peace sign , and eating tofu . Lyrics about nothing , just total gibberish , some psychedelic muck about ... not knowing what to say.. ? Another trait of the CD age is albums became War and Peace take II , so you have to endure what seems like eternity of this nonsense . Sure there 's some good playing on here , but this never should have come out as a 'Dokken ' release , maybe the 'Traveling Blue Fish , ' with George sporting a Fu Manchu moustache and Don some serious dreads .	-1
THis is not Ozzy 's best album , no way , pal ! ! ! THe sound here is flat and industrial , very strange . Below , the list of Ozzy 's best studio albuns , in my opinion:1 ) BLIZZARD OF OZZ ( the ultimate masterpiece ) 2 ) DIARY OF A MADMAN3 ) NO MORE TEARS ( best album with Zakk Wylde ) 4 ) BARK AT THE MOON5 ) DOWN TO EARTH6 ) NO REST FOR THE WICKED7 ) OZZMOSIS8 ) THE ULTIMATE SIN	-1
I downloaded this album with high hopes it would match my high expectations after buying one fierce beer coaster and horray for boobies . What i heard is hardley even listenable . It 's way too much like punk , and it seems childish even for the bloodhound gang . One fierce beer coaster is much superior to this album in every way . I must stress that unless you want to piss someone off by giving them a crappy gift , DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM !	-1
Just as the other reviewers have stated this is NOT a remaster , but a remix . This type of autrocity makes me really glad I 've kept hold of my old Denon turntable and kept my LPs in great shape . Screw digital , sounds even better on an old tube amp from Pioneer as well . Do n't bother wasting your money here !	-1
Its an abomination to have replaced original musicians Lee Kerslake and Bob Dailey with members of Ozzy 's current band . Why not rerecord Randy Rhodes guitar parts and use Ingwie Malmsteen to do the job ? Or worse yet , lets get Ronnie James Dio to replace Ozzy 's parts , hey it worked in Black Sabbath , Oz should be used to it by now . Either scenario would be as inappropriate as this Sharron Osbourne led hatchet job . To ruin an album because musicians actually wanted to get paid for their work is inexcusable . What should we expect though from the daughter of a gangster ? The greed is just sickening . I will look for the '95 reissue to replace my worn out cassette copy instead of buying this travesty .	-1
Then would n't Rudy Sarzo also have something to say about the re-recordings or was he just a touring session bassist on the Diary of A Madman tour when he was with Brad Gillis at the `` Speak of the Devil '' Tours or were those completely different concerts . This is why I only gave it 2 stars because of the comments above on the page .	-1
Why buy a criminally-altered version of the real thing ? Ozzy ( and his manager/wife ) should give credit to extremely talented original bass player Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake . Alone with guitarist extraordinaire Randy Rhoads , Daisley and Kerslake were part of the MAGIC that started it all ... and the reason of Ozzy 's present fame and wealth .	-1
The rythm section that replaces the original is good , in time , but not an inch more than that . Just average good musicians.The original band , with kerlslake and Daisley played beautifully , originally . Buy the previous remaster , not this fraud.The same happened with Diary of a madman . Ozzy is extremely greedy and cheap for doin this mess .	-1
Why would they re-edit this cd ? Cut out the part 's and add new player 's ? What was there to prove ? Let 's go ahead and cut out the Mona Lisa smile and add Madonna 's smile , lol ! Boycott this recording at all cost 's , please.Bad enough that we all knew Ozzy did n't write the word 's . But to spit in the face of those who we 're responsible for the true power of a great rock n roll record ? ? Enough said ! For a guy who ca n't even articulate more then a couple significant words at a time . But everyone knows it 's Sharon Osbournes carrer , really.Next thing you know Yoko Ono will be redoing The Beatles with new people , backing john , lmao ! ! In the long run Ozzy 's ( I mean , Sharon 's ) Show will show us what a fool he really is . Next thing you know , we 'll all believe Anna Nicole Simpson , is really a sex symble.Ah but the magic of TV.But thank you for helping me to save a few buck 's . Great music must be saved from it 's self , sometimes .	-1
Remastered nothing , its been almost completely remade and is musically inferior to the original version . Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake have been screwed out of royalties , and now they 've been removed from the album altogether ! Sharon Osbourne is one mean-spirited , greedy , over-materialistic person and the fact that Ozzy went along with it shows how little integrity he really has . I hate to say it , but I 've simply lost respect for Ozzy Osbourne . I love his music and legacy , but there are certain things that are just inexcusably wrong , this CD is one of them .	-1
If only I had known that this was n't the same album I bought in 1981 when I was 15 years old , I sure would n't have bought it ! I thought that it sounded different , and then when I read the liner notes I knew it was n't the same album ! I have lost what respect I had for Ozzy , that he would erase Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake ( and I do n't have anything against Mike Bordin or Robert Trujillo ; they do a commendable job ) . They did an excellent job musically and Bob Daisley was Ozzy 's lyrical mouthpiece ( much as Geezer Butler was in Sabbath days ) , though he 's tried to deny it for years ( and what 's wrong with the Aussie bass master ? I 've met him and he 's a nice guy ! ) . And what of the & quot ; bonus & quot ; track & quot ; You Lookin ' At Me Lookin ' At You & quot ; ? Is Randy Rhoads indeed on this ? I did n't think any other material existed with him , except for & quot ; You Said It All , & quot ; which I got on a vinyl EP years ago in Canada.If Ozzy can do this , then Tony Iommi should & quot ; re-master & quot ; all the Ozzy-era Sabbath albums with a different vocalist ( i.e . ; one who can sing - I think Tony Martin is still available ) .The only reason I got this is because of Rhoads ' guitar work . At least Ozzy did n't wipe that ... I think ... I hope ... that 's the only reason for the two stars . A heck of a way to honour Randy 's memory ! Thank God I still have an original cassette of & quot ; Diary Of A Madman. & quot ; Stick to MTV , Ozzy .	-1
... We should be told if parts are rerecorded or if we 're not getting the original album remastered . Do not buy DIARY either , it is the same [ situation ] . I was fooled , so the best I can do is tell you not to buy this garbage . It 's like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa ! Rating : Negative 1 Star !	-1
Before you head to your nearest record store to buy this album please read this . The 2002 `` remastered '' version of Ozzy Osbourne 's Blizzard of Ozz is also a `` reissue '' of every song . If you have already read the earlier reviews then it should be clear to you Ozzy and company for some unknown reason has re-recorded over the bass and drum parts . For those of you who are new to Ozzy must be warned . I 'm sure people who own the original notice right off when they pop this version of the album into their CD players that this can not be same as the vinyl or the 1995 remaster . Do n't be tricked into buying this because of the falsely stated `` ORIGINAL Recording Remastered '' sticker on the front ... Also note that Diary of a Madman has also been recorded over . Avoid both of these albums .	-1
I was surprised to see an average of two stars for this album . I knew that `` Blizzard of Oz '' is probely the most loved Ozzy album , espically for us older metal heads . Then I found out what all the fuss was about . A remaster that cuts out the original musicans . Are you kidding me ? First off , who the hell wants to own an album that doesnt have the original studio muscians on it . Its not like Ozzy wanted to re-release the album with different muscians to try to give it a different sound ( just like Anthrax recorded `` Amoung the Living '' with John Bush on Vocal or Twisted Sister did a rawer version of `` Stay Hungry '' ) I dont understand why Ozzy would want to do this . He has enough money in the bank , and just because he has some older band members that he is in a fued with , does n't give him the right to record over their contributions to this album . This was recorded 25 years ago , and this is a DISGRACE to Ozzy fans , espically the ones who supported him through the 80 's when he wasnt getting radio play or MTV play ( expect headbangers ball ) and all before Oz Fest . I see what Ozzy is all about . Regardless of if Sharron influenced him to do this , the music is still copyrighted to Ozzy , and he has the last say . He decided to do it anyway , and I encourage you to not support this jerk anymore . Screw Oz-Fest , as its mostly Nu Metal garbage anyway , and we can see that all he is a greedy money hungry a**wipe . If you want this album remastered , then try getting your hands on the last remaster released before this one . I dont have the album if front of me , but I believe it was done in the last 90 's . All the original musicans are here and the recording sounds great . Good thing that you cant get it new , so if you buy it you Ozzy wont be getting any money for it . OZZY , you SELLOUT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Ban this cd . Aside from the rotten , dull songs , it empowers dudes with mullets to commit savage acts of sodomy on each other . While that concept may sound funny , other side effects spill over into pop culture , warping the fragile balance of nature . Commonly , one will observe dudes working on their pickups on their front lawns , nascar stickers abounding ! Ozzy 's pathetic rantings are perfect for those who live in grandma 's basement while collecting welfare . The same can be said for ANY ozzy cd , and all comparative 80 's crap-metal . Cliche garbage .	-1
This 2002 remaster is an abomination to the memory of Randy Rhoads as well as the HUGE contributions of Bob Daisley ( bass ) and Lee Kerslake ( drums ) .Sharon had the bass and drum parts re-recorded by Robert Truijillo and Mike Bordin respectively for this 2002 remaster to try to get out of paying Bob and Lee performance royalties that they are rightfully owed.To make a short point , buy the 1995 remasters instead of both Diary and Blizzard instead . Those are the ORIGINAL versions of these albums with Bob and Lee 's amazing rhythm section work intact as well as the original tone of Randy 's still amazing guitar work . ( Has it really been almost 25 years since his death ? R.I.P . Randy ) .	-1
I do n't own this and wo n't own it . By an earlier version and hear Randy the way Randy wanted you to hear him , not the way pop superstars Ozzy and Sharon think you should hear him . Ozzy is such an idiot . How someone that can put together such a great group of musicians , year after year , can be so stupid is beyond me . Not to mention , this album is huge . You do n't just go and replace people and mix down the real star of the band . Anyway , if you can find an earlier version of the CD , buy it . It 's a great album when it has n't been tampered with , other than raising the volume a bit . It 's a shame people continue to support Ozzy , when all he has really done for the past 3 decades is ride the coat-tails of the person standing to his left .	-1
The original album , left alone , is 5 stats . This sound like crap with the new mix . It 's really just low-level LA rock musicians that are willing to take a couple bucks for a day in the studio.Sharon has really hit a new all-time low with ruining one of the most classic heavy metal albums ever made .	-1
First of all , I had both vinyls ( blizzard of ozz , diary of a madman ) in the eighties , but sadly I sold , trade and/or lost them.Tired of having sucky bad-compressed mp3s in my PC , I decided to order them both by Amazon . Let 's have both CDs ! I saw that these were the 95 reissues ( with Lee Kerslake & Bob Daisley in the rythm section ) . I says here : original CD reissues from 1995 . Good deal because you ca n't find them anywhere.But - alas ! - I received those goddamned 2002 versions with Sharon & Kelly on bass and drums ! Like we say in my good ol'town : Punked !	-1
This album is a complete disaster . All the songs on here suck . The best song is Shot in the Dark , which I would only give a 2/5 . ( The rest of the songs recieve 1/5 ) I guess if you like Shot in The Dark this album is for you . Just remember I warned you , do n't waste your hard earned cash . Whenever I want to listen to Ozzy , I 'll stick with Diary of a Madman .	-1
Ultimate sin is an `` Ultimate Sin '' . `` Shot in The dark '' ... classic . The rest is a repetition of one song after another . I thought my cd player was acting up . Spend a few more $ $ $ and get `` Essential Ozzy Osborne '' . Just my opinion .	-1
This would be an incredible album if it were n't for the terrible mastering . Randy 's over-saturated distortion sounds great on studio recordings , but the engineers really over did it for the purposes of this `` tribute . '' I can understand that Randy should be featured prominently in the mix of an album dedicated to his memory , but his guitar levels are so high , and there is so much crowd noise and stage echo added in , that your ears will quickly grow tired of listening to it . Do n't get me wrong , I love the blaring sound of an over-driven Marshall amp , but this is just annoying . Van Halen and Tony used some wicked distortion in the '80s , but it did n't sound ridiculously harsh and it did n't overpower the vocals , bass , and even drums . It 's like holding a buzz saw up to your head . I 've never been able to make it past track three without needing to give my now-ringing ears a break . I 'm sure some of you are n't as concerned with recording quality , but even when listening to this a low volumes , the sound is rough.This album deserves a complex remix and a dynamic remaster fitting of its historical importance.Google `` the loudness war ''	-1
My friend David told me to check out this album for some tr00 guitar playing . I found the tape in a junkshop for 50 cents so I bought it without hesitation . Wow , was this bad or what ! Total disappointment . The guitar playing was just the same boring shredding and overly-long solos again and again for an hour . Weak . Check out `` St. Anger '' , `` All The Right Reasons '' , `` Metal Machine Music '' or `` American Idiot '' for some facemelting solos from true fretboard masters !	-1
It 's a little surprising that Ozzy would choose to redo the drums and bass on his first two solo recordings , yet leave this release intact . The drum sound on this recording is simply unacceptable , and the entire production is hopelessly murky , even after a remaster ( clearly only AAD ) . I hope whoever produced this record is no longer employed as a music professional . Poor Zakk Wylde hit the big time , only to have his debute butchered.In terms of song writing , Ozzy was off to a weak start with Zakk . Miracle Man and Tattoed Dancer are great songs , but the rest are as mundane as anything Jake E. Lee came up with on the Ultimate Sin . Perhaps a few attempts to write with Zakk finally resulted in Ozzy 's decision to hire other writers by the time of Ozzmosis . It was really sound decision making , because Zakk is an amazing player , if not the most original writer , and it would be a shame to lose him . He 's as much a part of Ozzy 's sound now as the legendary Randy Rhodes .	-1
Ozzy was never any good solo , more like pop metal . This is ozzy doing hair metal ... oh joy . Ozzy sucks .	-1
No Rest For The Wicked was definitely a comedown after the decent The Ultimate Sin album . This is Ozzy 's first album with Zakk Wylde on lead guitar and although his playing is impressive , the songs for the most part are n't very good . The first three tracks : `` Miracle Man '' , `` Devil 's Daughter '' , and `` Crazy Babies '' are the strongest tracks on the album . The track `` Hero '' , which was untitled on the original release , is also a decent track . The rest of the album consists of unmemorable songs like `` Breaking All The Rules '' , `` Tattooed Dancer '' , and one of Ozzy 's worst tracks ever , `` Demon Alcohol . '' The band is top notch , as they are all on of Ozzy 's albums , but the songs are n't up to par . I would recommend this fans of Zakk Wylde for the excellent guitar playing but otherwise Ozzy has made much better albums than this one , particularly those with Randy Rhoads .	-1
Back in 1994/1995 , Silverchair were everywhere in the news in my native Australia because the media was commenting on how little Australian music was on the radio . This trio of then-teenagers from the industrial city of Newcastle took over the airwaves in a remarkable way during 1995 , leading to a comment that `` Australian music was back '' during 1996.However , regardless of what one might think of this , the music here has no redeeming qualities at all . From the moment it became a staple on the radio , I tried to change the channel when ever it played.Basically , Silverchair copied , with almost no change , the awful noise/pomp style that had been developed by the Seattle bands of the 1990s . The songs usually began in exactly the same manner as did the pompous stadium rock songs of the 1980s . A soft , airbrushed guitar line opened every song , with Daniel Johns ' voice the only clue to Silverchair 's hard-rock character.Then the song , more discreetly and aggressively than a 1980s power ballad like `` Alone '' , turns into heavy metal with a shouted , groling chorus . On the really dreadful `` Israel 's Son '' this takes time , but one gets a headache listening to the emotionless , amplified soft parts before the chorus . Elsewhere , the loud parts of `` Frogstomp '' , like other grunge albums , were just like 1980s heavy metal with a more bass-heavy and darker sound.For all the volume , the songs never convey any feeling because Daniel Johns never appears to know anything about the subjects he is writing : `` Frogstomp '' was shallowness personified.Try something else if you want 1990s music , no more to say .	-1
Just another run of the mill teenager depressing whine feat from AIC . Sucked then sucks now nothing special move on ... , .	-1
After the exelent & quot ; Dirt & quot ; expectations were all time high . However I was very disappointed . The songs sound very alike and around the 6. track I lost patience . AIC does not sound inspired at all . I hope this album will not be their swan song .	-1
Michael Bolton , ( I first knew him mistakenly as Michael Dutton from a radio announcement ) was the singer behind a vast number of major hits that dominated commercial radio during the 1980s and 1990s . He first came to prominence with the sudden high entry of his version of `` Dock Of The Bay '' ( I used to sing it as `` Top Of The Bay '' ) onto the charts in 1988.In 1990 , Bolton began to dominate the airwaves with a vast string of hits , of which the upbeat songs like `` How Can We Be Lovers '' and `` Time , Love And Tenderness '' were rather painless to listen to though they certainly were extremely pompous , Bolton 's voice certainly appeared to convey some real emotion . They were also undeniably catchy and could bear hearing on commcercial radio.However , as time went by , Bolton moved onto softer and softer , airier and airier ballads that really did make his voice sound painful , grating , even tuneless . The early `` When A Man Loves A Woman '' is barely distinguishable from a version by Australian Jimmy Barnes but really has little tune , whilst the flyweight `` Said I Loved You But I Lied '' is even harder to listen to as Bolton mumbled through both verses and chorus in a way that ought never to impress . `` How Am I Supposed To Live Without You '' was more of the same , but the then-new tracks are just awful even compared to Bolton 's earlier output . There is not a single memorable hook in the new tracks , and Bolton 's voice , really best designed for hard rock or heavy metal , falters trying to sing a tune with any gentleness in it at all , yet alone such flyweight songs as these.Pleasant , yes , memorable , anything but . Look elsewhere for something that will keep you listening .	-1
First let me say that I am a Big TFF fan , however this release has just a couple of good songs ( God 's Mistake and Me & amp ; My Big Ideas ) but it is generally just overblown , over bombastic , and just does n't connect with me . May I suggest Elemental or Roland Orzibals solo L.P. ( Tomcats Screaming Outside ) .	-1
The last song of Billy 's Joel 's album , `` The River of Dreams '' seemed to be somewhat appropriate . On the song , `` Famous Last Words '' , Billy sings the words `` These are the last words I have to say ; That 's why this took me so long to write ; There will be other words some other day ; But that 's the story of my Life '' . Billy Joel would soon proclaim that his 13th studio album , 1993 's `` The River of Dreams '' would be his last original Rock/Pop album he would do . Following that album , Billy Joel would assume a place as an `` elder statesman '' of Rock . Instead of creating new music , he would spend his time touring ( solo and with Elton John ) , doing the College Lecture series ( discussing his music ) , and dabbling in Classical Music ( he released a Classical Instrumental album - i.e . no words called `` Fantasies and Delusions '' ) . In a way , Billy would go into semi-retirement . The release of `` Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume 3 '' was a way for Billy to provide some closure to the work included on the latter albums . In 1985 , Billy released a double CD entitled `` Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume I and II '' . For all practical purposes , `` Greatest Hits Volume 3 '' covers the last decade of his career . While this does provide some closure , I find this a most disappointing effort.I look at Billy Joel 's career as having three phases . The first phase is what I call `` Old Billy Joel '' . This basically includes all of his material from `` Cold Spring Harbor '' through `` Turnstiles '' . These are perhaps the strongest days as the piano sound , but they also contain most of Joel 's least heard material . The next phase is what I call `` Middle Billy Joel '' . This was his most successful period and covers from `` The Stranger '' to `` Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume 1 and 2 '' . Joel would go through a transition during this phase - expanding his musical horizons and exploring different avenues . The final phase is the `` Later Billy Joel '' phase - this covers `` The Bridge '' to `` River of Dreams '' . In this phase , Billy would start to incorporate some of his older styles of music while not abandoning his desire to continue to explore new avenues . For the most part , `` Greatest Hits Volume 3 '' focuses on Phase 3 - `` Later Billy Joel '' . Although `` Greatest Hits Volume I and II '' covered Billy 's last studio album of Phase 2 , `` An Innocent Man '' - there are two songs on `` Greatest Hits Volume 3 '' from that album that were not on `` Greatest Hits Volume I and II '' . `` Greatest Hits Volume 3 '' includes 14 tracks from Billy 's last 4 studio albums . `` An Innocent Man '' ( `` Keeping the Faith '' , `` An Innocent Man '' ) ; `` The Bridge '' ( `` A Matter of Trust '' , `` Baby Grand '' , `` This is the Time '' ) ; `` Storm Front ( `` Leningrad '' , `` We Did n't Start the Fire '' , `` I Go to Extremes '' , `` And So it Goes '' , `` The Downeaster 'Alexa ' '' ) ; `` The River of Dreams ( `` Shameless '' , `` All About Soul '' , `` Lullabye ( Goodnight My Angel ) '' , and `` The River of Dreams '' ) In addition - as with most `` Greatest Hits collections '' there are three new tracks . Billy sort of keeps to his promise on `` These are the last words I have to Say '' in that the new songs are written by other people . The songs are `` To Make You Feel My Love '' ( a Bob Dylan song ) , `` Hey Girl '' , and `` Light as the Breeze '' .There are several reasons why I advise against this particular Billy Joel collection : - Billy would release a modestly boxed set called `` Billy Joel : Complete Hits Collection '' that includes the remastered version of `` Greatest Hits Volume I and II '' , `` Greatest Hits Volume 3 '' , and a fourth disk that includes outtakes and live versions from a College Tour he did . You get everything on `` Greatest Hits Volume 3 '' in this collection . Unless you want to `` fill the gaps '' , you should carefully consider the 4-disc Boxed Set first because it is a better value.- I think much of the charm of the `` Latter Billy Joel '' phase were some of the `` hidden gems '' of songs . These were n't necessarily commercially successful songs , but still had good quality . It is disappointing that `` Volume 3 '' does n't include these hidden gems . Songs such as `` Running on Ice '' , `` Modern Woman '' ( `` The Bridge '' ) ; `` That 's Not Her Style '' , `` When in Rome '' ( `` Storm Front '' ) ; `` No Man 's Land '' , `` Two Thousand Years '' , `` Famous Last Words '' ( `` The River of Dreams '' ) are missing . The omission of `` Modern Woman '' really surprised me . I think this song gets a bum rap from the critics . .- Taking out the two songs from `` An Innocent Man '' and the three new songs . This collection really only covers three albums : `` The Bridge '' , `` Storm Front '' , and `` The River of Dreams '' . This really is n't enough for a greatest hits collection.As mentioned Billy includes three new songs by outside songwriters . The one thing that I liked about all three songs is that there is a piano element in each of them . The best of the three songs is `` Hey Girl '' . This song has a very soulful/R & B ; feel and it is something different by Billy . I would go as far as to say that this is a great Billy Joel song . This song features some terrific background vocals . I also like the horns in it . The other two songs are n't quite as strong , but still of good quality.. `` Light as the Breeze '' had more of a classic Billy Joel `` Piano '' and `` Horn '' elements , but this song never really grabbed me . With the exception of the percussion , `` To Make You Feel my Love '' did n't really feel like a Bob Dylan song - but it still was n't that bad.While this collection is probably worth it for the new songs , my advice would be to try to get the Boxed Set `` Billy Joel : Complete Hits Collection '' . This is the one Billy Joel album that disappoints me . With the exception of the new songs , all this collection does is provide closure - but it really is n't going to provide the value from a Billy Joel compilation you would expect .	-1
and poor ones at that.With Oasis albums , all one has to do is just hum a Beatles tune and guarantee it matches the melody of Oasis 's `` songs . `` It 's one thing to pay tribute to a band but it 's quite another to blatantly rip them off , and then have the gall to badmouth one of the greatest guitar players in music history ! ( The late George Harrison had more talent in his pubic hair than Liam or Noel Gallagher have in their entire bodies combined ... and then some . ) The brothers Gallagher obviously never heard of the saying that `` you can imitate but never duplicate . '' If it were legally possible for them to just put their name to the Beatles catalogue , they would have done it long ago without thinking about it.These little boys apparently have zero concept of the word `` originality . `` But the saddest part of all is that people actually gush over these losers as if they 're original or something special . Maybe it would be too much work to listen to the people who gave Oasis their careers - that would be The Beatles.Liam Gallagher in his wildest dreams will NEVER reach the height of creativity - drugged up or straight - that Lennon , McCartney , Harrison , and Starr did . He can make the asinine claim that Oasis are greater than The Beatles but time always gets the last laugh ( let 's see if Oasis has the vast cultural influence the Fab Four did back in the 60 's - an influence that continues to this day . As it stands now , they have TONS of catching up to do ) .If it were n't for the constant tabloid reports on Liam 's latest fight with his brother Noel ( and everyone else ) or his sexual exploits , people would have forgotten them ( like they should have been ) long ago.Keep smoking whatever it is you 're toting , Liam , because your little group is nothing but yet another glorified , overexposed garage band .	-1
Wow , does anyone actually listen to this garbage ? To say overrated would be too kind ... this album should be on the $ 1 discount shelf , and even then I wouldnt buy it	-1
I am a fan of Brazilian music of all kinds , and a sometimes jazz fan . I have read about Terence Blanchard 's work but , until this CD , had not heard him . Ivan Lins gives Blanchard marvelous songs to play but Blanchard does virtually nothing of interest with them . In fact , the playing is mind-numbingly , teeth-achingly dull . Too often on the slower material , Blanchard holds notes for what seems like forever because he has no other place he wants to go . Technically proficient , but boring , the CD feels like it lasts for hours . Lins tries adding vocal accompaniment to most tunes , but that usually does n't work , because again Blanchard shows no understanding of the material that he is working with . Any of Lins own albums is better than this by a wide , wide margin . As for Blanchard , I do n't know him well enough to hazard a guess , but I sure do n't plan to give him another listen for a long , long time .	-1
Although I wo n't say that she 's trying to be Tori Amos , no one could acheive that , she definetely is not doing anything so impressive . Her lyrics sound even more self-obsessed than Tori 's . It 's like she 's trying to be philosophical , but it 's not quite working . I feel the same anger and guilt she does , but I want a singer who demands and includes me at the same time , whereas Fiona Apple just seems to be venting her anger towards me . I want you to understand my pain and make me feel better , not to feel guilty for your pain ! If she got some singing lessons , actually played the piano ( does she just say she plays the piano , 'cause I 've never seen her do so ) , and did n't try to solve her problems with rage but with understanding , she would be a much better artist . I respect her though for trying . Good luck Fiona in discovering you might actually have more talent than you show .	-1
I was excited when I heard that Bruce Springsteen was going to record another album in the & quot ; Nebraska & quot ; mode . My excitement turned to disappointment , however , as I listened and realized that there are no songs here close to the power of that album 's & quot ; Atlantic City & quot ; or & quot ; Johnny 99. & quot ; What you get instead is a lot of standard folk-singer-stands-up-for-the-downtrodden tunes that fail to achieve any transcendence . Bruce 's stand for the oppressed would be a lot more convincing were he not already a multi-millionaire rock star . This is a well-intentioned but ultimate self-indulgent effort from an artist capable of much better . Never was the need for Bruce to bring back the E Street Band more evident .	-1
While flashes of & quot ; Ten & quot ; slendor are evident , the staple of the Seattle bands is loosening with each CD released . Just plain weird does n't translate into just plain good . I give them props for doing something new , but bleching into a megaphone is new , too . And about as good . I know at least 50 bands better than Pearl Jam , Here 's a list of a few of them : King 's X , Faith No More , Living Colour , Lenny Kravitz , Sly and the Family Stone , Bela Fleck and the Flecktones , Korn , Nirvana , Soundgarden , James Brown , Alice in Chains , Metallica , the Dixie Chicks , the Spice Girls , My brother ' marching band , my yellow rubber band , Yanni ... Hey , Eddie ... ... ... .what happened ? ? ?	-1
After the monster success of their first three albums , Pearl Jam did the time honored tradition of recording a self indulgent , non-commercial album that 's more for themselves than their audience . The band is to be applauded for branching out and stretching themselves , but as with most bands , they would have been better off sticking to what they do best . The band is influenced by Neil Young , especially his work with Crazy Horse . The band tries to ape the sound of Mr. Young 's work from Rust Never Sleeps on & quot ; Red Mosquito & quot ; and & quot ; Smile & quot ; but they come across as bad imitations . They go curiously into a world beat sound on the & quot ; Who You Are & quot ; ( flip flopping the title of another major influence , The Who 's & quot ; Who Are You & quot ; ) and & quot ; In My Tree & quot ; . The latter song is particular bad . Stone Gossard steps in front of the microphone to sing & quot ; Mankind & quot ; and he shows why he is the band 's lead guitarist . The album is not without its merits . & quot ; Hail Hail & quot ; ranks as one the band 's all-time best songs with its driving guitars and powerful Eddie Vedder vocals and & quot ; Lukin & quot ; is another strong rocker . Many people love this album for its eclectic nature and the fact that it does n't sound like anything else the band has ever done . That 's the problem No Code suffers from , it does n't sound like a Pearl Jam record .	-1
I had a lot of expectatations when I bought this album , having listened to her songs for about 5 years now . It just never grew on me no matter how long I listened to it . A few songs are okay but the rest of them are really disappointing . It does not have the spirit of her other albums .	-1
I have n't pulled this one out for 5 years or so . I 'm sorry that I did . I was making my best of Journey CD ( post Perry not included ) and searched Trial by Fire for a gem or 2 . I can honestly say this CD sorely sucks . I 'm almost sure these are out-takes from the last few CD 's in the 80 's . How many balads are there on this thing ? Take a look at the picture of the band on the jacket . Was Perry cut and pasted in ? He looks like he 'd rather be taking a crap . I love this band but this album was a mistake .	-1
This sounds like a downgraded version of Perry 's 1994 solo album `` for the love of strange medicine , '' which by the way was very good . You can feel the tension among the members of the band , here , that spoils the chemistry . Boy , what a long collection of unmemorable , plain dull songs . I can maybe salvage three tracks here : the single `` when you love a woman , '' mid-tempo rockers `` If He Should Break Your Heart '' and `` Forever in Blue , '' None of them , by the way , equal the poorest track from their previous album `` Raised on Radio . `` And I do n't know how one can explain the very poor production here given they had a huge comeback budget to record and promote this thing . I spent the full price back in 96 for the original release . What a shame . I would rather go ahead and download the extra track , another decent one , that Mr. Perry wants me to shell out another 15 buck to have . Very small minded thinking , whoever decided it .	-1
Apparently , their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down . 'Trial By Fire ' was the band 's '96 comeback attempt , but if I remember correctly this CD was a stiff from the get-go . I tried SO hard to get into this fifteen track disc , but even with a duration of 68 minutes , I just could n't . The songs do n't completely suck , they just do n't appear to have much life . Fantastic cover , do n't you agree ? If you 're an old school Journey fan , I encourage you to check out their new 2005 release , 'Generations ' with vocalist Steve Augeri , who 's been with the band for awhile now . That CD is surprisingly good , as I 'd give it 3 1/2 , maybe 4 stars . Keep in mind that guitarist Neal Schon is their 'key ' player .	-1
I 've never been a fan of Celine Dion but I was surprised at how uniformly bad this CD is . Some of the songs might be reasonably good sung by someone else , but this woman has the ability of turning everything she touches into the worst kind of syrupy schlock . This has to be the most pretentious , overblown and ultimately ridiculous thing I 've heard in a long time . Miss Dion has a very powerful voice and she can certainly carry a tune , but she does n't know the meaning of the word subtlety , and that is essential for a singer . Despite all her wailing she does n't manage to convey any feeling at all . This woman can scream all right , but she ca n't sing .	-1
I am giving the 2 stars to the U.S. release because recently I had been to Canada and just happened to browse around in a CD store and came across Falling Into You . To my disappointment , there was an extra track on the canadian CD that was n't on the one I bought back home in America called Your Light . It 's a really good song and I do n't know why it was left off the U.S. disc . Not only that , but that song was released worldwide	-1
I liked the former album , & quot ; The colour of my love & quot ; , but this one is far worse in many ways . Just a couple of songs are worth paying attention and listening to . It 's a shame this got a Grammy Award . Both arrangement and instrumentation for this album were not well-done but just & quot ; medium-rare & quot ; , I think . In particular , I do n't like most accompniments were done by using synthesizers , which must be , I believe , an easiest way to perform ( and to save time and efforts ) . My impression from this album is that proper endeavours were not made by Celine and other people including recording engineers who made this one . To tell the truth , this album made me be afraid of buying her next albums . I really do n't think that singing songs well with nice voice is not all to & quot ; create & quot ; a meaningful album.But I still am a fan of Celine . I love her beautiful and powerful voice . I just want her to be better in all elements forming music other than singing itself .	-1
This is one of the worst rock cd that i ever listened . The only songs that i like are nine lives and full circle , the rest of them are very stupid and boring ! ! ! ! Aerosmith is n't cool anymore .	-1
Korn 's Cd is so bad . They do not play well they can not sing , the lead singer screams a lot and that is not good . I used to like them I do not know why . I cannnot wait until they are not popular anymore because they are not that talented at all .	-1
If it were n't for Jon having a nervous breakdown in the middle of making Peachy maybe it would n't have sounded so rushed . As it stands , it 's short , boring , not particularly well made and with only No Place to Hide , A.D.I.D.A.S and Good God to recommend it . GET FOLLOW THE LEADER !	-1
OOHHHHHH Korn your so stupid its not even funny hahahaha what the hell is that singer doing on the first song does he have gas or sumthin	-1
Life is peachy seems like it could have been a good album if Korn had devided to work on the album some more . Songs like Chi and Twist could have been good with some extra work . Low-Riders and ADIDAS are pretty funny but the album could have been alot better .	-1
They shipped me . Freak on a Leash , wtf , that 's not what I pay for . Wheres my actual order ? So upset , I guess Ill keep the CD but thanks for the wrong CD , I mean no thanks .	-1
I used to be a big Korn fan . This CD made me listen to other band , and eventually dislike Korn . I do n't like one song on this CD . Jonathan Davis 's voice is so bad here . Their debut was so much better ! Why was this one so bad then ? I do n't know . But this is really , really bad Rap Metal . Do yourself a favour , and give this one a miss .	-1
2 1/2There are clues abound that point to the classy merging of jazz-hop that could have been , but those end up merely being well-honed lines amidst misfired collaborations complete with cornball voiceovers .	-1
The good thing about this album is it show how good SRV was . Unfortunately that is so because it is painful to listen to other artists playing his songs . The only artists to come out of this presentation with any credit are Dr. John for his 'Cold Shot ' , Bonnie Raitt for her slide work and Eric Clapton for 'Ai n't gone'n give up on love ' . The message of the album was 'we miss you stevie ' which I can only echo after buying this album .	-1
It may have been a good idea to put on a tribute concert to SRV , and I hope the proceeds ( and the proceeds from the sale of this CD , the VHS , the DVD etc . etc . ) go to a worthy charity - although , since it is n't mentioned on the tin , I doubt they will - but in any case it does n't reward the listening.Each one of the featured artists is great in his or her own right , and if you want to catch some of that greatness , then buy the artist 's own CD . Same goes for Stevie Ray Vaughan . But do n't buy this.Just give this record the swerve - if you already own everything else by the artists concerned , buy a book or something , and improve yourself.Olly Buxton	-1
Certain soundtracks have a lasting impact due to the impression made in the movie . The true test of a soundtrack is to see how the music holds up to someone who has never seen the movie . Falling into the latter camp , I was given a copy of The Craft soundtrack by a friend who knew I was a Smith 's fan , and wanted me to hear the Love Spit Love version.The writing should be good ; Lennon-McCartney , Peter Gabriel , Ric Ocasek , Marianne Faithful , Morrissey-Marr . However , the execution left a little to be desired . That 's not to say this is a bad album , but it 's not exactly a great album either . For the covers , I kept wishing that I had the original copy of the song , with the exception of Our Lady Peace 's Tomorrow Never Knows . I would suggest that people take a listen to the original Peter Gabriel , Cars , Smiths , etc . songs and then listen to these versions .	-1
I ca n't claim to be Journey 's biggest fan , but I like 'em enough to own more than a few of their albums , their best being ESCAPE & FRONTIERS . Even though I 'm mainly a metal head , I can still appreciate the occasional `` light '' album , and these two are still great . But RAISED ON RADIO just sucks . I 'm sorry . It 's essentially a Steve Perry album and not a Journey album . I mean , Perry even produced it , so of course it 's going to be his . Why Neal Schon went along with this is beyond me . It 's also obvious why Ross Valory was n't on it . By this record , Journey only consisted of Perry , Schon & Jonathan Cain , with help from some guest bassists and drummers , one being Steve Smith . This album just has too many radio oriented love songs and typical pop nonsense . It 's very dated and has n't held up well over time . Too many overly 80 's style keyboards and funky bass playing really hurt it . Neal Schon 's guitar is also overlooked . The whole thing is just too `` happy '' and energetic ( you know , the kind of thing only high school girls like ) . However , I will say that there are a couple of decent songs , but not many . `` Be Good To Yourself '' is ok , as is `` Raised on Radio '' , but I really ca n't listen to the rest of it before I ask myself 'Why did they do this ? ' .I have no answer to it , other than that they wanted lots of airplay and this was the best way to do it . So , in closing , sorry die hard Journey fans , but this is n't even close to their best .	-1
Be good to yourself is probobly the gayest song these sell outs have ever done . It 's really hard to say which Journey album is the worst but if you say this one I wo n't argue with you .	-1
Buyer beware . These new Journey releases are reissues of their 1996 remastered releases . They are NOT remastered in 2006 . Rhino should be ashamed of itself for this ( it 's been 10 years - I would have gladly paid for a remastered version , but not for new packaging ) .	-1
I give it two stars because I agree with all of the reviews that state it as a repackaged and not a re-remastered release . I suspect it 's because this INFINITY and EVOLUTION have no bonus material added to them , so they got lazy and just repackaged them . All of the other Journey cd 's that have the bonus material sound better than the 1996 versions , and along with the remastered Steve Perry solo cd 's they are worth buying . If you have the 1996 versions of the above two cd 's INFINITY and EVOLUTION do n't repurchase these .	-1
this is the problem with current R-N-B all recycled music.these Young Lady 's have some talent but this run of the mill writting & amp ; music weighs whatever they may have down badly.since they come out with songs that repeat the subject three times please do n't become Puppets , puppets , puppets .	-1
Destiny 's Child debut album is really far from being nearly close to the magic & amp ; cleverness of the other Destiny 's albums . Full of filler cuts , surrounding the only worth song & quot ; No , No , No & quot ; , this is a sad start , but it was amended by the second album & quot ; The Writing 's On the Wall & quot ; . This is so anoying , that if you want the hit single , buy the commercial single or maxi.single . No even & quot ; With Me & quot ; the second single managed to keep it up with the audience .	-1
because only one song 's good .	-1
THis girl is very badly produced , she could be much better if people did n't tell her to scream instead of singing . Of course her numbers in records sold and tours are great , but this CD shows the same mistakes as before : screming instead of singing , pop-corn lyrics , electronic drumming .	-1
I 've been an IG fan for a long , long time now , but I really do n't like this album much . They seem to have forgotten that you can write a really great song using just a few chords and a couple of guitars . I also think that as their lyrics become more ideological , the music becomes less accessible . It 's not a matter of whether or not one agrees with the statements made ; I , personally , just do n't care for politics on my stereo . I think the Alternative/Lilith Fair crowd will like this album a lot ... but I 'm interested to hear what other long-time fans think of it .	-1
there 's nothing special about Silverchair 's music.in fact i wonder if Hanson had have caught on sooner would they be riding them as well ? same age.this album sounds like 2nd rate Nirvana & amp ; pearl jam.i do n't see what the big deal is about them .	-1
in some ways a return to form after a rather depressing second album , this one is a little too light and bubble-gummy , largely saved by the most quintessential suede song ever written `` picnic by the motorway '' . Too many songs are throwaways and begs the question why the single `` Trash '' 's b-side `` Every Monday Morning Comes '' was n't included on the album.There is little direction shown by the band which seems to be now treading water .	-1
A G3 concert seems more like a couple of guys showing off in the weightroom then musicians creating music . Satriani , Vai and Johnson try their hardest to get laid , they rip roar and try desperately to speed pick their way into the pants of every girl in the room . In other words , this is heartless guitar heroics without an ounce of musicianship . I 'm still not sure how three & quot ; guitar heroes & quot ; could completely miss the vibe of Hendrix 's & quot ; Red House & quot ;	-1
This music sucks so bad it 's an insult to canadian music . The vocals are unbearable too .	-1
Truly a band out of it 's time , bland pop of the Roxette school , middle aged married women may like it . It made me want to vomit .	-1
some great guitar rock ... .who cares though ? ric ocasek is maybe the best songwriter i pop today ! , but not 1 song that showcases this concept . what a waste of his writing talents . Note : billy corgon ( smashing pumpkins ) producer and plays on the album , ... not much help though.Come On ric you still have some great potential to do a break through album !	-1
What an amazing collection of songs . This makes it even more disappointing that the mastering is so harsh and `` redbook CD '' sounding . I 'm playing only DVD-A 's and SACD 's now and loving it but although this collection is stereo and not multi channel , it 's still a far too harsh and unmusical sounding presentation .	-1
I purchased this CD because it had the song Ghosts that I wanted to hear . I assumed that it would be a good CD since I really do enjoy Michael Jackson 's music . However , it was very disapointing . The only song that I really liked is & quot ; Ghosts. & quot ; Is it scary is nice but the rest of the songs , which were remixes of previous songs , were not my bag .	-1
Method : Take a monster , genre defining album you recorded over 15 years ago , borrow the voicings , polyrhythms and sound effects , rearrange them to slightly ( but not *that* ) different tunes , crib the album art ( cheesy then ; cheesier now ) and re-release.The point ? Well , to The Man , it 's obvious . There 's one born every minute . But for genuine , discerning afficionados of electronica ? Search me . Like a good souffle , it was better the first time.Indeed , inventing Oxygene Parts 7 - 13 is almost as pointless an exercise as going back and re-recording the original album from scratch . And guess what turned out to be Jarre 's next project ? Whoops ! Writer 's block , perchance ? Olly Buxton	-1
Belgium band with a very abstract offbeat sound . Some of the instrumentation has a nice atmospheric sound but the vocals make them sound like Everything But The Girl or The Cocteau Twins . Not my cup of tea .	-1
2 1/2Try as he might to escape generic entrapments present within stale blues-rock guitar virtuoso songwriting , even most bright runs feel dampened by the somewhat stilted pulse .	-1
This album is a complete sold-out by Satriani . I prefer & quot ; Flyign in A Blue Dream & quot ; and & quot ; Surfing With The ALien & quot ; .	-1
Well , concert performances are fabulous I admit , but I felt like , Joe did n't try as hard as he does usually , in studio works ... Like , he recorded these stuff in one boring studio day ... Perhaps greatest disappointment since the song called & quot ; snake & quot ;	-1
I like Steve Vai . I love Devin Townsend.I , however , do n't especially like this album . Their are some great parts , and some humourus parts , but overall there is about the same amount of bad as good ... which is really not what I look for in music.If you like great guitarwork and screams taht sound like someone is ripping their throat out with air , then you 'll like about half of this album , while the other half is odd little `` SHAKAZULU '' chants and weird stuff like this .	-1
this album was poo poo ... i put this cd into my car and hit play ... it starts off pretty good with a catchy beat but than the rapping started . i could n't beleive how bad these guys were at rapping , i mean b-real is tight ... we all know that , but these guys he recruited were straight garbage . they rap off beat and they try too hard to make it sound grimey , and it comes off just sounding bad . production was n't all that great either , alot of the beats sounded similar , and the bass did n't knock as hard as i would 've liked . all in all , i would wipe my a $ $ with this album .	-1
The Psycho Realm sounds like a cross between Cypress Hill and the Gravediggaz . At first many of the eerie beats are catchy , but too many of the songs sound similar and soon the novelty gets old . Not a bad debut , but I would n't recommend it for anyone unless they are a huge fan of B Real and the Hill .	-1
Do n't buy this unless you want to turn into a geek machine like the RAWW ( ... ) RRRR man ! Go Creed !	-1
I ca n't fault PJ for staying true to themselves and making music that ( I would hope ) is very satisfying to them . But I also ca n't fault a good share of the fans who picked up `` Ten '' and `` Vs. '' , who also stay true to their tastes in good catchy , hook-driven `` comfort food '' rock n ' roll and not wild experimentation and extreme tangents away from what originally got them where they are.What I 'm saying is , if you 're like me , and you found `` Ten '' and `` Vs. '' to be two of the best albums of the 90 's , but you found `` Vitalogy '' to be decent but a little too avant garde in its direction , steer clear of this and all post- '' Vitalogy '' Pearl Jam albums . They 're just not the same band anymore . And even if they occasionally show signs of the PJ of old ( as they do on excellent songs like `` Wishlist '' and `` In Hiding '' ) , it 's too little too late.Plus , you know you 're album 's going to bomb when the first single ( `` Given To Fly '' ) is instantly recognizable as a hack retread of a Led Zeppelin tune ( `` Going To California '' ) .	-1
Great band , but this album is for the diehard fans only . Too many skip-over songs . In fact , I really only repeatedly listen to one : Starseed.I prefer three of their other albums much much more : Clumsy , Gravity , and Healthy in Paranoid Times .	-1
The group sounds better without the lead singer . I understand they are in Europe now . I hope they will stay there . Music and politics do n't mix . I could care less about what they think .	-1
description did not say digipak but that is what i got for my 13.99.i like the content but i feel like i should get a jewel case for my money unless specified otherwise . amazon has good thing going but they have there problems more specifically their descriptions need to be more accurate and more thorough	-1
A good half of the songs on this album are in the key of G ; sit down with the guitar and figure them out yourself . Why ? Because Roger Waters wrote a majority of them , and came up with the lyrics , which are beginning to show the vile pomposity that made & quot ; The Wall & quot ; and & quot ; The Final Cut & quot ; impossible to listen to . Waters ' second-rate junior college philosophy class existentialism , and his attempts to be up-to-date by pointing fingers at social problems just like the punks of the day , sounds terribly dated now , as does the meandering , aimless and dull songwriting . The best thing about this record is David Gilmour 's singing and guitar playing . Other than that , there is very little to recommend it .	-1
Oasis had a formula . They liked it . It produced two very well-received albums for them , the first of which was good and the second of which perfected the formula and was wonderful . Then , of course the dilemma arrives . What to do next ? And Oasis , somewhat understandably , opted to try and replicate the formula.Now this is never a good idea . Oasis , because of their arrogant swagger , northern attitude and brash rock music , while being an excellent band , were always balanced precariously closely to dropping into self-parody . While they avoid this , they 're wonderful . When they do , the result is bad . That is the story of Be Here Now . An attempt to replicate previous success drops into self-parody.The lyrics , rather than being wonderfully obvious representations of the young working class generation , seemed forced in their attitude . This was probably because Oasis were less naive , and not technically working class anymore , meaning they needed to evolve , something they delayed until the following album , when their reputation was already destroyed.You see , Be Here Now must be viewed as the album that destroyed Oasis ' reputation . Whilst most British people still like some Oasis anthems from the first two albums , their public image went from brilliant rock idols to soggy Northerners making copycat , soggy songs . Which was a shame , especially considering that it marred the public reception of the next , and considerably better , album , Standing on the Shoulders of Giants.D'You Know What I Mean is a perfect example of their attempt to replicated themselves . Firstly , the title is a forced , working-class phrase to try and establish themselves as your mate down your local . Secondly , some of the lyrics are worryingly similar to those of 'Do n't Look Back In Anger ' . 'Look into the wall of my mind 's eye , I think I know but I do n't know why ' says D'You Know What I Mean . 'Slip inside the eye of your mind , do n't you know you mind find a better place to be ' said Do n't Look Back In Anger.There are , however , a couple of good tracks . Do n't Go Away is a welcome change from the Sour Mash , an emotional ballad . Also , Stand By Me is the only genuinely great anthem on the album , where as the others are trying to be that way.You can understand how Oasis got into the situation they did , and on reflection it seems somewhat inevitable that they would someday make a Be Here Now . At least it forced change on them for the next album , showing them that they could n't make the same music over and over again .	-1
Picture it . Your first album knocked everyone off their feet . Your second album propelled you to superstardom , and before you knew it the country was swaying drunkenly to your music . I suppose anyone would get ahead of themselves . And Oasis , with this third , somewhat regretted album from the Boys from Burnage , did.On the plus side , each song is n't bad on it 's own . I could easily listen to My Big Mouth on it 's tod , or Fade In/Out singled out . But in succession , these laughably overlong wannabe-epics feel ludicrous and out of place.The thing about epics is that they should be on their own , after a succession of sweeter , shorter songs . I mean Champagne Supernova sat at the end of ... Morning Glory , proving the perfect , calm yet dizzying end to an almost stupidly popular album . But an album of Champagne Supernovas would just be silly ... and here it is.When it 's good , however , it 's very good . D'You Know What I Mean is fantastic ... perhaps the album 's second only song that probably deserves it 's length . It 's like a slower , slightly downbeat Morning Glory . The other is All Around the World . Yeah I know , 9 minutes is a joke ... but it 's uplifting . Like the album , only it rarely lulls and ends with a beautiful coda that I personally prefer to Hey Jude.One odd thing is that the singles are good , but the rest feels like filler . Although I consider The Girl In The Dirty Shirt and Fade In/Out excellent , in comparison to the powerful Do n't Go Away and cheery Stand By Me , they look like jumped up B-sides . So the album comes to seem like a collection of rather substandard songs stretched to stupid length . And Magic Pie comes as the token-song-I-hate . For ... Morning Glory it was Hey Now . Here it 's Magic Pie . Long , dull , no discernable message ... it 's just Noel rambling , knowing what he 's talking about and not caring if we 're clueless . Even so , it 's Liam 's favourite of the album . I guess it just bores me.There 's still quality here . The title track is good , and It 's Getting ' Better ( Man ! ! ) is wonderfully fresh after All Around the World . But the album desperately needs to have been more sensible , more contained . Oasis need to remember that although good , and now infamous , they 're not Gods . And that no-one short of some infinitely patient monk living in a mountain would have patience to sit through 70 minutes of overblown B-Side-esque material . Easily their weakest album .	-1
I can see what Noel is tring to do on this album , hes tring to keep the rock/pop theme but slow it down a bit . It didnt work , He ended up with a lot of boring , annoying noise.The best tracks on the album are:1 . Stand by me2 . Fade in-out3 . It 's gettin ' better manThe ones to avoid are:1 . My Big Mouth ( pathetic ) 2 . The girl in the dirty shirt3 . Magic PieOverall , this is a huge disappointment and i would not recommend it .	-1
Oasis achieved phenomenal success with the release of their 1995 album & quot ; ( What 's the Story ) Morning Glory , & quot ; but then followed the unfortunate trend of having their next album suffer . Still , & quot ; Be Here Now & quot ; has its moments . The best song on here is obviously & quot ; All Around the World & quot ; . It 's long , pretentious , and has a stunning music video to go along with it ; it 's reminiscent of the Guns N ' Roses ' song & quot ; November Rain & quot ; . The album also houses & quot ; The Girl in the Dirty Shirt , & quot ; which is the nasaliest of any song Liam 's sung before or since . The rest of the album is mostly just OK , making this a major disappointment given the brilliance of their last album . Oasis completists will want this album ; everybody else would be wise to just buy & quot ; All Around the World & quot ; as a single and leave it at that .	-1
I 've gone back and forth several times , re-reading the glowing reviews here and re-listening to this CD , and I 'm almost convinced that there must be *two* Time Out of Mind 's , because the one I 'm hearing does n't match any comments here . I do n't hear anything landmark . I do n't hear anything transcendent . I do n't even hear anything that I can take seriously enough to be convinced that it 's really dark . I hear trite , forced , bubbling-up expulsions that should n't be allowed to tarnish your music collection.The genre is clearly blues , though really bad blues , IMO . The production is overdone ( *very* late 80s ) ; otherwise , some of the tinkering of sounds could have been interesting . The lyrics are an incredibly powerful yawn , with the cleanest ones lifted from elsewhere . ( & quot ; going down the road feeling bad & quot ; ? & quot ; baby turn the lamp down low & quot ; ? ) . To describe its weaknesses could take eight or nine lengthy paragraphs , but its *so* weak that it is n't worth anyone 's time to write them . ... So I 'll stop.You should too , before ordering this . Pick something else . Anything else.Unless you 're buying a gift , for someone you do n't like . Really do n't like .	-1
It takes a fair bit of critical contortionism to declare this any kind of masterwork , especially considering it comes from a man with a few genuine classics under his belt . Despite popular opinion , Dylan 's lyrics here are uniformly horrid , travelling the short distance between trite and awkward with less flourish than your garden-variety Hallmark card . Melodically the songs are indistinguishable from one another , with Dylan 's cracked honk blending into the thick soup of Daniel Lanois ' ponderous soundscape until it sounds like one of Brian Eno 's ambient albums as mewled by a goat . I 'd actually prefer the goat . Do Dylan a favor and pick up a copy of & quot ; Blonde on Blonde & quot ; or & quot ; The Basement Tapes & quot ; or even & quot ; Love and Theft & quot ; instead of this over-praised steamer .	-1
... HE HAS TO SHOW HIS `` THIS IS WHAT DEATH LOOKS LIKE '' FACE ON THE COVER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! bob is no musical genius ( no `` O '' in genius , people ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) but he is a genius exploiter.he duped a generation of hippies into believing his junk.its been said before , put some other drunk guys name on any of bobs cds and not one person would buy it.except for tom waits but that goes without saying .	-1
This is what 's wrong with people .	-1
Arguably Korn 's best cut , A.D.I.D.A.S . ( All Day I Dream About Sex ) is a catchy , rather disturbing song with lyrics reflecting a hormone-controlled ( sorry ; ca n't use the other word : -D ) kid who fantasizes of being a pimp . It 's a kind of song focused on the subject matter of what you want to be that you 'll never be . Understand ? Good ... The lyrics are well written for the most part . The chorus is just the same words of the title being repeated over and over again , only upgrading the last word in it to obscenity . The only problem I have with that is the edited version of the song . The editing was done in the right places , but they added some really annoying noises in the place of the edited word making it unlistenable . I strongly advice you to stay away from anything by Korn that is edited.The music sounded excellent to me at first . I remember it being rather short ( only 2 minutes and 34 seconds or something ) , and it had a way of embedding itself deep inside your head after listening . That is because Jon Davis 's vocals were quite superb in the repeated chorus . It 's amazingly well sung there , with each word sung carefully and overwhelmingly . The verses were mumbled in the same annoying fashion he did with everything else at the time , but enough about the vocals . The thing that penetrates this song a good deal is the atrocious guitar-work . No chords , no riffs , just bass . The vocals really do make up , but imagine the song with grinding guitar-riffs . You more-than-likely wo n't mind at all at first however.Now I do n't think I have to mention that you should n't get this single disc . Buy `` Life Is Peachy '' ( Korn 's crowning masterpiece even though I do n't like them too much ) instead . This is the song that really boosted them into the mainstream and it began the downfall from there ( although they have redeemed themselves somewhat with `` Untouchables '' ) . BTW , the remixes Korn did here are beyond awful and need to be gone . That 's it . Peace ...	-1
The duet of Ronnie Spector and Darlene Love singing & # 34 ; Rockin ' Around the Christmas Tree & # 34 ; is definitely one of the top five exciting Christmas performances of all time and easily justifies the cost of this album . The remainder of the album is pretty weak , but there will probably be a few other tracks that appeal to any particular taste .	-1
heres an interesting phenomenon that seems to repeat itself quite often , ancient singer enjoys well deserved comeback with catchy single , follows it up with an album that contains the hit single and a disappointing clutter of filler tracks. & quot ; practice what you preach & quot ; , the song that put barry back in the picture is here , and it is incredible , possibly the best song he ever recorded . the remainder of this album is dull , repetitve and unimaginative , and not worth hearing . in short , its awful . that pretty much sums it up.i 'd recommend the new double album , the & quot ; essential barry white & quot ; , for everything you need .	-1
I bought this album on the strength of `` Negasonic Teenage Warhead '' which I think kicks majorbutt ! ! However after listening to the whole album , nothing else even comes close to the energyof that song . If you are looking for more of the same , you too , may be disappointed . I 'm not astoner , so maybe I am missing something in this music . I was able to get this through the Amazonmarketplace for a couple of bucks , so I just think of it as the purchase of a really long CDsingle : ) .	-1
2 1/2Sting gets to let out all of his new age urges in doing the soundtrack for this underwater doc . Including a few of his vocal-based songs from previous solo work to wet the appetite , unfortunately the background-coasting , generic Caribbean vibe which pervades a majority of instrumentals makes the title an unworthy purchase .	-1
How coincidental that Amazon is putting a package together to get the greatest hits of both of these bands . They were the ultimate examples of why I abandoned most of FM radio and just played my own albums . Overplay the same overblown songs done by bands with lousy lead singers with poofed-up hairdos.I grew up in the Chicago area , and Styx played our high school while I was a student . Most of the audience I guess got it , but I never did . I suppose the same could be said of the record-buying public who also saw something I never did . If a lot of people like this stuff , great , but why it deserves a greatest hits album is beyond me.The band is promoted as a rock band , but there are more ballads on this than actual rockers . Some of the ballads are good , but `` Lorelei '' is about the sappiest thing ever recorded that became a hit . I really hate Dennis DeYoung 's voice , and if I were Lorelei , I 'd head for the hills if this person came to me singing like this.If it were n't for the addition of Tommy Shaw , would the band have even survived , much less put out a greatest hits package ? What also bugs me about the band is that some of their songs are long introductions that never go anywhere . `` The Best of Times '' is an example of me wondering when the song is going to start . And `` The Grand Illusion '' is a lower grade version of Emerson , Lake , and Palmer , who did this stuff a lot better.Finally , we have `` Mr. Roboto '' , where the band tried to create a world where music is censored . You want this theme , get the far superior `` Joe 's Garage , Part 1 '' by Frank Zappa . With `` Mr. Roboto '' , I really think that Dennis DeYoung believes in the Easter bunny .	-1
I should punch myself for owning this . The crazy thing is , that once this music was popular . Mr. Roboto ? What were they thinking ? I recently saw the Styx Behind the Music . Yikes , they basically admitted they stunk , but laughed all the way to the bank . Ugh . If you like meaningless music , go ahead and buy this junk . If not , welcome to the land of the living .	-1
seems like anything before year 2000 sucks , this is even a remaster , does not matter , sucks for sound . If I have to turn all my cd players up to near full blast to get a half way decent sound out of it , then it sucks . seems anything redone or released 2000 or later I only have to turn it up 2/3 or 3/4 at most to really get it jamming.man do I ever miss the days of albums.Listened with Sennheiser 595 's , the best that I have found , had 555 for a couple years they are nice too , but cant touch 595 's , pay the dif and see , er I mean hear .	-1
They seem to be the only band I see on VH1 classic now . I love me some classic , but it 's time for Styx to go the route of Toni Basil and just go into choreography . I liked the behind the music because they really had some good , solid conflict . I keep hearing their songs everywhere and they are kind of wimpy . I love Mr. Roboto because I too , have dealt with the inner workings of a japanese robot society . It 's not something you share with the group and I 'm someone who works and plays well with others . I do n't have a problem personally with styx because I admire the guts it took to wear some of the satin outfits they did . If I programmed VH1 classic , it would be Toto , toto and a side of more toto . Can you get enough of `` Africa '' or `` Roseanna '' ? It 's like a dang chinese buffet to me in that I know I do n't `` need '' more General Tsao , but darned if I do n't pile another load on my plate . Styx is more like greek food , it 's not bad , but you certainly ca n't eat it everyday without pooping .	-1
Although not Joans biggest fan , none the less , I am a fan . The mix on this album is off center and choppy . A few good songs but they do n't flow like they should on a circuit . Joan is better on MP player as you can glean the arrangements . her studio cuts are far superior to these half and halves ( live and studio ) . Only C.D . I 've not been satisfied with in a long time .	-1
Sorry , folks , this one does n't quite cut the mustard . It 's OK , but nothing special . Merely adding a bunch of crunching , disorted guitar chords to some fiddle playing does not an exciting folk-rock album make . This is clearly the case of a FOLK musician trying to make a ROCK album , but he has no clue as to how to go about it and resultingly sounds out of his element . If you want to hear what truly exciting Celtic Rock is , check out Tempest 's `` Gravel Walk '' and `` Turn of the Wheel '' , Wolfstone 's `` Unleashed '' , or Horslips ' `` Book of Invasions '' : there is intricate interplay among various instruments , at times each instrument solos , at others , all the instruments join together in note-for-note harmonious unison to form a powerful melodious wall of sound . There is nothing of the sort here . The fiddle player just wails away while the guitar player plays power chords and drones beneath the wail . No interplay from the guitar , no soloing , no note-for-note unison . In short , nothing interesting musically is going on and nothing to maintain the listener 's interest . This simplistic , fiddle-over-guitar chords formula rapidly becomes tiresome and boring . Good try , Ashley . Better go back to the drawing board before trying anything like this again . Or better yet , just stick to folk music ( the folkier tunes are the better ones on the album ) .	-1
The titles give it away : & quot ; 18 Til I Die , & quot ; & quot ; The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You , & quot ; & quot ; Do To You , & quot ; & quot ; I Wan na Be Your Underwear. & quot ; This is a work of deliberate immaturity , not a valiant effort to recapture youthful exuberance . This is just a mistake for a performer who is capable of quality material . There are & quot ; guilty pleasures & quot ; from such obviously infantile lyrics but they do not hold up for more than any one song . Add in Adams ' worst movie theme ( & quot ; Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman & quot ; ) and you have what is possibly Adams ' worst CD .	-1
The only reason why I listen to this CD is because of & quot ; If it makes you happy & quot ; , & quot ; Everyday is a Winding Road & quot ; , and & quot ; A Change Will Do You Good & quot ; . The album was sooo disappointing because it is nothing like & quot ; Tuesday Night Music Club & quot ; .	-1
This is the most overrated album I 've ever heard . There is not an origanil song on here . I 'm sooo disappointed .	-1
I am a Huge Carpenters fan , but this CD is a real disappointment , even Herb Alphert of A & M ; had to reject it and it layed dormat for 13 years.It 's Karen alright , but ver vocals are not used to the max , the songs just dont have that magic as most Carpenter CD 's do.If your a huge fan , buy it for your collection , otherwise there is not a whole lot to offer .	-1
This is truly the most overrated album of all time . Nevermind ? Ten ? Dark Side of the Moon ? The Wall ? Wish You Were Here ? Sgt . Pepper 's ? Machine Head ? Images and Words ? Wishmaster ? Lift Yr . Skinny Fists ? OK Computer ? Disintigration ? The Downward Spiral ? RATM ? Nevermind the Bollocks ? Anything by Minor Threat ? Reign in Blood ? Ace of Spades ? Evanescence 's worthless Fallen ? Hell no . This is the king , always and forever .	-1
I was there when this album first came out . I bought it the first month it hit the shelves , simply to own an album by a band associated with Andy Warhol . In 1967 , he was hip , cool , and perfectly tuned into popular culture . I took the album home , peeled off the banana peel on the cover , put the record on and was disappointed . `` Sunday Morning '' was obviously meant to be a hit single but never made it . `` Femme Fatale '' was a lovely ballad written by Lou reed which was destroyed by a [ poor ] arrangement on guitar , lousy production , and stunningly bad singing by Nico . The other songs were dreary musical dirges about drugs , s/m , etc . The very poor production quality made the album stand out as raw to many . To my ears , it just sounded like garbage . I returned the album to the store the next day . About 30,000 people bought the album and then it died at the stores . A miserably unsuccessful debut album in a year full of great musical highlights.Fast forward ahead to 1969 . The Velvets are falling apart . They can barely pay their rent . Lou Reed composes two great songs for the `` Loaded '' album : `` Sweet Jane '' and `` Rock and Roll '' . They get some airplay and plenty of groups rip off the chords for those two songs . Then , the group dies . Not much of a legacy.People go on and on about what a great group this was but no one took them seriously then and few can put up with them now . Who wants to hear a hymn to `` Heroin '' in this day and age ? Lou Reed wrote a handful of good songs , that is all . So what is with the supposed legendary status of this group ? They were a garage band who almost made the `` C '' ( not `` A '' or `` B '' ) list because of the two songs mentioned .	-1
I 've been hearing about this band forever . People really like them . That 's awesome . However , these guys dont even mask ripping off other artists . There She Goes Again , IS , Hitch Hike from the Rolling Stones . I have never heard a band rip off anything like that before.I think this CD is pretty lame . If you want to buy something different thats a bit off the mainstream , do n't start here .	-1
Although this album is not a heavy listening experience , in that there are no heavy metal type of sounds , there are screeching violins that are just as disturbing . The song Heroin is an attempt to reconstruct the musical feeling of taking heroin and the attitude towards it , the most scything feeling on the entire album . Sometimes they sound like the Byrds and sometimes they sound like the Stones but the sound is original in its energetic impact . Seems as if there were so many modern musical masterpieces released in 1967 ... yes this is one of them and worth its place on anybody 's must listens .	-1
OK , let me start off by saying that I am indeed a VU fan and do not write this to bash the band , I just want to warn those who are unsuspecting and think that this package is actually & quot ; deluxe & quot ; , because it 's not . This album is essentially the original release , some Nico songs thrown in and the un-edited version of the album . This may sound like a lot of great stuff , but pay attention . The Nico songs can be bought seperately , they are not exclusive to this release . But the real problem is that the second disc sounds so identically similar to the original that it defeats its own purpose . I 've listened to the discs with headphones on and there are differences , but they are so small and slight that even the most devoted fan probably would n't be able to tell the difference in a blind taste test . If you are trully a completionist and want every VU release , by all means knock yourself out , but if you already own the original do n't waste your money . Finally , if you do n't own the original or the deluxe , definitely by the original , it is one of the most under-rated and under-appreciated rock n roll albums of all time .	-1
I have committed certain critical suicide by bashing this album , but so be it . For all of the hushed , awed appraisals of the 1967 VU release `` The Velvet Underground and Nico , '' I really doubt that anyone truly enjoys this album -- those who claim to are simply falling victim to `` Well-I-guess-I'm-supposed-to-like-this '' syndrome . There are countless albums that are more original , more melodic , more inspired , and , especially , more timeless than this one.I guess I heard VU too late in life -- when I finally purchased a copy of `` Nico '' last year , I was preparing myself to be stunned by what my friends called `` visionary music . '' What I got in return was a collection of quaint , jangly guitar rock songs , not unlike a softer version of The Who . It has some original character of its own , with a few fey guitar distortion parts and screeching viola lines thrown into the mix , adding a somewhat bizarre and obtuse character to Lou Reed 's bluesy compositions . Occasionally , an actual tune ( i.e. , `` Sunday Morning '' ) emerged from the 'experimentation , ' but even its melodic merits sounded dated and clich & eacute ; to my modern ears . That 's the chief problem with `` Nico '' -- once you have heard the music of VU-influence bands like the Jesus and Mary Chain , Joy Division , and the Stooges , you do n't turn back to this primordial album . It may have been alt-rock 's blueprint , but it is not that genre 's definitive statement.I 'm sure that , at some point in time , VU sounded unlike anyone else . They were supposedly the antithesis of the `` flower-power '' movement of the late 60s , as if this is supposed to be some sort of admirable feat ( maybe it 's just me , but a lot of good and influential music came out of that 'wimpy ' hippie movement ) . Needless to say , VU 's golden moment has long since passed . Subsequent musical generations have outdone VU by tenfold ( yet try to find *any* band that has outdone the Beatles or the Stones ) , and their original catalog , including this album , seems now like nothing more than an antiquated , dusty chronicle . What 's more , it simply does not compare to the music of contemporaries such as the Beatles , Jimi Hendrix , The Who , et al ; it was n't like VU were the only ones 'breaking rules ' during the 60s . Such a forward-looking attitude was more the norm than the exception during this decade . To me , VU 's jangly rhythm guitars and cutesy background vocals do not constitute truely futuristic musical vision . Their 'sonic assaults ' are not at all shocking to my ears -- modern bands have pushed the envelope much further , and with better songwriting , to boot.VU may have made it to the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame ( a joke considering that the Stooges and so many other more deserving bands have been left outside looking in ) and they may be rock critics ' favorite child , but I dare anyone to say that VU 's music is n't hopelessly dated . Not only that , but it is also roundly mediocre , with tuneless arrangments and muzzy production that subtracts from any hope of an actual song rising to the fore . Call it 'cool , ' call it 'hip , ' but do n't call it genius -- to elevate `` Nico '' above the scores of superior albums that followed in its wake is akin to putting a unicellular amoeba above a developed human . To steal a line from Reed himself , `` what comes is better than what came before . '' How strikingly true .	-1
If you can sit through 17 1/2 minutes of `` Sister Ray '' `` suckin ' on that ding-dong '' , then go right ahead.There are a lot better records out there even if you are into the `` avante garde . ''	-1
I mean honestly , this album sucks . I know its supposedly the prototype for punk , but c'mon there are much better examples of proto punk , i.e . The Stooges . There is just too much heroin on this record . `` Sister Ray '' is a noisy mess . The only worthwhile track is the title track . The rest of the album is just an all out attack on quality music . Do n't get me wrong , I love rawness and imperfection in my rock music , but this is just crap . There are better representations of what the Velvet Underground were capable of and how influential they were for punk and indie music . Pick up the slightly overrated `` Velvet Underground and Nico '' and also the very underrated `` Velvet Underground . '' But skip this one all together . You 'll be better for it . nuff said	-1
I remember listening to this back in 1969 . I was less critical then . Like Hitchcock , I just do n't understand why folks revere Lou Reed .	-1
I bought this album in the cut-out bin of my local record store way back . Although I am not sure , I do n't think Eric played that much guitar . Most of the work was done by George Terry . I recall that Clapton 's lack of interest in playing the guitar was a frequent complaint from concert goers at the time .	-1
I 'm a huge Supertramp fan , but I was crushed upon purchasing this collection . I picked it up just before closing time and hurried home to make a cassette copy ( this was the late 80 's , ) only to find that they 'd shortened several of the songs , Goodbye Stranger in particular . I was sitting there , singing along with the stereo , and when the whistling solo was supposed to start , I started whistling right alongside , only I found myself whistling alone . CD 's like this one are the kind of things that give record companies a bad name . They might be okay for the casual fan , but if you 're serious about a particular group , I 'd steer clear of the A & M Classics releases .	-1
I have not purchased this and I wo n't . $ 50 for one cd ? Not me .	-1
I ca n't beleive the great reviews for this 60s turd . There is one great song ( A Salty Dog ) and the rest is terrible . The other songs are not good at all , and the singer does not have any range . He almost ruins the title track but the song is so good , it pulls through despite the stressful vocals . Get a Greatest Hits collection instead and avoid this !	-1
There is no questioning Rick Wakeman 's technical skill or importance as a progressive rock instrumentalist . However , this is what you end up with when your technique is more important than your creativity : dull , rambling , dated , unmelodic organ runs and cheesy & quot ; classical & quot ; piano instrumentals . If you 're still someone who thinks & quot ; Fragile & quot ; is the greatest album of all time , then this is for you . If you have any taste in music , avoid this at all costs .	-1
PERHAPS THE SINGLE WORST ATTEMPT AT MUSIC I HAVE EVER HEARD ! UNLESS YOU NEED A SUBSITUTE FRISBE OR HAVE RUN OUT CLAY SKEET TARGETS , DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ ANY ONE OF THE SEVERAL OTHER ONE STAR REVIEWS OF THIS TRASH BEFORE WASTING YOU MONEY . PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAD TO GIVE IT ONE STAR IN ORDER TO REVIEW IT . THE SINGLE STAR IS NOT DESERVED ! MOUNTAIN MAN DAN .	-1
Six Wives is so much better than this one.I bought this one and Yes 's Fragile at the same time . No comparison . Fragile is much more mature , elaborate , complicated , masterpiece.At some point I was so annoyed by the keyboard sound that I turned of the cd . As I am writting this review I am listening to the 6th Track `` Sir Galahad '' , and its really really bad . If I could have my money back I would return it in an instance .	-1
Herb Alpert and his friends at A & M ; should be ashamed for putting out a 12-selection album claiming to be someone 's greatest hits and then leave off four of the sixteen hits Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66 had from 1966 to 1970 under that title ( two more would be added under the billing Sergio Mendes & Brazil '77 in 1973 , and from 1977 to 1976 Mendes would add nine more , including one under the billing Sergia Mendes & Brasil '86 ) .But this is supposed to cover his Brasil '66 `` greatest '' so where are Constant Rain [ Chove Chuva ] , which was their second charter in early 1967 [ # 11 Adult Contemporary ( AC ) / # 71 Billboard Pop Hot 100 ] after Mas Que Nada ( # 4 AC/ # 47 Hot 100 ) , For Me [ # 16 AC/ # 98 Hot 100 in April 1967 ] , ( Sittin ' On ) The Dock Of The Bay [ # 12 AC/ # 66 Hot 100 in July 1969 ] , and Wichita Lineman [ # 34 AC/ # 95 Hot 100 in December 1969 ] ? These all fit into the category `` greatest '' by any definition of the word since they charted on both the AC and Hot 100 lists.The same can not be said for Like A Lover , Goin ' Out Of My Head , Look Around , So Many Stars , and Day Tripper . With the exception of Like A Lover , which backed The Look Of Love in 1968 , these were n't even the B-sides of hits ! At least their cover of Joe Cocker 's With A Little Help From My Friends did go to # 31 AC in spring 1968.That 's not to say they are n't great performances , but come on folks . How hard would it have been to include at least all those that made the more lucrative Billboard Pop Hot 100 along with their B-sides and turn it into a 20-selection CD ? I do n't know whether you 've noticed or not , but not many people are buying 10-12 selection CDs these days . Something else we like to see are informative liner notes . This has none at all.A shoddy product from all angles .	-1
It is so so , does n't sound right , very tinny , do n't buy it ! Find another greatest hits , this ca n't be the only one ... no good !	-1
Fine music for his fans , but Herb Alpert did not survive the test of time for me , and I decided his albums were not keepers . ( Note - I am very picky in my record evaluations , and give a thumbs up -- four or five stars -- only to albums where I can play the whole record and delight in hearing every single song . )	-1
Other than & quot ; Do n't You Forget About Me , & quot ; and & quot ; We Are Not Alone , & quot ; this soundtrack is basically garbage . Do n't waste your money on this one , get these two tracks from other sources and forget the rest . There , you were warned .	-1
I recently reacquired this album as a CD and am wondering what I ever saw in it when I was younger . Crisis ! What Crisis ! came out at a time when Supertramp seemed to be intent on singing all their songs in an even more irritating falsetto than usual and much of it is pretty inconsequential . That said , the album has more highs and lows than the grossly over-rated Crime of the Century , and two tracks in particular -- Soapbox Opera and Two of Us -- are worthy to be included in any compilation album . But if you want a classic Supertramp album , you 'd better look to Even in the Quietest Moments .	-1
I can only reiterate the complaints other reviewers have stated about this reissue . With all the nice repackaging jobs that have been done with classic albums ( Sonic Youth 's `` Goo '' , ABC 's `` Lexicon of Love '' ( UK 2xcd ) ... ) , this one definitely falls to the bottom of the barrel . Of course , the album is a classic , as every song on it could be considered a `` single '' and received ( deservedly ) radio airplay . So with all the technology available now to improve the sound from the original tapes , you would think they 'd do this one right . Wrong . The sound quality is just ok , perhaps an improvement over the original CD , but not an overwhelming improvement as with some other reissues ( Rolling Stones , Bob Dylan , `` Dark Side of The Moon '' ) . Part of the problem is that it 's just another CD , no 2nd layer of DVD-audio or SACD DSD on this . So no Hybrid disc that would really improve the quality of the audio.This release also contains no bonus material on the first disc , but puts it all on the 2nd , which for some is good because it retains the original album feel , but for others is a waste of disc space . If there was stellar material to add it would n't be much of a problem , but I think that the folks at Universal realized the bonus material did n't quite fit . For the bonus material on the second disc they add the songs from the Mike 's Murder soundtrack that had vocals and one side of the live double album that heavily featured songs from `` Night & Day '' . Why not just digitally remaster these & release them as complete albums ? Of course , they probably will eventually get around to it & then you 'll have to shell out some more $ $ $ to Universal to get them.While it 's nice to get demo material for this recording , these demo versions have to sound closer to the actual album versions than any demos I 've heard . The `` demos '' are basically the album tracks , but with just piano , Joe 's voice & synths/drums , no additional instruments.To add to all these shortcomings , there actually is material from this period that could have been released on this reissue as bonus material , but was n't . First , the spanish versions released on the `` Real Men '' EP & used as b-sides on singles ( El Cancer , El Blanco , & Un Otro Mundo ) . Then there was also the 12 '' Extended version of TV Age & I think there was another 12 '' version or perhaps instrumental version of one of the other album songs . None of this studio material was included , not to mention any of the unreleased live material from this time.The packaging is a double digipack , which wo n't stand up over time ( likely to tear ) & is annoying to have to pull out of the sleeve ( which has the actual track listing on it ) just to open it up & pull out the discs before you can play them . The included booklet has the obligatory new liner notes from someone no one 's heard of , and they do include information on musicians for tracks , but there 's only 1 picture of one of the original 7 '' s & no info on the original singles or album 's release ( pictures , dates & countries released , charting etc. ) . The liner notes do include the song lyrics though.So what reason is there to fork over the exorbitant amount they are asking for this `` expanded '' issue rather than ripping it ? None . And the music industry wants to know why CD sales are plummeting . It 's not just because of file-sharing . It 's because the music industry releases pathetic stuff like this & asks you to fork over a day 's wage for it .	-1
When will Polydor stop and think for a minute about how they want to re-issue the James Brown catalogue ? How many times will they release & quot ; Make it Funky & quot ; , & quot ; Please Please Please & quot ; , & quot ; My Thang & quot ; , & quot ; Get on the Good Foot & quot ; , & quot ; Doing it to Death & quot ; , and the twenty or so other extremely redundant titles ? Where , for example , are & quot ; rare & quot ; tracks like & quot ; Papa 's got a NEW brand New Bag & quot ; from & quot ; Everybody 's Doin ' the Hustle & quot ; or & quot ; Give the Bass Player Some & quot ; from & quot ; NonStop & quot ; ? Though this is a decent collection , it is sad that so much good stuff is locked in the vaults , while the same songs keep ending up on different CD 's ( & quot ; Star Time & quot ; , & quot ; 20 Greatest Hits & quot ; , & quot ; CD of JB 1 & amp ; 2 & quot ; , & quot ; Dead on the Heavy Funk & quot ; , & quot ; Funk Power 1970 & quot ; , ad nauseum ) .	-1
I have over 2000 CDs in my collection , and I 'm always thrilled to discover remastered versions of CDs that I dearly love . I 've generally found remastered versions to at least offer a slight improvement to the sound , but this release is different . It is the first remaster I 've purchased to make the sound worse - much worse . The sound is harsh , brittle , and very compressed . Fortunately I also have a Mobile Fidelity copy , but I was hoping for an improvement over that with all of the major advances in mastering technology that have occurred over the last several years . If you have a typical audio system , and are just interested in casual listening , it wo n't be a problem - just turn down the treble . But if you have spent a considerable amount of money on your system , and you seek out improved versions of CDs you already own , this is n't your bus .	-1
To make a long story short , if you want a great sounding version of this , seek out the Mofi Gold version . That version sounds absolutely incredible with a super-smooth high-end , punchy bass , and incredible dynamics . This version has a very harsh high-end , muddy bass , and is compressed beyond belief . Use the title track and compare both versions above ; you will not believe how lame this remaster is . The EITQM remaster is even worse ! ( Strangely , the & quot ; Crisis ? What Crisis ? & quot ; remaster was acutally very well done ! ) If you like recordings whose dynamics have been chopped off at the knees or will solely be playing it through a boom box , by all means order this CD . Audiophiles need not apply ...	-1
Oh how dissapointing that Supertramp went down the road of bubblegum , seeking middle of the road AM play . They used to be so good , but followed up their excellent albums ( Crime of the Century and Crisis , What Crisis ? ) with the boring , flat Event in the Quietest Moments and the even worse Breakfast Over America . This is a totally forgettable album .	-1
Okay , so lessee ... the original CD came out in the 80 's some time , which sounded like junk . Then the remastered version came out in 1995 , which sounded fine . So what , if I buy it a third time , will they come and play at my house ? Uh 'scuse me , is n't there something better you folks could do with your time ? It 's no wonder Universal has to cut prices on their CDs , what with brilliant reissue projects like this .	-1
This is one of of Police records I like most . Unfortunately , there is something wrong with SACD Amazon sent . It is not recognized by my McIntosh MPV861 , so I get not sound at all . I tried to send it back from my country but Amazon 's shipping agent in Venezuela ( UPS via Aerocav ) is charging almost USD 120 to return it , so at the end it is cheaper to keep this not sounding sacd here at home .	-1
Dirty record , does n't play thru .	-1
This album is simply embarrassing , especially after the beauty of hits like `` Babe . '' `` Mr. Roboto '' ranks among the most annoying songs ever written ( `` secret secret , I 've got a secret '' chirping in the background ... . ! ! ! ) and one wonders what the band was imbibing when they wrote this lame attempt at a rock opera instead of simply listening to `` Tommy . '' Spare your ears at all costs .	-1
The irony of the song `` Do n't let it end '' is the key here . The Styx empire of classic rock ended with this album . I will state my status as a Styx fan prior to `` Kilroy Was Here '' and after . Prior to KWH I had the `` Paradise Theater '' album and I did enjoy it as a kid back then . It may not have been the best Styx album of all time but it was their most popular and pretty consistent as an album . Before `` Paradise Theater '' , I only knew of Styx from the singles of that era . Back in the 45 rpm era , those were what really sold in that time . I have the 45s of `` Babe '' and `` Lights '' and I think I have `` Why me '' also . Anyway , I was a limited Styx fan at the point of time when `` Paradise Theater '' came out.As for the `` Kilroy Was Here '' days of Styx , I was just getting into being a Rush fan so honestly KWH was not on my musical radar at the time . With me the controversial side of the release of the album does n't even have a say in my musical history so no story from me here about that . I really only know of the controversy from seeing the VH1 special in the 90s.On to the review , I think a two-star rating is fair enough . After just now listening to the album in it 's entirety for the first time in a year or so , the weak songs are still weak to me . I do happen to love `` Mr. Roboto '' , I do like `` Do n't let it end '' very much and `` Heavy Metal Poisoning '' is a pretty good rocker , but the rest of the songs are just not good , IMHO . I know some people on here list other tracks and they have stated their opinions of them and I respect that , but honestly the rest of the tracks are weak in comparison to the three mentioned above.Get this cd only for completist purposes only . Start with `` The Grand Illusion '' `` Pieces of Eight '' `` Cornerstone and `` Paradise Theater '' and then go to the ones prior to those in the repretoire of Styx.For those wanting a return to greatness of this once great band quickly order `` Return to Paradise '' , a great live CD and DVD . A truly magical experience and a heluva good show.In conclusion , I would not call `` Kilroy Was Here '' a total travesty but given that the band was for all intensive purposes kaput after this particular episode , this should tell the tale . But in all honestly , like in sports , ca n't win em all .	-1
Poor Dennis tried to write for the there and the then , with disco . There was nothing wrong with their music before , and it 's not like they were going poor . Do n't Let it End was a nice ballad , and Tommy 's Have n't we been here Before ? was a slow relaxing track , but that just does n't cut it . Double life was kind of funny in an interesting way , but that 's it . The rest is just disco as a lame attempt to get popular . Maybe this was the reason Tommy left for Nugent and Spades . They were back on the trail in '99 with Brave New World , but from 83'-98 ' , Styx was on a big break from music . Welcome back Styx !	-1
If you have every seen the `` Behind The Music '' episode on Styx you know that `` Mr. Roboto '' was the album that killed the band . The other members wanted to play hard rock but Dennis DeYoung wanted to put on make-up and write Las Vegas-style floor shows . Things came to a head when the group began their Mr. Roboto tour by sharing the bill with a couple of straighforward Southern Rock bands . The audience showed up , waiting to hear driving , no-nonsense rock music . Instead , they got the members of Styx on a stage that was designed to look like THE FUTURE , dancing with mask-wearing `` robots , '' and saying scripted lines like `` No Mr. Roboto , you ca n't take rock-and-roll away from the kids of America ! '' The audience booed and threw beer cans . That was the moment when the members of the group decided to go their separate ways . It is one of the funniest moments in rock history.Dennis DeYoung is either the most self-diluted musician in rock or he is an absolute comedic genius . Either way , we all owe him a debt of gratidute for creating the greatest bad album of all times.By the way , I suspect that every favorable review posted on Amazon.com was actually written by Dennis DeYoung himself . I assume he has nothing better to do now that Styx has re-formed and is performing without him .	-1
This was somewhat enjoyable when it came out in 1984 . The biggest problem this album has now is that it simply does n't age well at all . Dennis DeYoung 's writing was really starting to feel like a bad Andrew Lloyd Weber musical . Is that redundant ? Was it intentional ? Buy this if you are completing your collection but Styx needed to break up after this . Of course , their regroup came too late to recapture this fan .	-1
Whoa , what a bad album . The Police , who were formerly a respectable little reggae-rock band , go adult contemporary . Every song but one is mellow , harmless , and slathered in ambient keyboards . I do n't think that 's what most Police fans wanted to hear from the group - I , for one , would rather listen to `` Do n't Stand So Close to Me '' or `` Message in a Bottle '' than `` Mother '' ( which I think might be the most universally despised Police song , their `` Dogs of War '' , if you will , and it 's not like I 'm giving it my vote of confidence ) , `` O My God '' , `` Walking in Your Footsteps '' or `` Tea in the Sahara '' . The only song that is n't white bread pop , `` Synchronity 2 '' , is a great reggae-rocker , and a deserved Top 40 hit . The good news is the three major singles , which do the same atmospheric thing but are far more successful with it : `` King of Pain '' sports a stunning solo from Andy Summers ; the disorienting # 1 `` Every Breath You Take '' ( which might as well be Possessive Stalkers Anonymous ' anthem ) has so many brilliant arranging details that even its near-endless radio play simply can not diminish its virtues , and `` Wrapped Around Your Finger '' has got to be my favorite song on the album ; its dreamy keyboards and Caribbean production make it downright scary , and is that not a hugely catchy refrain ? But there are too many turkeys contained , and you can find the four classics on any Police collection worth talking about . Why buy it when the other four are so much better ?	-1
Just was n't impressed by this album . I do n't know where to begin , just no songs I liked , but I ca n't put my finger on why I did n't like them	-1
I 'm a HUGE Cat Stevens fan . I have purchased all the remastered cd 's . They all sound great except for this one . I seriously doubt they got the original master tapes on this one . The drums have absolutely no punch whatsoever on this disc . This disc has the dynamic range of a normal run-of-the-mill cassette tape . Please guys ... ... I 'm begging you ... ... find the original master tapes and reissue this again to correct the blasphemy of this cd .	-1
I bought a vynil copy of this album at a local used-record store not knowing what to expect . Since it was from 1982 , I guessed that it would have a lot of the minimalist/contrapunctal type stuff that Fripp was into in that period . It does , but there does n't seem to be very much variety in the pieces . In fact , the whole album seems to drag along with no real idea of it 's own purpose . I think Fripp recorded this simply because he was in the studio with Summers . I strongly doubt that some of the pieces were even practiced beforehand.There are a few & quot ; ambient & quot ; -style tracks thrown in for variety , but these pieces sound as though Fripp and Summers listened to a heap of old Eno records and tried to copy his style . That might be exactly what they did.So I would say that if you are a Fripp completist , or really like his ticky-ticky guitar style of the early eighties , you will probably enjoy this disc . If not , you might find it aggravating . And DEFINETELY do n't buy this based on a liking of king Crimson - Fripp outside of his band is a different player .	-1
As the liner notes ( on the album I own ) indicate , Bewitched consists mostly of Summers ' work and compositions , due to Fripp not having the time in his schedule to join Summers for the work . For Fripp fans , expect an album more along the lines of & quot ; Fripp shows up and adds some interesting accompaniment and a few solos. & quot ; For Fripp fans and collectors , the album has interesting points , but it 's a step down from I Advance Masked , and not in the same ballpark as Fripp 's contributions to , say , Another Green World or Scary Monsters .	-1
Taking an artistic risk is typical for Joe Jackson , an artist who refuses to be placed in a category . But BLAZE OF GLORY does not work for me . Starting with the anthem `` Tomorrow 's World '' which sounds like something Starship would do , Jackson constantly reaches for a grand statement about life and the pain and joy that touches us all , but through a number of curious musical choices the theme falls flat . Bouncing around from pop to jazz to Greek influenced instrumental ( ? ) , the music lacks the focus to move the story forward . I ended up being more distracted by the music then being moved by it . The songs are also designed to lead from one to another which will also lead to a jarring dissonance . Lyrically the anger and pain is well expressed but there is a sense of `` heard this before '' that kept me from wholeheartedly following along . Even the title track is strangely reminiscent in theme to a number of other `` Burned out before they fade away '' songs . I can see by some of the other reviews that this CD has touched others deeply , but I found myself unmoved by the trials and tribulations within .	-1
Well , I like the first track , loder than love and get on the snkae but this cd is held back by poor production and Cornell 's vocals are losy on this cd . It 's a shame because it could have been a really excellent cd but poor production holds it back . Thhe next three cd 's , however , would be well produced and put soundgarden on the map .	-1
Styx were famous for big , emotive ballads like `` Babe '' and `` Lady '' but this album does n't deliver in terms of memorable songs . Show Me The Way is representative : a big number , but neither melodic nor emotional enough to stick in the mind .	-1
Ok well I went to a cd store to listen to this album again to make sure this was as bad as my review said it was and It is bad . I remember it being bad but not this bad . God man this is worse then I thought possibly even worse then any Journey album with Steve Perry . Love is the ritual opens up this album and uggh that is so god awful . And whats worse is thats probobly the best track on here . This is probobly even worse then Kilroy . I could n't listen to this all the way through it 's just to bad . It doese n't even sound like Styx . It sounds more like that band Magnum that noone knows from the 80s . This bassically is n't a styx album how can it be it sounds nothing like them . The ballads bore me to death worse then any Chicago ballad . I 'll stick to listning to a good rock album like Crytsal Ball . That one rocks in my book but this ? I am sorry but man for all you styx fans that do n't have this yet look for it used . I have seen in in the $ 1.00 bin , yes it is that bad . Worse actually . I would probobly sell this for whatever penny you found on the ground .	-1
OK , the song of Robin Hood is the song of our marriage , so have to like it , but have liked other Adams offerings more though many find some great tunes .	-1
The debut Blues Traveler CD was truly fascinating . Great jams fueled by some catchy songs such as Gina , But Anyway , Warmer Days , and Sweet Talkin ' Hippie.This follow up Travelers and Thieves CD has many good jams but many unmemorable tunes . As talented as the instrumentalists might be , after a while the endless noodling gets a little boring if a good melody is not present . All In The Groove is possibly the only piece with a noteworthy melody . Mountain Cry is not bad in the background with some good vocal interplay between John Popper and guest , Greg Allman . In time I could appreciate it a bit more . Onslaught is semi-memorable if a bit chaotic.However , the overall impression is that of boredom . The tunes all seem to blend together with little in the terms of variety and even originality . Even Popper 's harmonica blasts get wearisome midway through this CD.The discriminating fan will choose the first CD , Four , and Straight Until Morning and pass on this mess .	-1
The item arrived on time and in good condition although outer plastic case was cracked . This CD should have been the & # 34 ; Best Disco & # 34 ; ever recorded but it was rather a big letdown . I would recommend the & # 34 ; Bee Gees greatest Hits & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; A Night At the Roxbury & # 34 ; as perhaps the best disco album from start to finish .	-1
You probably know the story : Frampton Comes Alive sold about a gazillion copies upon its original release in 1976 , catapulting the formerly obscure artist to international stardom , and why not ? The whole package is such an appealing chunk of pop product that it really is hard to deny its power- there 's that almost iconic cover portrait , the inviting exclamation point in the title , and that trusty Rolling Stones cover towards the end . There 's `` Baby I Love Your Way , '' one of the most radio-friendly songs of all time , with its perennially hummable melody and fiercely inoffensive lyrics . There 's even an extended version of `` Do You Feel Like We Do , '' with that signature talk box guitar solo . I mean , never mind that the song is repetitive , unoriginal , and unbearably overindulgent , the guy makes his f***ing guitar talk ! Never saw Jimi Hendrix do that , did ya ? Probably because he was busy being , y'know , innovative.The whole album is covered in a layer of gloss so shiny that it 's hard to remember anything about any of the songs . The instrumentation is professional , the songs have hooks where conventional wisdom says they should be , and the lyrics are pleasantly forgettable . It 's music that sounds nice and feels nice , and when you play it , it melts into the background and does n't get in the way of whatever you 're doing , even if you play it kinda loud . And there 's a place in most music collections for that sort of thing , but in the end , I ca n't really imagine anybody playing this thing for pure listening pleasure very often .	-1
I just ca n't imagine listening to it again . I could swear I hear some yodeling in the background . He sure does know his ukelele though . OK , OK , the xylophone stuff is pretty good . The spoons and bells are alright too . I just think it 's prententious and arrogant . The banjo does n't even work ! Oh , and that harpsicord ! Just awful ! It sounds like he has one of those vibrating things for his throat . I geuss it has it 's moments - but not vary many of them .	-1
I like Simple Minds and I usually perfer live music over stale studio albums.This is one of the worst concert albums I have ever heard . The songs are all muddled and the music is indistinguishable . The group never sounds in sync . I think this is one case of a group that is much better in the studio than live .	-1
Live in Europe , Adams ' set includes all his hits up to 1988 ( & quot ; Cuts Like A Knife & quot ; & quot ; Summer of 69 & quot ; etc . ) Adams is an engaging live performer , but like most live sets this one is for fans only . It makes for a nice keepsake for the fan that wants to have an audio memory of an Adams ' concert , but it does n't quite capture the energy and charisma of Adams on tour .	-1
Although the band is very competent , there is something strange in this album . The performances lack energy ; maybe it 's the lack of overdubs , and this is how a live album should sound , I do n't know ... But it 's only for completists .	-1
I remember listening to the Moody Blues on radio years ago and really liked them . When I saw this CD , and that is was remastered , I thought it would be really good ( is n't remastered supposed to mean improved ? ? ? ) . What a huge disappointment ! The first song , `` Go Now '' , is the worst , sounding tinny and scratchy , nothing like I remember . The others are n't quiet as bad , but the quality just is n't there . This is poorly remastered . If you want Moody Blues music , listen to samples of their other CD 's first . This one is terrible .	-1
Polygram ceased production of its portion of Van-The-Man 's catalog , resulting in 29 titles , two-thirds of his entire recorded output , remaining frustratingly unavailable for the past several years . Even more regrettably , sixteen of those OOP titles had been fabulously remastered and re-released in 1998 . Accordingly , prices for these had soared , especially for the remastered titles.Then , in late 2007 , The Announcement ! All 29 OOP titles would be re-released in 2008 ! With new remastering ! Extra tracks ! Even mini-sleeve editions from Japan ! Well , fellow audiophiles and mini-sleeve aficionados , the hyperbole is unfortunately only half-true : Those 16 1998 remastered titles ? Except for the bonus tracks , the 2008 re-releases are the EXACT same remasters , right down to the ` 98 silkscreen scheme on each disc , and the ` 98 booklets , with only minimally text-modified for the bonus material and production credits.The ` 98 mastering work was performed by Ian Cooper at Metropolis Mastering in London . The ` 08 booklets credit another Metropolis engineer , Tim Young , for the new editions . However , the only effort Mr. Young expended on the sixteen 1998 titles was to sonically match the minute bonus content to the pre-existing ` 98 mastering.So , in this first 7-CD set ( Tupelo Honey , It 's Too Late To Stop Now , Wavelength , Into The Music , A Sense Of Wonder , Avalon Sunset and Back On Top ) of four 2008 scheduled catalog re-releases , only Avalon Sunset and Back On Top have been newly-remastered . As the Japan ` sleeve version of Back On Top was delayed until April , I have n't had the opportunity to A/B that disc . The result of remastering the 20-year-old Avalon Sunset could certainly be more pronounced than redoing 1999 's Back On Top , so that remains to be quantified . The Japanese also floated something called `` high-quality SHM-CD format '' on the mini-sleeve versions ( which are always my CD 's of choice ) , but I ca n't discern any audible improvement in that department , either . ( Although I have referred to my A/B set-up in other Amazon reviews , due to the subject matter herein , I should probably reiterate that my comparisons are made on two Sony XA7 transports , simultaneously running into a Camelot Uther DAC via matching Acoustic Zen coax cables , and monitored thru Sennheiser 590 's ) .This same existing-remaster+bonus-tracks scenario will apply for the other 1998-remastered titles to be released later this year : Saint Dominic 's Preview , Hard Nose Down The Highway , Veedon Fleece , Period Of Transition , Beautiful Vision , Inarticulate Speech , Common One , Live/Belfast , No Guru , Poetic Champions Compose and Irish Heartbeat.Do n't get me wrong , these all sound glorious . Yes , it is wonderful to have these fantastic recordings readily available once more , and again , yes , it 's great to finally have a newly-remastered Avalon Sunset . By the end of 2008 , it will also be especially joyous to own the other 13 never-before remastered titles.However , speaking for myself , who already owned all the remastered ` 98 's , the mastering sleight-of-hand was NOT appreciated , especially at mini-sleeve premium prices . There is also Polygram 's deplorable Enron-like tactic of taking the entire series out of production for an extended period of time to create demand , years longer than just the clearing of the older releases in the retail channel via sell-off would have required . As a retailer acquaintance once sagely observed : `` Nobody wants to buy anything until it 's deleted '' , a lesson the financially-struggling Universal Music Group ( Polygram 's odious parent ) is obviously applying in spades here . The record labels bemoan the loss of CD sales , but it is exactly this kind of manipulative marketing ka-ka that provides impetus to consumer alienation.So , if like me , you already owned the ` 98 's , the only decision in reinvesting in the ` 08 's are the a . ) meager-two-tracks-per-disc `` bonus '' material , and b . ) to-buy-or-not-to-buy the more expensive Japan ` sleeve editions . The bonus tracks could have been released as a separate set ( A `` Philosopher 's Stone Volume 2 '' , perhaps ? ) , but then , of course , Polygram would n't net the possible re-sale of 16 additional CD 's per VanFan.As for the desirability of the bonus tracks themselves , I 'll leave it to others to opine on whether the return on such a substantial reinvestment is either a worthwhile , or foolhardy , expense.WHAT IS A JAPAN `` MINI-LP-SLEEVE '' CD ? Have you ever lamented the loss of one of the 20th Century 's great art forms , the 12 '' vinyl LP jacket ? Then `` mini-LP-sleeve '' CD 's may be for you.Mini-sleeve CDs are manufactured in Japan under license . The disc is packaged inside a 135MM X 135MM cardboard precision-miniature replica of the original classic vinyl-LP album . Also , anything contained in the original LP , such as gatefolds , booklets , lyric sheets , posters , printed LP sleeves , stickers , embosses , special LP cover paper/inks/textures and/or die cuts , are precisely replicated and included . An English-language lyric sheet is always included , even if the original LP did not have printed lyrics.Then , there 's the sonic quality : Often ( but not always ) , mini-sleeves have dedicated remastering ( 20-Bit , 24-Bit , DSD , K2/K2HD , and/or HDCD ) , and can often ( but not always ) be superior to the audio on the same title anywhere else in the world . There also may be bonus tracks unavailable elsewhere.Each Japan mini-sleeve has an `` obi '' ( `` oh-bee '' ) , a removable Japan-language promotional strip . The obi lists the Japan street date of that particular release , the catalog number , the mastering info , and often the original album 's release date . Bonus tracks are only listed on the obi , maintaining the integrity of the original LP artwork . The obi 's are collectable , and should not be discarded.All mini-sleeve releases are limited edition , but re-pressings/re-issues are becoming more common ( again , not always ) . The enthusiasm of mini-sleeve collecting must be tempered , however , with avoiding fake mini-sleeves manufactured in Russia and distributed throughout the world , primarily on eBay . They are inferior in quality , worthless in collectable value , a total waste of money , and should be avoided at all costs .	-1
I 'm a big Van fan , but somehow the charms of this album escape me . Of the 20+ Van records I have this is easily my least favorite.Musically , it feels lazy and unispiring . The lyrics are strangely mundane and & quot ; American & quot ; for Van Morrison . I do n't think there is a single essential song on this disc.That 's not to say there are no enjoyable songs , just that there is nary a hint of Van 's usual genius . Thankfully , the genius would soon return in spades for & quot ; Veedon Fleece & quot ; . This is for Van completists only , an unfortunate sidestep on his way into the mystic .	-1
Okay the only reason I am going to flunk this CD , its yes this is okay , is firstly , this CD cant touch A Night in SF double CD set , not in quality or sound . The real simple reason is its priceI have all of Vans CD 's and have had them all for years , so looking for something different , and seeing this one listed for sometime at these prices all I kept thinking was man o man must be some killer show ! its got ta be better or at least equal to the SF show CD , so I pulled the trigger and bought it.Its clear cut , not even close.So the reason I am writing this , the one and only bad Van review , is if you have the A Night in SF CD , save your money , if you want a good CD and do n't have that one , again save your money and buy that one.So now you know , spend or not , you have been warned.IF you really rich and money is no object , well then maybe that 's who these other reviewers are in here.poor me I guess , complaining on getting on getting by on 85k a year .	-1
But this ONLY if you already have most of his other albums ! Even by Van The Man 's high standards , this one falls a bit low . Not as far as being bad , but this album is not an essential part of his vast body of work . For completists only !	-1
I found no song on here that was good . This is pretty much album no.4 only there 's more songs on here . I just want to take that harmonica to a hammer really bad .	-1
Very similar to the last Arnold soundtrack . The cover song by S. Crow is by far the worst in the whole series .	-1
This album is one of the Moody Blue 's milestones , a symphonic progressive rock album.But BEWARE - Amazon sells two different MP3 versions of this particular DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED album . A cheaper $ 5 version , and a more expensive $ 9.49 album.The cheaper version only contains the first seven tracks of the original album ; it does not have the remaining tracks , numbered 8 through 7 . And missing is their classic TUESDAY AFTERNOON.So beware - if you 're looking for the complete album , do not buy the cheaper version ! NOTE : I gave this one star so people would know that they could be shortchanged if they buy the cheaper version .	-1
When compared to 'In search of the lost chord ' and 'To our children 's childrens children , this release falls way short on both performances and sound quality . A few good songs but not enough to recommend it . Despite being remastered , the sound is not that much improved : very little high end and an overall 'thin sound ' . 13 tracks/37.06 .	-1
Whatever witless wisdom and meandering melodyless-melodies the Moodies wanted to bestow on generations across the ages they will do just fine in putting the tapes right back in an unmarked box and leaving it out by the curb on collection day.The gall that these guys at this stage of their 'careers ' would have in unleashing more of their senseless noises upon any but the most committed/committable fans is unparalleled . Even some of the worse reviews I myself have typed up and posted on Amazon have provided a greater good to humanity then these guy 's continued musical endeavors.I tried listening to half the samples on the webpage . Could n't pull off even that much of an effort . And why should I when even the Moodies put in less effort 'creating ' their 'art . ' ? Someday maybe someone will explain to me what is so fascinating by any of the music in the Moodies vast resevior of music . But i doubt it . But forty minutes of someone defending the work of the Moodies is actually barely more tolerable then hearing the music itself . Barely more tolerable - but just slightly over the threshold .	-1
Just so you know where I 'm coming from , I think that what the Moody Blues produced from 1967-1970 is one of the great legacies of the rock era . Also , some of the material I 've heard from 1981-1999 is good ( if formulaic ) , but I am less familiar with it . With that said , the Moodies hit their lowest point with `` Every Good Boy Deserves Favour '' and `` Seventh Sojourn '' . The only song on `` Every Good Boy '' that I enjoy is Justin Hayward 's excellent rocker `` The Story in Your Eyes '' . I award two stars to this album just because it contains this song . The other songs are either plodding and dull or sticky sweet , comparable only to the very worst of their prior material . If you are exploring the early Moodies ' music , do yourself a `` favour '' and try any of their first five albums ( see my other reviews for details ) . You will find rock that really rocks , and beautiful music that is fresh and original .	-1
Note , this one-star rating is for the product , not the artist/music.Hoping that I would receive one from a previous production run , I placed an order anyway . No such luck , mine does not play in standard or SACD players.It looks to me like the bad ones started showing up just this year . If you can be assured that yours is from an older production run , you are probably safe .	-1
'Chim Chim 's Badass Revenge ' has created more reasons for arguement amoungst Fishbone fans than any other topic or album . Bitterly hated or adoringly loved , the balance of the two is undisputed as some say it is an amazing musical journey , and other say it is an angry shadow of the bands former self.Around the time of it 's release back in 1996 , I have to say I was extremely disapointed . My thoughts as I went through the tracks for the first time were , that the departure of founding members and key song writters Kendall Jones ( guitar ) and Chris Dowd ( Keyboard , Trombone , Lead Vocals ) have left the band in ruins , all the catchy talent gone , as was the polished edge . The production was so muddy and lacking in definition , the songs were n't melodic and some were just far too agressive and thrash/punk to get my head around . I was in mourning for the band that I loved and adored over the previous few years . I did recognise magic moments such as the final track 'Fight For Nuttmeg ' is one of the bands most intense grooves but with expectaions of another 'Reality Of My Surroundings ' or 'Give A Monkey a Brain ... ' , 'Chim Chim ' Badass Revenge ' left me disappointed.None of my friends who loved Fishbone seemed to like it either , some have never purchased another Fishbone album since , as if this one album turned them away.Lets just say time has worked for this album and I now have a new found appreciation for Chim Chim . Because I never listerned to it much , when I decided to give it another listern 5 years later , it was like a new album which I was unfamiliar with but without the expectation . The production , mix and sound is still poorer than an average demo , but it is a profound window into the emotional turbulance Fishbone were going through during the time . After two key members quit , losing a major record label and being black listed in the music industry , no wonder why it is so mad . These days must have really hurt the guys in Fishbone and it shows in 'Chim Chim 's Badass Revenge'Not for you average listerner !	-1
I just received this SACD from Amazon a few days ago and played it today on my Sony XA5400ES SACD player and was immediately taken back by how average it sounded when compared to the regular stereo red-book CD edition . In stereo the Eagles Hotel California SACD seems to be tipped up in volume but sounds no better than CD . I do n't like surround sound and I do n't have a surround sound set up . I have a High-End Stereo setup at home and have been very disappointed lately by many of the expensive imports coming from Japan . I 've found the majority of them to be bright sounding compared to their American equivalents . The one good thing I can say about this recording is that it is n't bright sounding at all . Instead it just sounds like a regular CD , nothing special , certainly not worth paying the upscale price . However I just purchased The Who 's Tommy Domestic SACD and it sounds fabulous . So does the Domestic Elton John Tumbleweed Connection as well as Mad Man Across The Water . The only Japanese SACD I 've heard that is great is Elton John 's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road on Universal Japan . It stomps all over the harsh sounding American version and is worth every penny IMHO . For comparisons sake today I played my old trusty copy of Hotel California on vinyl pressed by Mobile fidelity in the Early 1980 's and it of course bettered both the SACD & CD in every area of sound , better bass , sound stage , dynamics , midrange and so on.This review is not meant as a put down of lovers of surround or multichannel sound . If that 's your cup of tea then go ahead and enjoy . However , If you are into stereo I would suggest to stay away from this one .	-1
I like & quot ; Pretty Maids All In A Row , & quot ; & quot ; Try And Love Again , & quot ; and & quot ; Wasted Time. & quot ; The rest you can have.Sorry..it 's not in the league of Sgt . Pepper .	-1
Turns out everyone who bought a copy of this album made a major mistake . Thankfully , that mistake can be fixed . All you got ta do is return your copy to whatever record story you bought it at and ask for your money back.Now what about the music ? Well , I gave it one star , so that should be a sign it sucks . Any album with Witchy Woman , Desperado , Peaceful Easy Feeling , Lyin ' Eyes , Take it To the Limit , Best of My Love and One of These Nights would be worth one star already , but they lose even more points by ruining a great Jackson Browne song ( Take It Easy ) . Skip this .	-1
Although I like JB this was one is not to my liking . The others I 've purchased recently outshine this CD .	-1
This CD is just one more example of Joe Walsh 's ability to come up with one great song on an album of filler . `` Life 's Been Good '' with its distinctive melody and tongue in cheek ( ? ) portrayal of the rock and roll life is a true rock classic . It would be nice to find at least on more good song , but the rest of the CD is just a couple of weak instrumentals and some instantly forgettable So-Cal rock .	-1
I 'm a huge fan of Joni Mitchell -- few in the history of recorded music have approached her prodigious talents as both a singer and a songwriter . That said , `` Miles of Aisles '' -- both the LP and the concert tour , was a disappointment . Her collaboration with Tom Scott and the LA Express worked poorly , despite the great sound of Scott 's band . I actually attended the concert -- at Tanglewood in Lenox , Mass. , about 500 years ago , and I remember feeling the same way back then .	-1
According to the liner notes , Joni Mitchell was asked by Charles Mingus to put lyrics to some of his tunes . That 's what she should have attempted to do ; she should have attempted to put straight lyrics to them , NOT lyrics ABOUT Mingus , and she should have attempted to sing them straight and not sing `` jazz '' . I do n't say she 's hopeless as a jazz singer , but if she wanted to sing jazz , she should have recorded an album of standards ( standards that already had lyrics , that is ) .The musicians here do a fine job , especially Jaco and Herbie ( some great horn arranging by Jaco , by the way ) , but that 's the accompaniment . Joni 's lyrics are embarrassing and her singing seems pretentious and phony.In any case , this record simply does n't work , and it ai n't a-happening -- which is why it was received unfavorably in its day and continues to be received unfavorably ( except by Internet fetishists ) , to the extent it is n't ignored completely .	-1
The late seventies Eagles were a been there , seen that , done that type of band . A southern California band that was disillusioned with the SoCal and Hollywood lifestyle . If the band were doing tons of coke all the time , it does n't show in this album ( or they were recording on mornings after ) because the playing on this album is lethargic . The songs could have been very strong , but the band sounds bored with them . Every song sounds like it should be speeded up a beat or two and everyone sounds like they are playing behind that beat . The songs drag on too long and the band takes itself too seriously to be enjoyed . Even their one attempt at humor ( Greeks Do n't Want No Freaks ) falls flat , but it is only song on the album where the band does n't sound like they were playing while laying on the couch . Even Joe Walsh could n't save this one and the band 's break-up was probably the best move to make . Still , the talent within the band is/was indisputable and there are several listenable tracks here , especially I Ca n't Tell You Why which showed the shape of things to come for Don Henley who seemed to care a lot more when it was his name alone on the album cover . In the City was a remake of a song Joe Walsh did for a movie ( the Warriors , I think , but I could be mistaken ) and it pales next to Joe 's solo version . Heartache Tonight , while a big hit , seemed like an attempt to return to the Eagles early sound , but ended up an overplayed AM radio anthem . Teenage Jail was the albums `` hard rock '' song and just sounds very slow and tired , a minute and a half into it , you just wish it would end . The Eagles put out some great music in their lifespan , but this , their last full studio album , was n't it . For some great Eagles music get the earlier albums like Across the Border , where they actually sound like they are interested in what they are doing .	-1
The Eagles were itching to move on with their solo careers , and that is quite visible from this album . It seems like a pile of songs just thrown together without too much thought . There are some real disappointments on this album such as 'These Shoes ' ( incredibly boring ) , and 'Greeks dont want no freaks ' . 'In the City ' is okay but perhaps misplaced . The album 's highlights include 'I Ca n't Tell you Why ' and 'King of Hollywood ' . Naturally it is hard to follow up a masterpiece such as 'Hotel California ' . The fact that I hardly play this album anymore proves that .	-1
This is an album I loved on LP back in the Eighties . I bought it with great anticipation , but beware the & quot ; Bargain Series & quot ; sticker on the front . & quot ; Bargain & quot ; , in this context , appears to mean , & quot ; We saved money by not doing any re-mastering and pass the savings on to you ! & quot ; This is an AAD disk , which means that the original analog master was simply digitized . A better process is ADD , whereby the analog tracks undergo a final digital mix before the digital master is put on disk . Regardless , there is a noticeable lack of high frequency energy on this CD . It sounds a lot better than the LP does but not nearly as good as it could have . I ca n't recommend it .	-1
As a wee'un I was hoping the back-sass and cheek would continue . `` do n't cha stop '' [ sic ] . . `` just what i needed '' . . `` candy-o '' . . and then I heard for what i had been waiting : the sound of andy devine on his horse - bushy , bagot and green - trying to hurry his goof 'd rotundity from the efforts of some old pale thing . `` touch and go '' . . good god 's grief and lee van cleef , this is not the sound that saved rock .	-1
As a fan of the Cars ' debut and Heartbeat City , I thought the reviews here might point to another solid through-and-through Cars ' effort.Not so . I do n't understand how anyone can positively rate this record . While there 's one or two OK tracks , this disk is just a splash of sound effects , guitar rhythms , and weak lyrics that someone apparently hoped would equal music . They do n't .	-1
I never did get this one ! Perhaps two decent songs on the whole album . A major mistake . I was in denial for so many years , but now I come clean ! Why else would it be cheaper . Own it for collectors sake only !	-1
& quot ; There Goes the Neighborhood , & quot ; released in 1981 , marked the descent of Joe Walsh from progressive rock force to lightweight has been . The songwriting here is almost uniformly lackluster , save for & quot ; Life of Illusion , & quot ; a catchy single that can be had on many of his anthology albums . The song & quot ; Things & quot ; typifies the kind of stuff that Walsh was writing at the time . It has an okay groove , but the lyrics are so utterly incosequential that you know the artist had run out of things to say . The problems with Walsh that started here would only get worse as the 1980s dragged on . A sad end for a once formidable artist .	-1
OK , I do n't know what these other reviewers are listening to , but this is the most stale , unemotional music I 've heard out of TD up to that point . I prefer Cyclone over this album anyday . My copy says that it 's & quot ; live & quot ; but no mention is made of the venue . Maybe it 's a type-o or it 's & quot ; live-in'studio & quot ; . But it 's very plastic-sounding and repetitive . Let me go back in time : The album came out around 1980 . At that time there was the beginning of the digital revolution and synths were becoming more complex , with new synthetic instruments being produced and gaining popularity . TD was always in the forefront , using the latest and greatest gear . One problem at the time was that many of these synths lacked what is called & quot ; velocity sensitivity & quot ; . That 's the effect you get when you play a piano hard or soft , you get two very diffenrent sounds , plus all the variations possible in between . These new synths lacked that ability for another year or two . The sequencing equipment , though more complex , also lacked the ability to record velocity info , so everything comes out at the same volume . Now this effect was perfect for the new synth-pop and New Wave music that eventually led to that dark and emotionless period in music history known as & quot ; the 80 's & quot ; . So therefore you get TD playing synths with lots of tonal possibilities but very little expressiveness . The same problem is in evidence on Jean-Michele Jarre 's Magnetic Fields album . No soul . Now the music itself is rather lackluster , even poppy in parts , and downright embarrassing in other parts . I could see Edgar Froese taking over after Pete Baumann left , and getting caught up in the possibilities of the new synth technology . It resulted in this case in an album that sounds VERY dated , unlike much other TD music . I suppose this music would have it 's fans but someone who appreciates TD 's adventurous nature will not help but be surprised that TD could put out such bland stuff . Then again what followed for twenty years was pretty much in the same vein or worse , though I 'm still looking for the exceptions . Buy at your own risk .	-1
This review was previously titled `` Does n't this album need RE-MASTERING ? '' and the rating was one star . That applies to what was available at the time . Below is the complete text of my August , 2004 review . But by now ( Spring of 2013 ) the album may ( or may not ) have been re-mastered properly . . . .I appreciate the content-based reviews , but some of us are long-time Cars fans who made their minds up about these songs many years ago . The question is , is this compact-disc everything it could be in terms of SOUND REPRODUCTION ? Regrettably not . The Cars albums were initially `` dumped '' to CD back in the early 90s , and it took a long time for the first three albums to be decently re-mastered . ( Sadly , ART and LYRIC reproduction still has not been handled properly ! Each new CD version looks exactly like the older , worse version ! ) As far as I can tell , Shake It Up and Heartbeat City have never been properly transferred . In other words -- they sound terrible.Seems the problem is , Elektra 's out of business . Certaintly , it 's not a question of The Cars being able to sell records , since they ALWAYS DID , FROM DAY ONE . It 's just not fair.Somebody , please , obtain the rights and do The Cars right ! Do n't these pioneers of 80s sound quality deserve modern reproduction ?	-1
In Joni 's early work , I was amazed at her ability to cloak wonderful , accessible messages and a dreamy , passionate world within her songs and the lyrics , and was yet fun-loving . She was a wonder , from Clouds , Song to a Seagull through For the Roses and Blue ... .some good bits on Hissing , Court and Spark , and Hejira . I try not to be closed-minded about artistic evolution ( all my favorite artists do it ) ; but here is little discernible effort at the craft of songwriting as I understand it . No rhythm , no melody , mainly just sadness and a sense of hystrionics . When I bought this decades ago , I feared Los Angeles had finally destroyed her . I have heard a few tracks of her work since this album , and it seems true.Now , for all the people that give this such great reviews , I wonder if they really find it likable enough to play often and return to . If so , that 's great . My ears ca n't imagine it .	-1
AS a avid Joni Mitchell fan I always looked forward to every album she released . For me , the lady could do no wrong . After all , she created such masterworks as , `` Blue '' and `` Court & Spark '' . But , this album left me confused and cold . There was no passion , only failed musical experiments . The songs go nowhere . Their messages are unclear and esoteric . Joni was , I suppose , trying to expand her muse , but in the process created a artistic mess . The title cut is the only saving grace on this double album . Double album ? A little indulgent of the lady I must say . This album foreshadowed her 80s and 90s failures .	-1
Everybody who thinks is an Eagles fan should know the only reason this album was made was to please the record company , because the band was coming apart at the seams by then , so comes as no surprise the fact that the final result is boring . Logical , if this may be one of the most obscene examples of corporate greed . The band should have disbanded rather than make this uninspiring album.I wo n't get into discussing if there are too many overdubs or not , cause I 'm not up with that stuff so I prefer leaving it to people who know more than me but , if so many have claimed there are , it must be true.The lack of passion is painfully obvious on this 'live ' cd , and the setlist suffers as a result . Nine minutes for a Walsh song ( that is not bad , but just drags on and on ) and none for Witchy Woman , The Best Of My Love or Good Day In Hell ? The latter may be the most unfairly overlooked song in the entire Eagles catalogue.Contrary to what some reviewers have said , some of the songs ' arrangements were changed for the stage , and f***** things up . The studio arrangements of their songs were already excellent , so why mess with them ? On both Heartache Tonight and I Ca n't Tell You Why there 's less drumming than on their studio counterparts , which is also a disappointment.In a nutshell - one of the least appealing 'live ' sets ever , probably not a good sample of what the Eagles were on stage before becoming the take-the-money-and-run dinosaur that are now . Wryly , and as contrived as Hell Freezes Over may be , leaves you with a better taste of Eagles 's music than the dreary 'Eagles Live ' . 'Eagles Yawning ' would have been a more adequate title .	-1
This is an album I loved on LP back in the Seventies . I bought it with great anticipation , but beware the & quot ; Bargain Series & quot ; sticker on the front . & quot ; Bargain & quot ; , in this context , appears to mean , & quot ; We saved money by not doing any re-mastering and pass the savings on to you ! & quot ; This is an AAD disk , which means that the original analog master was simply digitized . A better process is ADD , whereby the analog tracks undergo a final digital mix before the digital master is put on disk . Regardless , there is a noticeable lack of high frequency energy on this CD . It sounds a lot better than the LP does but not nearly as good as it could have . I ca n't recommend it .	-1
There is something inherently prosaic in this dead dull `` music of der future '' . Fortunately , man has still some sense of individualism , but barely , and Kraftwerk 's fascist goal for music has not rendered vocals obsolete . Listening to this , it harkens back to the techno geek 1970 's when Germans laden in neo-fascist uniforms with thin ties and a pound of grease on their hair , showed no emotion on stage , acting like machines . Most of them wore leather pants so tight that they froze while playing , hence the dumb and inarticulate Krautbot look . They copied architecture chic from the 1930 's , added some 70 's porn montage and called it `` modern '' 1970 's and praised the revolution of robots and computers . Not only is that very idea horrifying , but it is also silly . `` Kraftwerk '' means `` cheese plant '' in German and they are very cheesy.The CD is probably one of the most horrible things I 've listened to . If you can get to the end of it , you 'll find all sorts of unwanted electronic noise , Krautbot voice dubs , electro fuzz , beeps , computer konks , repugnant computer-generated vocals , static , repulsive synthesizers , and extremely unpleasant clamor that goes on forever , that you 'll soon be reaching for a hammer to crush the CD . In my estimation , all crap . A few American bands at the time tried the stale trend with deadly results , Gary Numan The Pleasure Principle ( 1979 ) , Styx Kilroy Was Here ( 1983 ) , both tossed their careers away because of it.You 'll be reminded of foolish telephone companies , lumbering computer screens , electronic wires , gay 70 's discos , and moronic techno cabarets in smelly , dark German cellars . So , unless you 're a nerd or have little taste in music , forget this stuff ever existed .	-1
I 'm really disappointed in this LP reissue ( and the other 3 by Tom Waits ) Pressed at RTI , the LP 's are flat , thick and quiet , the sleeves are thick and look good.The music is great ( it 's a Tom Waits record ) , but the sound is so dull and lifeless , it hurts my ears.I compared it to the cd and a German repress from 2003 or so , it 's awfull.I will update this review if I get a better pressing , hope so .	-1
I ca n't for the life of me , understand that there 's only one sub four star review on this crappy album . `` Desperado '' is one of my favorite EAGLES songs , but one great song does n't an album make . I sold this to a used cd store a couple of years ago , and I ca n't say I miss it that much . I have the song `` Desperado '' recorded on cassette , and I have the `` Eagles Live '' on cd , so no problem . This is definitely the handsdown worst studio release in the EAGLES discography . `` On the border '' is only slightly better than this one . `` One of these nights '' is their final one with Bernie Leadon and is their best effort , so stick with that one instead of `` Desperado '' .	-1
Its a good thing Kraftwerk stopped producing after this . Its their worst album . Still has moments and the Telephone Song is great , but it goes dwonhill . The track Electric Cafe is a good example of how they began to lose their edge . And Kraftwerk is all about perfection . All the previous albums being so solid.Maybe they werent happy with this and packed it up to do something new . I dont know what because I did not follow them since.Theres also a remix of the Telephone Song which is good.Have no fear , all the previous albums were stellar , even back in the Organization and Neu days and the organic sound .	-1
I am an avid soundtrack collector , and this one rates up with the worst . Not only are most of the songs not even in the film , but they 're just plain horrible examples of each artist 's work . There are only 2 songs worth listening to ... `` Somebody 's Baby '' by Jackson Browne ( unavailable on his albums ) and `` Sleeping Angel '' by Stevie Nicks .	-1
This first Motley Crue attempt is a joke . Lack of rage , lack of feeling , lack of solid melodies , lack of voice ... Dont waste your time listening to this metal-punk mixture , it 's garbage . You want real metal bands ? Get something from Fastway , Ratt , Judas Priest or Cinderella . You want real work from Motley Crue ? Get Dr. Feelgood .	-1
Previously the Eagles ' success baffled me , but I think I 've got it figured out now : they brought the right stuff ( dull pointless pedestrian soft-rock ) to the right place ( California ) at the right time ( the '70s ) . Their continued popularity today is probably more out of nostalgia and/or peer pressure ( `` How can you NOT like them ? '' say the fans . `` Greatest Hits 1 is the biggest-selling album ever ! If you do n't like the biggest selling album ever , you do n't have good taste ! '' ) than anything else.But what 's the music like ? Well , I 've heard the band themselves hated this album . I hate it too . For one , there 's the ' '' legendary '' `` Hotel California '' . A # 1 hit like anything else they put out at a certain point . But it 's embarrassing . Every element that gets praised even today is an element of it I dislike - I see the syncopated reggae rhythms as this forced , `` Look at us , we can do REGGAE ! We 're DIVERSE ! '' thing ; the lyrics as either pretentious ( `` We stabbed the beast with steely knives '' ) or unintentionally hilarious ( `` You can check out anytime you want , but you can never leave '' - what is this , the roach motel ? ) , and the famed guitar duel near the end puts me out like no anesthetic ever could . And if Don Henley is ever picked as the voice of rock 'n ' roll over Mick Jagger , Roger Daltry or John Fogerty , that will be the day I stop listening to rock 'n ' roll . At least it is n't bad as their other attempt at reggae , `` New Kid on the Block '' , another # 1 hit ( god , did these guys have a payola deal going ? And while I 'm conspiracy theorizing , they probably locked up all the executives of the Billboard charts in their basement and played them their music until they agreed to move their records up to # 1 ) .But wait - there 's more ! The addition of Joe Walsh somehow convinced the Eagles that they were a sleazy boogie-rock band , like ZZ Top ! Only they saw themselves as too smart to right about tube snakes and pearl necklaces and girls with legs who knew how to use them . No , instead they gave us their takes on either the frailty ( `` Heartache Tonight '' ; `` Victim of Love '' ) or longevity ( `` The Long Run '' ) of love ; cliched damming of rock-star life ( `` Life in the Fast Lane '' ) . Problem is , they ca n't play boogie-rock ; the vocals are painfully oversung , and the band sounds stiff and awkward . `` Heartache Tonight '' ( or `` Headache Tonight '' , take your pick ) is especially painful , though all four of 'em are disgraces.And can they write a memorable lyric that has not , in fact , been beaten into the ground ? Glad you asked . No is the answer to that question . Let 's count the songs that pretty much do the same thing as `` The Sad Cafe '' ; `` I Ca n't Tell You Why '' and `` After the Thrill is Gone '' . Let 's see ... . one , two , three , four ... 9.5x10^28 , 9.6x10^28 , 9.7x10^28 ... This right here is a fine example of why sometimes you ca n't trust the masses . The fact that George W. Bush was elected for two terms in office was another example . This might 've sounded great in the '70s - I was n't around back then , I would n't have a clue - but the music of the Eagles has aged like cream cheese . Oh yeah , they 've got a new album out . You know what that means , right ? That means I will never turn on the radio again as long as Don Henley , Glen Frey , Timothy B. Schmidt , Don Felder , Joe Walsh , Randy Meisner , and Bernie Leadon live . At least Felder , Meisner and Leadon had the good sense to jump ship . Wait , wait , their music was n't any better with them on board . Never mind .	-1
I have been a Linda Ronstadt fan for a long time , but I do n't like everything she 's done . In fact , after GET CLOSER , I went seven years ( ! ) before getting another new album of hers . WHAT 'S NEW , while it garnered a great deal of attention when it was released ( some very positive , some far less so ) , has not aged very well . Yes , it 's a well-meant attempt to revive the standards of the big-band era in the age of MTV . But she probably lost as many fans as she gained by making this album and the four that followed , and I almost became one of them . Sorry Linda , you 're a great singer , but you 're not perfect .	-1
When I first heard the song `` Breaking The Chains '' , I loved it . I thought this band is gon na kick ... ! ! ! Well , the rest of this album is not as good as the opening single . However , while not as polished ( or good ) as their later albums , this introduced us to Don Dokken 's vocals and maybe one of the most underrated guitar players of all time : George Lynch . I recommend this CD to anyone who loves Dokken , but for others I would wait till `` Tooth & Nail '' .	-1
Ignore the people who call this commercial ? Why ? It is commercial dreck and shame on the Cars for making it . By this point the Cars were poising themselves to be multi-platinum superstars and they suceeded big time with thier music suffering . The first three releases ( & quot ; The Cars & quot ; , & quot ; Candy-O & quot ; and & quot ; Panorma & quot ; ) I would highly recommend to see what the Cars were all about . But hey , if you like over processed , slicker than oil , calculated , derivative , drab pop music , this release is for you .	-1
I love this album , and wanted to buy the new gold version as soon as it came out . This is , indeed , the best sounding version of this album . Congratulations are in order . Nevertheless , the new Audio Fidelity release has a couple of problems . It does n't have the segues of the original album , and even though it 's encoded in HDCD , sometimes the encoding disappears without warning and you are left with a click ( depending on your player ) . The artwork is horrendous . When you pay $ 25 or so for an `` audiophile '' release , you have to expect perfection everywhere . This release is simply not up to par with the offerings of companies like Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs .	-1
I remember it like yesterday . I had been a big Cars fan throughout their career , and I had a friend who , at the time , was working on the mastering of this recording before it was release . He had been raving about it for weeks . He built it up as their best recording ever and brought back an advance mixdown for me to hear . I 'll never forget how disappointed I was.The Cars already had a very poppy , commercial sound , but they also had originality and a charming quirkiness to them that made them endearing . Their success up to Heartbeat City seemed like a natural result of a band that had not sacrificed their integrity to make it . They already had a natural formula for success , but with Heartbeat City they appeared to deliberately attempt to make their sound even more slick , polished , and commercial . The result is an over-produced , conventional ( for the time ) , disposable pop album that has not aged well at all . With a few exceptions , notably `` You Might Think '' and `` Hello Again '' , the quirkiness is drowned out under a wash of reverb and overly bright EQ . True , there 's no doubt this release helped The Cars reach their highest level of commercial success with no less than 4 hits , ( the videos at the time certainly helped put these songs across ) but it 's a an obvious sellout and a fairly soulless release .	-1
there is no resemblance to the band that put out two masterpieces in their debut and 'candy o ' . 'shake it up ' was the beginning of the end , but still had a few decent tracks on it . ( cruiser , since you 're gone ) . this is most certainly the end . if you like drum machines and synthesizers over good rock and roll , buy this one . if not , buy the first two.gets one star for drive , a cheesy song , but great vocals by benjamin orr . r.i.p .	-1
and he should 've stayed a bloody poet . i mean usually poetry and music mix , but not in this case . it 's good poetry and bad music . i ca n't believe how bad some of this sounds . I give it 2 stars because of the cool musicians ( not poets ) in the band .	-1
In the 1980 's the Doors ' music was released on CD later than music from other groups . The first release available was this collection from 1985 , which also came out on LP ( the Doors individual studio albums , of which there were only six , were not issued on CD in 1987 ) . However , with the summer 2003 release of the Doors ' `` Legacy '' , this collection is unnecessary and should be out of print . I will say that the song selection on `` Very Best Of '' is good . But the Doors only recorded 64 studio songs ( including 2 non-LP B-sides ) , and while 19 of them are on `` Very Best Of '' , 34 tracks ( including a live track and an unreleased studio track ) are on `` Legacy '' , which represents 50 percent of the groups studio output . The sound on `` Legacy '' is also superior . Finally , my one objection in terms of song selection is that neither `` Legacy '' nor `` Very Best Of '' contain the track `` The Soft Parade . ''	-1
I would like to edit my review because this has 2 good songs in For Whom The Bell Tolls , and Fade to Black . I 'm not a huge Metallica fan . I just like about 3 of their good albums in Black Album , Master of Puppets , and this Ride the Lightning .	-1
Bread was a band that mastered the concept of songs to work in an office by . Unobtrusive with little lasting value , Bread 's songs pass through your ears like a sun shower on a field , momentarily pleasent and then quickly forgotten . The Anthology collects the best of their particular style of music .	-1
Sure it is a Cure album but the remix was a waste of time . While they did some improving and it sounds nice , they compressed it so it is super loud . This cd is not worth the money . Buy the original release , it sounds much better .	-1
I was hopeful that this was the real deal after reading about it being a `` Rare Japanese Pressing '' of one of my top FIVE favorite albums of all time AND BOY , WAS I MISLED ! I compared the audio quality to my domestic copy purchased close to 20 years ago by now and there was ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE ! It also says it was pressed in ARGENTINA , NOT JAPAN right on the cd and the booklet that comes with it looks like a cheap bootleg pressing ! TOTALLY AVOID THIS FRAUD AT ALL COSTS ! How long is it going to take for Lars and Co. to update this classic album with a 20+ bit remaster so scamsters quit taking advantage of true fans like myself ? ? ? Amazon needs to stop this scam right now !	-1
New Metallica , old Metallica , both are worthless artifacts from their respective time periods . Always sounding like the gay Slayer , Metallica 's only decent purpose in my eyes was for good bands to be able to cover their second rate attempts at thrash . My theory ? Anyone who owns a Metallica shirt has an I.Q . below 65 .	-1
I was excited to pick up a copy of this for a good price from a local music store only to take it home , open it up , and listen to it and find out that it was pressed like crap . Right out of the wrappping the record skipped all over the place , my guess is it was produced poorly , and i have super dirty , old records that do n't even do this . An amazing album of course , but if you want it on vinyl i would stick to the original pressing .	-1
I watched the MTV Icon show honouring Metallica so I figured `` Hey , these guys must be good if they 're on MTV ! ! '' . Needless to say I heard some of the songs of st. Anger and Reload - as well as a couple of the `` Metallica '' album and was quite impressed ( although the latter album sucks overall ) . So I decided to check out some of their older stuff from the 80s . Big mistake . Back then these guys were just a bunch of goths telling you to take drugs and kill yourself . Also the songs are too long . Some of these are over 8 minutes ! ! If a song goes longer than 3 then it 's boring . Thank god they woke up and decided to play on MTV and learnt how to actually play .	-1
I usually like Jackson but find it really offensive that an individual whose personal relationships with women have resulted in violence has the audacity to protest violence on the international scene.IF you ca n't get along with the one you love , do n't tell us how to get along.Maybe you should listen to the words of another insightful songwriter who said & quot ; ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE & quot ; Unless & quot ; In the Shape of a Heart & quot ; is his admission of his own faults ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
There are only four good songs on this album : Heavy Metal by Sammy HagarHeavy Metal by Don FelderRadar Rider by RiggsOkay , three songs . I was going to add Blue Oyster Cult 's 'Veteran of the Psychic Wars ' or Black Sabbath 's 'The Mob Rules , ' but they just are n't in the same class as the three listed above.And the rest of it ? Well , Cheap Trick is always entertaining but never amazing . The songs by lesser-known bands are okay . Journey 's 'Open Arms ' is completely out of place . So is Stevie Nicks.You have to admire the wide range of songs here , but the top three outshine the rest . ( And there 's something funny about the fact that the two best songs on the Heavy Metal soundtrack are BOTH called Heavy Metal . Maybe the producers should have given each band or musician that requirement : & quot ; The song has to be called Heavy Metal. & quot ; )	-1
What I like best about Billy Bragg is his wonderful , quirky sense of irony . While he croons on about his working class ` identity , ' social justice , and the wonders of multiculturalism , he is careful to live in a posh mansion in 100 % rural White Dorset - as far as one can get socially and geographically from the multicultural chaos , confusion , and high crime of his native Barking.Well done , Billy , keep selling 'Socialism ' and 'Multiculturalism ' to Guardian readers and keep living the good life in nice , White , safe , upper class Dorset . No doubt Tony Blair will make you a Lord soon . Meanwhile all your fellow working class Whites who could n't escape from the socialist multicultural chaos of Barking seem to have started voting for the 'far right ' British Nationalist Party .	-1
Kudos for her as an artist to make a difficult cross-over from Pop to Mariachi . However , the arrangements are n't innovative , she chose some questionable songs , as a singer she lacks good phrasing in Spanish , and her voice is monotonous ( her voice has only one color , and she does n't present us with meaningful volume contrasts ) .	-1
Self-righteous , self-indulgent crap . Musically simplistic and utterly dull . Not a singly sly or subtle lyrical twist . Many people think , because she 's black and a lesbian I guess , that she 's the second coming of Joan Armatrading . She could n't carry Joan Armatrading 's frikking briefcase .	-1
After some pretty cool guitar riffs to lead into CAN '' T LOOK AWAY , the musik becomes contrived and confused . His high falsetto vocals are mediocre and the songs have nothing to say and take forever to say it . The lyrics are cliche and add nothing to these tracks . Throughout the CD I wished this was an instrumental release . The guitar playing is OK and only hints at what might have been . The compositions are complex , but do not benefit from this complexity . I am sure RABIN is a very good guitarist , but apart from a couple of sterling moments , he seems throttled by the need to be obtuse and clever . Yet the cleverness never rises above sounding pretentious .	-1
Yes , it does have some of the feel of Yes ' 90125 . However , it is more like a Muzak version than real rock . I was shocked by the lack of artistry , compared to his Yes work .	-1
YESTERDAY I JOINED SEEUKSEE AND THEN I DID A STRANGE DANCE WITH A CATERPILLA BEFORE THE CUP FELL OFF A CLIFF AND DROWNDED US . THE WHOLE MOVEMEMNT OF EMOSE ROSE TO THE GLORIA IN EXCELSIS DIO .	-1
Normally I love to hear my favourite albums remastered , and God knows there are plenty of '80s albums that desperately need it ( Psychocandy ! ) . However , I think that the decidedly murky sound quality of this album was its best feature . Let 's face it , this really is n't the Cure 's best album . My personal favourites are 'Faith ' and 'The Head On The Door ' , but 'Pornography ' had always seemed really good . That is , until they remastered it . Sure , now you can hear every 'nuance ' , but on top of that you can also hear just how frightfully mediocre the songs are . With the old version , it sounded like the band recorded the album at the bottom of a swamp , and that seemed to work really well with the overall sound and feel of the album . But now that it sounds all clean and clear , you realise just how weak this album was in the first place . To the original version of the album , I give four stars . But to this remaster , I give two .	-1
What was the big deal with this album ? ... One is good , yeah , it 's the one Metallica song everyone knows , I do n't care who you are , where you live or how old you are . Yeah , it 's great . Everybody knows that guitar part in the middle , I do n't have to describe it , you know what I mean ... Did n't this win some kind of Grammy or something , for what , worst album of the year ? Buy the single of One , excellently inspired by Johnny Go HIs Gun ( movie/book ) and the video is great , one of the most groundbreaking and memorable . Ok wait , let 's just run One on here 6 or 7 times and rename it One , then it 'll be good .	-1
I ca n't express with words how much I loathe this album . Its just so incredibly gloomy and depressing . Who wants to sit and listen to 10 minute songs all about death and destruction and darkness ? Not me . I do n't want to be miserable.Listening to this entire album will poison your mind . It will make you miserable , gloomy , and depressed . It makes you want to kill yourself . Do you really want to buy an album that will put you in a suicidal state of depression ? I challange any Metallica fan to give up listening to Metallica 's suicidal angst music . I almost guarantee you 'll feel better when you are n't listening to Metallica .	-1
I feel bad listening to this master-piece of American bubble-gum & quot ; rock & quot ; . This band continue as lousy as ever , they 're only after your hard-earned money , so they can continue joking around the world makin bad recordings . There 's no even one real rock song worth listening in this . If you want listen to bubble-gum rock , at least go to their father , KISS , to listen to some good songs ...	-1
this disc was catchy 10 years back but nothing worth keeping.Groove is in the Heart was about it.much like the B-52 's pretty campy .	-1
After Surfer Rosa and Doolittle , you 'd expect another genius album . WHAT HAPPENED ! ! ? ? Everything that made the first two great is missing from this one ; good beats , inspired song structure and poignant lyrics are all MIA here . Definitely listen to it before you buy . If you have a decerning ear for artistic content , I doubt you 'll be pleased with this one .	-1
Never before has my cd player been punished with such repetitious over-produced self-indulgent nonsense . When I listen to this , I can hear Eldridge laughing at those who had previously considered him 'goth ' ... but I laugh to myself , because 'music ' such as this puts him in the 'shoddy Motley Crue cover band ' category . Which would he prefer ? I loved First and Last and Always and Floodland , I even did n't mind Some Girls Wonder By Mistake ... But this ? This just sounds like sleezy , late 1980 's LA strip-club music . And on his website , Mr Eldridge considers this a 'fine album ' ? Please . If this is 'fine ' music , then why is it that session musicians had to be PAID to play it . Where did the band go ?	-1
These Boys lost My respect when they claimed that JESUS failed . Nothing ELSE MATTERS , but the Truth boys , and satan is the god that FAILED Big Time , but has You Buffaloed into believing You can become UNFORGIVEN . Your SANDMAN is satan because You believe him a Winner HA HA , not Hardly . Wake up Metal-Ick-U you can become 4Given if You Really Follow The GOD THAT WON . JESUS . Obey His New Covenant Gospel 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9 2 John 9-11 , and drop the god who REALLY FAILED satan Ok .	-1
this is one of the most awful things ever made ... ballads ? nothing else matters ? unforgiven ? and enter sandman ? ha ... that 's so terrible ! there 's no good songs in this album . sad but true !	-1
this album is not good . enough said .	-1
I 've had a dislike for Metallica ever since I first heard their name , which has to be one of the cheesiest names for a band ever . I 'm hardly qualified to judge all of their material , since the only albums I 've heard straight through are the self-titled , Load and Reload . Well , Load does n't really count , because after getting about halfway through it I had to rip it out of my CD player and burn it.Anyhow , based on the 10 or 11 songs that I have heard off the older Metallica albums , the black album seems to be a huge sellout . They dumbed down the songwriting majorly , slowed down the songs way too much , and used way too heavy production . One of the reasons why most heavy metal is garbage is because the emphasis is on heaviness and not the songs . Metallica make the drums here so sickeningly heavy that the songs just get ruined.Plus the fundamental lameness of it all should make you feel embarassed to even own this album . Take the lead single , Enter Sandman , which tries to be scary but lyrically sounds like something a 10 year old child still afraid of the dark would come up with . Come on . And how about song titles like & quot ; The God That Failed & quot ; and & quot ; My Friend of Misery & quot ; ? I mean I know that this album is like 10 years old already , but those titles would have been cliched even 30 years ago.The one song on here I can tolerate is & quot ; Wherever I May Roam & quot ; , which has a really cool riff . But like all the other songs on this album its still marred by the overly metal guitars and drums . As for the rest of the album , there is no reason whatsoever to buy it unless you live in a Jerry Springer-esque town and want the rest of the trailer park to think you 're as cool as them . Even the horrible Reload is better than this , because even if its mostly filler and probably an even worse album overall , at least it has 3 semi-decent songs & quot ; Fuel & quot ; , & quot ; The Memory Remains & quot ; , & quot ; The Unforgiven Two & quot ; as opposed to the one semi-decent song here . Note that I said semi-decent , as in tolerable but still not worth actually paying money for . If you want Metallica , look for the older stuff , because this album is garbage .	-1
I was just listening to this CD , and thought how dangerous this album is . I mean that singer , he just ca n't sing , this is just dirty , dangerous , loud , angry metal . I mean I like the drummerLars but the rest of the CD is just noisy . The only good song isEnter Sandman . I like Nirvana Nevermind better because Kurt Cobain is much better singer even though he screams some . I thinkthere were more songs I liked on that album such as Smells Like Teen Spirit , Come As You Are , and In Bloom . This is just stupid lousy album . Go get Nirvana Nevermind and any album from Dire Straits , Guns N ' Roses , or Green Day insted.PS . This music is gon na make you cry .	-1
Only the Gargantua stomp of Enter Sandman has much resemblance to the Metallica of classic yore . The formerly apocalyptic sounding aggression now sounds like crybaby drivel ( examples : `` The Unforgiven '' and `` Nothing Else Matters '' grunge-y Metallica meets emo ... wheee ! ) .Here we have also one of the most anti-traditional Metallica songs on here , `` Do n't Tread on Me '' ( listen to it after `` Disposable Heroes '' and `` Fight Fire With Fire '' . You were warned. ) . Not to mention the song Hetfield himself admitted he wrote as filler , `` Through the Never '' .Never , as in never buy a Metallica album again.One of the most crippling variables here is the lead guitar work of Kirk Hammett . Hammett used up any ability he had on ( the SONGS ) `` Ride the Lightning '' and `` Fade to Black '' . He then began repeating himself extensively on `` Master of Puppets '' ( the only good solo on that entire album was Hetfield on the title track ) . Thus , Hammett gets owned by ole laziness himself : Yngwie Malmsteen , in having run out of ideas after two full studio albums ( whereas Yngwie arguably made it 2-and-a-half : `` Steeler '' , `` No Parole For Rock 'n ' Roll '' and 1/2 of `` Rising Force '' ) .On this album Hammett pulls what he did on the only-slightly-better `` ... and Justice For All '' , using the wah-wah as a crutch to get him past his horribly indolent , recycled licka-ature . It 's obvious that money completely changed his attitude toward the guitar ( much like it did Jimmy Page and too many others ) ; that is : play what you did before ( does n't really matter how well , since you 're rich now and all those rock and roll kids wo n't know the difference ) .Besides the aforementioned `` Sandman '' and perhaps `` My Friend of Misery '' ( well ... there 's a distinct whine on that track as well ) , this album is without merit . I would n't reccomend it to beginners in metal , like many other reviewers here mentioned . Why should n't they start with `` Master of Puppets `` or `` Ride the Lightning '' first ? Bottom line , this is only for die hard fans of Metallica .	-1
I do n't like it . Why all the hype about Metallica ? There is n't one thing special about them , just slow , boring music on this one . However , there are worse Metallica albums called Load and Re-Load . I 'm sorry , but Metallica is very overrated .	-1
Some say this is the greatest achievement by Metallica , those people are not true metal fans , this is when Metallica turned their backs on their true fans who where with them ever since 1983 when they had no money and no kind of corporate backing but put out awesome music , ok maybe I 'm being a little to harsh this album does have some ok tunes like Sandman and Holier Than Though , but overall this album is a complete back stab to the real metal community ...	-1
Ah , Metallica 's `` breakthrough '' CD . Yes , how wonderful it was that this great band learned how to `` pare its excesses '' and focus on `` tight song structures . `` Uh , hello ? I LIKED the excess on Metallica 's albums . That 's why they were great ; they made the excess work for the music , instead of against it . This CD , called the `` Black Album , '' is just a dozen songs with riffs stolen from Tony Iommi and lame nursery rhyme lyrics . Sure , Hetfield 's vocals only keep improving , but if I want great singing I 'll listen to Elvis.Maybe if half these songs had n't been overplayed so much on the radio and MTV , I might like them . But that 's not the case . This is boring arena rock , unsurprising and sterile .	-1
This is the point when Bob Rock comes in and begin to destroy the band artistically , but with the intention of making them rich.Bob Rock was a guy that worked with a lot of hair metal bands . That 's his reference.Maybe he and Lars and James figured it out : & quot ; Well , we had enough of writing highlyy complex , with intelligent and varied riffing and strong metal songs . Maybe we can make the same amount of money ( or much more ) by writing slow-tempo , falt and faceless songs that seem all the same , and people will fall for it , and we 'll not have to use our brains so hard to make the marvellous compositions we used to write & quot ; THat 's it , folks . Like someone said below , this was the & quot ; beginning of the end & quot ; . One year eralier I sold my copies of this album , of LOAD , RELOAD , of S & amp ; M album and even the GARAGE INC. ( due to the new covers ) . Yes , I bought them all , because I always had hope that they would find their way again.Metallica , a band that made his name by ripping-off the British heavy metal bands , at least could write great tunes . Now , they are just a souless band , cold , indulgent . At least Jason Newsted got out in time ...	-1
The hype and hoohaa surrounding this album does not even come close to justifying the actual musical credibility of this album . Metallica 's previous works were good ( although overated aswell ) but this album and all the hype surrounding it is responsible for the musical spiral in which this band will never climb out of.The logical conclusion is that rather than this being a natural evolution for the band , which this is clearly not , this album was written as a mass marketing tool , a sellout album . A natural progression would have this end up sounding similar to Meshuggah 's Contradictions Collapse and None , a truely underated album by a band that plays real music , rather then metallica , an album equated to an advertising billboard appealing to the & quot ; cool & quot ; generation rather then on music and people who listen to the music .	-1
Following a lackluster `` ... And Justice for All '' , they follow up with this drivel . i admit , i bought it . i loved it.But , Kill 'Em All and Master of Puppets remained in rotation in my CD player . This album , over time , proved NOT to be timeless like the older albums . Metallica had proven how long they prayed at the altar of the record industry . They sold out . They abandoned us who considered ourselves fans .	-1
If cliff was alive when tallica wrote black album he 'd probably laugh in their face . The album as a whole blows . A select songs on it are good , ie my friend of misery , unforgivin , through the never and struggle within . Enter Sandman is the most overrated piece of crap song i think i 've ever heard ( prior to hearing st anger ) Load and Reload were worse , and words cant even express how bad st anger was . This was the album that started the mighty Metallicas downfall . You cant go from Master Of Puppets , Disposible Heros , Dyers Eve and such to Enter Sandman , or Mama Said ... sad what once was the forrunner of thrash metal has come to .	-1
After AND JUSTICE FOR ALL , Metallica simply run out of ideas . That 's it . They just could not write great metal compositions anymore.Let 's check my claim : AND JUSTICE ... . was recorded in 1988 . Since then , Metallica released only two studio albums with new material : METALLICA ( 1991 ) and LOAD / RELOAD ( I 'll count them as one because they were the result of the same recording sessions ) .In the span of 14 years , Metallica has released only two albums , and filled the gap with a live album with orchestra and a new covers-album ... .Smart guys ... So , altough the black album is hailed as a & quot ; masterpiece & quot ; , I can not forget the fact that it seems the point where everything fell apart for Metallica 's integrity and honesty . THis is the moment when they team up with producer Bob Rock to make real money , and they obtained it . THis is the moment when the songs began to sound the same , with that slow-paced drum beat and groovy riffs.Like many other bands ( and that 's natural ) , Metallica was not capable of releasing album after album of strong material . In their specific case , their run ended with MASTER OF PUPPETS ( three albums ) or , depending on your taste , with AND JUSTICE FOR ALL . The Black Album is good , but it was not about Metallica anymore ...	-1
Go ahead and rip me ... unlike the majority of the lunkheads that are of the opinion that this is Metallica 's 'best album , ' this is the cd that finally caused me to throw up my hands in disgust ; why , oh WHY does every band I truly love let me down sooner or later , recording something so hideously WRONG ? Let 's see ... Metallica ... METALlica ... Metallica=thrash ... thrash album ( s ) ... from what I remember reading , 'Metal'lica noticed something 'wrong ' while touring for 'And Justice For All ' - it seems like the simpletons in the crowd just could n't 'get into ' all the intricate time changes going on in some of their newer songs ... in other words , no mindless headbanging for mindless cretins . To hell with experimentation , we say ! Let 's 'get into a groooooooooove . ' WAKE UP , MORONS ! You are a THRASH band ! ! ! ! ... I should 've noticed something was starting to stink around the time radio stations picked up on 'Welcome Home ' - yep , another radio-ready mid tempo song that predated this pile of grotesque garbage by a few years . As for 'One , ' if I hear that damn song one more time , I will go on a multi-state killing spree ... but golly , if it were n't for those 2 wastes of time , we would n't have 'The Black Album ' to rip apart , would we ? And it really pains me to rip Metallica , since I was there from the beginning ; I found their 1st lp on vinyl ( on Megaforce , before they signed to Elektra ) and bought it without even hearing a note beforehand ... the band name sounded cool , the song titles sounded like something I would enjoy , and the band was ugly as hell . Cool ! Brought it home and my jaw dropped ... I became the local metal hero at my high school , believe me . Brutal riffs , incredible time changes ... thinking-man 's thrash ! Excellent ! ! ! And then , little by little , things began to go awry ... it became truly evident after the sad and unfortunate death of bassist Cliff Burton - with his tragic passing , Metallica started to slip into realms of reek ... acoustic ballads ? What 's this crap ? ? ? I want 'Whiplash , ' dammit ! This album marked the end of an era for me ; I have not bought a single solitary Metallica cd since ( and I will never do so again ) ... I do n't own anything from them between this piece of s**t and 'Death Magnetic ' ( which is a promising cd ... but I 'm really scared of their 'Lulu ' cd ... even the name suggests another pile of crap ... maybe they should 've named it Doodoo ' instead ... ) - NOW , here 's the thing about this album that kinda sticks in my craw . Overall , as a complete body of work , is the music on this cd 'bad ' ? No ... as a 'corporate hard rock/metal ' album , it has its moments . 'Enter Sandman ' is a pretty cool song , and so is 'Through The Never . ' That being said , as a METALLICA album it fails on all counts . If their desire was to become a foppish MTV band , they succeeded ; never mind that you 'll be puking all over your hardcore fans ; the ones that supported you from the start , that loved songs like 'Trapped Under Ice , ' 'Disposable Heroes ' and 'Hit The Lights . ' THRASH fans . Bottom line : if this album was recorded by ANYONE else , I 'd probably love it , or at least LIKE it . Since it was recorded by Metallica , a band I once held in reverence for being the epitome of thrash , I absolutely DESPISE it . Hope you guys are happy now , since it seems like a gazillion people can finally headbang in unison at one of your shows ... bunch of damn sell-outs . Shame on Metallica for this utter piece of rubbish .	-1
Like most `` real '' Metallica fans , I too harboured a strong contempt for this album , simply known as the `` black album '' . I mean , this was the album that ushered in Metallica 's fall from grace and made them sellouts , at least that is what I thought . But upon going back and inspecting this album again I do not think it is such a sellout album as people claim . To me , the black album seems like a natural progression from `` ... And Justice for All '' . If one looks back at Metallica 's albums , one can see how each one is a direct progression from and an answer to its predecessor . For example , `` Ride the Lighnting '' feature more melody and better song writing in answer to the pretty much unmelodic immaturity of `` Kill 'Em All '' . Then , with `` Master of Puppets '' , Metallica build onto what they had started with `` Ride the Lightning '' and wrote even more ambitious songs with lyrics that were much more intelligent . After `` Master of Puppets '' they had more or less progressed as far as they could with `` thrash '' sound - enter `` ... And Justice for All '' . This album dropped most of the sheer hyperkintec velocity of its predecessor in favor of heaviness and a brooding , dark mood . I consider `` AJF '' to be Metallica 's best and they were on the top of their game lyrical and musically . And there , according to most Metallica purist is were the `` real '' Metallica ends and the sellouts now known as Metallica soldout . But , it seems to me that they did n't sellout at the Black album , for it is just a natural evolution of `` AFA '' . This album is still heavy , though not quite as `` AFA '' and it is n't as overtly dark thanks to its crystaline production . But just listen to the lyrics , this is a dark and direy album . Yes , musically this is much more simple in its approach than the previous albums , but again , Metallica had progressed as far with technical abilty as they could and still stay true to their sound . The ferocity that was Metallica was condensed into a single , streamlined , linear point - a minimalist Metallica , if you will . Just because this had huge commerical success does n't make it a sellout album ( They soldout around ReLoaded ) . It turned Metallica into the biggest metal/hard rock act the world has ever seen , and any album that did that can not be all that bad . If you go into this will a sour mind like I first did , then yes , you will dislike the black album . However , if you actually give this a chance you might just like it . I will admit that not all the songs on this are great ( in fact , few are ) and that this is not exactly my taste of music ( I still prefer their four previous albums to this ) , but this is still an decent album.NOTE : I ment to give this album 3 or 4 stars , which would have been above average based on my rating system . But I guess I accidently gave it 2 .	-1
There are so many debates about where Metallica went sour , or at what point they got better , that sometimes writting a review for this band can seem exhausting . I am sure that all that are reading this are pretty familar with this album , so let me get to my point why I find it a below average album . The year is 1991 , and we had waited three years for them to follow up on what I consider to be their break-through album , both musically and lyrically . Let me talk about the `` ... and Justice for all '' album for a moment . When it was first released , I had some mixed emotions about the album , but as time went on , I felt that it was a hell of an album . Even though I still love `` Ride the Lightning '' for its pure heaviness , the ... '' and Justice '' album was showing us how much the band had matured since the debut of `` Kill Em All '' in 1983 . Lars drumming was insane on this album , and sadly he never matched it again . The album was lyrically intelligent , moving into a more diverse range of subjects , and the guitar work was perfect , along with some great bass work by Jason . I almost think of it as a progressive rock/thrash album , and as you can tell by my ramblings , its a pure 5 star effort . SO lets get back to my review of the `` Black '' album . After expecting so much from the band after this greatness of `` ..And Justice for all '' I was expecting this album to be even better , since the band had just reached its pinnacle of musical greatness . So then I see the video for `` Enter Sandman '' Now I understand that they had made their first video for MTV off the .. '' And justice '' album , and that would be for the song `` One '' Yet , I dont think it was ever written to appeal to the masses . Yes , it did get them more of a fan base , but the album still didnt pull away from their roots of thrash . SO here is the video for `` Enter Sandman '' and I am thinking `` WTF ? ? ? ? ? '' I thought it was the worst song that Metallica had ever done , and it seemed like the song was written to appeal to the masses . Then I got the album . Man , what a disapointment . Not because its not as heavy as the other albums , but it seems like they never built on the previous release , and kind of `` dumbed down '' their material . Are there some good songs on here ? Sure , there are , but the album doesnt come close to the brillence of `` ... And Justice for All '' There seems to be way to much of a pop Metal feel to this , and I think that Metallica could have put forth a much better effort . This is why I still am furious over `` Load '' Not only did they `` dumb down '' even more , but the song writting horrid , as well as the musical effort . Its like if you took a band with Pink Floyd 's , Yes , or Rush 's talent , and asked them to record an album that sounded like something from Blink-182 or Green Day . This still is a disapointment , yet still has some listenable tracks , but I ca n't say its the `` Masterpiece '' that most people think that it is .	-1
The reason I bought Apollo 18 is because I liked the Oblongs and the Malcolm in the Middle theme songs they did . But , I just think this disc is incomplete . Half the songs are 10 seconds or less ( the Fingertips songs ) and most of the others are 2 minutes or less . Although the whole album is about 43 minutes , I just do n't think most of the songs are songs . I do like some of the songs ( My Evil Twin , The Statue Got Me High , See The Constellation ) but there 's nothing very special on this disc . Here 's a rundown of the songs:1 . Dig My Grave- Well , they say 'Dig My Grave ' a lot . Pretty bad lyrics and a VERY SHORT song ! The song is okay , but I really think it 's nothing special.Time : 1:08 Rating : 3/52 . I Palindrome I- A lot of people really like this song , but I think it 's nothing special . The lyrics are much better than Dig My Grave . I even like some of the lyrics . For example : `` I am a snake head eating the head of the opposite side . '' It 's probably one of the better songs on the CD . ( There 's not much competition . ) Time : 2:20 Rating : 4/53 . She 's Actual Size- I really hate this song . There 's nothing I like about this song . The lyrics do n't make much sense and sometimes the music is impossible to listen to . Another short song.Time- 2:05 Rating : 1/54 . My Evil Twin- Probably the best song on the CD . The lyrics are much better , `` Who cut the arm off the voodoo doll that resembles a Republican president from long ago . '' The music in the background is pretty good . One of the few strong parts of the CD . Too bad it was n't longer.Time- 2:36 Rating : 5/55 . Mammal- I like the song . But at this time I discovered that most of the songs on the CD sound pretty much the same . Also , they almost teach science in this song . There 's four chambers in the heart like they said and they tell you about blood cells.Time- 2:14 Rating : 3/56 . The Statue Got Me High- Probably the best song on the CD . The lyrics are great and the song is catchy . This and My Evil Twin are the two reasons I 'm not on eBay right now selling this . Very strong point on the CD . ( Finally . ) Time- 3:03 Rating : 5/57 . Spider- Ok ... .. I do n't know why they added a 50-second instrumental ( sort of ) song to this CD . It 's a very weird song and I think it 's PRETTY stupid.Time- 0:50 Rating : 2/58 . The Guitar- Twist on The Lion Sleeps Tonight . Although its okay , I do n't think it 's very good . One of the many songs I skip when I 'm rarely listening to this CD.Time- 3:48 Rating 3/59 . Dinner Bell- It 's okay , but sort of annoying . The lyrics are very annoying and they just talk about dinner bell doing the dinner bell thing . Again , it 's short.Time- 2:08 Rating : 2/510 . Narrow Your Eyes- It 's pretty boring . There 's nothing interesting or really different about this song . The chorus is really annoying and the rest of the song is n't too great , either.Time- 2:45 Rating : 2/511 . Hall of Heads- Let me just say , the music of this song is just about the best ON the CD . But , of course , the lyrics are very annoying.Time- 2:50 Rating : 3/512 . Which Describes How You 're Feeling- Finally , the song lyrics are sung pretty fast . The moment I heard this , I thought , `` Hmmm ... this might be the best song on the CD . '' Then it ended . The whole song was just over 1 minute . Psshh ... Time- 1:12 Rating : 4/513.See The Constellation- This is a pretty good song . The song lyrics are pretty good and the whole song is n't annoying , such as many songs on this album . I think this is a very good song , although not as good as My Evil Twin or The Statue Got Me High.Time- 3:26 Rating : 5/514 . If I Was n't Shy- Boring . Very slow and boring throughout the whole song . All it is is the singer telling people what he 'd do if he was n't shy . When you think about it , good thing he is n't shy . Horrible song.Time- 1:42 Rating : 1/515 . Turn Around- Hmmmm ... weird . The song is okay , but the chorus gets very old very quick . It 's nothing special , just like the whole CD.Time- 2:51 Rating : 2/516 . Hypnotist of Ladies- This song is actually sort of fast ( compared to the rest of the CD ) but it 's still horrible.Time- 1:40 Rating : 2/517-37 : Fingertips- All of these songs are just 10-20 second snippings that just say 1 or 2 words . Some of them are sort of funny , and this IS sort of a strong point of the CD , but they 're short.Time- various times Rating : 4/538 : Space Suit- Space Suit is an instrumental song and it 's not very great . It 's only okay , but apparently a lot of people like this song . I guess I 'm not one of those people , because I find it irritating.Time- 1:36 Rating : 2/5Okay , I 'm through with all the songs . The major problem with this CD is that all the songs are so short and many did n't even need to be put on the CD . The average length of the song are 2 minutes and 9 seconds . That 's just sad . I 'm sorry if this album is just about your favorite album in the whole world , but I give it a dissapointing 2 out of 5 .	-1
You would have thought , with a list of brass credits this big , that the music on this album would have more intensity , but aside from 'Alcazar ' , which is beautiful , the horn section sounds , well , cold and mechanical . It does n't sound like a seasoned group of musicians , but rather like a CD where each track was put together in the studio ( those redundant guitar lines on 'Snakes ' are a great example ) . This includes a section of horns that sound like they were were sampled electronically and added around Sanborn 's solo sax . Try Tower of Power for some really emotive brass section work .	-1
A BUNCH OF SILLY INCONSEQUENTIAL STUFF.ALL THE BEST SONGS ARE DONE MUCH BETTER ON THE LIVE ALBUMS.This is Phish 's second official , major release studio album ( it is thier third , if you count Junta , which was originally only sold at concerts on a cassette tape ) . It is 60 minutes long , and the sound quality is very good but not excellent.There are 16 tracks on this disc . But , only 5 of them have any meat to them . The rest is just silly filler in between the real songs.Phish plays these 5 songs in concert all of the time . They are on many of the Phish live albums . Sometimes , Phish stretches out the songs , and other times they do n't . But , all of the live versions I have heard are better than these studio versions.The album starts out really strong with Llama . Other good tracks are Tweezer and Chalk Dust Torture . Cavern is a good song , but this one is especially so much better done live.The other tracks are a mixutre of styles . There is a Calypso track , a Latin-rock track and some soft jazz . There is nothing wrong with experimenting with different styles . Many groups have done it successfully all on one album , like Derek Trucks on Make A Joyful Noise , or Frank Zappa on Chunga 's Revenge . But , Phish 's attempts at all of these styles is rather weak and not very interesting . It reminds me of Pat Boone trying to do rock and roll.I prefer Phish 's later studio albums . I think they just got better as their sound matured . But , I also like the earlier work on Junta and Lawn Boy.I think that this CD suffers somewhat from the `` American Beauty '' effect . As with every jam band , Phish 's first 2 studio albums , Junta and Lawn Boy were more along the lines of their live shows . Eventually , every Jam band wants to make an American Beauty , the Grateful Dead 's first traditional studio album that emphasizes the songs and not the music . I think with most bands it is forced , while for the Dead it was a natural progression . String Cheese Incident just went throught this with the horrible One Step Closer .	-1
- Barely any melody- Poor attempts at harmonizing ( except Gigantic and Where is My Mind ) - sub-par rhythm section- Sounds worse than a live album . Sounds like my band practicing but with a bigger budget.I tried to like the pixies . I tried , really hard too . I 'm musically open minded and like similar artists like Superchunk , The Wrens , Smashing Pumpkins etc . ... i just ca n't ... like this except for a few songs.Thank god I downloaded this , or i 'd be selling it now .	-1
I bought this CD the day it came out , and let me tell you , the 1990s had their share of hits and misses , more misses than hits , and this open especially bothered me a lot . Granted , nearly every artist and group loathes to release a second album that is a Xerox of the first one , but when bands define what they want to be : metal , pop , dance , etc.. they truly do a disservice to themselves and their fans when they release an album that lacks all the things that made the first one such an catch in the first place . Yes , they have the & # 34 ; Deee-Lite & # 34 ; eclectic team of producers and collaborators to make the & # 34 ; sound & # 34 ; come out , however , the songs here are AWFUL ! They appear to be either the rejected tracks from the first one , stuff that was in somebody 's forgotten trunk that should have never seen the light of day ( see XTC Apple Venus Vol1 , and Oranges & Lemons ) , or songs that were rushed and half-baked on the subway ride to the recording studio . Since the label or the band already paid for the production team , the studio time , and the rest of the team , this sloppy homework done at the last minute is what they had to work with . No time for rewriting or to properly compose good songs as they did with the first one . The label wants another 5 top 10s by the end of the week ! ! Sadly maybe 2 songs were good enough for me to keep this album in my collection for so many years , but now I will trade it in among with my other undesirables for enough $ to buy something else . The last time a famous artist went from his trade ( rock ) to a political album , it flopped miserably . Anyone remember John Lennon & Yoko Ono & # 34 ; Some Time In New York City & # 34 ; ( 1972 ) ? Yes , that one sucked as well . Right after this flop DJ Towa Tei called it quits . He saw the writing on the wall . A sad and bitter decline for a band that had so much promise . I still mourn them .	-1
This review is going to put me in the line of fire , but so be it . First , the good news . Paul Fox 's low-tech production has loosened the band up considerably after the Peter Asher-produced `` Blind Man 's Zoo '' showed signs of stiffness . The lyrics are more abstract and less focused on social issues . The joyful `` These Are Days '' recalls `` In My Tribe , '' their best album . The gentle , hypnotic `` Circle Dream '' explores new territory with satisfying results.So why the low rating ? Because there is n't a single song here ( aside from the two I mentioned ) that could n't have benefitted from stronger music . Most of the melodies sound like afterthoughts . This becomes painfully obvious on `` Jezebel ; '' even the jarring rhythmic shifts ca n't obscure the meandering quality of the song . `` Tolerance , '' the one attempt at `` rock , '' has none of the bite of `` Headstrong '' or even `` My Mother The War . '' Bringing in the James Brown horn section on two tracks only weighs things down . When the Maniacs finally come across a decent riff on `` If You Intend , '' all they can do is repeat it to death . If you 're a fan , you still might want to check out `` Our Time In Eden , '' but expect to spend more time reading the lyric sheet than listening to the album .	-1
Unlike most SOM fans who have followed the group since their early days , I only recently became interested in these goth rock legends . I bought their first album , First and Last and Always , to start out , and consider it to be a gem in my CD collection . This caused me to become interested in their later music , but I could n't decide on which CD of theirs to get . So I got their greatest hits to give me an overview , and I have to say it is a big disappointment after having known only the material from First ... The numerous eight minute long sagas sound aimless and repetitive and lack much originality . Even old favorites , like No Time to Cry sound weak with the added effects . This album definetly should not be a starting point for those who are new to the SOM because it will only turn away new listeners .	-1
I saw a lot of reviews for this album that proclaim its genius , saying how it stands up next to other classics such as The White Album or Dark Side of Moon . Well , I would n't give it that much credit , but I will say it 's carved out its own spot in the crowded world of music.What I did n't like about it is that the whole thing comes off as juvenile , and very little actual songwriting ability comes into play . Instead of substance , I see an overwhelming attention to sound texture , almost as if they relied on their effects pedals and synthesizers to write their songs for them . It seems as though the guitars are run through phasers or stereo/chorus on every track . While this works well for some songs , for others it seems like the novelty wears thin . And anybody can screw around with a lot of effects , some do it better than others . I 'd say Sonic Youth does it better.I 've seen comparisons to Frank Zappa in some reviews of Ween . What separates Frank Zappa from this group is the ability to write a song.I can see how this would play well with audiences that like their psychedelics a whole lot , but mostly I found it obnoxious at its worst , engaging at its ( infrequent ) best .	-1
I presume from the average ratings that this one is meant to be like Captain Beefheart 's `` Trout Mask Replica '' - you either love it or think it 's atrocious . Count me among the latter . There is , quite literally , zero , songwriting talent on display here . For truly great geek-rock music from the same period , try They Might Be Giants . Toss this in the bin.Argh . I wanted to rate this zero stars , but Amazon wo n't let me !	-1
I just do n't get all the praise for this cd . I was a huge Anthrax fan up until this album , bought it when it came out and never could learn to like it . Ended up giving it away . So here I am again , having bought and loving their new 'Worship Music '' cd with Belladonna back at the wheel . So I decided to dl all the Bush era Anthrax and give it another listen , based on all the praise showered here . Thought maybe I missed something . Ugh , this cd sounds so generic ! There are a few decent songs , like 'Only , and `` Room for one more '' . Nothing catchy that sticks with me at all . And I do n't care for Bush 's vocals here either . Where 's the awesome singer that did `` Can U deliver ' ? ? He certainly is n't on this cd ! The band has completely changed musical direction too , it is n't the fun , tongue-n-cheek , moshing mayhem Anthrax that I love , it sounds more like heavy grunge/hard rock . Now I love grunge , so that in itself is not a bad thing , but this is not even good grunge rock . I just do n't get the hype here . Very boring and bland . Now their cd `` We 've come for you all '' is starting to kind of grow on me and is leagues better than this one . Having revisited this cd just reminds me why I gave it away in the first place .	-1
This disc has no soul . How could a supposed musical & quot ; concept & quot ; concerning a rift in a human realtionship be so void of human emotion ? I could n't even bare to think that someone might actually see it in my collection , so I sold it . The instrument sounds are produced well , overall the sound is clean , but the music is lame . If compared to any number of other rock guitarists ( Fripp , Howe , Vai , Satriani , Belew , Zappa to name but a few ) jazz guitarisrs ( Pass , Hall , Roberts , Montgomery , Benson , Metheny , Frissell , Stern , Abercrombie , once again naming but a few ) or real musical virtuosos ( Bach , Beethoven , Brahams , Mozart , Chopin , Debussy , Starvinsky , Rachmaninoff , Bird , Diz , Miles , the list goes on ... ) Anastasio commands no instrumental virtuosity on this effort . The only other Phish disc that I still own is & quot ; Billy Breathes & quot ; . At least that one has some emotion . I would rather listen to old Glen Campbell lp 's than ever spin this drivel in my player again .	-1
no question , the guy played a mean slide and created a real hoodoo mood . problem is , the performance is so overwrought and melodramatic , it 's almost humorous . do not believe that was the intention . the blues are supposed to be an escape from hell .	-1
This is considered one of the best electronic records of the early 90 ` s and one of Bjork ` s essential albums . While it is innovative in some moments , parts of it already sound dated today , and a lot of songs aren ` t all that interesting to begin with and turn out to be a bit irritating . Bjork sings in an unique way , no doubt , but it doesn ` t mean that she ` s always nice to listen to . A few good tracks appear here and there , such as the opener & quot ; Human Behaviour & quot ; , the atmospheric & quot ; One Day & quot ; or the ethereal & quot ; Come To Me & quot ; . Still , as a whole this debut is too uneven to recommend even if it is a somewhat curious album . It ` s follow-up & quot ; Post & quot ; is a more well accomplished effort , this is just a fashionable product .	-1
This is a weird one . To bring his 8o ths `` hip to the square '' style to some classical rock and roll songs . It ` s a so so listening , that put ` s Huey Lewis all over the song ` s but have problem ` s to bring us back to 5o ths . It start ` s ok with the soulfull saxophone on Shake Rattle and Roll , on track 1 , butthen Lewis voice doesn ` fit ` s in in a way . Track 2 Blue Monday , has a good musical background atmosphere , but the vocal one brings it down . The saxophone is great anyway . Track 3 Searching for my love , is a sentimental weepie , and the quality mark weeps too . Track 4 She ` s somekind of wonderful , is more in the Lewis 80 ths style , and this one works . On Track 5 But it ` s alright we are back in the `` stream of cliches '' once again . It ` s anyway ok in a way . Track 6 . If you got ta make fool of somebody , sounds like `` poor manns '' Burt Bacarach , which is a minor stepdown.Track 7 Mother in Law , is an upstiffer , and on this one Huey `` steps '' on the right buttons , all trough . Track 8 Little Bitty Pretty One , is an even better song . The only 5 star song on this CD , with it ` s tempo up beat rock and roll rythm all trough . This one shines . Track 9 Good Morning little school girl , is an ok , blues song , which another vocal than Huey ( or it could be ? ) brings some flaire to the song . Track 10 Stagger Lee , is a classic . The original is better . Track 11 . She shot a hole in my soul . Yes she does and Huey does too , when i listen to it . Bad to the bone this , with it ` s hybrid 50 th ` s and 80 ths soundpicture . Track 12 Surley i love you , sound ` s like a `` comic book song '' , and is more `` cartoon '' than rock and roll . Track 13 You left the water running , is cool , and has a certain temperature all trough . Track 14 Your cash ain nothin but trash , has some guts , but it doesn ` t kicks off . Track 15 Function at the junction has big band flair , but that ` s all . Track 16 Better to have and not need , it ` s `` urban big band beat '' as poor man ` s blues brothers , but that ` s not a quality mark on this one , but it sparks here and there sometimes . Track 17 Going down slow , is a fast `` blues rock and roller '' that sparks lively.As a whole this one shake ` s sometimes , but on most of the track ` s it doesn ` t . That ` s it folks !	-1
Back in the day , this was very popular . Not many people are driving around with this in their cd player today . It sounds dated.However , `` Cannonball '' is a classic . This band just happened to stumble on a genuine , `` Louie , Louie '' type of song . `` No Aloha '' is interesting ( sounds very Pixie ish ) , `` Divine Hammer '' is decent and `` Driving on 9 '' is a cool , trucker vibe of a song.The rest of this is pretty unlistenable .	-1
2 1/2Moby begins to struggle out of generic techno land on this dull-with-a-side-of-intrigue EP . If it does anything important it is to highlight the budding artist 's hint of creative liberation which was to be followed by full blown breakthrough .	-1
The camera work on the concert DVDs looks like something the local community college art dept . may have produced . The camera never stops flashing back and forth one angle to the next . A real headacher indeed . Two stars only because it 's Metallica , any other band would get one star . Good idea , poor effort .	-1
This is not a very good effort from David . The music has no soul , its boring and overall play is just plain . I have played this album maybe twice in ten years ... and that ` s a lot . I can wait to get rid of it .	-1
I loved this album as a pre-teen in the early noughties , but it does n't hold up . He calls himself CL the 'sextified ' , over and over - and that sums up the tone of this album . I do n't know what happened but C.L . smooth fell off so hard on this album . He 's just sex-obsessed on this , it makes most of the tracks awkward and unlistenable and off-putting . He 's trying to play an LL Cool J ladies-man role , and it is just not working at all . And that 's a damn shame because this is some of Pete Rock 's best production ( that is , when he does n't simply xerox the samples from Donald Byrd ) perhaps some of the best production of the era period . If only there were someone else on the mic riding these beats , this record would be mentioned alongside Illmatic and Ready to Die as the genre 's most beloved classics .	-1
For once I agree completely with the Amazon review . These tunes are boring , unsexy and soulless.I can hear the record company pitch . `` Lets find three seriously pretty girls who can sing so we can indulge our sexist fantasies in some hastily written songs , and make buckets of money ! '' . And the result is what I call Drivel Music - not sexy , not even musical , just irritating . With Athena Cage being in such short supply , I wanted to hear a little more of her . But not like this .	-1
I 've tried to get into this artist but I can not . I would rather listen to 20 hours of someone 's fingernails on a chalkboard than what passes for Bjork 's voice . Avoid unless you like to hear your dog howl .	-1
I purchased this album several years ago and recently listened to it again and was a little disappointed . The strong tunes are spread out among too many seemingly pointless tracks which sound like a spoiled little rich kid was turned loose in the studio with no regard for musically correct pieces . It 's not that all of the music is bad , but it sounds more like unfinished experimentation thrown together rather hastily then pressed into a product just for the sake of making a release . What happened to the darling Bjork who sang so strongly and pleasing to the ear in & quot ; Big Time Sensuality & quot ; , & quot ; There 's More to Life than this & quot ; , & quot ; Crying & quot ; , & quot ; Venus as a Boy & quot ; , and & quot ; Violently Happy & quot ; from Debut ? On & quot ; Post & quot ; it appears that success has gone to her head and she got herself to the point where she could just hum and make noises into a tape recorder and the deluded public would call it artistic experimentation . Of the strong tunes , & quot ; Army of Me & quot ; is an interesting idea with a great drum track , but the singing in the chourus does n't blend well with the music and does n't even sound musical . The partially-thrilling & quot ; Enjoy & quot ; sounds unfinished and raw and could use some fine-tuning . & quot ; Possibly Maybe & quot ; is one tune that still sounds good after several listens , and & quot ; It 's Oh So Quiet & quot ; remains my favourite tracks on the album , here she actually sings a catchy melody and utilizes her unique voice to convey the strength and beauty as she did on Debut . Her voice actally sounds great against the orchestra . But poor tunes like & quot ; You 've been Flirting again & quot ; , & quot ; Cover Me & quot ; , and the dreadful & quot ; Headphones & quot ; inspire me to ask myself & quot ; what was she thinking ? & quot ; Her shaky whispering vocals just do n't work with the music , are n't catchy ( and sometimes not even on the correct notes ) . I am surprised at all of the rave reviews that this disc received . When she was backed up by guitars and acoustic drums with The Sugarcubes , Bjork was at her best . Her solo efforts have gotten progressively worse . Bjork is an extremely talented artist and I feel a bit cheated by & quot ; Post & quot ; and even more so by & quot ; Homogenic & quot ; , wondering why she is not living up to her potential . Try spinning old Sugarcubes tunes like & quot ; Blue Eyed Pop & quot ; , & quot ; Delicious Demon & quot ; , & quot ; Coldsweat & quot ; , & quot ; Vitamin & quot ; , & quot ; Hit & quot ; , Speed is the Key & quot ; , & quot ; Walkabout & quot ; , and & quot ; Motorcrash & quot ; then listen to & quot ; Post & quot ; , there is definitely something missing .	-1
I own every Cure album , and I love all of them ... except this one . I 've had this album since the day it came out , and despite all the negative reviews and terrible things said about it , I gave it a very fair chance . It 's really not as bad as SOME people say . I mean at least The Cure are still trying new things musically . Problem is , a lot of these melodies just are n't very good at all . `` Want '' , `` Bare '' and `` Jupiter Crash '' are incredible , and easily the best songs on here . The other decent ones , `` This Is A Lie '' , `` Mint Car '' , and `` Return '' , are still not that great . But `` Round & Round & Round '' , `` Gone '' , `` Club America '' , `` Strange Attraction '' , and `` Trap '' make me wonder how Robert Smith could even listen to those songs , much less over and over again during recording sessions ! Then there 's `` The 13th '' which stands alone with it 's dumb melody , but interesting carribean musings . I guess it 's okay , there 's nothing awful about it . And `` Numb '' , the same way ... nothing great about that song , but then nothing about it stands out or drags me in , it 's just sort of there . And I know how a lot of fans of this album like `` Treasure '' and it 's okay , but after a while it just bores me . So yeah , this one 's a miss . For all the reviews I 've read that suggest that the reason this album gets a bad rap is because of all the goth-purists who do n't like it cause it 's pop , I 'm no goth purist , in fact I love all the pop stuff they 've done , EXCEPT this album ! Personally , I consider this the worst Cure album because I think The Cure 's usual outstanding talents in the mood , melody and lyrics departments are lacking here . Most bands that have been around for this long end up putting out a few albums that are n't very good . Well this is the Cure 's one miss so far .	-1
Wild Mood Swings is an album from The Cure that I do n't care for . I purchased this when it was released a few years back and quickly filed it away in my music collection ( I was n't impressed with it back then either ) . I just recently decided to give it a listen again to see if my past perspective of it would change -- ca n't say it has . I can see why I only listened to Wild Mood Swings maybe just a handful of times a few years ago . It 's a strange album really . Nothing stands out at all on this release . The musicianship and production are better-than-good , it 's just that the songwriting leaves a lot to be desired . The album seems to try hard , but it still ends up uneventful and bland . I also thought that the brass instruments really did n't fit in either . Wild Mood Swings is the only release that I have of The Cure that I could easily get rid of . Not completely poor ( musicianship and production-wise ) , but still very unmemorable . I actually rate this 2.5 stars . Listen to Disintegration .	-1
This CD is a huge disappointment for long-time Maniacs fans . There are four excellent songs ( San Andreas Fault , Wonder , Jealousy , and Carnival ) , and the rest just lays there . Almost every song is plodding and pedantic . Gone are any upbeat pop songs , in favor of slow , self-involved , downright boring tunes . Just when you think there could n't possibly be another down-tempo number , there it is . If you 're enamored with Natalie the pop star , this is your CD , but if you are a fan of the musical/songwriting abilities of 10000 Maniacs , they are not here . She may not need that band to be successful , but her music has definitely taken a turn for the worst with this effort , which of course matters little as far as radio play , etc . goes . Natalie 's singing is at it 's best , clear , intimate , even moving at times , but that is not enough to energize this sleeper . Every single song ca n't be a slow one ! I 'll be listening to & quot ; The Earth Pressed Flat. & quot ; and would encourage you to do the same . It compares favorably with classic Maniacs CDs , but Tigerlily does NOT , by any stretch of the imagination . Do n't buy the hype !	-1
I for one was disappointed by this record . I know that a band this good is likely to receive negative criticism for any album they release that is anything less than their usual ass-kicking standards . For example , after Back in Black came out , For Those About To Rock and Flick of the Switch both got less-than-spectacular reviews but were a couple of really great albums that a lot of fans and critics were reluctant to listen to without comparing them to past classics . If any other band had released them , they might have been hailed as masterpeices . Fly on the Wall truely was n't nearly as good as anything before it , but when listened to with an open mind , if you get past Brian 's deteriating voice , the worse-than-usual lyrics , the weak production , and only a few really weak songs , that album still contains some classic AC/DC tunes . Ballbreaker , on the other hand , has very strong production , only a few decent songs , worse-than EVER lyrics , and a ton of boring , plodding songs that do n't go anywhere . What happened , guys ? Blow Up Your Video and the Razor 's Edge has a lot of really cool stuff going on in the songs musically , and with the exception of the vocals , they clearly showed signs of musical growth and songwriting progress , even if they did n't `` kick ass '' , per se . I 'm sorry to say that Ballbreaker has no kick-ass appeal , nor does it have many interesting licks . It 's just bland . I liked it at first , but it became a boring listen . Why ? For one , no energy . Well , that 's okay , but ALSO no interesting riffs to make up for the lack of vitriol causes this record to fall flat on it 's face even when played at full volume . Brian 's voice , which is almost completely dead , is something I 've gotten used to , so I do n't really mind it so much . The problem here is clearly the lousy songwriting . Cover You In Oil , Boogie Man , The Honey Roll , Love Bomb , and Whiskey on the Rocks sound as if they were effortlessly thrown together in minutes . Some of the songs have really cool parts . I 've always liked `` Hard as a Rock '' , the title track and a few others . So my message to you , my friend , is that if you 're in search of some really good late-period AC/DC , try Stiff Upper Lip . It 's got muscle , it 's got loud blistering guitars , it 's got blues , it 's got raw production , good energy , and last but not least , GOOD SONGS !	-1
I guess not , and maybe that 's the reason the Young Brothers keeps Brian Johnson under their payroll . There are a couple of good songs here , a good sound production , good booklet . Bu the singing ... oh My ! !	-1
I ca n't believe that some people actually consider this to be a good album , let alone one of AC/DC 's best . Give me a break ! Is there a worse song in their entire catalog than Hail Caesar ? I certainly do n't think so . The Furor ? C'mon ! I 've been a fan since '78 and I recall when I saw them on this tour , that I sat behind some teenagers who stood up for the Ballbreaker songs , but sat down for classics like The Jack . What a society we live in . I do n't know where I was going with that , but anyway , DO N'T BUY THIS CD ! Is that subtle enough ?	-1
The Human League were at the cutting edge of synth pop back in the early eighties , but they really should have given up the ghost when the decade ended , albums like this only tarnish their reputation .	-1
In the Meantime was a big hit and I thought it was a great song . I bought this album for that song . I listened to it several times but each time the rest of the music got worse and worse . This is the only album I have ever given away . It is awful . DO NOT BUY THIS RECORD . If you like the single then buy the single . This band should not be encouraged .	-1
I 'm adding my voice to the two others before me who were unimpressed by this album . Several of the reviewers who praise this album attribute the two negative reviews to fans of Gilmore 's more traditional country albums who can not accept the more adventurous production provided here by T Bone Burnett . Well , that does n't describe me at all . I 'm a big fans of Burnett and like almost all of his other production jobs . And this is the only Jimmie Dale Gilmore solo album I 've ever heard , so my opinion has nothing to do with comparisons to his other solo works.So , in many ways I should have loved this album . I like the first Flatlanders album , I like Joe Ely , I like Butch Hancock , I prefer my country music to have a bit of rock 'n ' roll edge to it . When I started listening to this , I thought at first that it just needed more time to grow on me . Well , after about 6 listens , I now know that it will never grow on me . I like one song a lot - `` Borderlands '' . The title track is OK . The rest just sounds lifeless to me.I think the biggest problem for me is that the production sounds mismatched to the music . This is especially true of the drum sound , which is primitive and would fit in more on an alternative rock or even punk rock album . I might like this sound on one of T Bone 's solo albums , but it sounds completely out of place with Gilmore 's voice and songs.That being said , I do n't think I 'd be a big fan of this album even if it had a more standard country sound that fit Gilmore 's style better . Neither his songs nor his voice seem very compelling to me .	-1
2 1/2By now you should know if you like or dislike the technically accentuated prog-metal show-offs , and appreciation of this fan-intensive EP will certainly be determined by that relation , as there is simply not enough challenging material here to exceed typical early/mid-career appeasement .	-1
I bought this CD because I heard one track ( & quot ; Give Me One Reason & quot ; ) on the radio & amp ; I had hoped that the whole CD would have a similar sound . Unfortunately , no other song on the CD sounds remotely like that one , so unknown to me at the time , there was only one reason to buy the CD ! & quot ; Give Me One Reason & quot ; is a great blues song , with excellent lyrics ( about a couple breaking up ) , & amp ; excellent electric guitar work , & amp ; an excellent soulful Girl Group doing backup vocals . It 's too bad that the rest of the songs on this CD are painfully slow , much more acoustic in nature , & amp ; do n't have the driving force of this one track . Tracy is known as a bluesy folk artist ; on this CD , the emphasis is heavily on the folk , except for that one song . & quot ; Remember the Tinman & quot ; is the only other song that has what resembles a & quot ; beat , & quot ; but its lyrics are not up to her usual standards . If you like & quot ; Give Me One Reason , & quot ; try to find it on a single or compilation rather than buying this CD -- you 're not likely to enjoy the rest of the songs .	-1
By C.S.Blue - Eyed Soul groups from the U.K. have recieved a mixed reception from North American audiences n recent years since the infusion of such acts hit such shores in the 1980's.Arrving on the heels of their American predecesors Hall & Oates , Michael Mc Donald , and Kenny Logins , these artists , primarily influenced by contemporary Black American R & B ; acts , found it a tough sell to attain Stateside success.That dose n't mean that the music has been totally illegitimate by any means , just under- rated and underappreciated by an audience un-savvy to the material ( like yours truly ) There have been some chart- topping moments - from Go West and their success with `` King Of Wishful Thinking ' from the blockbuster movie `` Pretty Woman '' soundtrack and moderate rotation for acts such as Living In A Box , Curiosity Killed The Cat ' Rick Astley , Spandau Ballet , and Breathe.Sheffield based ABC and former Wham ! vocalist George Michael had been the most consistent with Michael , at least until his personal troubles surfaced , at the top of the list image and sales- wise.The other British outfit that have generated on and off interest and some critical aclaim have been Simply Red . They broke chartwise in 1986 with the soulful ballad `` Holding Back The Years '' from their impressive `` Picture Book '' album.Their next few releases sparked mild interest , but a dip in sales , particularly i the U.S. , where the market had grown weary of British acts all the way across the board , rendered the group exiled in the minds of music fans on the North American side of the Atlantic.Then the group came back in the biggest way possible ; by unleashing the best selling album in British chart history ; `` the multi- platinum `` Stars '' Upon scrutinizing their follow up record `` Life '' , the contrast is somewhat vast though not far removed from the soul -based foundation The Reds are known for . `` Life '' is a mellow and emotive sounding piece of work with textured synths that bear a distinct resemblence to American acts stylistically packaged in a like- wise manner.No doubt the ingredients on `` Life '' make it a predictabe mix , yet the interesting aspect to the songs are small live elements to the candlelight aroma that one can sniff out on the majority of the albums tracks . Case and point- the finger snaps and distant mix of horns on `` So Beautiful Being '' , and the visual quality lent to the sexually driven subject matter on '' Remembering the First Time '' , a cut with the live feel that is Simply Red 's forte which they continue to project on the dreamy- sounding `` Out On The Range '' , which begins with a potent synth intro and progresses into a Philly- Motown groove vocal riff from Hucknall that certainly ranks as one the brighter spots on `` Life '' . The album does emit a slower cadence to it and fails miserably at an attempt to master pop reggae on `` Hillside Avenue '' until someone walked into the studio and rattled the band 's musical cage rattled to deliver the aformentioned live -sounding Simply Red tracks to give the record some sort of shape.This album was less commericially driven and not an blatant attempt to literally duplicate `` Stars '' , though in some respects it was . The bottom line on `` Life '' is that it is a less live attempt to create soul music . A counter-productive approach that prevents it from being a funkier and more powerful record and more like hip- hop based American R & B ; that is srtictly machine driven , lacks originality , and is way too easy to predict . Simply Red decided to be the latest in a long line of acts today that want to manufacture the magic.All in all `` Life '' is not an overwhelmingly scintillating record , but it rates as a semi- strong two ( 2 ) and a half to good three ( 3 ) star album that will probably keep the die- hards satisfied , but unlikely to shift musical tides elsewhere.C.S.6-11-03	-1
I 've listened to this piece of work several times , in many positions , on various stero systems , during different moods and I just ca n't understand the lyrics half the time and the arrangements were best described as 'a wall of mud'.It is n't a question of country music , or contemporary music , with ELH she has demonstrated throughout the years she just loves , and respects , GOOD MUSIC . The music is good , the woman has impeccable taste but this time I had wished she sat in on the mixing process.I think I understand the aim of this collection but geez , I wish I did n't . I am too accustomed to hearing ELH 's clear voice slice to the heart of the lyrics , take them and present them with a totally unique perspective . I wo n't start on her own playing because this review would be nothing but gushing about her near-total mastery of her craft.She 's an amazing woman , artist and collaborator -- I love her because she is everywhere in music : supporting new artists , doing background for others , her duets are gems of generosity with respect for her fellow artists , while always doing what 's best for the song . I just hope there 's no follow up to WB.I 'm very happy with my other 8 ELH cds and I 'm in awe of 'All Roads Running ' and my [ ... ] is going to be front center next week in Los Angeles . It 's like waiting for Xmas .	-1
I 've been a fan of EH since 1975 , and being skeptical of overhype , I ignored this CD when it came out . Having hated her followup to this , `` Red Dirt Girl , '' I still stayed away . When I found it at my local library , I checked it out , and am I glad I did n't waste a dime on it . I confess , I gave up on it after 6 tracks . Her singing was off key , her diction slurred , and there was n't a steel guitar to be heard . I guess this is some sort of New Age Folk , but it sure did n't float my boat . If you 're a fan of EH 's country music , pick up her latest , `` All I Intended To Be '' and you wo n't be disappointed . But stay away from this one !	-1
I want to like this record , but I do n't really . Going for some kind of a concept album , on Black Love , for the first and only time in his carrer , Dulli 's reach exceeds his grasp . The result sounds swollen , pretentious , not quite genuine . I like to think that Dulli realized this , and intentionally stripped back some of the posing , to make the rootsier , less ambitious , and just flat better record with 1965 . Still , there is some good material here ; taken in small doses , everything sounds pretty good -- '' Going to Town '' and `` Honkey 's Ladder '' rock something fierce -- and although `` Faded '' is a little overblown , well , maybe more than a little , it somehow still manages to move me . This is the kind of record that would look good on a storyboard , from the creeping opening of `` Crime Scene Part One , '' to `` Double Day , '' so filled with foreboading , `` It was a Saturday , I came home early/ drunk with love and other things '' to the elegiac midpoint `` Step Into the Light , '' the chaotic end of the second act , the two above mentioned rockers , ( `` Honkey 's Ladder opens with `` got you where I want you , motherf***er do n't you try to move '' ) and moving toward conlusion and bittersweet resolution on `` Faded . '' The trouble is , that as it actually plays out , it sounds a little too structured , calculated , and neat , the spotenatiety is lacking . On their own , in concert say , many of these songs would , I suspect , hold up very well indeed . All in all , a theoretical acheivement .	-1
You would think that the reunion album with Vince Neil would have been something to look forward to . Actually , it 's even worse than the self titled album with John Corabi . Although I really liked their first five albums , this one just did n't do it for me . This CD also has the dubious honor of what is probably the worst ever Crue song , `` Brandon . ''	-1
The first thing that will come to your mind after a listen of The Crue 's 1997 Generation Swine will probably be : What the f*ck were they thinking ? Has Motley Crue turned into KISS where each member takes a turn at the mic ? What we need to remember is that this is a reunion album of sorts . For a long eight years have passed since 1989 's Dr. Feelgood . Vince Neil is back from his quitting/firing from the band . John Corabi has been erased from the Motley memorybanks . Was there ever another lead singer of Motley Crue ? I think not . You did n't see anything ... . Relax . So ... what do we have here ? Generation Swine ? This soundz like crap . Has The Crue tried to turn the corner into Alternative ? Why is Nikki and Tommy singing on here ? Why is everything so distorted ? Why are they dressed like a bunch of fags ? WTF ? All good questions ... Apparently The Crue thought that since they were back together that all the old Motley fans had grown up and moved on and that the juvenile puree that was the Motley trademark sound was no longer plausable since this was the late 90 's . Wrong ! Motley Crue is Motley Crue , you either love them or hate them . There should be no middle ground . ( except for Generation Swine ) This is one of those efforts that probably should have been twarted by someone with a conscience . Embarrassing . The Crue are tools here and that is not a good thing . All decked out is short hair and neo-punk-bag-person attire . Please ... There are very few nuggets of redemption on this album . Find Myself is listenable . Afraid is fairly cool . I actually like Rat Like Me . That 's it . Everything else is either complete crap or embarrassing . ( hear Brandon by Tommy Lee for an example ) Horrible ! Singing songs about their wives and kids . Is this Motley Crue . Sex , Drug & Rock 'n ' Roll ! Move on . Motley will rediscover their true identity on New Tattoo.Deal with it !	-1
This is probably the album least venerated by even Crue diehards . At least the 1994 album with Corabi was talked about . This one just wandered by without troubling the scoreboard at all , if you take my meaning.But down to specifics ; This album has a number of interesting tunes on it . There are some touches on here that you wo n't find very prevalent in the rest of the Crue catalogue . This in a way was the Crue trying to come across all mature both emotionally and musically . While the bands rhythm section has it 's fans in terms of musicianship the idea of this band as musical magpies just does n't float . And their attempts at musical growth while interesting are only so due to the sheer difference from the bands normal output . But let 's not get ahead of ourselves here , this album is n't some sort of Crue does prog album . It 's just that the party metal of former years has here been tempered in a few places by slower passages sprinkled here and there . But nowhere memorably.In addition the band have really here only penned one great party metal number in their ` classic ' vein in the form of the title track which sees Vince Neils nasal twang in full frontal evidence over the top of a well produced musical attack . But apart from that one flagship number there is precious little here for even devoted Crue fans - of which I was one at one stage . They even have the bravery/temerity to remake Shout At The Devil . A move sure to have their long time devotees turning in their figurative graves.Daring to censure the Crue on any release apart from the Corabi voiced album is a dangerous move prone to score one a lynching . But on this album it simply has to be done . Weak songs , a fractured sense of purpose and no really engaging stories to tell condemn this to being the worst album the Crue have ever released . My advice is to download Generation Swine from our mates at Amazon and save yourself the shipping bill for actually buying this .	-1
the crue are bak and by the looks of the cover tryin ' to make themselves cool again and following the trends of the times like most washed up eighties hair metal bands try [ well most have n't got the poodles to wash anymore ] this album generation swines starts off with `` find myself '' a explictsong that has a decent riff [ john corabi 's voice would suit it better ] afraid is the lassic track that kicks this half shot album into per-portion.. '' flush '' medium to good half way to bad.. '' generation swines '' the title track has a certain charm but just does n't go anywhere '' confessions '' some great lyrics and vocal performancethe highlight for me '' beauty '' the distorted song that you would n't think that motley crue had it in them to pull an album of this quality in their hatthe rest of the five songs suck eggs so no need to descibe how i feel about them '' shout at the devil 97 '' is abit of an odd ball..why need to re-recorded a song..a bit of a alright '' brandon '' the `` sentimental '' love letter for brandon lee and pamela anderson ... that at first listen i thought awww it 's cute he wrote a sweet song then after the second listen i though ewww what a cheeseball of a songwhat a dreadful way to end a decent album with the crue trying to keep with the trends and failing misery atleast their next album `` new tattoo '' was an un-define success and bought the crue rocking to a great tune [ without tommy lee until the re-union tour were the circus is back on the road ]	-1
When I first bought this album in 1997 I would have given it 0 stars . At a time when the market for happy fun rock & roll was sorely lacking , it could not have been more of a letdown to find out that the band that ushered in an era of filthy , raucous , and beautiful heavy metal turned into what may as well have been a NIN cover band - but with less originality ! Now listening to this album , it does not strike me as being as bad as all that . In fact , there are some strong moments in here if you can trudge your way through the muck:1 ) Find myself - Good anthemic grunge-tinged rocker.4 ) Flush - By far the best song on this record - has a memorable riff and some structure.Now ... . the problems : Vince is not Vince . The guy 's voice is buried in the back of all of the pro-tools , synths , and sequencers used to record this album , and only on one or two songs does he let loose with anything resembling attitude . The explanation for this is that - allegedly - most of these songs were written for Corabi , while he was still in the group as a matter of fact , and Vince Neil could not fit his voice into the mold that was already cast.And speaking of synths - people can sound enlightened all they want by making ridiculous statements about how the group was trying to grow with this sound . Bollocks ! The Crue were trying to remain relevant and gain airplay with this sound - it had nothing to do with growth or originality . How could it ? It aspired to sound like everything released at the time . From Ministry to White Zombie to Sonic Youth to Smashing Pumpkins - the most reactionary sounds of the Industrial Grunge of the 90 's - it 's all here in grandiose quantities for anyone who wishes to celebrate their transcendent exploration of new sounds ! Also , production is super-polished - there is so much going on in each song with all the swirling synths , sequencing and the like , it 's hard to close your eyes and envision the group playing any of these songs live at times . Add to that a ridiculous ode to Ministry and Atari Teenage Riot in `` Anybody Out There '' and an embarrassingly sappy ballad `` Brandon '' that is completely out of step with the rest of this dreadful album and you have an album which is to the Crue what `` The Elder '' was to Kiss - a train wreck punctuated with a few accidentally good moments.What is interesting is that by all accounts , Sixx , Mars , and Lee were basically strong-armed by the Electra brain trust to fire Corabi and rehire Vince Neil at the time this album was made , and that really comes through here . Would this have been a better record with Corabi ? I do n't know . But as it stands , there is no resemblance of chemistry , fun , or anything else that made this band worth paying attention to here - just recycled grunge and industrial riffs with an overwhelming amount of effects.There is no growth to be had here . Crap is crap and that 's what the majority of this album is . For diehard fans only .	-1
Let me start out by saying that Metallica HAS EVERY RIGHT to play whatever kind of music they want to . That being said , let me also say that I have every right not to like it . Everyone is entitled to their own tastes and opinions , and I simply do not like this album . It 's not about them changing their style , it 's about the end product , and I do n't care much for this music.On another note , music can bring back memories for me : I can hear a certain song and instantly recall a time and place in my past -- maybe you 're the same way . A lot of music brings back good memories for me , but this brings back some bad ones : the hot summer of 1996 , living in a crummy apartment with my girlfriend ( now wife ) , and the engine in my beautiful 1984 Firebird on its last legs.Just one more thing : does anyone else find it ironic that a band that supposedly hates being labeled chose to name themselves METALlica ? If you 're looking for some good Metallica , I recommend `` Master Of Puppets '' or `` Ride The Lightning '' .	-1
Listening to Load is an odd experience . It 's comparable to meeting a friend from high school again after four years of college , and finding out he 's converted to some obscure , pantheistic , tribal religion . He 's enthusiastic about it , and really wants to get you pumped up about it , too , but all you can think about while listening is the old friend who talked about nothing but football and whose diet consisted solely of jalapeno-flavored Cheetos . In less than five years , the person you remembered is now someone completely different.Load is ostensibly a Metallica record , but much like your friend , they 've abandoned their Cheetos for religion . Okay , perhaps the analogy is starting to break down now . I should say , they abandoned any trace of intelligence and creativity for simplistic drivel . It may be a natural progression from The Black Album , in that it further lightens Metallica 's sound and ventures more into different styles , but it lacks that album 's redeeming qualities . Where The Black Album incorporated new ideas alongside their old ones to create something new while still maintaining their identity , Load simply cribs other genres wholesale and creates largely unsatisfying derivatives of them.Keep in mind , this was 1996 , and grunge was in full-force . Load was clearly an attempt to grab a piece of the pie , what with its blues elements , Hetfield 's southern rock style vocals , and slow , meandering songs that frequently go nowhere . Now , I 'm not trying to imply grunge is bad ; Alice in Chains is one of the better bands I 've ever heard , and I listen to Soundgarden frequently as well . I like grunge . Load is not good grunge . Load is not good rock , either . Heck , Load is not good country during its brief flirtation with it.I ca n't say there is n't anything worthwhile here . `` Bleeding Me '' is actually a pretty fantastic song , `` King Nothing '' and `` Ai n't My Bitch '' are serviceable rockers , and `` Until It Sleeps '' is a decent lighter song to break up the monotony . That 's four good songs , plus `` Hero of the Day '' and `` 2x4 '' , which are listenable despite having some flaws . Six worthwhile songs sounds good , but that 's out of fourteen . Yes , Load has fourteen tracks , and runs for a colossal 78 minutes and 59 seconds . Metallica thought that was impressive enough to feature predominantly on the album cover , but I think it 's generally a bad business move to let your audience know how long they 'll be sentenced to musical purgatory if they buy it . I 'm a believer in quality over quantity when it comes to music , and it would have been much better if Load was half the length it ended up being.In the end , half of Load simply ends up being boring . `` The House Jack Built '' , `` Cure '' , `` Poor Twisted Me '' , `` Thorn Within '' , and `` Ronnie '' are simplistic , repetitive , and leave no lasting impression on the listener . `` Mama Said '' has essentially the same problem , with the added offense of country , while `` The Outlaw Torn '' is decent , but about six minutes too long . Load is essentially musical junk food , and while there 's nothing wrong with that if it 's what you want , it 's insulting coming from Metallica , a band talented enough to write far better songs . It 's the musical equivalent of Stanley Kubrick directing Transformers . Transformers is n't bad in and of itself , but it 's far below the level of the man who directed 2001 : A Space Odyssey.The good news is , this is the worse that Metallica ever got ( yes , I consider St. Anger to be better than Load , by a significant margin ) . Although the follow-up , ReLoad , was similar , and perhaps even more mainstream , it showed a bit more refinement , and is generally more enjoyable . And while I ca n't recommend purchasing Load , it does have a few good songs , so if you 're a Metallica completionist , you 'll at least be getting a little out of the deal .	-1
No , Metallica did not sell out . They merely changed their style at a time when everyone else was doing the same thing , nothing to get in a stink over . But , it sucks . They tried to change their style like everyone else and they failed miserably . This is a ridiculously overrated album and I 'm just glad that most of my friends who once liked it are finally coming around .	-1
ho-hum . just O.K . nothing new or special . that 's why i have a problem with it . it bores me . it 's fine for playing at work as background music that coworkers might like , but that 's about it .	-1
There are only 4 songs I can honestly make it through on this album . Metallica largely sold albums on their name after the Black album . Every other band would have been put out of business had they released this swill . It just goes to show how crappy the 90s metal scene was that people actually like this crap .	-1
I must say that the downturn for Metallica began with the Black Album . The intensity and high voltage sound was pretty much dying on that album . But now , this is n't even the same group . I could care less if they decided to take their music in a `` new '' direction . But they should change their name . They are no longer a metal band . They are a pop band . Plain and simple . This belongs next to the Barry Manilow cds.We metal fans will just have to stick with Cannibal Corpse and Slayer . Which is fine with me , they both rock .	-1
There are very few people or bands that can keep their integrity after they have `` Made It '' . Usually the `` money , fame , and fortune '' goes to their heads resulting in the death of whatever spark manifested istelf in them to allow them to create or do the great things they did to get them to that position of greatness.Unfortunatly , Metallica is a textbook example of a great force against evil that at one time condemned the slack , lifeless , greedy warmongers of the world that just wanted to suck your blood dry for a penny . They sold out the true principles of Rock N ' Roll and turned their backs on the very people who believed in their music and message and joined the very people they were previously denouncing.They joined the POP world which includes such insipid , ludicrous , vamps as Madonna and Lady Gaga . In short , they became greedy businessmen with only one concern and that was to make money . This cd is the absolute turning point were one can hear their degradation into the mediocrity of the pop world .	-1
The worst Metallica album to date . Even the album 's sequel Reload is better than this ! If you like The Cranberries , or Radiohead , then this album is for you , but if you like Megadeth or Anthrax , skip this one .	-1
DO N'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY . BUY THEIR PRE SELLOUT ALBUMS , KILL EM ALL , RIDE THE LIGHTNING , MASTER OF PUPPETS , AND AND JUSTICE FOR ALL .	-1
Sometimes , the times change , and change for the worst , Load , Was a Load of * ! * % sadly . a good song here or there . and yes acoustic was good , but really growing up On Master Of Puppets , And Justice..And Black Album Tapes ... Then this comes .. Made me sad , To top it off , the haircuts which were probably needed added more , and then much later the napster ordeal . made me Mad at Metallica . I now occasionally listen to them , the old stuff , maybe st.anger . Which Was better than this . But Buy their stuff again not sure . Aww those good Old Days 93-97 in Middle School listening TO Metallica , Danzig , Misfits , And Samhain . ( I have Metallica to thank for Intro to the others ) .	-1
'Load ' is a bad album of bad songs.This would get 1 star , but it 's saving grace is 'The Outlaw Torn ' and 'Bleeding Me ' , thus it gets 2 stars for these songs , which are addmitedly brilliant . It 's lyrically , musically , and idea-wise ( it 's a bunch of rock ballads for christs sake ! ) a bad album . It is uninspired , plodding drivel and should be forgotten about . I respect Metallica for having the gall to change direction so sharply , but they seem to have forgotten what made them special in the first place , i.e being a metal band.It 's depressing that a band can progress from starting thrash metal to being a dull mainstream rock band , in about a decade . If you want a '90s ( studio ) album by Metallica then get 'Metallica ' or 'ReLoad'.Anything but this .	-1
james voice is horrible . It 's been high pitched and squeeky since the black album tour , dont believe me just check out the live s*** box set and listen . He tries to hard to & quot ; sing & quot ; and in turn ends up signing off key and what not . The cd has 2 maybe 3 songs on it that are worth listening to . Bleeding Me is one of the best songs they 've wrote , hands down . I love it . But some of the other material they put on this cd is pure utter crap	-1
THIS IS PURE S # # T . THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON THIS CD IS `` UNTIL IT SLEEPS '' THE ONLY GOOD SONG . THE REST IS PURE CRAP . SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR BETTER METALLICA . PASS LOAD AND RELOAD . ITS NOT WORTH ONE F**KING CENT .	-1
... It was about the old Metallica meeting the new greedy b**ta**s. The younger James said to the older one `` how could you let me turn into you ? '' and continued to toss a match onto his gel-ridden hair and watch him explode . The mullet Lars Ulrich beat up the greedy one , and then pissed on him . Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted teamed up with Kirk Hammetts younger self and threw the older Hammett off of a cliff . Megadeth Mustaine and Metallica Mustaine just stood there and laughed , while Slayer and Anthrax cried at the fact that a once musically beautiful and talented band had turned into a bunch of money-hungry f**ks ! ( this dream was TOO true ) Well , I guess that 'Aint My B**ch ' and 'King Nothing ' are decent songs , but the rest is crap and proves how lazy Metallica became .	-1
Everyone knows the Metallica story to this point . Through the 80 's they were one of the pioneers of thrash metal . Ride The Lightning , Master Of Puppets , and And Justice For Al are all thrash metal , and heavy metal in general classics . They simplified things with their self titled album , which produced several top hits , and really propelled them into something else . They were no longer just a metal band . They were international superstars , releasing one of the highest selling albums of all time.There was a delay in recording and releasing this album . Once it finally came out , we got an album that is more simplistic , more polished , more experimental , and worse lyrics . I 'm honestly not sure what they were going for on here . This is a mix of hard rock , blues rock , and alternative rock . Adding to the simplicity of the album it feels like a sell out album , which with the music industry devil Bob Rock , you could expect this . Still I was expecting to take a huge dump all over this album , but it 's really not that terrible . There are a number of decent songs on here , as well as some truly terrible songs . I have no idea how Fuel , Unforgiven II , and Where the wild things are , from the follow up b side collection Reload did n't make this album.James tries some diferent vocal styles on here and they do n't really work well . The guitar work is much more simple , and Lars sounds comatose on the drums.Ai n't My Bitch 6/10 is a fast paced heavier song to start the album . It 's really simple . The lyrics are awful or I 'd give this a fairly solid rating . The melodies are decent , and the music is passible . Still a far cry from the opening cuts of the 80 's albums.2X 4 6/10 is a kind of bluesy rocker with a lot of grooves . Again the lyrics are n't worth the paper they were written on . The song itself is ok . It 's definitely the first of many experiments on here.The House Jack Built 6/10 is a little longer than it should be . Overall I enjoy this one . There are some solid melodies . Overall this song moves from softer and slow to mid tempo and heavier . Still it drags on a little too long.Until It Sleeps 6/10 is a definition of sell out if I 've ever heard one . This sounds like an alternative rock song from the 90 's . that 's because it is . This is a mid tempo softer song , with a heavier chorus . Overall it 's not too terrible . James uses some different vocal styles , and the guitars in the verses really threw me off on the first listen . this song really showcases the simplicity of their music at this stage , as they have a soft instrumental break , with I guess what you could call a solo , however the song seems to build towards a heavier awesome solo , but instead they just break back into the chorus . Very disappointing.King Nothing 7/10 is another groovy mid tempo rocker . The melodies are pretty decent , much better in the chorus . Overall this is a pretty nice song , and a good choice for a single.Hero Of The Day 7/10 starts with a soft guitar riff , which made me wonder if I was listening to Pearl Jam . Overall though I enjoy this song . James sings in his softer voice again , but there 's also a heavier part in there.Bleeding Me 7/10 2 soft songs in a row ? This song did n't do much for me to start with . I like the instrumental break and the heavier parts , but the slower parts did n't do much for me at first , neither did the chorus . That stuff all grew on me , however the song drags on way too long . This song should 've been 5 or 6 minutes and that 's it , and it clocks in at around 8 minutes . Way too long . Part of that problem is the softer parts , verses , seem to take forever to get to the point.Cure 5/10 is a mid tempo groove oriented rocker . This one 's ok , but it 's not really special.Poor Twisted Me 3/10 is a slow paced rocker . I do n't like the vocals at all . I cringe when James does his `` Twisted meeeeeeeee '' . Uh just awful . Overall this song really goes nowhere , and should 've been left off for 1 of those songs from Reload I mentioned . Fuel would 've fit much better there.Wasting My Hate 8/10 is a simple fast paced rocker . There 's not even a solo in this one , but overall the melodies are pretty solid , and this song gets to the point a lot better than a lot of songs from these 2 albums . It 's very welcome after the snooze fest of the previous few tracks.Mamma Said -infinity/10 is the worst song Metallica ever did . They go country on here , and James Hetfield should NEVER sing country again , on an album anyways . I grew up in a small red neck town . I HATE country , and even if I did n't , Metallica should not be doing country.Thorn Within 7/10 starts with a decent heavy riff with a slightly up tempo riff , but then the song goes into a softer slower verse . The chorus picks up . Overall this is a decent song . it has a nice hook.Ronnie 1/10 is a really slow song . The pacing is awful . I just really do n't like this one . The lyrics are atrocious and make the lyrics to Ai n't My Bitch seem like poetry . The song goes nowhere . I hate the pacing , and the melodies are truly awful.The Outlaw Torn 1/10 is another song that should 've been left off the album . It 's way too long . It 's really slow , and just plods along with no real sense of urgency.Overall this era did not deserve 2 albums . But then they 'd probably , well with the track listing on here , they did , pick some of the wrong tracks for the album . They should 've put the 3 songs from Reload on here and took off some of the more atrocious songs on here , and the album would be fairly decent . Overall I was surprised by the number of songs I actually liked on here , but they are n't generally good enough to make up for the really bad ones . If you love everything Metallica then feel free to get this , but if you only want the thrash stuff , then stay away . This was certainly a misstep , but not as much as a b side collection of songs from these sessions posing as a new album , a gargled mess called St. Anger , suing everyone in sight , doing a bad symphony album , that crappy Mission Impossible song , and horrible production on Death Magnetic . This was the second in a series of huge missteps that turned Metallica from a force to be reckoned with in the metal world into a joke . It 's amazing how the mighty have fallen .	-1
Whoever says this album is awesome , best Metallica , brought more listeners in , etc . is just lame . They can be characterized as something that rhymes with a baggot . Anyway , this album gets 2 stars only because King Nothing and Until it Sleeps are OK songs , and only because 1 star is the equivalent to 0 ( so 2 is equivalent to 1 ) . Other than those 2 songs , this album sucks hard .	-1
Um , this album WAS a sell-out . That 's like trying to argue Saddam Hussein is not guilty . It 's sell-out , face it . Is it thrash ? No . It 's sell-out . It 's alternative with a bit of a metal edge made by a bunch of Gucci-wearing , ( ... ) . Let 's call it for what it is.Why the 2 stars ? I figured they deserved something for being better than the other mainstream bands , such as Taproot , Puddle of Mudd , P.O.D. , Creed , Nickelback , Linkin Park , etc . etc . etc . These guys may be sell-outs but they still play better stuff than all those other bands and they can still play live shows well. ( ... ) But please , people , this is sell-out since it is n't thrash and Metallica made it to get more radio play . Shame on them . This band died with Cliff .	-1
THis is the beginning of the end for METALLICA . The end of creativity , not of richness , that just began to grow ! ! ! Horrible album .	-1
This is pathetic . I ca n't believe people who think that Metallica are still worth listening to . Point in case : their newest single on the radio , St. Anger . ( Sigh ) Where did it all go wrong ? Let me point out just what it was ... To go back to the very root of Metallica 's musical deterioration , we should really be looking at the Black album . I guess in most Metallica fan circles , however , the Black album was the last great album . I disagree . I have always thought that And Justice For All was their last great album . Justice was a metal masterwork , with epic songs and brilliant lyrics . It was a fitting tribute to their dead bassist and friend , Cliff . It was their goodbye to Cliff as well as their goodbye to great music.The Black album was more mainstream , the songs were compromised , the riffs sloppy , the lyrics silly , but it was still recognizable as MetallicaFast foward four years . Load is released to perplexed fans . `` Cut hair , pimp suits , goth makeup in their music videos ? What ? This is not Metallica ! '' And in a way , it was n't . The Metallica the thrash metal fans knew died with the four year hiatus . They had finished grieving Cliff , and the spirit was gone . Cliff would never have allowed this Glam Rock/alt rock/blues/goth rock hybrid . It would have shamed him.Metallica has become everything that they once claimed to have hated , and it really makes me sad . The music they made in years past was so EXCELLENT . Each one of their first four albums was a metal masterpiece , brilliant and well thought out . Now their music is a parody of what it once was . Until it Sleeps , the House That Jack Built ... blech . Give me Harvester , Blackened , Master , Four Horsemen , anything but this drivel .	-1
Load thier sixth albumComing off thier most successful album Self titled Metallica , they released Load . To put it plainly , its just not good . To anyone that will try to tell me im not a 'real ' fan because I do n't like Load has no idea how many hours i 've spent listening to this great band . Im not using the whole 'selling out ' thing as an excuse not to like this album either . I have listened to Load many times trying to give it a chance ; I wanted to like this , but it just was n't there . Aint ( ... ) is the only reason that I even still have Load , and even then I only end up putting it in every once in a long while .	-1
Say you where an alien from another planetary system and you landed on Earth in 1996 ( or perhaps consider yourself a lonely wildman returning to civilization after being stranded in British Columbia since the 1980 's , but I think the alien situation is cooler . ) having never before listened to Metallica . You come into contact with me for reason , call it fate , and I present you with two CDs - both Metallica . One CD is `` Master of Puppets '' and the other is , well , this example of what happens when good bands loose their mind . Even if you had never seen or heard of Metallica before you could tell that they changed their style just by comparing the two above-mentioned CD samples . The band cut their hair ; the album cover is very different to say the least ( it features cow semen mixed with blood ) , even the Metallica logo is different . So obviously the band has evolved ( or de-evolved ) their sonic stylings . Now I applaud bands for attempting to change , I mean who wants to listen to the same material belted out over and over again ? I consider `` ... And Justice for All '' to be an evolution of `` Master of Puppets '' , just like as I consider the Black Album to a natural progression from AJFA , and this is true of Metallica 's earlier albums too . But at this album Metallica decided to try and do something different ... they sold out . The album is such a blatantly obvious attempt to gain more mainstream fans . And mind you , I have nothing wrong with a band gaining popularity , more power to them for living out their dreams , but a band sells out when they drastically alter their music and appearance in an move I can only fathom as a desperate move to gain more fame ( and therefore more money ) . And Metallic did just that . And not to do a complete reverse , but this is not half bad for what it is . The music is actually pretty solid ; it just does not hold my interest and pails in comparison to their previous albums . So I will say to exercise extreme caution when purchasing this Load ( am I clever or what ? ) , if you are a fan of old Metallica , you probably will not like this , but if you are new to the game this might be a good place to start , but not the best . I recommend any of their previous five albums to this .	-1
This is one of the worst albums ever made , Metallica put the final nails in their coffins on this one .	-1
This one should have been called Hab . The follow up of course would be REHAB . Thanks for all the recent table coasters Jaymz ! So lets see , Jaymz goes to rehab , Lars becomes a movie star , if there is any Justice at all , Kirk will go back to Exodus and Jason will go back to Flotsam and Jetsam and forget they ever met these money grubbing clowns .	-1
It 's not a sellout , because other than the commerical-minded `` Until It Sleeps '' ( which is as good as radio-ready hard rock gets ) , I do n't hear a lot of singles on here . Indeed , it HAD a lot of singles - `` Hero Of The Day '' , `` Bleeding Me '' , `` Ai n't My Bitch '' , `` King Nothing '' , and `` Mama Said '' also all received heavy airplay - but I do n't hear Metallica trying to be Bon Jovi or Def Leppard or even Nirvana on this album . I just hear them trying to be a slightly more streamlined Metallica . Slower , yes , more groove-oriented and less speed-oriented , yes , slicker production , yes ... but also amazingly free of any good hooks.What I DO hear is the most boring album they ever did . Virtually none of the singles get played today , because they just plain evaporated from memory once they ran their course . There 's nothing on here that sticks in the brain like an `` Enter Sandman '' , `` Master Of Puppets '' , `` One '' or `` For Whom The Bell Tolls '' . Their forays into southern rock and country twang ring hollow , and the whole album just seems way too labored over . It is n't the least bit LOOSE , which of course has never been Metallica 's forte ( they 're about precision , not looseness ) , but here it just makes the whole thing a downer . By contrast , the more rushed follow-up , `` Re-Load '' , is much better with more memorable songs . Even so , those two records represent a noticable lull in their otherwise stellar track record.If you 're a Metallica beginner , start with `` The Black Album '' and work your way backwards to `` Kill 'Em All '' ... then jump all the way to the end with `` Death Magnetic '' and start working your way backwards again . That way you 'll finish your collection with this one and know you have them all . If you START with this one ... you might not be compelled to delve deeper . It 's just plain a bore .	-1
This was probably the weakest Sanborn work . I was not very impressed with the CD . I did like the tune & quot ; Rikkie & quot ; , otherwise that 's about it on this disappointing effort . You 're better off buying some of his earlier or even later CD 's . This is not the one you want . Move on ! !	-1
Worst Bad Company CD ever . It was actually painful to here what they did to the classic Bad Company songs on this.Even more dissappointing because the previous album Company of Strangers was their best non-Paul Rodgers album.Save your money . Buy the original Bad Company or Free albums .	-1
This is a horrible compilation of of an amazing band . It is missing so many of their hits ( peace frog , alambama song , backdoor man , the wasp , spanish caravan ) the list goes on . If you want a cheap single disc collection of the doors ' best stuff then get the very best of the doors ( which isnt that great either . ) Otherwise go with legacy , that is by far the best doors compilation out there . Even if you dont even know the doors that well and u only know a few of their songs , this is still not the right choice . The worst part about this album is the version of `` The End '' that is inlcuded . The only reason i didnt give it 1 star is because any cd that is all doors songs will be great . But this is an inexcusable collection .	-1
I know there are alot of doors fans out there and you are entilteld to that . Riders on the storm is good and touch me is good . As far as music vocal harmony and music the Beatles are the best . GodBless	-1
they have better stuff what about horse lattitudes	-1
You 'll wish you were two ears deaf if you ever find yourself listening to this drivel .	-1
Matchbox Twenty , Sister Hazel , Third Eye Blind , Semisonic , etc . etc . ad nauseam.What 's the difference between these bands ? Nothing ! Same corporate pop marketed by shysters as `` alternative '' pushed down the throats of the masses year after year after year .	-1
I 'm sure this is a great album , that is , if you 're the kind of person who thinks modern rock radio is great and Jim Breuer is funny , in other words , HAS NO TASTE . It just gets me really pissed off that radio can generally ignore incredible bands like Radiohead and Blur , and overplay junk like this and Matchbox 20 . Go do yourself a favor and buy & quot ; OK Computer & quot ; if you want to hear good music . If you want commercial & quot ; alternative & quot ; pop music from people who ca n't play their instruments or write a mildly intelligent lyric , 3rd Eye Blind is for you . Go ahead and mail me if you want .	-1
A soundtrack for the summer ... yes . If you are ten years old . There is a very juvenile feel to this album , which is really quite fine if you are 12 or under . If not , this is the sort of album you would never play when driving around with your friends . In fact , its the sort of album you would stash under your bed when they come over just so they do n't know you own it . The songs are poppy , and often quite catchy , but other than that there is n't a single reason to own this album . The extremely high levels of enthusiasm and earnestness in the music and lyrics gets really annoying , really fast . Much closer to pop than rock , nothing experimental . The melodies are very simplistic and childish , singsongy almost . Also , I find something extremely disturbing with how the singer seems to be almost happy when singing & quot ; Jumper & quot ; , a song apparently written about a friend who was contemplating suicide . Personally , I would never write a pop song like that about any of my friends unless maybe I wanted to embaress them . But then again , Jenkins does n't appear to have much integrity so I would n't be surprised if that song really was n't about anyone real at all and just something he dreamed up because he though it would make a good hit song . A lot of the lyrics also seem annoyingly self-righteous , and they give you the feeling that Jenkins is the kind of person who just looks in the mirror every morning and thanks god for being such a good-looking guy.PS : If & quot ; Graduate & quot ; is n't a purely commercial song with a sole lyrical intention of empathizing with schoolchildren , I do n't know what is .	-1
This album is a mess . It gets two stars because I enjoy Trail of Tears , Peruvian Skies , and Hollow Years , but otherwise the album is a mess . A shout-out must be made to the abomination that is You Not Me . Its terrible.I bought this album knowing full well that it would be a rough experience , and after multiple listens , trying to find something good , I can only bear to listen to the three songs I listed . I know the group was under pressure from their label , but even then that does not salvage the fact that the album is not at all representative of what Dream Theater is . Their worst album by far .	-1
ZZZ ... You Not Me ... ZZZ ... Lines In The Sand ... ZZZ ... Peruvian Skies ... ZZZ ... Hollow Years ... ZZZ , and i 'm still tried . This is a very weak effort by a band that has potential to be really HEAVY . I mean , it sounds like the band is playing it safe , making every song sound like it 's formatted to be a radio jingle . That 's good for a song or two , but not an entire album . You just have to leter rip . All those songs mentioned above are good and accessable but not acceptable by a band that can crank out metal and prog like no one else can . Sorry boys , this one 's a yawn .	-1
I still do n't understand what the band was thinking when they released this piece of trash . I 'm pretty sure they were trying to cater to a more mainstream audience . Why else would they write modern rock garbage like 'You Not Me , ' 'Just Let Me Breathe , ' and 'Burning My Soul ' ? I saw a few shows on the FII tour , and whenever these songs were played , I used the opportunity to use the men 's room . These are n't Dream Theater songs ... they 're grunge rock acid trips perpetrated by Elektra and producer Kevin Shirley . I respect the ability of a band 's sound to evolve and progress , but if they do it in a poor manner , I 'm going to say something.There are still a few songs I enjoy on this album , but when you put it up against records like IMAGES & WORDS or A CHANGE OF SEASONS , there 's simply no comparison . Perhaps it was the addition of Derek Sherinian or the presence of Kevin Shirley , but we can not make excuses.My favorite track is the epic , 'Trial of Tears , ' with it 's dark atmosphere which reminds me of something they would have recorded on their AWAKE album . Most notable is the guitar playing of Petrucci which really takes on a kind of 'Allan Holdsworth-esque ' style . The ballads are also worth a 'thumbs-up ' - 'Anna Lee ' is a beautiful piece both lyrically and musically . Sherinian 's playing sounds good if Dream Theater were a pop band , but his limits are evident with his Elton John style playing . 'Hollow Years ' is an amazing acoustic guitar piece with some spanish influence . The remaining songs such as 'New Millennium , ' 'Take Away My Pain , ' and 'Lines in the Sand ' are decent songs , but they totally lack the instrumental 'edge ' that has never been absent in previous Dream Theater recordings . This is the element that makes this band stand out , and I 'm pretty sure it was not the band 's idea to change in this manner , considering the nature of the followup , SCENES FROM A MEMORY.If you want to build up a Dream Theater collection , this should be the last album you purchase . Do n't listen to the other reviewers here - They are suffering from the 'Emperor 's New Clothes ' syndrome .	-1
THis band is amazing , only virtuosos there , but their kind of & quot ; rock & quot ; is incredibly boring in this album .	-1
this album is a disgrace , i want my money back . it 's more like falling into the garbage , this album sucks bad . they should pay us to take it .	-1
I love DT- but this album- is simply boring- Sherinian barly lifts a finger on this album- hardly displays his talents . HEavy song , soft song , heavy song , fast- uhhhhhhhh this album has nowhere NEAR the same replay value as their others .	-1
Now I have heard a lot of people say that this is a classic , and that it may be the most creative CD of all time , but when I take a listen , I just laugh . There are so many better rappers who have a million times the talent that Missy Elliot has and are so much more creative . Honestly , and the lyrics are awful , only a couple of the beats are okay , but after listening to Missy Elliot 's annoying voice , then you will be very frustrated like I was that I bought this .	-1
As a passionate follower of Stereolab I remember with distinct agony the arrival of this album . Stereolab was a blessed union between electronica and the resurgence of lounge -- they were the musical messiah many of us had been waiting for throughout an otherwise dismal 90 's . Oh yes , there was grunge , but before Nirvana ? Before uh , those other guys in flannel ? That 's right , it was bleak indeed . Would-be hipsters raised on the mountain of slop that was NKOTB and Hootie and the Blow-chunks gave name to the new music they were hearing -- they dressed it in Gap clothing and christened it ALTERNATIVE , and THAT was the birth of the truly alternative music lovers hell.Soon the ever-expanding Black Cloud of Musical Death reached my dear Stereolab . Someone , somewhere must have told Stereolab that Chicago was the new Seattle , so they picked up a resident faux-hipster wierdo noise-musician and let him play king for a day . The end result is an album that is so over-produced it 's tedious . To the seasoned Stereolab listener Dots and Loops sounds as if the task at hand was to take music that was - in it 's unadultered state - quite cool , rehash it and make it uncool , and then pulverize it yet again so that it 's so uncool it must be very cool . And voila , the final product is a steaming pile of chunky barf .	-1
Pantera is simply Panterible.I'v seen these guys live too , they were one of the worst live acts i'v ever seen and i totally felt ripped-off after leaving the venue . I wasted hard earned bucks on these posers and i felt like i had to review this live album and warn others of how PaNtErIbLe this group is.Dimebag , man , i'v seen better guitar players at my highschool in Antarctica ( i 'm serious , we have schools down here ) . All he does is ripp off tricks and fret board executions that were established by much better guitarist like Eddie Van Halen and Micheal Schencker ( bet Pantera fans have n't even heard of him ) , he is not original at all . This guy was one of the most overrated guitarists ever and i 'm glad he is dead because it means no more PaNtErIbLe music from a PaNtErIbLe band anymore.If you want a document of possibley one of the worst bands in recorded music , this CD might be right up your alley . If you want to listen to a horrible joke of a metal band , this might also be worth purchasing . I myself keep it aroound for pure comedic value , but if you are looking for some good , serious music , stay far , far , far away from this and any thing else this band has ever released .	-1
The Doors Box Set only proves yet again that the Doors and Elektra Records are not very good to their fans when it comes to releasing material . THIS is the box set fans eagerly awaited for years ? Three discs , not even full length , and a fourth , completely useless collection of more hits . The great parts are : all of the demos , the Black Train Song on Disc 1 , finally a release on CD of Who Scared You ? ( WHERE is You Need Meat ( Do n't Go No Further ) ? ? ) , Queen of the Highway , Hyacinth House , and a couple of other rare bits . The Live in New York disc is a sham . This is not live in New York , this is merely the Doors once again splicing together parts of different tracks from DIFFERENT concerts and claiming the tracks are from ONE show . Gloria is the uncensored version from In Concert , and Celebration of the Lizard is chopped up and shorter . Naturally , as well , the Doors over-produced old material to make it sound like it was recorded yesterday ( and so they sound better than they were . ) Robbie Kreiger even overdubbed his own guitars 27 years later on some tracks ( ! ) The Soft Parade ? Um , we HAVE this version on the Video of the Soft Parade . What about something we DO N'T have or DO N'T know ? What about the OTHER , BETTER , version recorded of Someday Soon ? What about ALL of those shows recorded for Absolutely Live and Feast of Friends ? Dozens of complete , soundboard shows sitting collecting dust in the Doors archives . I was kind of pleased when I got this the first day , and then the excitement wore off when I realized that the box was n't really so great . It looks nice , has a nice booklet , but it reeks of big money ( it was not cheap ) and it certainly skimped on the rare and wanted material . The fans want something of quality , like four full discs of rare live and studio stuff NOT over-produced and NOT chopped up . ( They chop off the first few notes of Someday Soon and have over-dubbed crowd noise , butchering the beginning of that great track . ) I must admit the job on Orange County Suite is very nice , though . But I believe that the Doors attempt to exercise too much nervous control over the stuff they release to the public . Like we ca n't hear them out of tune live or messing up or not mixed so perfectly . Give us the stuff ! It 's no wonder people continue to gobble up Doors bootlegs , where you can even find a longer version of Rock is Dead and Jim Morrison 's poetry readings . NOT recommended for anyone except a serious Doors fan .	-1
The calibre of songs The Doors rejected , would 've made cult heroes out of them anyhow.And a single disc of choicest Morrison ramblings throughout his stage career , would be very humourous , and at times profound or contravercial.The problem is that every good song or Morrison ramble , is spotted between alot of pointless drivel spread out over endless amounts of cd's.And this 4cd set continues that ploy.Given the material , the prize songs should be on one disc , and ramblings on another.That way you can cater for your `` hearing interesting renditions '' mood , and your `` curiosity at Morrisons personality '' mood.But it 's set out as a mess.Also , 4th disc=unnecessary ( buyers of this set will already have these songs ) .And , the concert disk has only a few songs that are different enough from previously released material to even warrant unearthing.This set is like digging for gold.Most of what you find is dirt.The compilers should have done the sieving for us.Thankfully though , there are priceless gems at the end of this dig . ( They 're worth 5 stars.But the set is not )	-1
ude think with sweat/levert producin most of the album and gill adding his voice ude get a great album but not a single memorable song ..really sad when u think keiths last album had twisted nobody ... and why with all this talent ude get puff to produce is beyond me	-1
To call this band & quot ; Metalica & quot ; still is a travesty . There is absolutely no way that the music displayed on both this album and its predecessor represent the band that most of their longtime fans loved . Anyone who calls 'Reload ' or 'Load ' a & quot ; musical maturity & quot ; is full of it . The music here is n't even good rock music , let alone up to the high standards of the band 's past . There is nothing whatsoever on this album that could be called listenable . James Hetfield 's vocals show that his & quot ; growth as a vocalist & quot ; means he now must squeal instead of screaming in key . His ridiculous & quot ; yeahs & quot ; and & quot ; he-he 's & quot ; throuhgout the songs are hilarious , at best . 'Reload ' is absolutely pathetic . The only reason that this album even sold well , is due to people either not knowing how the REAL Metallica is supposed to sound , or die-hard fans of this once great band , who will embrace anything they come out with . The people who say that they did not sell out their style with this or 'Load ' are lying to themselves . This is not Metallica . Those fans would listen to the group if the lyrical content consisted of James Hetfield singing his laundry list . What happened to the thunderous drums from Lars Ulrich ? He now sounds like a 12-year old who learned how to play drums by banging his pencils on his desk in homeroom . Remember when Kirk Hammett 's guitar solos used to sing ? If he uses that wah-pedal anymore , I 'd swear I was listening to a third-rate Stevie Ray Vaughan cover band . This album is utterly sickening . For a fair representation of what the name Metallica USED to mean , check out their 80 's releases . It seems like these four guys have absolutely no reason to rock our world anymore . Just keep on copying yourselves , guys - We ca n't wait for Unforgiven III [ yeah right . ]	-1
Since the famous `` Black Album '' Metallica has just going down the streets , they 've forgoten how to make fast and agressive music as the same goes to how to make brilhiant guitar solos ... nowadays Metallica turned to an almost POP band ... MTV seems to be signed with Metallica some king of a statement saying they ( Metallica ) since now will just sell terrible MTV oriented music and forget how to do metal ... . It 's a shame ... , F**k Metallica .	-1
Wow , this has got to be bad if this is a collection of music that did n't make the album Load.Good Songs : Memory Remains and SlitherOK Songs : Unforgiven II and Bad SeedBad Songs : Fuel ! ! ! and everything else . Fuel sucks really bad . I ca n't see how it is a fan favorite because it gets really annoying.This CD actually may be better than Load ! Wow !	-1
Just when you think Metallica could n't find a new way to cover up how much they suck , they do . Let 's see ; put out a double disc of covers and something that was already released , then we could have a symphony behind us , then we could jump on the Alternative band wagon . What can we do now ? Lets release the crap that was n't good enough to put on our last album ! Yeah ! Our fans will put out money on anything that falls out of our back end ! This is why I stopped being a fan a long time ago and have since sold everything I owned that was Metallica . It 's sad when all a band wants to do is make money and not care about the product they put before the fans . I was n't fooled by this . After the black album , they should 've quit because what made this a great band left a long time ago .	-1
By now everyone actually knows what Metallica used to be , and what they turned out into in the 90s . Screw that ... What I would really like to see , is a personal music CD collection of a person who rates this abortion of an album 5 stars . I 'd really like to talk to him or her , to know what they have been listening to in their lives , how their musical taste evolved , what they like and dislike , and what other CDs by Metallica grace their CD-shelves.That 's about all the interest that this album arouses in me.So the obvious verdict is this : excellent Metallica started with & quot ; Kill'em All & quot ; and ended by the black album . Buy all 5 of them.PS & quot ; Unforgiven 2 & quot ; is quite good , though . Download it through a PTP service , so courthouse-lawsuit-happy Mr. Ulrich has another $ 15 lost ! I hope he wo n't sleep . : )	-1
Soldoutica - Wussica - MTVfriendlyica - Getarealbassplayerica - Larsisanidiotica - Watereddownica -- -- Please just quit now ! I 'm so tired of spinning in my grave !	-1
Let 's be honests with ourselves : almost no band can keep releasing good records forever . If that was the case , hou could people divide between average records and masterpieces ? METALLICA is not exception to this rule . At one point or another along the road , a band 's creativity in songwriting begins to decline . THis does n't is necessarily represented by accute drops in sales . Sometimes a band 's common release , worst than previous , sells more than any other release by that artist ( example : Bruce Springsteen 's BORN IN THE USA ) . Of course the band will deny that , after all they 're professionals whod epend upon the quality ( or marketing ) of their music for surviving . Let 's see some examples : 1 ) AC/DC - after Back in Black nothing was the same - according to some , even after Bon Scott died ; 2 ) IRON MAIDEN - after SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON nothing was the same ; 3 ) BLACK SABBATH - after Ozzy left or according to some after HEAVEN AND HELL with Dio , nothing was the same ; 4 ) VAN HALEN - after 5150 , or according to some after David Lee Roth left . With Metallica , this happened after AND JUSTICE FOR ALL , or , according to some , after MASTER OF PUPPETS . It 's clear for all to see , there 's no chance to deny the fact that METALLICA went downwards musically after that , . I 'm not saying this is due to becoming soft or whatever . The songs simply just did n't have the same quality anymore .	-1
they should be ashamed for ever putting the name metallica on this piece of crap . i bet cliff burton is rolling over in his grave right now because of this cd .	-1
I think they are unhappy with the fact they have had writer 's block since the black album , and no longer have anything of any signifigance to offer their fans of old . Yes , they have tons of new fans , but can not really identify with them . The old fans were just like them and used Metallica 's music to escape the realities of everyday life . And Justice For All was the turning point , because while Metallica began to make more adult commentary they backed it up with solid musicianship and challenging music that still had an edge to it . The follow up was their commercial break-through and I believe gave the band some delusions of grandeur , a feeling that what they had to say was more important than the music ( also known as U2 syndrome ) . This deslusion was carried out in Load ( the album preceeding this ) and as these songs are a continuation of that album , follow along accordindly . Money sometimes corrupts a band in ways that can not be redeemed , such as losing touch with the very reasons you got to where you are in the first place , and I truly believe this has happened to these guys . Yeah , they pretend to be the old fun loving guys when a camera is turned on , but when the tape recorders are turned on in studios , a cynical , jaded group of guys comes out . Their music is no longer exciting and emotional and it drives them deeper into a funk they have been in since the black album . This review is coming from someone who championed these guys when no one else wanted to know about them , and was a huge fan up to and including the Black Album , which as the time I felt was a misstep they would soon correct , and over the years , have learned to embrace as the last good album from a band who that just seems to be going through the motions with no emotions . This album ( Reload ) is a tiny step better than Load , but not by much . If you did n't like Load , you 'll probably hate this too . If you did like Load , you probably will , and it 's a fact that if you are fan of this drivel Metallica spewed out in the mid 90 's , you probably would n't care much for the stuff from their glory days . I am just deeply saddened that Metallica , who had so much to offer in the beginning , have chosen not follow bands like Slayer and Anthrax , and evolve the sound they already have . They have chosen to change their sound completely and totally alienate the fans that put them on the map in the first place . Sad but true .	-1
How generous of James and Lars to give us a CD comprised of songs that were n't good enough to make it onto the original `` Load '' . Of course , in retrospect , this was a work of genius compared to `` St. Anger '' , but that 's not saying much . Avoid .	-1
Whether or not Metallica sold out following `` ... And Justice for All '' is debatable , but the fact of the matter is that this group no longer has the fire that drove them to produce their brilliant earlier works . Reload is the emobodiment of Metallica 's newfound complacency . They do n't push that extra ten percent , and it shows in the bland rythm sections and inconsequential lyrics . Metallica must have got bitten by the alt rock bug pretty badly .	-1
Load was a scuff on the Metallica logo . Reload is a stain . Many claim that the album features good songwriting and originality and that if Metallica kept producing thrash albums they would get repetitive . This album is repetitive not only in and of itself ( Reload , as in Load again ) , but features little diversion from mediocrity among its own songs . The only stand out song is the riling The Unforgiven II . Working off a theme from the Black album , a powerful and original song is composed that 's surprisingly effective . The rest of the album is stale . Fuel is much weaker than it first appears and The Memory Remains , while creepy , is n't technical nor is it well-written . I liked Low Man 's Lyric , but it is n't Metallica . If you look at this album as though it was released by another band , it shines a little , but like Load , reality tarnishes it heavily . Do n't buy .	-1
The Load album either had good songs or bad songs on it . With this album , however , all of the songs are pretty mediocre and just okay . They put the best songs at the first and thank goodness for that , so now I do n't have to constantly do skipping to get to the good songs like on `` Load '' . The first 4 tracks are pretty good rockers , and if the album had kept this strength and momentum throughout the rest of it then this would have easily beaten out Load and have possibly matched up close with their Black album , although it would have had a different sound to it than the Black album of course . I do n't mind the different sound though . It 's nice to hear something different just as long as it 's good.The album starts out with `` Fuel '' . I actually like this song . It 's a fast rocker with some good riffs and melodies , equivilant in quality to the first track on Load called `` Ai n't my Bitch '' , which I also like . The second track , `` The Memory Remains '' , can be a little annoying if you let it be . Metallica was trying something different and they pulled out an alright job . I have to give them credit for it . `` Devil 's Dance '' is in the style of `` The Thing That Should Not Be '' , so not a fast-paced song , but a good slow rocker . `` The Unforgiven II '' is the next best song to come up . It does n't match up to the first `` Unforgiven '' , but it still turns out to be a good song . Up to this point it 's sounding like an alright album , but after that you discover the bad half of the album , or should I say the bad 2/3 of the album ? It carries out a pretty consistent mediocre sound throughout the rest of it . There 's nothing extremely horrible , but it just does n't sound like Metallica anymore . It 's bearable though . I was able to listen to this entire album in one sitting . That 's something that I can not do with `` Load '' .	-1
Every band faces the same question . Do you continue to make the same exact album every time , or do you try to change ? AC/DC never changed , yet they receive criticism for staying with what they do best ! Some bands are forced to change due to shifting musical tastes brought on by MTV . Other bands , like Metallica , try to change their style due to their overblown egos . Ever since the ridiculously overrated Black Album , they 've tried to mix their musical style up . In doing so , they 've screwed it up ! If you take the good songs from Load & amp ; Re-load and put them on one album , it 'd be pretty good . However , like Use Your Illusion 1 & amp ; 2 , the Load/Re-load albums suffer from too much filler . This album definitely has some bright spots , but just not enough to make this album stand up to their first four albums ! I remember back in '84 , skating to Kill'em All and Ride The Lightning & amp ; EVERY kid in the neighborhood thought Metallica ruled ! ! I wish that Metallica would return for the next album .	-1
Unless you are a fan of Load to begin with , I do n't think anyone in their right mind would think leftover tracks from that recording would be a good idea for an entire new album . Is n't the `` Memory Remains '' one of the stupidest things you have ever heard ... c'mon ... admit it . I can understand people maybe liking Load for what it is , something different , but how hackneyed is calling leftover tracks , `` RELOAD '' . I guess after Load Bob Rock was n't able to pinch anything else from them so he said , `` All right guys lets just re-tool the crap from the last one . '' I 'm sure they did n't put up a fight , they 're rich now .	-1
This album is : :Expletive deleted : : . Do n't buy it .	-1
Metallica WAS my favourite band .That is until the released the LOAD , RELOAD series ! If I could , I would give a different name on the bands name on their two last & quot ; junk & quot ; albums.Is not the fact that the music is not good.Is simply not a Metallica sound.Its softer , lighter , with less and less meaning ( deep meaning ) From their oldest albums like & quot ; master of puppets & quot ; or & quot ; ride the lightning & quot ; Metallica had created a legend , a status , and now they are just trying to destroy it by creating this kind of mixted up -confused -meaningless -with no grace albums.If I was a member of the band and I would like to continue produce records , I would change the name from Metallica to something else.Its a Sin to use the same name on these LOAD RELOAD stuff.For regular bands this would be a great album.For metallica Its way below medium , and way out of track.If you are a real fan of Metallica , dont buy anything having the word & quot ; load & quot ; or & quot ; reload & quot ; on it !	-1
First off , let me explain that I own every one of the Cure 's albums , a couple of singles , and every collection I can find that features a single Cure song . Plus the Glove , and the Banshees albums that Bob plays on . So it 's not like I hate the Cure , right ? But they are one of those bands that , no matter how much you like their music , you have to hate their attitude towards their fans . Basically , they put out a real studio album every three or four years , and in between they release a bunch of concerts , collections , remix albums , and assorted other junk . This CD is one of those stinkers , a little tidbit designed to complement the already-bad concert recordings Show and Entreat . To start with , the Cure are not a concert band . Their concerts are usually pretty bland , and the RECORDINGS of their concerts are even more lifeless . Some great studio music just does n't quite work in concert , and the music Bob writes is a perfect example . In addition , every one of these tracks is available as a B-side on some single . And since the band has a history of producing great singles , any fan will find it worthwhile to go and track down those singles . Every one of the singles features four songs , usually the A-side , a non-album track , and either two remix tracks or two live songs . Find them and forget this .	-1
The girls loved him . But the most annoying , boring recording of all time is Tom Rush 's `` Urge for Going '' . How anyone can sit through it from beginning to end , without having to take a week or two break , or shooting her- or himself in the head , has always puzzled me.If you want to yell , put that song on your player , and in no time at all you 'll be yelling at Rush , `` Then go , goddam*t ! Go ! `` He keeps singing , `` I 've got the urge for goin ' '' -- but he never does get around to leaving . `` Gad , Tom -- there 's the door ! USE it ! `` The girls loved him .	-1
... .you have THE SOFT PARADE , by the Doors.The title piece ( and set-closer ) , `` The Soft Parade '' is truly one of the silliest things ever committed to vinyl . With words like : `` Peppermint miniskirts , chocolate candy -- Champion sax and a gur-ull named Sandy , '' the myth of Jim Morrison 's supposedly brilliant lyric-writing abilities was laid to rest for all time . You can almost hear Morrison drunkenly hiccoughing during his ad-libbed `` This is the trip '' nonsense on what is an overlong , wincingly putrid musical montage.His physical damage from drug and alcohol overconsumption and rapid decline were never more apparent than on the vocals for `` Touch Me '' and `` Tell All The People . '' The man 's lack of sobriety on the first and unsteady weakness on the second are almost painful to experience . `` Wishful Sinful '' and `` Wild Child '' are more of the same.The only standouts on this one are `` Easy Ride '' and `` Runnin ' Blue . '' My guess is Jim was sober for those sessions . The rest here is totally forgettable . If you must own all the Doors albums , buy THE SOFT PARADE last . It 's that poor , and that sad . Probably should have been called THE SAD PARADE.SIDE ONE : [ 3:23 ] Tell All the People [ 3:12 ] Touch Me [ 4:49 ] Shaman 's Blues [ 3:08 ] Do It [ 2:41 ] Easy RideSIDE TWO : [ 2:38 ] Wild Child [ 2:33 ] Runnin ' Blue [ 3:02 ] Wishful Sinful [ 8:37 ] The Soft ParadeTOTAL TIME : 34:03	-1
Trash . Schlock . The Doors with an orchestra ? ? ? ? When this album first came out , When I first heard it in 1969 , I had an overwhelming feeling of personal betrayal . After the spectacular , `` Doors '' , & `` Strange Days '' , the good `` Waiting for the Sun '' , this ... .In retrospect , the Doors were like many other groups , Jim wrote poems for years , before they became popular , before there was The Doors . The early gems were spread through the first three album . All new material . Here the muse had stopped ! ( Altho that Spirit did return , to some extent , for `` Morrison Hotel '' and `` LA Woman '' . ) Worst of all The Doors albums , for completeists only ! Caveat Emptor . Just trying to save your money . Buy ANY of the other wonderful Doors album before this .	-1
This is one of the great albums of any decade ! The SHM-CD sound is a disaster , as it clearly demonstrates , by its extra clarity ( can anyone say `` boosted-treble , boosted-bass three times fast ) , that there has been no remastering of the material save the boosted parts of the sound spectrum . The classical releases in this format -- try Karajan-Mahler on DGG for a truly memorable earache -- are disgraceful . After many tries at finding one `` really better than the original '' SHM-CD , I 've given up on what I perceive to be a marketing ploy to pawn off older recordings at a `` boosted '' price.Even though the original release of `` No Secrets '' did n't have the greatest overall sound , it was more-than acceptable do to Ms. Simon ( who in the photo leaves `` no secret '' to the fact that she is n't wearing undergarments -- excellent ! ) and her immense talents.Buy the regular CD and skip this expensive turkey . Better yet , if you do vinyl , try to find a good copy .	-1
I 'm as big a fan of Zep as most reviewers but I have always been terribly disappointed with this release . All the live Led Zeppelin I 've ever heard really does not compare with the studio albums . They were just plain sloppy and could n't capture their greatness in a concert setting . If you need some live Zeppelin check out the newer , better sounding , and way better performances on How the West Was Won . For casual fans I 'd suggest sticking with the studio offerings .	-1
Duke Ellington wrote in his autobiography , & quot ; Some really DO dig distortion . Abstraction can reach a point where it represents or says anything the artist claims . . . But if you want to be IN , just make believe you dig it , man ! & quot ; To me , this summed up Ornette Coleman 's following in a nutshell . I 'm pretty sure Duke was describing anyone who rated this album five stars.This album presents an interesting concept - a return to collective improvisation , but without any kind of rhythmic or harmonic limitations . Theoretically , it would be interesting to hear Eric Dolphy and Don Cherry & quot ; comment & quot ; behind an Ornette Coleman solo , much like all jazz drummers do behind a soloist . However , without any kind of melody to work from , the result is an absolute mess . Dolphy comments with something that clashes horribly with what Coleman has moved to , while Cherry jumps in to add to the cacophony . I like Eric Dolphy , and I like Charlie Haden , and I even like some of Ornette 's unaccompanied playing . But I also like pizza , orange juice , and mint ice cream . Do I like those foods thrown together ? Heck no . For all intents and purposes , they may as well just have recorded all eight musicians in seperate rooms with a metronome and layered it together.I fear that your jazz neophyte or casual jazz fan will see this album 's five star rating and think it is a jazz classic on par with & quot ; Kind of Blue & quot ; or & quot ; A Love Supreme. & quot ; It simply is n't . It is painful to listen to . It is disjointed and by its very nature can not have any kind of theme or meaning . Anyone who says otherwise either sees something in it that I do n't , or they 're just trying to be hipper and more intellectual than the general public who will hate this album . More than anything , this is a failed experiment.Do n't be fooled . If you want to risk wasting twelve bucks , then buy the album , but I suspect most people will not even make it through the whole thing once .	-1
Hi when Flack made love with me long ago in 1988 , she stole my pants . She dessapeared form the room and she had stolen my wallet , trousers , and slip . Now I have to write that she had to steal me and made this record that year , she 's such a bad princess and made me think i was gon na die because I had offered her some sex to go on the bed and keep on lovin ich other.No , it 's a lie , I was only joking . I respect her as a singer and just waned to make another type of review . Any antihelpul votes are welcomed . Nanay .	-1
I just purchased the Graham Nash Songs For Beginners cd/dvd-a set . I 'm having an issue with the dvd-a.In my Pioneer DV-578A universal player , which has dvd-a capability , when I insert the disc the menu comes up fine . However , when I select play the machine freezes up , to the point that the only thing i can do is unplug the player to unfreeze it . This is repeatable.The dvd plays fine in my regular non dvd-a dvd player , also a Pioneer . The universal player has never before had a problem with dvd-a . I also just checked it with another dvd-a , which plays fine . Does any one have any idea what 's going on ? Has anyone else experienced this ? Edit : I 've finally figured out that the Pioneer 578-a has a bug where it has trouble with all hybrid dvd-a discs . It plays straight dvd-a 's fine , but with hybrids ( depending on the firmware ) it either locks up or only plays the dvd video audio track . Not the disc 's fault.Edit # 2 : I recently found an unofficial firmware update for my player on line which kind of solves this problem . I say kind of , because I still have to press an odd sequence of buttons on the remote for it to play . If anyone reading this has a 578 , you may want to search for this firmware.____________________________________________________________________Here 's my thoughts on the cd : I am really disappointed in the new mix . As the album is under 34 minutes , I think it 's a travesty that Nash did n't put both mixes on the cd , or even the old mix on the cd & the new mix on the dvd . I believe my dislike is partly because of 30+ years of listening to the old mix , but also that this mix harms the music . The gated drums are a joke in this context ; they 'd be at home with Billy Idol , & the multiple previously inaudible mistakes are a huge distraction for me.Here 's a few specific comments:1 . Regarding several comments here & elsewhere that the drums sound re-recorded or sampled : I have some studio experience . What I heard on Better Days & several others was likely the original drums , but with a very loud & prominent gated reverb added that was not on the original mix . The drums were also mixed louder then in the original . I have no clue WHY Nash made that choice ; imo it harms the songs.2 . I get the impression that Nash decided he wanted every tiny part that was sitting anywhere on the multi track masters to be clearly audible , even at the expense of the song as a whole.3 . I never noticed before that the acoustic guitar on Be Yourself is slightly out of tune . There are also some wrong bass notes on the piano that I never heard before on the 1st verse . I heard numerous muffed parts throughout the cd which I 've never noticed before ; I suspect they were intentionally buried in the original mix.I 'm definitely going to keep my original cd . I have n't yet decided if I 'm going to keep this . The mastering is tremendous , but so far I 'm not fond of this mix . It sounds like a totally different album , & some of the parts do n't fit ; little mistakes that were previously buried are now loud & clear , especially on the drums .	-1
I was disappointed in this release . They changed everything around . The original feel is gone which is what really is important to keep during a restoration of any kind . Let 's just talk about ( Track 10 ) `` CHICAGO '' .They start off adding acoustic guitar to the first verse bullying out the Afuche Cabasa , tambourine and the organ . Let 's add the lyrics `` It 's dying '' again to make it sound like a mistake . Maybe it was edited out on the original who knows it did not work.The song/album was perfect why F with it . `` Songs for Beginners '' is a terrific album I just wish that reissue studio remixers were taught a course in `` Respect for Works of Art '' during there training . Sorry Graham I hope it was not you that asked for these changes.GET THE ATLANTIC CD RELEASE ( 7204-2 ) and you will feel the songs again . The Atlantic CD has good sound quality and with some EQ tweaks on your system experience `` Songs for Beginners '' the best way so far .	-1
This CD unfortunately contains the recently remixed versions of these songs , not the original mixes . How I wish this was a remastered version of the classic mixes , but it 's not . Why ca n't Rhino release a remastered CD of the real version of this album ? Bummer .	-1
I am a big H & O ; fan and have been for over 25 years and counting ; not so much their `` newer '' stuff i.e . anything after `` Big Bam Boom '' ( except maybe the glorious `` Marigold Sky '' ) but it was really the stuff they did before `` Voices '' that intrigued me and got me reeled in after `` Voices '' and `` Private Eyes '' first got me hooked.I was deeply affected by what I had heard on `` Beauty On a Back Street '' as well as `` Bigger Than Both of Us '' and I went on to try and find as many of their albums that I could get my hands on.A couple of them , however , I wished I had n't had done . One of them is this album which you could if you want to be kind call an `` experimental '' effort but definitely no brilliant debut release by any stretch of the imagination . Another way of putting it would be to say that after this , they could only get better and believe me they really did until things started going downhill with `` Ooh Yeah . `` With this album , though , only `` Lily , Are You Happy '' really gives us some indication of what we can expect from the dynamic duo in upcoming albums . No point getting a whole album just for one song unless you are a die-hard collector and need this just to make your collection complete.I would recommend if you can find it in some used cd store `` No Goodbyes '' which is a brilliant compilation of their best stuff from their first 3 albums before they changed labels for RCA from Atlantic . It 's been out of print for many years and the duo themselves could probably care less about it given their acrimonious split from Atlantic but that is one compilation that would be good to get a remastered version of.I 'm still holding on to my Japanese press that I got years ago . Very precious to me indeed ... .	-1
There is nothing to recommend this album . The toll drugs and alcohol were taking on his skill and his ego were at their devastating worse here . The songs are terrible , the arrangements lacluster and the recording quality a real mess . If someone gives this to you , slap them with it . The masters of this should be destroyed at once .	-1
I am a major Stills fan . I think the first Manasas album was a true classic ! I decided to give this one a try even though I skipped it years ago when it first came out having heard bad things and by that time I was a bit burned out on this type of music . I wish I had skipped it this time around . The entire project seems thrown together like as if Stills and the boys were forced under contract to put something , anything , down on on record . The lyrics are sophmoric , and the rest is beneath Stills to put out . Two tracks are worth hearing - Is n't It About Time and Pensamiento . The rest is filler .	-1
& quot ; Face Value & quot ; is n't bad , I guess , but it most certainly is n't my taste . I absolutely love & quot ; No Jacket ... & quot ; and a lot of Phil 's later hits , but when I heard this , I was really disappointed . I wont say it 's bad , I just want to warn everyone who likes Phil 's later ( more mainstream pop ) songs , that they should listen to this before they buy it .	-1
I am sure that Phil Collins is a nice guy , he just is not a good singer . I just do n't get how Mr. Collins sells so many records when the music is so bad . Phil 's version of the great Beatles classic `` Tomorrow Never Knows '' is just horrible . If you must listen to this album , please make sure you are the only one that can hear it .	-1
This album was a seminal part of every teenager 's album collection ( including mine ) in the 60 's right along with the obligatory Hendrix and Cream albums . Granted , the remaining tracks could n't compare to the title cut , but at 17 minutes plus , who the hell cared ? That said , I would recommend that anyone considering buying & quot ; In a Gadda Da Vida & quot ; purchase a turntable and buy a used copy in vinyl at a record store . The sound quality of the CD is the worst of any album I 've ever heard . The guitar solos in particular were mixed down way low and lose the ambience and sonic clarity of the record . The only thing stopping me from giving this CD a lower rating is the fact that at least someone had the guts to try and do it ... and at least left the drum and organ solos in pretty good shape .	-1
MUCHO ORGANO AL FRENTE , MUCHO TUFO A PSICODELIA FORZADA ... .SOLO EL TEMA QUE DA TITULO AL ALBUM MERECE CONSIDERACION ... ESO SI , LA EDICION ACTUAL ES MUY PROLIJA , CON BOOKLET , FOTOS Y ANECDOTAS ... DESPUES NO HAY MUCHO PARA AGREGAR ... ... ...	-1
What happened with the sound quality ? ? ? ? Read the other reviews of this CD ( I Should Have ) . It sound 's like a cassette tape rather than a engineered CD ; With the ongoing `` Hissssssss '' in the background . This should have been a ( do-over ) at the studio ...	-1
Very few artists have made abums this bad . The thing about Phil is he included covers on many of his albums as if he could not be inspired enough to write all his own songs and even did the covers poorly and focused on quantity or more then quality . If you want to hear a good artist focussing on the opposite get Security by Peter Gabriel released the same year as this absolute rubbish .	-1
Advice to the ladies out there : If you are dating a musician be prepared that if you break up with that person , he or she is likely going to write an album on how much they now hate you . Many noticeable artists have done this before . Justin Timberlake , Eminem , Michael Jackson , Carly Simon , but one of the most noticeable releases was that of Phil Collins when his wife Joely divorced him . With the divorce getting ugly and bitter for both parties involved , Collins locked himself up in his studio and began recording to release some of his bitter emotions . The result is `` Hello , I Must Be Going , '' one of his weakest albums to date . Granted , for people who might not like Phil 's other albums this may be for you.Unlike some of his mainstream albums and hit singles , this Phil Collins is angry , bitter , and sarcastic , with nary a trace of humor to be found . The opening track `` I Do n't Care Anymore '' shows Collins ready to let loose some anger , and he does n't care whether you like it or not . And that 's exactly what he does for the firs four tracks : Vents . He vents , vents , and vents . Sadly , for all the anger directed in these songs , they do n't provide much of an enjoyable listening experience . The second half of the album is slightly better , starting with a remake of `` You Ca n't Hurry Love . '' At this point Collins contemplates the purpose and place for love in the first place . It 's a much calmer , more thoughtful , more mature second half , where the thoughtfulness can be felt in the music itself.Still , despite the second half being more interesting then the first , Collins would have done well to save a few of the highlights and shelve the rest of the album . This is an album that is probably too personal to please many people . I 'm glad he managed to get all this pent up frustration off his chest though , as what followed were much better , much more enjoyable works to be sure.Grade : ** starsDownload This : You Ca n't Hurry Love , Do n't Let Him Steal You 're Heart Away	-1
Well , it did get worse - Invisible Touch and Calling All Stations were conceived and released . The self-titled album starts off in solid form with the mysterious Mama , the bouncy pop of That 's All , and the artsy drama and pyrotechnics of Home/2nd Home By The Sea . Then the ideas dry up , and the band has even said as much when discussing the & quot ; rest & quot ; of this album . Illegal Alien is an embarrassment . The remaining songs are filler at best . Silver Rainbow has an enjoyable driving riff , but those lyrics -ouch ! Not the best effort from the Collins era Genesis , or should we say , Genesis Lite	-1
I would give this album 2 and a half stars for being half good , but seeing as I ca n't , and that the good parts are only good , not great , I will settle with 2 stars.The first song is one of the good ones . Mama is powerful , and edgy , surprising for a band who had been trying hard to get away from its edgy past with it 's previous few releases . I also like this song because Collins 's voice sounds its best here . Collins was always at his best when he was singing angry songs.That 's All is also a good solid pop song . A bit overplayed ( you 'll know it when you hear it ) , but a good song nonetheless.Home by the Sea is okay , a little bland though . It goes into the more instrumental Second Home by the Sea , which hearkens back to Genesis ' earlier days of long instrumental sections . It 's good , and compliments Home by the Sea well , and the reprise improves both songs as a result.It 's on the second side that everything starts to fall apart . There are some sappy love ballads , a joke song that is just plain irritating , and some more synth noodling.One of the most irritating things about 80 's Genesis is the choice of synths that Mr. Banks used . He abandoned the beautiful sounding mellotron and hammond organ in favor of more portable synths that just sounded awful to me most of the time . It would n't be so bad if he used them sparingly , in favor of piano . But unfortunately , piano is rarely heard on this album , and all you hear are the awful synths . He 's a great composer and musician , but the sound of those synths just turns me off . I also miss the acoustic guitar , something Mike Rutherford often played beautifully on the earlier albums , but abandoned when the group became a trio.If you like eighties pop music , you 'll love this album . But as an art rock album , it leaves much to be desired . Genesis , with this album , had pretty much abandoned progressive rock . Still , you 'll hear a little bit of their old brilliance here and there .	-1
stryper 's costumes and hot guitar licks are much cooler than ratt 's . i mean , what 's up with the lead singer 's sissy combover . motley crue and nelson are also more talented artists . save your money on this album and purchase nelson 's & quot ; after the rain & quot ; instead .	-1
If your voice is awful and your name is not Roger Waters ... please do n't sing ... ever ! : - )	-1
I had high hopes that the material on this CD would blow me away . With superstars like Paul Rogers and Jimmy Page you would expect nothing less than pure magic . Sadly that did n't happen and for the worst of reasons . This has to be one of the most poorly recorded albums of all time . I have to wonder if the vinyl record sounded this bad or if something went wrong in mastering the CD . Paul 's vocals sound like they were recorded in a large cave - with Rogers standing in the back . Likewise , Jimmy 's guitar work is buried so far down in the mix that the subtle parts are nearly inaudible . Ironic considering that Jimmy and Paul produced this work ! Chris Slade 's drumming is fine - at least he knows when to play and when to be silent . I ca n't say the same for Tony Franklin 's efforts . Between that odd sound he gets from his bass and his staccato style of playing , his work seems out of place here . To be fair about it , there are several great songs on this CD . `` Radioactive '' , `` Satisfaction Guaranteed '' , and '' Midnight Moonlight '' are all stand-out tracks . I also liked `` Together '' . I do n't know if the Firm 's second release is any better than this first effort , but I think I wo n't spend my money to find out . My advice is that you pass on this one .	-1
Shrill Collins is phony , talentless , boring , vapid , chiched , weak , tuneless , unoriginal , atrocious , fake , irritating and just plain BAD . Review over . Thank you .	-1
I saw the You 're in Love video and loved everything about that video , the songs that followed this track on the CD however seemed a bit less . As I would soon discover , it appears that Ratt used a lot of the same songs on CD from CD which made the collection as a whole somewhat not as good as others I 've seen . Great look , but as for me and my taste this CD just was n't on target . Try again .	-1
I bet when Ratt coined their album 'Invasion of your privacy ' all those years ago they never imagined the term would become so popular years later , meaning many things to so many people ! Of course , back in '85 , these guys were just looking at girls.But when listening to this invasion of privacy , it seems that there is n't much meat on the bone . They get that 80 's party rock beat , anthemic chorus , guitar solo , and very lean on the songwriting.The opening 'You 're in love ' is an excellent rock anthem with great riffs , 'Lay it down ' is a very good song , and 'Between the eyes ' is different enough to be interesting.Apart from that , the songs are n't bad , but there is very little depth in the songwriting , just chugging out that stadium sound and shifting the units .	-1
Ok , Scott was gone forever , before reaching his full potential . Everyone thought tha band was history . But then they come with the masterpiece & quot ; BACK IN BLACK & quot ; and a new & quot ; screaming & quot ; singer in the form of Brian Johnson . SOme people think the material to Back in Black was composed while Bon was alive . In truth , you can almost close your eyes and imagine Bon singing that tunes . IT would fit perfectly . The same is not truth for the albuns that followed . Johnson was getting worse and worse in the vocal department . Then the quality of the songs and lyrics deteriorated amazingly . This FLY ON THE WALL was the first sign of the end of their creative genius . Of course , being AC/DC , it has strong moments , simple and heavy chords . But the general effect is disgraceful .	-1
Bad Company / 10 from 6 : Warner , Swan and Atlantic records all must hate the casual fans of Bad Company . The music on this CD is great ... there just is n't enough of it . There are just far too many hits missing to feel good about this CD . You may notice that there are several ` hit ' CDs for Bad Company and they are all criminally short or woefully inept . This one is far too short . The double CD ` anthology ' is utterly incompetent and unnecessarily incomplete . A proper history/hits package for Bad Company simply does not exist . This leaves you with the option of being disappointed with a hits CD or paying for every album they ever made ( and as good as Bad Company was , not ALL of their albums is worth owning ) . I 'll stick with my old LPs until those responsible for the legacy of Bad Company get off their butts and gives us a decent collection . If they do n't , their incompetence will eventually lead to Bad Company being one of the many forgotten bands in history , and they deserve better than that . The 10 from 6 CD gets a Two Rating ( Five for the songs that it has , and minus three for the songs that should have been added ) .	-1
I have been waiting for `` Little Miss Dangerous '' to hit iTunes just to download the title track . No surprise Ted has tried to hide this record 's existence . It 's an embarrassing compromise in his flailing attempt to stay commercially viable in a time when pretty hair bands were taking over from the old arena rockers . But the title tune was the focal song of maybe the greatest episode of `` Miami Vice . '' This gorgeous chick was a psycho murderous hooker , and the Nooge 's song was a perfect fit . It 's a great listen . The rest is shameful.If Ted had n't gone all ego and broke up the band that recorded the `` Ted Nugent '' solo rebranding back in the mid-Seventies , I bet we would have gotten a lot more and more memorable music out of Nugent . No , Ted , I ca n't stand to listen to you sing . Derek was a better singer . Meat Loaf was a better singer . Don Van Vliet would have been a better singer.But Ted is an extraordinarily talented guitarist . `` Tooth Fang and Claw '' and `` Ted Nugent '' were spectacular recordings that belong in your collection .	-1
Little Miss Dangerous has some good Ted Nugent tunes on it . It does not however , compare to great albums like Cat Scratch Fever or Free For All . It does n't sound like Ted singing on most of the LMD songs , is that him ? Maybe the vocals are very `` processed '' in an 80s way . I do n't know . I really like the title track , and High Heels In Motion is super catchy and rockin ' . I also like Strangers and the cover of Little Red Book . I remember the vinyl of this album sounded horrible- very distorted like the levels were set too high in the recording studio and too much treble - the CD remaster has not really fixed those problems the production is still poor . All that being said , if you like Ted Nugent I do think this is worth getting , but after you have his debut , Free For All , Cat Scratch Fever , State of Shock , and maybe a couple of others .	-1
THis is the first ( and only , thanks ! ! ) time SAVATAGE tried hard to go mainstream , producing an awful glam album full of boring music and without any merits . It 's a shame to the band discography , but they proved to be better than this and changed into one of the best American metal bands .	-1
Invisible Touch has a lot of hit songs on it , and at the time of its release was hugely popular . However , I do n't think it held up over time . The ballads ( In Too Deep , Tonight Tonight Tonight , Throwing It All Away ) are decent but tiring and too plentiful on the album . The pop tracks ( Invisible Touch , Anything She Does ) are energetic and catchy but sound very dated . The standout track is Land of Confusion . Not really a bad album , but not nearly as good in 2008 as it was in 1986 .	-1
I 'm not giving two star because I 'm a GENESIS purist . No . Please , just listen to the drums in this album ! ! They are awful , completely beyond any reasonable explanation , giving the fact tha Phil Collins really can play drums ! ! ! ! The title track is very good , the rest is crap in the style of & quot ; ABACAB & quot ; . A disgrace to the band 's music ( but not to their pockets ! ! ! )	-1
I have all AC/DC albums , including the australian versions of High Voltage , TNT and DIrty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap . The only album I do n't own is exactly this one here ! ! WHO MADE WHO is neither a greatest hits compilation nor a soundtrack of entirely new material . It 's just about 3 inedit songs , mixed with such utterly bad filler songs from the FLY ON THE WALL album ( `` Sink The Pink '' and `` Shake Your Foundations '' ) , along with their most famous song in the US , `` You Shook Me All NIght Long '' , more `` Hells Bells '' ( another track from Back In Black ) , along with `` Fot THose ABout To Rock '' and one Bon Scott-sung song , the great and immortal `` Ride On '' .So , by the price of a whole album , you 're buying just three new songs , and the rest is NOT a compilation , because the songs are thrown in there just to make a total of nine songs , regardless of quality or whatever , what is made clear by the inclusion of the FLY ON THE WALL tunes ! !	-1
A movie soundtrack for Stephen King 's Maximum Overdrive . A Fair mix of AC/DC tunes . For the hardcore AC/DC collector only .	-1
When you think AC/DC , you are thinking `` Back In Black '' , `` Whole Lotta Rosie '' , `` TNT '' and `` For Those About to Rock '' ... not movie soundtrack score . But , that 's what you get with `` Who Made Who '' which was essentially the soundtrack for Stephen King 's `` Maximum Overdrive '' . In the context of the movie , the score Angus and the boys put together totally works ... on it 's own , it 's just kinda blah instrumentals ( save a couple of exceptions ) . Do yourself a favor and just buy the title track as a single ... that song does rock ! Top Tracks : Who Made Who	-1
Nothing ruined a night more for a bunch of stoned headbangers , when HeadBanger 's Ball played White Lion . 'When the Children Cry ' is by far one of the worst songs ever recorded . ( ... ) Seriously , bands like White Lion , Warrant , and Winger killed 80 's rock . They were just ridiculous .	-1
No motter how you see it , this band is another piece of junk of the hair metal era . That 's it . ( at least Vito whatever played good guitar ) .	-1
As a strong Foreigner fan , I have tried hard to like Inside Information . I have owned the CD for some 20 years and have played it rarely because I was disappointed when I first heard it . After reading some of the reviews proclaiming this the best Foreigner album , I decided I needed to reconsider and give it another try . I have listened to it again , only to find my original impression confirmed . It 's not the `` studio polish '' sound that bothers me ; no I like the effects of good mixing , etc . Certainly the Foreigner sound is there , and thank goodness Lou Gramm 's voice , which no one can ever replace . At first I had trouble pinpointing what bothered me . Now I realize now that it is the lack of passion in the songs that leaves me feeling cold . The hooks are generally weak and missing is the excitement of great songs like `` I Want to Know What Love Is '' or the raw emotion of `` Hot Blooded . '' Out of all the songs `` Say You Will '' is certainly a stand out , and I do like both `` Ca n't Wait '' and `` Out of the Blue , '' with `` A Night to Remember '' a distant fourth . If you are looking for more recent strong Foreigner songs , I recommend the album `` The Very Best and Beyond '' which not only has their best hits , but three 1992 collaborations between Mick Jones and Lou Gramm , `` Soul Doctor , '' `` Prisoner of Love , '' and `` With Heaven on Our Side . '' These three recapture the passion of the Foreigner I know and love .	-1
I have n't owned this cd since about 1988 because it 's just not the Foreigner that I came to know and love in the years 1977 to 1981 . The only song that I like to listen to repeatedly is the song `` Say You Will '' . That song is what Foreigner should sound like . Everything else is boring and mediocre . Unless you 're a diehard Foreigner fanatic , you should just pass by INSIDE INFORMATION and just stick with their first four studio albums .	-1
Testament was often considered one of the second tier of thrash bands , behind the big four of Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer and Anthrax . In the shadow of the big four , the likes of Testament , Exodus , Forbidden , and Overkill struggled to gain the recognition of their more famous peers . But it never came . For the likes of Exodus , it was a travesty . For Testament , it was never going to happen- they simply were n't good enough.Before all the old school thrash fans out there call for my head on a spike so crows can pick my dead staring eyes from their sockets , let me explain . Testament was and is a good band , but never reached beyond that level in the 1980s . The New Order is a good example of why . On first listen , it has all the ingredients of a good thrash album , but a few hours later , you 're struggling to remember any of it . Put simply , Testament as a whole were poor songwriters back in the 1980s . The riffing is solid , but unimpressive . Alex Skolnick 's leads are adequate , but not dazzling . Chuck Billy 's vocals are flat , and poorly executed in places . The song lyrics are standard , middle-of-the-road thrash fare . All seems & quot ; good & quot ; , but nothing is & quot ; great & quot ; , so promotion to the major leagues never came.Testament were often unfairly labelled Metallica clones . Unfortunately , many media at the time had no idea about thrash metal beyond Metallica or Slayer , so bands were generally compared to one or the other of them . Testament had their own sound . Listen to & quot ; Disciples Of The Watch & quot ; , the best song on the album . The bass was audible . The rhythm and lead guitars were quite different to Metallica 's sound . And Louis Clemente ran rings around Lars Ulrich when it came to drum technique and skill . Unfortunately , it just did not seem to gel on the rest of the album . It is like tomato sauce , ice cream and beer- all fine on their own , but mixed together ? Not appetising at all.This album is probably of interest as a history piece today , but you would not use it to show someone how good thrash was back in the 80s . It is simply too mediocre for that .	-1
I ca n't believe Neil Young would play on a sellout 80 's pop record like this .	-1
late-80s rappers bunny d. and tigra offend both rap affecionados and the larger music community with their debut release , _grab it ! _ . before the title track is over , there is enough evidence to book these two valley-girls-turned-rappers on at least two counts of overt style-biting . though apparently older than young mc baby d , l'trimm 's voices are not nearly as mature , making their more sexually-suggestive lyrics uncomfortable to listeners . the two win points for consistency , however , as their rhyming skills do not belie their immaturity . in short , l'trimm 's most notable contribution is the nominal hit & quot ; cars with the boom & quot ; , which managed to secure considerable airply the year of its release in spite of the fact that critical acclaim was not forthcoming . though the fresh beats of & quot ; push it & quot ; and & quot ; supersonic & quot ; acheived success among a large and diverse audience , many suburban youth were still cutting their teeth on the relatively new national rap/hip-hop phenomenom and , therefore , could not handle the likes of the more serious artists such as salt-n-pepa , j.j. fad and roxanne shant & eacute ; . in that regard , it can be said that their relatively soft-core interpretation of hip-hop , which had cheerleaders from orange county to nashua considering themselves fans of rap , aided and abetted rap 's insurgence into mainstream american culture . it is unclear whether tigra and bunny were intended as a pop anomaly or a serious rap duo , but the absence of a sophomore effort speaks for itself . bunny sums it up best in & quot ; grab it & quot ; when she raps & quot ; my name is bunny and this is not funny. & quot ;	-1
Ratt is a group with such energy and awesome riffs and lyrics , but this cd surprised me because it 's so weak and almost lame . All good groups seem to have a dud and for Ratt this one is it . I would n't suggest this cd to anyone unless they just want to complete their Ratt collection , as I do .	-1
I really liked the opening track `` City to city '' but that was it ! ! ! Almost every song seems to be so plain and it is hard to tell the difference . I prefer `` Detonator '' album which is more powerful with stronger beats and melody . However I am still looking forward to their reunion .	-1
I used to like this album but then I got sick of it because of this band 's tastelessly cheesy antics . & quot ; Warrirs prayer & quot ; made me cringe every time I heard it . Next to everything released by Bal Sagoth , that is one of the cheesiest tracks I 've heard on a metal album . The lyrics are typical Manowar arrogance in which Eric Adams boasts about how they 're & quot ; real metal & quot ; and other bands are not . It 's tiring . Manowar starting doing that since the New wave of British Heavy metal days and their still doing it ! Well , I 'm done . Personally , I would recommend anything by Kamelot if someone wants to listen to some cheesy power metal with some good taste and intelligence .	-1
I 'm usually not the type to buy a CD off of one song , but sometimes when I got some cash burning and a thirst from some harsh riffs I impulse buy . I 'd heard of ManOWar before , and the song & quot ; Hail and Kill & quot ; and figured , why not . I listened to the CD about twice , then shelfed it . The entire arrogant and cheesy lyrics turned me off , and only a few good songs saved this from being a total let down.1 . Wheels of Fire - One of the good songs , it 's fast and fun but nothing superb.2 . Kings of Metal - Ummm ... kind of an ego trip with alright riffing to go with it.3 . Heart of Steel - A decent ballad , not great.4 . Sting of the Bumblebee - More annoying then cool , something original would have been nice.5 . The Crown and the Ring - Another decent song , the oragns are a nice touch , but again nothing spectacular.6 . Kingdom Come - Better than most of whats on the album.7 . Pleasure Slave - I 'd probably have given a higher rating to this Album if it did not contain this terrible piece of garbage . More ego tripping , with moaning girls and some totally awful lyrics.8 . Hail and Kill - The whole reason I bought this CD , it 's a fun song , something I 'd hope would be consitent throughout the album.9 . The Warriors Prayer - Whats this ! ? It 's not even a song ! It 's a grandpa telling some lame story to his grandson ! I do n't want to spend 4 1/2 minutes listening to this , maybe if they 'd sprinkled 30 second snippets throughout the disc to further the story like Blind Guardian did in Nightfall.10 . Blood of the Kings - Well , it closes good , this song is pretty cool , but lyrics just kinda suck ... what else is new.Being that I was told that Kings of Metal was one of ManOWars best , I do n't plan on buying anymore . Theres about 3 good songs on here . Your money could better be spent elsewhere on some ( old ) Metallica , Iced Earth , Pantera , or Anthrax . Unless you 're already a fan of ManOwar I really do n't reccomend buying this CD .	-1
After having owned a copy of Fighting the World for over 10 years and thinking it was pretty good , I thought it was about time I bought another Manowar album to check out . After reading reviews of albums on Amazon I decided to grab a copy of Kings of Metal , bad move . 3 or 4 tracks feature choirs , which would be okay for intro 's maybe , but they drag on for 4 or 5 minutes , one track is some old guy telling a boring medieval story featuring horses and swords , and that Sting of the Bumblebee bass guitar crap is just painful . The rest of the album is okay , although very over produced , but not good enough to keep me interested , I took it back and got a refund . Kings of metal with highly over produced choirs etc ? hardly	-1
I mostly got this for Black Velvet ... ..but of course , I was going to listen to the rest of the album . Listened to it twice and I honestly just do n't like it . I ca n't pinpoint what my reason is , all I know is , that I do n't like . Luckily I did n't pay much for it .	-1
Donna Summer 's fourteenth studio 'Another Place and Time ' was produced by 80s British hit makers Stock Aitken Waterman , and boy does it tell . This album sounds similar to 1988 's Kylie and sapps all of the personality from Summer . The album like most of their work sounds horribly dated and was a big misstep for her and it was no wonder why David Geffen passed on both her and this project . Thank goodness her follow up with PWL never materialized . The tracks like most of their work is incredible vapid and Summer struggle greatly to in part some personality to tracks that could have been sung by essentially anyone . Some of the tracks sounds like her voice is battling the overproduced music . That being said the album is incredibly catchy in that annoying I wish ti would my head type of way and does contain like four memorable track like the opening track `` I Do n't Wan na Get Hurt '' which kinda reminds me of `` I Should Be So Lucky '' and is easy to sing along with after a listen or two , `` This Time I Know It 's for Real '' which was one of three tracks that she co-wrote , and and then there is `` In Another Time and Place '' and `` Breakaway ' which both sounds nothing like they where produced or written by SAW . Overall not her best album and she could have definitely done better than these disposable tracks that sounds horrible dated .	-1
Not one of the more distinguished productions by the great Stock-Aitken-Waterman team , this album is definitely one of the worst ever instances of a great disco artist trying to make the transition to 80s R & B . This album did spawn the huge hit `` This Time I Know It 's For Real , '' which is by all means a great song . Unfortunately , nothing else on the album even comes close to it , and since the song is available on most or all of Donna Summer 's many hits collections , I would just get it that way instead .	-1
By the end of the 1980s , after four releases in a synth rock vein with instrumentals and vocals alike far removed from rock-out savagery , Rush 's popularity was beginning to fade . The tour for 1988 's album HOLD YOUR FIRE saw half-empty venues and cancelled dates , while guitarist Alex Lifeson was feeling increasingly pushed to the side by all the keyboards . The trio knew they needed to make a change and PRESTO , released in 1989 , shows them embarking in a slightly different tradition . It 's not a complete departure , as songs like `` Red Tide '' and `` War Paint '' and could easily have fit in on the previous two albums . But in the main we find a much dimished use of synthesizers , and in tracks like `` Show Do n't Tell '' and `` Available Light '' , Lifeson returns to the spotlight.But the album is ultimately overall disappointing . The most readily noticeable flaw is Rupert Hine 's production . The drums have no punch , the sound is flat with little variation in dynamic , and there 's an incongruous edit in the second track . The other problem is that , as one listens through the whole album , Neil Peart 's lyrics are perhaps his weakest in the band 's entire career . At best , they are forgettable , with myself and many fellow Rush fans unable to recall half of what Geddy sang . At at worst , they are risible . The `` boys and girls together '' bit on `` War Paint '' makes me cringe almost as much as the infamous `` Net boy , net girl , / send your signal 'round the world . / Put your message in a modem / and through it in the cyber sea . '' lines of `` Virtuality '' on TEST FOR ECHO a few years later.I consider PRESTO the weakest Rush album released in the three decades since they moved to radio-friendly lengths . From talking to other Rush fans , I always thought this was the common opinion , and I 'm baffled as to the high average review here . It 's not a complete failure , as I occasionally listen to `` Chain Lightning '' and `` Available Light '' , but this is one of the few Rush albums I 'm reluctant to play through . Ironically , opinions aboutHold Your Fire , the album that drove so many people away in the late 1980s , seem to have improved over the last 20 years . On the other side of PRESTO , the following albumRoll the Bonesis also often seen as a solid effort .	-1
This is Crosby , Stills , & Nash 's weakest album . They venture too far into pop and not enough rock on this one . The most interesting song on it is `` After The Dolphin '' where Nash seems to try to remake the C & N classic `` Last Whale '' . All-in-all , this is a very forgettable album . Recommended for hardcore CSN fans only .	-1
This is commonly known as the `` weenie '' album from these weiners . Yuck ! This is the result of too many drugs , too much booze , and an attempt to be trendy , '80s-style . Even throwing on some mustard and relish wo n't help this meal . Pass the Alka-Seltzer , please . Ah , thank you . Burp !	-1
And to those that hated when Metallica crossed over to a more alternitive style metal , I give you Ratt 's `` Detonator '' I had stated on my review of `` Reach for the sky '' that Ratt was already losing their signiture sound , but at least there were some repectable songs on it . I gave it 2 1/2 stars . When Detonator was released in 1990 , and I had first heard it , I knew that Ratt had truely `` sold out '' as this album is some very bad hair metal . Its sounds nothing like the Ratt of old , and even gives in to some bad `` electric '' drums . The only song on here that is any good is `` Shame , Shame , Shame '' , the rest is just garbage . Even though Hair Metal would die a in two years , Ratt had died and gone to hair metal heaven after this piece of junk release . If you like your hair metal cheesy such as BulletBoys , Winger , White Lion , and Ugly Kid Joe , then this is for you . If you were a die hard fan of Ratt 's `` out of the celler '' and `` Dancing Undercover '' ( their two best albums ) then avoid this mess .	-1
This is my least favorite release by Testament . I own everything else by them except this and 'The Ritual ' ( 2 star release ) . They are both thin , boring and lack any type of aggression . There is not one song on this cd that I like . This is n't thrash ... this was their attempt to get on the radio . I do n't care if they rushed or not , this is just not good material . There are too many great releases by this band to waste time on this one .	-1
A bunch of boring blues rip-offs and boring songs about Vikings . It all sounds identical.Nice cover art , as the bands ' fans are likely the type into that crop circle twaddle .	-1
no talent here just a bunch of noise no imagination allright i 'll get to the point no craftsmanship no substance must i say more just an awful band i hate them with a passion if you really like old rock try the kinks or the beatles !	-1
the songs from the movie which hooked me ( Harry Nilsson - Jump into the Fire ; and songs by the Stones and Beatles ) were conspicuously absent.Such a disappointment ! What were they thinking ?	-1
Mike Rutherford is in the unenviable and unavoidable position of being compared with his more successful colleagues from Genesis - Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel . This album does not help.Most of the material on the Mechanics ' third album falls away after the encouraging opening track & quot ; Get Up & quot ; .While there is plenty of slick pop throughout , most of the lyrics are a little flat . & quot ; Get Up & quot ; , the title track , & quot ; Stop Baby & quot ; and & quot ; Let 's Pretend It Did n't Happen & quot ; are the better moments.This is a disappointment because the Mechanics , formed in 1987 , had shown promise .	-1
This reunited version of Lynyrd Skynyrd sounds too stale . Each song is delivered in the same angry tone and key . One guitar solo sounds like the rest . And the back up vocals by the new Honkettes are overutilized . Smokestack Lightning and Pure And Simple are two excellent songs . A few of the others are n't bad either . But its very annoying to listen to this CD in one sitting as it really all sounds the same halfway through the disc . Purchase Street Survivors or Second Helping for real classic Skynyrd .	-1
This album starts out fantastically -- `` Dreamline '' is easily one of the best songs the band has ever done , while `` Bravado '' and the title track maintain a high standard . But other than `` Heresy '' and the instrumental `` Where 's My Thing '' , the rest of the album is forgettable mainstream rock . Though fans of the 70s material may appreciate the ( near ) absence of synthesizers they might still find parts of this CD to be extremely boring . The completist will want to pick this up , but most of the good songs from this album are available on the live set Different Stages . [ This review is based on the original 1991 release , not the 2004 remaster ; the sound quality on the original is just fine . ]	-1
That 's hard to believe . I 'm a big Rush fan , from the point of view of their entire catalog , but this is definitely one of the weak spots . I think & quot ; Big Wheel & quot ; and & quot ; Ghost of a Chance & quot ; are OK , & quot ; Roll the Bones & quot ; is a mediocre radio tune , and the rest is very forgettable IMO . Not sure what caused Rush 's decline . They certainly had some good moments after Moving Pictures , but on the other hand they seem to have been in steady decline ever since . Nope , ca n't recommend this one .	-1
Bad effort by RUSH . A IRon Maiden , Van Halen , Def Leppard , Ozzy and others artists , they just ca n't be so great anymore .	-1
After repeated listens I have to agree with the other reviewers that feel this is an extremely weak record . Two stars is almost being kind . Dreamline is a solid song , Ghost of Chance is also quite good . There are some other average tracks but nothing memorable . They seem to have been searching here and possibly catering to what other bands were doing at the time . A mistake on their part as Rush should never worry about other bands and simply do their own thing . Presto is a much more solid effort than this one . Show Do n't Tell , Scars , the title cut , and the simply stunning Available Light clearly give the edge to Presto . I own every Rush CD except for Vapor Trails and I think this one is clearly my least favorite .	-1
I 'll keep it short ... This album by Foreigner sounds more or less exactly like Bad Company 's `` Holy water '' . Best song is `` Low down and dirty '' . It 's decent polished rock of average standard from a time gone by . Maybe it 's not Hair Metal but sure it 's close to.It 's not bad but it 's not great .	-1
I hate to give albums one star , especially from a band that I love so dearly , but this one was pretty weak . There were two decent songs here , Fading Lights and Driving the Last Spike , not the greatest thing they 've ever recorded , but still not bad.But overall , this album 's pretty boring . Makes very nice background music , I 'll give it that . But there really is nothing of note hear . There is an over-abundance of sappy love songs and various elevator music filler . It 's hard to believe , from listening to this album , that Genesis was once an edgy prog rock band .	-1
We Ca n't Dance kind of sums up post 1980 Genesis : some great moments , but many dull and uninspired ones . No Son of Mine and Dreaming While You Sleep are probably their best work ( since 1980 ) , as they have an adventure and boldness that had vanished for quite some time . But the second half of the album is just plain lousy . All three members seem to have forgotten their wealth of musical talent , opting instead to write catchy hooks and sappy lyrics that do n't challenge their abilities , or the listener . Some terrible moments are when they try and find a & quot ; happy medium & quot ; between their ambitious art-rock beginning and obvious sell-out commercial pop , having simple hooks that stretch on upwards of ten munites . Occasionally , they have moments ( driving the last spike starts to sizzle around the five or six munite mark ) , but it also bring out the weakness in Collins ' lyrics . This album and Invisible Touch are easily the best of their commercial work , but they 're not particularly strong or interesting , as flashes of brilliance get muddled in the long , boring stretches .	-1
