I love these gloves . I bought a couple 9 yeas ago at Walmart and they are still in great condition . They are not quite white any more but they still protect my hands . I have n't been able to find them near me . My skin is very sensitive and I ca n't let any cleaning chrmicals touch my skin or it gets extremely irritated . I am glad to see they can be found here . I will need some pretty new ones for the next 9 years ! Totally recommend these gloves .	1
My wife buys large 'rubber ' gloves for herself ; none of them fit me . Another reviewer says that these run large . That 's great with me ; we 've actually found 'rubber ' gloves that I can wear . I wear gloves for everything , so gloves that fit is important . The size stamped on the large gloves says - 8 1/2 -- 9 . The XL box contains 9 1/2 -- 10 gloves . When placing my hand on the size 'gauge ' printed on the box it indicates that I 'd wear a medium . Not if you want to slip them on and off easily.The lining is great ; I ca n't address the durability , but will in a few months . Another reviewer says that they are nitrile . In that case they should not be used foir changing oil or cleaning with any petroleum product . Tighter fitting disposable would be best for that anyhow .	1
These gloves for perfect plus they are nice and soft inside which is a nice bonus . I 'd buy them again .	1
I absolutely love these gloves . They are soft inside and are very durable . The fact that they are white is a little offputting as they do stain . Not a real issue but when washing up after a dish with tomato sauce , the gloves are tinted and never quite look the same .	1
I 'd almost given up on Mr. Clean brand kitchen gloves until I discovered their `` Bliss '' latex-free gloves . I used to buy the Mr. Clean `` Mega Grip '' long-cuffed orange version until I lost patience with the inconsistent sizing . Sometimes a small would fit , the next time I 'd find I needed a medium . After my last pair ( medium ) had one glove that fit more like an extra-small and the other like a large ( though both noted the size as medium on the gloves themselves ) , I promised myself I 'd just go back to the Playtex brand . I also found the `` Mega Grip '' anything but . Very slippery when used for washing dishes , and they also quickly developed small holes/tears.When I went to the store to buy some Playtex gloves to replace the odd-sized Mega Grip gloves I 'd just tossed , there were no Playtex gloves available . I then saw the Mr. Clean Bliss latex-free gloves , and thought I 'd give them a try , even though I have no problem with latex . I first opened the box and tried them on in the store , not wanting to take chances with weird sizing again . In the Bliss , I was back to my usual size ( they run a bit large ) , both gloves were the same size , and they felt great . When I put them to the test washing dishes , I found that they were very comfortable , and the texture on the palms makes for a good grip - no more dishes sliding out of my hands . They feel thick and cushiony , yet are n't at all bulky and allow for great flexibility . They also protect so well against heat that when I first used them I kept checking the water temp to see why it did n't feel as hot as usual . I 've found that the interior flocking has held up very well , and really wicks away moisture . After a few uses , the flocking in most kitchen gloves seems to just disintegrate , but not so with the Bliss gloves . These gloves are holding up very well after a couple of months ( though I like them so much that I made sure to buy a back-up pair ) , and the flocking is still intact . It makes them very easy to get on and off.One thing I 've found with all kitchen gloves is that unless you allow the insides to dry completely , they get funky . So I hang them up with one of those plastic clothes pins with a hanger hook at the top . No need to turn the gloves inside out - just turn the cuffs down a bit to expose more of the inside of the gloves , clip them together by one side of each turned-down cuff so the gloves are hanging together , open to let enough air inside to allow the flocking to dry . Et voila ! No more mildew-smelly , clammy gloves . At least that works well if you 're not doing dishes several times a day and can give the gloves time to dry .	1
UPDATE : Received four pairs of gloves for $ 3.99 per pair . The gloves are the gloves of old that I loved and treasured . They are latex-free and lined with a soft velvety white lining . Thank you for bringing these back ! Your happy customer Penmouse.Note : I have added a photo of the new gloves with package too.I ordered four packages of these . I am not sure if I will receive four gloves or 24 gloves as the Amazon description says Mr.Clean 6-pack Ultra Grip Latex Gloves with Grippers . The ad also says these gloves are latex-free . All I know is these gloves seem very similar to the gloves I purchased in the past from Amazon . If this is the case , I will be in pure heaven as these gloves have a soft , velvety interior lining with a durable exterior . I am down to my last pair of these gloves and I have washed and hung these babies up to dry for a couple years . I have enclosed a photo of my beloved gloves.I use these gloves a lot as I have very sensitive skin . The gloves are used mainly for dish washing as this is my last pair . In the past , when I had more of these gloves , I used them for household cleaning too.If you want a durable pair of gloves , that are gentle on the hands , I highly recommend this product based on my previous purchases.I will update this review , if needed .	1
Can I say kitchen gloves are cozy ? Maybe it is this long winter we 've been having but I really like the feel of these gloves . They are thicker than regular gloves and they have a soft lining on the inside which is far more pleasant than plain rubber gloves ! The fit is great- I am petite so I chose small . I love the fact that they come in lots of colors so you can match them to your kitchen decor . Hey if they are going to be out near your sink all the time they might as well match !	1
I like that they are white for one thing , soft on the inside , could be a bit longer on the arm but they are pretty standard as far as that goes . Sizing : Widest width of palm 2 7/8 for small , 3 1/2 for medium , 4 & # 34 ; for large . That is according to the back of the box . I had bought a large because I wear a large in regular gloves and my palm is exactly 3 1/2 & # 34 ; wide at the widest , in this glove I need only a medium .	1
I like this product my co-workers at work noticed the smell this product gave out , our secretary said how she can smell the fresh scent on me , im sold .	1
I always thought these were just cheap detergents . I bought some on a buy 1 get 2 free sale with the intended use to wash the dog bed and animal products . Well it turns out we like how this detergent smells a lot better than other popular name brands , especially when combined with the purex crystals ! So we use just 1 packet of these and 1 scoop of the crystals and everything comes out smelling fresh ! Our other brand detergents we would use 2 full cups and it 'd just be okay .	1
I was n't sure about these when I ordered it , since I had never used these before , but now I am hooked ! it gets the clothes clean , very simple to use , no measuring , no pouring , ect ... just drop a pack in and wash , very simple ! it also has gotton a lot of stains out that I was not able to get out with my old detergent ! which is a major major plus ! ! ! highly recommended !	1
I am a tide pods fan . While I feel that tide does a better job I buy these to have on hand because they are a fraction of the price and for some small loads I like them . If I am just washing ours dogs blanket or some shop towels there are great because they still clean fine but save a bit of money .	1
This is is a great , affordable product and I was very happy to see it on the subscribe and save program .	1
Whoever invented the laundry pod should be given a medal ! They have made my life so much easier and I am happy to be without the heavy laundry detergent bottle each time I have to do laundry . I first bought these because I was given a trial and a coupon to buy more . I love the scent and only wish it came in a larger size container . I have since tried Tide pods , I like them too and use them more often simply because I can buy a larger size at the store and it is more convenient for me to buy them that way but I prefer the scent of the purex . I find no difference in the way they clean my clothes . Either way , I will never buy anything but laundry pods again for doing my laundry and will probably continue to alternate between the two depending on price and size at this point .	1
I kept going through the liquid detergents too quickly because I 'm too lazy to measure the proper amount . This works much better .	1
NICE PRODUCT , CLOTHES SMELLED NICE AND FRESH AND WORKED WELL IN MY WEASHER , THIS IS SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER PODS IVE TRIED AND THEY WORKED EXACTLY THE SAME	1
I love using these little packages , I have a very small portable washer and there 's makes it so much easier than dragging out the big bottle of soap .	1
First time ever trying these detergent packs and I 'd perfer them over the traditional way of washing clothes . It makes the process go by a lot faster . as far as cleaning clothes , I have no complaints so far , however I 've been using two packs per load . I have n't tried using one per load . clothes look clean and smell great .	1
Very easy to use , just throw it in the washing machine and it does the job . Smooth and clean scent , definitely not overpowering . Great value .	1
I like this product a lot , easy to use , not big plastic bottle to throw away . And that is great . The product itself works well and clothes come out clean .	1
Great buy , have this item coming as & # 34 ; subscribe & buy & # 34 ; .. Not having to worry about running out any more and lugging all this staple stuff back and forth . Fast ship and GREAT price ! ! ! !	1
Works great and even better than the big name products ! And Cleans just as GOOD , even great ! ! I love these pods !	1
I really like the purex ultra packs . To address earlier reviews- I will agree that if you place the pod on top of clothes you can get that blue reside that is difficult to get out . I just throw the pod in before my clothing and do n't have that problem . It 's also helpful to note that one pod is for a pretty small load of laundry- like 5 towels . Most washers are much more high capacity than that , so if you 're washing a lot or very soiled clothing you should use two pods .	1
I love the tabs over liquids and powder . No residue . No measuring . Purex smell great and get the job done . These were a steal as well at under $ 5for 54 of them . Thanks , Amazon ! !	1
I am happy with this purchase . These packs were less expensive than some of the others and so far they workreally well . The laundry smells good and comes out clean .	1
I have tried Tide ultra packs , Purex ultra packs , and Arm and Hammer ultra packs . I do n't think any of them work better than the other , and Tide is much more expensive . So I will buy these and happily save money .	1
Just the right amount of soap every time . Just put a pack in with your cloths and forget it . I work on tractors all day and get very dirty . I had my doubts about this soap when I fist got it . After the first load I was very pleased . Its nice getting the correct amount of soap every time . The mountain breeze is nice as well . In my opinion a very good value for the money .	1
Laundry just became so much easier . I love that I do n't have liquid being poured into the machine , this just seems like it will be better for my machine . Just throw one in and start , it is a great idea . I will continue to use these and love the subscribe and save option .	1
Love the packs..no spill or measuring . I have always used the liquid , but the container becomes bulky and heavy , so these are perfect .	1
These work surprisingly well . I am trying pods for the first time . Used one in a large load in an HE machine and clothes came out clean and smelling nice . What more could you want ? I have to go down the hall to a laundry room , so grabbing a pod is much lighter and less cumbersome than carrying a big bottle of detergent .	1
Yes , this is very convenient as no need to scoop and measure , just have to throw into washer , clean clothes with nice smell .	1
This works just as good as Tide and costs a fraction of the price . I do recommend this detergent . +	1
I have always liked Purex products , but like most people I used more than I really needed . Even though these pods cost a little more than a jug of soap , I actually save money because I do n't add that little extra that I used to before . Having them delivered to my house for free and the price break using the subscription service saves my money and time . Ca n't beat that !	1
Loved this product when it first came out . Lugging 3 bottles plus laundry baskets to the laundry room is not an enjoyable task . This product made it much more endurable . However soon after it came out to the world , it disappeared just as quick . Why all the convenient products have a short life is beyond me . Anyway , I inquired to Purex directly when I was n't able to find this particular scent of detergent in the stores last year and they said it was discontinued.I 'm so happy Amazon is carrying this product and in such a large quantity . Next time I & # 34 ; ll be ordering 2 at such a great price.Thanks for making laundry a bit more hassle free for me .	1
this makes laundry so easy..it does the job and its easier to use then the liquid . with the liquid you can over pour.. with this you cant . if its a big load you use two if not you use one..pretty freaking easy . I will repurchase .	1
It 's just the two of us so these last a long time . Able to save money using the subscribe & saving . My husband use it and thought that I had washed the dogs cover and the water was dirty because of that . I had to explain that the product makes the water a deep blue . Cleaning power is great !	1
The purex ultra packs of laundry detergent are so great to use . It is so easy to follow the directions and put however many packets you think you might need according to size of was load . Packaging was done well so as not to squash the liquid packets .	1
I bought these so when I did laundry it would be less of a chore . They 're incredibly convenient ; just toss one or two ( depending on load size ) into the washer , and the little packs do the rest . The detergent itself cleans very well , and leaves clothes soft and smelling great ! You have to make sure you have absolutely no water on your hands or else the pods will open in the bag , and the seal on the bag is a bit of a pain to clasp shut . It 's supposed to stay sealed to prevent moisture from getting into the bag , so I poured mine into a large freezer bag .	1
This is well packaged and delightful tasting ! I used approximately a cup of nectar and blended this into a smoothie with some fat free greek yoghurt and honey and it was delightful . Those who like mango flavor will not be disappointed . There was never any aftertaste of fish as others have complained about . I would recommend this for those looking for a smoothie boost . I just wish they included some sort of information on the bag about how long the nectar is good for once opened . I threw some of it away because I was worried that I may have kept it too long . With Fish Oil being the main ingredient I would rather be cautious than sick .	1
This is a great product . I tried both this mango and the lemon . I did n't HATE the lemon but definitely notice a less fishy taste , if any at all , with this mango.Is works well alone or in smoothies and provides a very bioavailable omega 3 product . No fishy urps or aftertaste .	1
I love this product . I love mango . Best of all , it promises a decent source of Omega 3 with a few very tasty spoonfuls . My only compaint is that this very eco-friendly re-sealable packaging is a bit difficult to manage for some people such as my mom who has trouble with all types of packaging . The first morning she accidentally squirted the product all over the counter when attempting to close the screw top because she applied pressure on the wrong part of the packet . Other than that , I think this is a very tasty product for those of us who do n't like pills.Recommended .	1
First off , ditch the gummies . The liquids have way more EPA and DHA per serving and less sugar . The gummies may have 50-60mg of EPA or DHA , where as the liquids have over 300mg of each . No comparison really . My kids ca n't handle the big adult capsules yet and these liquids are awesome for actually getting them meaningful doses.We have been getting the Barleans liquids . Those work great and I would recommend them as well . I like this Coromega product a bit better though as it is just Omega 3 ( Barleans has Omega 6 and 9 in their Omega Swirl fish oil line , unless you get the Key Lime enhanced stuff ) . Pricewise they are about the same per serving ( compared to normal Barleans ) with 2 tsp being a serving for both brands . They have the same DHA at 360mg per . The Coromega has more EPA at 540mg vs. 360 for the Barleans . Taste is good in both products.I would recommend this brand and product . In fact after trying the & # 34 ; Big Squeeze & # 34 ; I ordered the Coromega individual serving packets ( they look like little ketchup packets ) in Orange flavor for a recent trip we took and they worked great for getting the kids their daily Omega 's .	1
My dad is very into all kinds of supplements , including the Coromega single serving squeeze bags of original orange flavor . He periodically gives me a bunch of the single serving orange flavor bags , and I eat them . Single serving is tasty , but expensive ( as of today , you can get 120 of them for about 30 dollars ) . In case you have never had it , that original product is like small ketchup packets that contain sweet fruit flavored omega 3 supplements . Also , in case you have never had it , these smell and taste great and are all like sweet fake fruit . There is no hint of fish or anything like that.I was excited to try this big bag of Coromega mango flavored stuff , because I like the traditional flavor.First off , the flavor is great . I could eat this all day , by itself , or in yogurt . Just like how original flavor does not taste quite like oranges but is still good , this does not taste quite like mangos , but is still good . This has a tart prickly after taste , like a slightly unripe mango . I would say to sample it first , but even the smallest count of single serving Coromega packets costs about as much as this big bag , so just go for it if you like the original orange flavor.Second ... the big bag did not work for me . This product is a giant bag containing 45 days worth of Coromega ( equivalent to about 90 single serve packets ) . After you open the big bag , you have to refridgerate it . Then you shake and squeeze into a spoon your dose of Coromega . The packets had worked for me , because I could just have them in a backpack or drawer or what ever . The big bag does n't work for me for two reasons : Not as convenient . I have to use a spoon to squeeze some onto , and then unless I am putting it in yogurt or something where I was already going to use a spoon , I have to wash the spoon . And , because I have to refridgerate it , I do n't take it consistently.For me , the big bag will be a way to stretch out my single serve packets . So , if I do n't have time to measure out a spoonful , or I 'm on the go , then I will eat a packet . If I 'm going to put the Coromega in a yogurt at home , then I will use some of the big bag .	1
The timing is funny . Just the other day I was checking out Coromega 's website , to see if they had any new offerings . Then , this selection came up on Vine , and I nabbed it.Personally , I alternate various types of fish oil . When I finish one bottle of capsules , I 'll try a bottle of the liquid . With so little known scientifically about which types/combinations/ratios are best , I figure I will hedge my bets with the variety . I take these products for brain health and anti-inflammatory benefits . Americans in general are woefully deficient in Omega-3s and suffering from a surplus of Omega-6s.I purchased the individual foil packets of Coromega ( orange ) because I was traveling a lot , and the little packets provided a very handy way to make sure I kept up the Omega-3 habit on the road . I also liked the taste , reminding me of my favorite childhood frozen treat : Orange Dreamsicles.My husband , on the other hand , avoids any type of omega-3 supplement . He either does n't like the taste or texture of the liquid preparations , or he just does n't consistently take the capsules . He would n't even taste the Coromega orange because he knew it was & # 34 ; medicinal & # 34 ; and contained fish oil . If I 'd drizzled it on his oatmeal or toast , without telling him what it was , he probably would have loved it . I 'm not sneaky like that , but the point is what he fears something will taste like often determines how he approaches it.With this Big Squeeze , I 'm delighted to have a ready source of omega-3 to use in various ways -- straight from a spoon , on toast , etc . I wish there did n't need to be so many extra ingredients , but there seems no getting around it . I 've tried other liquid fish oils , and even the orange/lemon-flavored ones have a certain viscosity that most people just wo n't tolerate . Plus the fishiness.With this product , it just tastes like thick mango juice to me . I detect absolutely nothing & # 34 ; fishy & # 34 ; -- and I have fairly refined tastebuds.It would be nice it Coromega were more forthcoming with information about its products . Roaming around the website , I found it almost impossible to identify the DHA/EPA ratio for any of the products . I 'd also like to see the independent lab certification it claims to have . But all in all , this seems like a good choice for people who ca n't or wo n't swallow capsules or consume less tasty fish oil.One important caveat : More is not better when it comes to fish oil ( and many other supplements ) . There are very real side effects and adverse outcomes to over-doing it .	1
I have tried several of these Coromega products with varying degrees of success but this one I liked very much . I love Mango and the mixture of Mango Nectar in this product is great tasting both while drinking and the aftertaste ( which is the most important to me because it will be hanging in my mouth for a while ) . As far as the Omega 3 did not notice any changes but did not think that I would.Would get again !	1
I think this is a great way to get your daily dose of Omega 3 . I have been taking the pills daily and really dislike the fish aftertaste that you usually end up getting after taking those . With this you can jus use a spoon and take by itself or mix it in with a protein shake or a smoothie . The taste on these is a lot better than what I expected them to be and is not really too bad . I really like the lemon better than this one but I would definetly use this flavor again . It kind of really depends on what you are mixing it in with as well as it adds a little flavor to your drinks .	1
Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 , Mango Nectar is a big pouch of concentrated mango flavored goop . It is pretty thick in consistency and by itself it tastes like mango I wiped with fried mackerel skins . True to the advertisement , there is not much aftertaste at least . I find that in a 12 ounce or larger smoothie , a tbsp or less of this stuff will go mostly unnoticed and make a positive contribution in sweetness and thickening .	1
I used to take my Coromega in theSqueeze Packetsbecause I worked outside of the home . Now that I work from home I am taking advantage of the Big Squeeze form of Coromega . It is a little messier than the packets because air can build in the pouch when you shake it up , when you squeeze it out it can splatter some of the product out . This is very annoying , wasteful & messy . I make a point to be as careful as possible & always squeeze it out over the sink.Onto the flavor . I think it tastes great for what it is ! - So far lemon is my favorite out of all the flavors I 've tried.Can you taste the fish ? I do n't think you can actually taste it as much as you can smell it . The way our senses are I believe it is the smell that we perceive as the taste . I 've swore I could taste fish before taking a dose yet while it 's in my mouth all I taste is sweetness & the faint taste of mango . If you are concerned about this , I highly recommend eitherWholemegaorGreen Pasture 's ( best & most expensive ) .Coromega claims you can add this to smoothies & yogurt etc . Personally , I just take it as is . If you are worried about disgusting fish burps , never fear , I have never experienced fish burps in all the years I 've been taking Coromega , no matter what flavor .	1
I love strong fish flavor like salmon or trout . After reading the reviews of those who found the Coromega either had a fish taste or an aftertaste , I wondered how it would taste to me . I take Omega 3 fish oil capsules daily without any taste . So I tried the Mango because I love fresh fruit.It was barely sweet , thick ( like a smoothie ) drink . I did taste a little fish . For me it was a fruit drink after I added sugar . I then tried it as an additive to home made lemonade and the taste was much better .	1
Let 's face it , taking vitamins is n't always pleasant . Sometimes they taste terrible , sometimes they do n't work , and they never seem to last that long even when you buy them in bulk with the best of intentions.I 've had Coromega 's products before , in little pouches , and was pleasantly surprised by them . Because they specialize in Omega 3 's they seem to do a good job with their products . This one had a little different of a serving format that I actually think I prefer . Instead of little disposable packets , this is one bit packet that you can squeeze out of a nozzle at the top . This means you can give yourself as much or little as you would like and squeeze into either a glass or spoon for intake ( or if you 're gross like me straight into your mouth ) .I 've tried this a few ways and taking it from the spoon was pretty smooth . I also had it mixed in a smoothie with successful results . The one way I tried it that was not successful was to just put it in the bottom of a glass and adding juice . It formed into this hard white stuff that I ca n't compare on here without setting off filters and was completely unappetizing . I do n't recommend using it that way at all.The taste was good . It did n't really taste like mango per say , but it was sweet without being overwhelmingly so . There was a little bit of sour , almost like a citrus after taste . But it was palatable and did n't have that fishy after taste that so many Omega 3 supplements seem to have.I would n't definitely continue to use this product for my Omega 3 supplement . It 's convenient and it tastes good.Review by M. Reynard 2014	1
I tried the Coromega Big Squeeze Omega Lemon Nectar and really ( surprisingly ) liked it . I have to say this is a really good flavor too , but the lemon was even better . I guess this is a personal preference if one likes the taste of mango or lemons better . The taste of the fish oil is slightly noticeable , but is tasty enough to take without that being a real problem.My 4 year old son also agrees with my tastes . My son would gladly take the lemon nectar , but this one he is n't as thrilled with . He actually does n't even want to take it at all anymore .	1
I recently tried the orange variety of this brand and I was not impressed ( it tasted like a fish jumped into a pina colada ) , so I was a little hesitant to see if this one was going to be good or not . I was pleasantly surprised . It definitely has a strong mango flavor with only a slightly noticeably after taste . It is very sweet ( sweetened with xylitol in case that causes anyone digestive issues ) . I like that it also contains vitamin D3 in addition to the fish oil . I thought that it had a nice flavor and even my kids were willing to take it without complaint . The pouch makes it easy to dispense and it 's a convenient size to be able to just tuck and squeeze it into the refrigerator ( it needs to be refrigerated after opening ) .	1
Straight from the pouch ? NO ! I recently purchased some store brand milk that had Omega 3 . I had tried the Horizon Organic Milk with DHA , I expected them to taste the same.The store brand had a strong fish smell and taste , YUK ! All I could use it for was a tuna casserole.While this Big Squeeze is n't nearly as strong as the milk , it does have a slight taste I do n't care for . So I tried it in a banana orange smoothie.Easy way to boost your smoothie , it was n't noticeable at all .	1
Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 , Mango Nectar , has a pretty good taste . The flavor of this product used alone is n't bad at all . This flavor also works very well when mixing it with juice or smoothies . I like how much better this liquid formula is absorbed into the body for optimum performance . I often enough a smoothie for breakfast or an afternoon snack . What better way is there to remember you take your Omega 3 supplement than just adding it to the mix ? The mango seems to be my favorite flavor variety of this product !	1
I have been taking coromega by packet for about a year , and it 's very convenient.Coromega Omega-3 Supplement , Orange Flavor , Squeeze Packets , 90-Count BoxI recently changed my diet to paleo , and bumped up my intake from 2 packets a day to 4-6 a day . The packets do n't really have a lot of the EPA and DHA.The packets do n't have a fishy taste , and they are very well metered , if you tolerate 2 packs with every meal , then you 're golden.I was concerned with the packets , as 6 packets a day in the trash seems a bit needless , vs softgels or taking flavored oil by spoon.I saw they have a product out ( This one . ) with D3 , and in this packaging , which seems a bit more responsible.Ok , the taste is pretty good , texture is a bit thick . ( After a couple of days , you get used to the taste , even look forward to it . ) There is a couple of tricks to not have aftertaste : Eat something before and after . I know it sounds intuitive , but I mean immediately before . If there 's any taste of food in your mouth before you take it , there wont really be much aftertaste , if any . Remember what you ate immediately before it , if there 's aftertaste , try eating something else before it next time.I notice that if I do n't measure it , I just take more , and it 's a good way of taking more . I have taken quite a bit of it at a time , and noticed zero digestive upset , but that may be the paleo diet I 'm on making me better at digesting fats.It 's to coromega 's credit that the only product I 've found to compete with their packets is this product , and after a week of use , I have grown to like it better than the packets . I will continue to get the packets as well , they are just so convenient for work.If you get gelcaps the oil could be poor quality ( Getting burps a lot with the gelcaps . ) or it could be rancid . How would you know ? With coromega you know it 's good , because I 'm pretty sure rancid fish oil would make me retch immediately . I never get any sort of repeat with the coromega products I 've tried ( I think they get absorbed more easily . ) .On delivery : As an aside , I thought I 'd be frugal , and get my next order from coromega to save a couple bucks . It 's been a week , and my order is still 'pending ' . Amazon spoils me with some ridiculously fast ship times .	1
Coromega offers a kid-friendly way to get relatively high dosages of EPA and DHA . They claim 300 % better absorption than traditional fish oil pills . I have been giving my daughterCoromega Heart Omega 3 Squeeze Juicy Orange , Packets 30 Eachwith Coenzyme Q10 on the advice of her integrative neurodevelopmental pediatrician . This Coromega product has Vitamin D rather than the CoQ10 so I will need to give the CoQ10 separately until I use up this bag . It contains 45 2-tsp servings total.When I ordered the `` Big Squeeze '' , I had imagined it would be a single-serving smoothie but it turned out to be just an eco-friendly alternative to the single-dose packets I 've been giving . The advantage is that it uses far less packaging . The disadvantage is that once opened , the entire bag needs to be refrigerated and used up fairly quickly , while the individual packets will last for months . The flavor is ok but not as good as the `` Juicy Orange '' flavor , which tastes like a creamsicle.I 'm a big fan of Coromega products , but I do n't think I 'll be switching to this `` Big Squeeze '' .	1
1 serving of 2 tsp ( 10 ml ) of Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 contain the amount of EPA ( 540 mg ) and DHA ( 360 mg ) recommended for daily consumption . It is better than the Lovaza medication , which contains 465 mg of EPA and 375 mg of DHA in 1-gram capsules . Omega-3 fatty acids are vital for normal metabolism , but some of the potential health benefits of their supplementing are controversial . Common sources of animal omega-3 include many fish , seafood and some plant oils . Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 is the best source of omega-3 for those who do not eat food naturally containing it .	1
The timing is funny . Just the other day I was checking out Coromega 's website , to see if they had any new offerings . Then , this selection came up on Vine , and I nabbed it.Personally , I alternate various types of fish oil . When I finish one bottle of capsules , I 'll try a bottle of the liquid . With so little known scientifically about which types/combinations/ratios are best , I figure I will hedge my bets with the variety . I take these products for brain health and anti-inflammatory benefits . Research indicates that Americans in general are woefully deficient in Omega-3s and suffering from a surplus of Omega-6s.Years ago , I purchased the individual foil packets of Coromega ( orange ) because I was traveling a lot ; the little packets provided a very handy way to make sure I kept up the Omega-3 habit on the road . I also liked the taste , reminding me of my favorite childhood frozen treat : Orange Dreamsicles.My husband , on the other hand , avoids any type of omega-3 supplement . He either does n't like the taste or texture of the liquid preparations , or he just does n't consistently take the capsules . He would n't even taste the Coromega orange packets because he knew it was & # 34 ; medicinal & # 34 ; and contained fish oil . If I 'd drizzled it on his oatmeal or toast , without telling him what it was , he probably would have loved it . I 'm not sneaky like that , but the point is what he fears something will taste like often determines how he approaches it.With this Big Squeeze , I 'm delighted to have a ready source of omega-3 to use in various ways -- straight from a spoon , on toast , etc . I wish there did n't need to be so many extra ingredients , but there seems no getting around it . I 've tried other liquid fish oils , and even the orange/lemon-flavored ones have a certain viscosity that most people just wo n't tolerate . Plus the fishiness.With this product , it just tastes like thick orange juice to me . I detect absolutely nothing & # 34 ; fishy & # 34 ; -- and I have fairly refined tastebuds.My husband , on the other hand , is still reluctant . He 's gotten down two spoonsful , but only when I put it in front of his nose . And that 's as many times as I 'm willing to try to encourage the habit . Now he 's on his own ! All in all , this seems like a good choice for people who ca n't or wo n't swallow capsules or consume less tasty fish oil.One important caveat : More is not better when it comes to fish oil ( and many other supplements ) . There are very real side effects and adverse outcomes to over-doing it .	1
I have never used this brand before and was pleasantly suprised that it tasted so well . I have bought others that I took one taste and dumped it out in the sink . The Omega 3 , Vitamin D3 etc in this product is hard to review as far as the advantages of better health I have not noticed any difference but then again I have never noticed any difference as far as better health in other products too.So for the taste , which is the most important part for me , it is a thumbs up.Would buy in the future !	1
I have recently needed to add about 3000 mg of Omega-3 to my diet daily . I have a huge issue with taking pills ( and keeping them down ) so I needed something other than fish oil pills.I have been taking Omega 3 gummy fish ( which are delicious ! ) but did not provide enough Omega 3s . This smoothie is delicious , goes down easily , and has not fishy aftertaste . I bought this at Vitamin Shoppe , where is was $ 16 with a $ 3 , so overall , the price was excellent . I highly recommend this for anyone who needs high doses of Omega 3 but does not want to deal with fish oil pills .	1
Admission : I 've been a fan of Coromega 's products for years , ever since my optometrist first suggested that I take fish oil capsules on a daily basis to help ward off the effects of macular degeneration . That was enough to send me scurrying for a number of bottles of capsules as a remedy , but soon I found that many caused a problem with which many will be familiar : fish oil burps.Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 , Tropical Orange Nectar with Vitamin D3 , 16 Ounceis the latest product from this company that I have tried , and from the package description it seems to have all of the right ingredients . It has omega-3 , Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , vitamin D3 , which are all of the right ingredients in this type of supplement , and the `` fish oil is sourced from small , sustainable fish from deep , cold water . `` Raised a slightly skeptical eye when I noticed that the low-calorie sweetener xylitol was the third item listed in the ingredients on the package . It 's an ingredient reputed to prevent tooth decay rather than cause it , and often derived from the bark of the birch tree . On the downside , it can cause some temporary gastrointestinal side effects in some ( gas , bloating , diarrhea , etc . ) and xylitol has been established as toxin to dogs , of all things . Your physical reactions may differ.This is a product that I really wanted to like , as omega-3 has anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties . It 's been proven to be good for your vision , brain , heart , skin , joints , and helps lower bad cholesterol levels among other things . In short , the right daily dose is good for just about every single part of your body . It protects your vision and is known to help push back the effects of AMD ( Age-Related Macular Degeneration ) . It 's effective in joint lubrication , decreasing inflammation , and is noted for fighting wrinkles . And since omega-3 reduces triglycerides and boosts levels of HDL ( the good cholesterol ) , it helps the heart . In keeping your arteries clear , you 're immediately improving brain function , along with alter your neurotransmitters to help reduce depression.Have been taking this Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 Tropical Orange Nectar supplement for almost a month now . Refrigerated it immediately and the next morning tried a single teaspoon , finding it to have a creamy texture , not altogether unpleasant , but with a slightly fishy aftertaste , which was surprising . Have since switched to taking it in the recommended two-teaspoon doses mixed in with my breakfast yogurt , which seems to help . But speaking subjectively , is it as good as the other products available in packets from this company that I 've been taking for years ? No . Why ? Because it gives me gas , which does n't occur with their other products.Up front I 'll rate this one with the other Coromega products that I 've used : Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 , Tropical Orange & # 9658 ; Coromega Omega-3 Fish Oil , Lemon Lime Squeeze Packets : 5-stars & # 9658 ; Coromega Omega-3 Supplement , Orange Flavor Squeeze Packets : 5-stars & # 9658 ; Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 , Tropical Orange Nectar : 3-starsI have separately reviewed all of the above product over time.Should you want to read up a bit on the advantages of the fish oil supplements and their effects on the body , you can tryDHA : The Essential Omega-3 Fatty Acid ( 1998 ) by author Remi Cooper , who explains it clearly in a 32-page booklet . It 's an older book , but the information was invaluable to me when reading up on the benefits of omega-3 after my initial scare regarding macular degeneration. & # 9670 ; Summary : ThisCoromega Big Squeeze Omega 3supplement is probably a good product for some as a way to increase their daily intake of omega-3 , which can also be found naturally in a variety of foods that include tuna , salmon , avocados , olive oil , and walnuts . Once finished , I probably not reorder this product but will stick to the two versions from Coromega available in packets as noted above . Those two are highly recommended.JW & # 9642 ; 1/24/2014	1
I used to take my Coromega in theSqueeze Packetsbecause I worked outside of the home . Now that I work from home I am taking advantage of the Big Squeeze form of Coromega . It is a little messier than the packets because air can build in the pouch when you shake it up , when you squeeze it out it can splatter some of the product out . I make a point to be as careful as possible & always squeeze it out over the sink just in case I have an accident.Onto the flavor . I think it tastes great for what it is ! The Tropical Orange Nectar flavor seems to be the sweetest with the least amount of fish smell & /or taste . Out of all the flavors I 've had lemon is my favorite . Chocolate Orange my least favorite.Can you taste the fish ? I do n't think you can actually taste it as much as you can smell it . The way our senses are I believe it is the smell that we perceive as the taste . I 've swore I could taste fish before taking a dose yet while it 's in my mouth all I taste is sweetness & the faint taste of mango . If you are concerned about this , I highly recommend eitherWholemegaorGreen Pasture 's ( best & most expensive ) .Coromega claims you can add this to smoothies & yogurt etc . Personally , I just take it as is . If you are worried about disgusting fish burps , never fear , I have never experienced fish burps in all the years I 've been taking Coromega , no matter what flavor .	1
I love strong fish flavor like salmon or trout . After reading the reviews of those who found the Coromega either had a fish taste or an aftertaste , I wondered how it would taste to me . I take Omega 3 fish oil capsules daily without any taste . So I tried the Orange Nectar because I love fresh fruit.It was the flavor of an orange pushup . I did not taste fish and I did not have any after taste . Guess that shows we all have varied tastes and are sensitive to the same item in different ways . This is definitely a more appealing way to get my fish but it is more expensive .	1
The concept to this product is not something you see very often . A liquid vitiamin that can be taken almost any way you can think of.Being so much more convenient then a pill this product is perfect for the whole family . You can store it in the pantry till your ready to open it . Then once you open it , you can store it in the fridge for a fairly lengthy time.It has a very nice flavor overall , and if your looking for an alternative to pills or even gummies then give this a try.Recommended !	1
I do not eat enough fish as I should so something like this is really good me . The taste is alright , orange with a hint of pineapple and an even smaller hint of actual fish . The product , which two teaspoons daily is enough , can be eat straight from the spoon and squeezed into your favorite drink . I ended putting mine in water which did make it taste a bit watered down in a full cup . My one complaint is that it expires fairly quickly . I was the only one to use it and I used it daily but still had about a fourth left by the time it expired .	1
This reminds me of the times where I drank cod-liver oil and then there is an alternative to the cod-liver oil disguise with orange-y taste.Yes , the nectar does cover the 'fishy ' taste , but only on the initial tasting , but there is still a strong after taste of the 'fishy-ness ' of the omega 3.Overall , an alternative way to getting your omega3 - by drinking it !	1
Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 , Tropical Orange Nectar with Vitamin D3 , has a lot of great nutrition inside giving you lots and lots of Omega 3 and Vitamin D3 . If you only got your Omega 3 's from this product or just your Vitamin D3 you 'd be getting one powerful product . Here you are getting both ! Being liquid in form , it 's easier for your body to absorb those nutrients.The more we hear about Omega 3 's , the more important it is for us to make sure we get it in our diets .	1
I tasted the orange version of this and found it too sweet and gritty . This lemon version is very similar in texture but for some reason the tart aftertaste is appealing . The fish aroma bites you the longer this stuff is in your mouth , and I recommend you swallow it quickly . The packaging is convenient for crowded cupboards , but make sure the top is tightly in place . This is n't bad as an alternative for fish oil tablets .	1
When I first read about the Coremega Big Squeeze I was quite interested , especially the fact that it was in liquid form . I got the old measuring spoon out and was ready to give it a go . Two teaspons and you have all the fish oil you need for the day . This is a perfect way to get your omega 3 in , especially if you have difficulty swallowing pills . I do n't , but I do know those gel capsules can be quite large.My taste test was a little less than optimal . The Coremega Big Squeeze had a lovely lemony look . In fact it was gorgeous . That 's as far as the lovely went . When I tasted it , I was scrambling for something to cover up the taste , a lingering one . The Coremega will have to be `` disguised '' for many people . My favorite is to disguise less-than-tasty necessities in yogurt , but yours might be a smoothy . Great concept though and I do like it , but definitely not loving it.FEATURES : & # 9658 ; 3000mg Fish Oil over 1000mg Omega3 per dose & # 9658 ; Molecularly distilled for purity & # 9658 ; Sugar free , sweetened with xylitol & # 9658 ; Advanced packaging & # 9658 ; Delicious taken by spoon , mixed with yogurt or blended into a smoothieINGREDIENTS : Fish oil , water , xylitol , glycerine , gum arabic , natural lemon flavor , citric acid , guar gum , xanthan gum , natural peach flavor , ascorbyl palmitate , potassium sorbate , d-alpha tocopherol , turmeric root extract.SUPPLEMENT FACTS ( Abbreviated ) : Serving Size : 2 Teaspoons ( 10 mL ) Servings per Container : 45Calories : 40Calories from fat : 30Total Fat : 3gSaturated fat : 1gTrans fat : 0gCholesterol : 15mgTotal Carbohydrate : 4gVitamin E : 6 IUFish oil : 3000mgLong Chain Omega-3 Fatty Acids 1050mgEPA 540 mgDHA 360 mgCOROMEGA BIG SQUEEZE OMEGA 3 : Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 , Tropical Orange Nectar with Vitamin D3Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 , Mango NectarCoromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 , Lemon NectarCoromega Omega-3 Supplement , Orange Flavor , Squeeze Packets	1
I love strong fish flavor like salmon or trout . After reading the reviews of those who found the Coromega either had a fish taste or an aftertaste , I wondered how it would taste to me . I take Omega 3 fish oil capsules daily without any taste . So I tried the Lemon because I love lemonade and lemon pepper on fish and chicken.The lemon was not acidy or sharp . It was more like lemon pie filling- smooth . I did not taste fish and I did not have any after taste . Guess that shows we all have varied tastes and are sensitive to the same item in different ways . This is definitely a more appealing way to get my fish but it is more expensive .	1
My doc has told me that I need to start taking Omega-3 fish oil tablets now that I 've reached & # 34 ; that age & # 34 ; and am on cholesterol lowering meds . I 've absolutely hated the big tablets he recommends and find the aftertaste off-putting.The Coromega Big Squeeze Omega-3 that is Lemon flavored has made this new regimen much more palatable . You can add it to juice or stir some in yogurt but I just take a couple of spoonsful . I 've noticed that some reviewers say they can still taste a hint of fishy essence but I have not noticed it.One 16-oz pouch gives you about 45 2-tsp servings yielding 3,000mg of long chain Omega-3 fatty acids each . I find this an easy way to take your medicine .	1
I 've been using Coromega in squeeze packs for years , but only the orange . The orange flavor is surprisingly good , with no trace of fishy flavor . The Big Squeeze is a different packaging of the same product , which makes it easier to add to shakes , though it can also be measured out in a spoon and taken pure.So , how is the lemon nectar flavor ? It 's ... weird . The primary flavor is very similar to the lemon filling in a donut , and that also describes the consistency . Unfortunately , unlike the orange , there is a very mild fishy aftertaste . I think it is masked enough to not be an issue if you are mixing it into a smoothie . For taking by itself as a supplement , I suggest the orange flavor .	1
I have to admit when I first got this I was n't sure if I was going to like it . The thought of taking fish oil with lemon nectar that comes in a big squeezable bag , which is taken from a spoon does n't seem too appetizing . But surprisingly , it really is tasty . The fish taste is hardly noticeable and the lemon nectar is really rich and creamy , so it is more like drinking Lemon Meringue Pie . This really is good stuff and I am very happy with it .	1
I really love the taste of Coromega Big Squeeze Omega 3 , Lemon Nectar . It is actually a bit like a lemon pudding in taste and texture . Very smooth and creamy . There was n't even a hint of fish or plastic flavor nor was there any fishy aftertaste . I 'm not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about . What a great way to get lots and lots of Omega 3 's into your body !	1
I am pleased with the insert if you need extra arch support or a slight lift this is the item for you .	1
I did n't want to spend $ 40-for inserts ( as I had in the past ) . These inserts work just as good as , or better , than professional ones I had done . Plus , they are reasonable enough for me to have them in all my walking shoes . Great buy , good quality , good performance .	1
Realized I have been falling in my yard because of other inserts that were turning my feet further out . These are great . Need to break in by wearing short time at first then build up . Really sturdy !	1
I like that they are 3/4 length . They stay in place better than the smaller inserts . I do wish they were a bit wider . Definitely a medium width & would work well in women 's dress shoes but they are still working good for me underneath the original shoe insoles .	1
Really helped with my supination problem . Worth the money ! Thanks ! I would buy theses aha in in the near future .	1
I was pleased to find these as they are no longer available locally . I have used these for years and years . They always wash up nicely . Just perfect for those non-stick pans and finer pieces of dishware .	1
I 've been looking for these for years and finally found them . They do the job but they do n't last long . The sponge slowly flattened and separated . I think i used it for a week or two then had to throw it away . My family is a medium size family 4 kids so there 's always dishes to do . Other wards it 's a great product I 'm sure I 'll order then again cause the price is goods for dozen .	1
Chose these pads as they were getting difficult to find in stores . However , once I found a dozen of them on Amazon I bought them for price of 3 or 4 in a store . They soap up well , easy on earth ware and Teflon finishes , and they last .	1
I ca n't find these in the store anymore so was thrilled to find them on Amazon . I use them to clean my bathroom and then I throw them in the washing machine . So far I reuse them with no problem .	1
These are so much better then just popping tums . Great product and you should give them a try . Great idea !	1
Tums have had the novel idea of mixing breath mint and antacid . And the idea really works.Gone are the traditional chalky tastes and textures , and say hello to a refreshing mint ! I 've used these several times , they work great , taste great , and they get the job done . What more can you ask for ?	1
The regular chalky Tums work well enough , but when I get heartburn after lunch at work , I like to pop a couple of these instead . They might be a little more expensive than the normal Tums , but they seem to work just as well . Gets rid of heartburn , and your mouth does n't smell like something died in it . It 's a win-win !	1
5 stars Mom likes these Dulcolax tablets.As a gift for your mom or dad it is great and the price is right.I recommend these for the slow digestion people .	1
It is really works . I take it before bed time - when I need it - and everything is sorted out the next morning . There can be minor tummy discomfort ( like an intense churning ) just before you wake up but it 's temporary - and in my opinion , always worth it .	1
Quite frankly , I had forgotten the the 'for smokers ' aspect of this while quickly putting an order of items in some weeks back . I am a smoker , however -- and do n't notice any difference in this versus the regular Polident tablets . That 's probably because I use a brush on my dentures every morning , after thoroughly rinsing off cleanser residue anyway -- just because I do n't like any slimy feeling on my dentures at the start of my day . I do like it ... and the 84-count means fewer mail orders .	1
If you do this gets rid of the stain all of them coffee too.I would recommend to everyone smoke or not|	1
Over several years and trial and error with several Denture Cleaners I 've found that Polident Smokers Cleanser really does the best and fastest job of cleaning . I do n't just use it for cleaning my dentures however , I also use it to clean the coffee stains which are unavoidable in a glass coffee maker caraffe . I fill the pot with hot water ( run a caraffe of water through the coffee maker to heat ) , then I drop in a couple of Polident tablets and within a short time I have a sparking clean glass caraffe .	1
Polident Smokers is great for anyone with dentures . It cleans great , smells wonderful . It makes your dentures lool like new .	1
For the past twelve years I have suffered with sciatica condition . No number of therapies or alternative medicine could give me the kind of relief this mat and pillow gave me . I would sleep on a $ 4000 tempurpedic and wake up with bad back and neck ache . Also after a severe concussion on my head last year things went from bad to worse . My accupucnturist bless her soul , helped me a lot but the problem lingered . Then I decided to give this mat and pillow a try and viola ! Here I am doing things I was n't able to do for a long time . I love taking my daughter on long bike rides , I play with her more now and now she has 100 % of her mommy with her . God I want to weep with joy . So yes , it is a little thorny but you know what it works . Do not think twice if you are in the same boat as mine Just buy it !	1
I ordered this after trying some other products to help deal with chronic neck pain and insomnia . I have to say , for the price ... its well worth a try . I like to try alternative methods of dealing with pain.Product arrived promptly . It is as pictured , a small neck roll and body mat . It comes with clear instructions for use . Both pieces are covered with small , hard plastic spikes . It can be used on your bed or on the floor for firmer support . I have tried both places . It also comes with a sturdy zippered plastic storage bag , and can be rolled up and stored easily in a closet.At first , I found it incredibly painful . The hard plastic spikes really dug into my neck . An elderly person with thin skin or anyone with any skin irritation should NOT use it without covering the mat and neck roll with a thin cloth ! I readjusted the neck roll until I found it bearable to lay on . After a minute or two of consciously trying to relax and breath deeply , I did tolerate it fairly well.I must say , it did certainly help the neck pain temporarily . I suspect it has nothing whatsoever to do with acupressure , though . I believe it stimulates the body 's production of endorphins , which are natures powerful pain reliever . ( Endorphins are among the brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters , which function to transmit electrical signals within the nervous system . At least 20 types of endorphins have been demonstrated in humans . Endorphins can be found in the pituitary gland , in other parts of the brain , or distributed throughout the nervous system.Stress and pain are the two most common factors leading to the release of endorphins . I personally think that the minor pain and stimulation of the hard plastic spikes in the product against your skin stimulte endorphin release . Endorphins interact with the opiate receptors in the brain to reduce our perception of pain and act similarly to drugs such as morphine and codeine . In contrast to the opiate drugs , however , activation of the opiate receptors by the body 's endorphins does not lead to addiction or dependence . ) However it works , it does work as a pain reliever temporarily . I was pain free for at least a few hours aftewards , which makes it well worth the small price in my mind . However , it has had no effect on my insomnia issues at all.I am using it in the morning to deal with the morning pain and stiffness , and at night , for 10-15 minutes at a time . I find it helpful to engage in deep breathing and mediation during this time.Overall good product if you are careful to cover it as needed if you have any condition of your skin that might put you at risk for severe irritation from the plastic spikes .	1
I purchased a similar item a few years back but ended up giving it to my mother , who enjoyed borrowing it frequently . We both suffer from pretty constant tension in the neck and upper back . I like the Zensufu item because it has the head pillow , which has quickly become my favorite portion . Honestly , I use the mat mostly for standing/marching on because I have sore feet quite often , but it is certainly as expected when I use it on the rest of my body . Acupressure is n't enjoyable for everyone , I know , but as one who does receive relief from it I found this item to be fairly priced and the delivery time quick .	1
I have chronic lower back pain , I 'm on pain medication as well as see a pain specialist for injections , so when I read all the wonderful reviews , I was so hopeful that I had found the answer to all my pain . However after a couple of weeks , I still dread laying on it although after a couple minutes ( if I hold still ) , the pain eases , but the only benefit I think I have gotten is that I do seem to sleep better.. I did n't buy it for that , but I 'm happy to get some benefit for the cost of this mat . My husband ca n't stand to lay on it even with his clothes on , and he 's 6'4 & # 34 ; and a tough guy by nature , but his opinion of the mat is that I 'm torturing myself by laying on a mat full of golf shoe spikes , and he refuses to do that.LOL ..To give you an idea of the pain , I take morphine for my pain , and i still ca n't get as excited as all the other reviewers seem to be . But I wish you well if you do buy this mat , maybe I am just too sensative .	1
Same as the bed of nails but with better packaging . Useful for back issue 's or just general tightness , hurts like the world is ending but just lay and read or listen to a few songs and get your mind on something else , it 's good for you .	1
I was skeptical at first , but liked it as soon as I tried it . It creates a relaxing sensation after only a few minutes .	1
I just submited a review of the spiky back mat and neglected to tive it my star rating which is 5 .	1
So I 've never used anything like this before , and thus suggest you read this with that as an understanding . This thing is odd . It 's a plastic bed of spikes on little quarter sized plastic tabs . They are about 1mm - 2mm long . You lie on them and allegedly they cause trigger points to become active , causing back tension to improve . I ca n't tell if it works yet , but it sure does , feel odd . Hey , it was cheap , if it works it is a steal.It 's been a few months since I bought this thing . At first I just could n't get used to laying on it , tried it a few times and threw it in the back of my closet . Well I read more about it , and the more I read , the more I realized I did n't give it the old college try , so I got it back out , gritted my teeth , girded my loins ( and so on ) and tried it again . After a few minutes a day , gradually increasing my time by 2-3 mins . Per day ( with a t-shirt on ) I got to removing my shirt , and it was n't bothering me anymore . Instead , the oddest thing , It started WORKING ! I lie on it for about 10-15 mins . A day now , and I feel much better . My stiff back has loosened up . My energy level seems up . And yes , I 'm sleeping better . I 'm a skeptic and I feel I have a high tolerance for what is `` effective , '' on me ( for example over-the-counter sleeping tablets do n't seem to do a darn thing ) . Well this device really does seem to help me relax , feel better , and is n't so bad as many people - myself included - make it out to be . You just need to give it a shot . I would n't recommend it to my grandmother , and my wife ca n't hack the feeling , she says it hurts . Well , having broken my collar bone , I can say it does n't `` hurt , '' it just takes some getting used to , and once you do , it really does work . I 'm amazed .	1
This is a great acupressure mat ! I bought this a few months ago after a friend recommended I check out acupressure to help with back and neck discomfort . I sit at a computer all day and even being ergonomically correct does n't completely keep away the pain . I have been using this mat about 4-5 days a week . I typically do an hour of yoga each weekday morning and then finish my routine with about 20-30 minutes of time on this mat . It really seems to put my whole body into a better position and I have not been experiencing the pain at the end of the workday like I was before . It seems to be well made , which is wonderful , since I will be using it a lot ! Great product , and the price is worth every penny to be pain free !	1
I got this as a gift and ca n't wait to use it . My boyfriend tried it out and says it really helped his blood flow . It worked just like it said it would in the instructions .	1
After my stroke last year , I had consistently pain in my left side of my neck and my left shoulder blade.When you lay down at first it is uncomfortable , But after a few minutes you do n't feel the spikes anymore.After about 10 minutes the pain in my neck and shoulder blade was gone ! It works really great ! Worth the money and the initial discomfort.I recommend it highly .	1
At first laying on this mat without a shirt was a mind challenge but we have worked up to laying on it without a shirt and the benefits are amazing . It totally relaxed my tension headache and also the knots in my shoulders and back . We all liked it so much we bought one for our daughter who was at our holiday and used our mat . As a set it is perfect and works beyond words . My husband has cervical stenosis and his doctor told him to try it . The mat helps with the muscle spasms and is a wonderful daily regiment for him .	1
Before I bought this product , I read a lot of reviews on it and I am glad that I bought it . It has helped my insomnia .	1
I use this for all sorts of workouts tracked through digifit app on my iPod touch 5th generation . The Bluetooth feature works great . It also work good with my concept 2 rower and the ergdata app . I have not gotten it to work any of the gym link features because I track my workouts primarily through the iPod touch and the digifit ap and not cardio machines or watches.For my purposes it is nearly perfect . I 've only been using it for a month and have around 25 workouts on it . I will be happy if it last me more than a few year	1
Absolutely love my Polar heart rate sensor ! I wanted it so I could use the Polar app with my phone and map my routes , keep track of time , speed , pace , etc . I 've been using it for several months now and it still works great.I did recently have to change the battery but it was really easy . I especially like how it puts your workouts on the Polar site and let 's you play your runs back ... It was cool to be able to do after I ran my first 10K . I 'd definitely recommend !	1
provides great feedback to workout info . Heart rate information is invaluable as you intensify your workout program . Phone app , oplar loop and theis heart monitor provide great tracking of info . Very easy to sync	1
I got this heart rate monitor to use primarily with the Strava Cycling and Running apps on my iPhone 5.I have an AT & T ; iPhone 5 16GB . The HRM worked perfectly out of the box and Strava recognized it right away . I was also able to use the Wahoo Utility app to detect the HRM with no issues . Added bonus is the Matrix treadmills at my gym recognize the heart rate , so I can get real time feedback when I run indoors.The HRM is alot smaller than I expected - think smaller than a credit card ( but thicker ) , but its comfortable and gives accurate readings the whole time I 'm reading it . I usually wet the strap a bit before I start running and have n't had any issues yet . Very handy to use with your iPhone 5 .	1
I love this H7 as it works great with my iPod touch ( 5th generation ) and also my iPad ( 3rd generation ) . Both devices see the device . I am using the DigiFit app . You do not need to pair it like you would a normal bluetooth device via the settings screen . In fact , I could not get either device to see it as a bluetooth transmitter . But the app will find it . This thing worked perfectly and I can see my continual heart rate for as many minutes as I can ride . I bought the FT40 watch , but I decided to return it because the app works so well . BTW , you can get the CR2025 Maxell replacement batteries for about $ 2 for a 5 pack on Amazon .	1
After some initial setup confusion ( it does n't need to be paired with iphones like other Bluetooth devices -- and lacks an on/off switch ... . ) , I was able to use the H7 with my Strava Cycling app without any problems . And as an added bonus , it is recognized by several fitness machines at the Golds Gym . No complaints so far .	1
Easy to pair with any number of apps on my iPhone . I found battery life was n't too compromised running with this thing on and you can tie it to an ERG with the right accessory . This strap is n't uncomfortable at all , and seems to take fairly accurate numbers . Very happy with this purchase .	1
I love this toy so much . It 's basically two parts -- an elastic belt that goes around my chest and a transmitter that snaps onto the front . You wet the side of the belt that touches your chest , snap the transmitter into the front and you 're good to go . I like that better than the all in one units because when I am done with my workout I can unsnap the transmitter and be sure that the unit is off.This is compatible with regular 5 hz heart rate receivers , like the watch from my olderPolar FS2C , or the display unit on theVelocity Rowerthat I use , so I can use both of those to display my HR while exercising.What makes this awesome , though , is that it also broadcasts my heart rate over low energy bluetooth . The good news is that that 's a new bluetooth standard that uses less power than old bluetooth . The bad news is that it 's only compatible , as far as I know , with the iPhone 4S and the iPad 3 . It 's theoretically compatible with some of the newer android phones , which are low energy or `` smart '' bluetooth compatible , but from what I understand , those phones do n't have the drivers that they need to use this monitor at this time . ( Since that 's a software problem , I assume it will get fixed sooner or later , but have no idea when . ) I love using this with my iPhone and iPad . When running or biking , I use the RunKeeper app to track my hr and pace . When working out in my basement , I use DigiFit on my iPad - the screen shows me my current HR , average , what `` band '' I 'm in relative to my maximum heart rate and other stuff . Having that info displayed on the iPad helps me monitor and step up the intensity of my strength circuits and my rowing.Unlike some of the other reviewers , I have n't had any problems with pairing . The sensor paired the first time I tried . ( Note - you pair from inside the Runkeeper and DigiFit apps , not from the general settings screen . ) I love it , and highly recommended for people with the new iOS devices.Update 11/12/12 : after a few weeks , I noticed that when the Polar H7 is paired with both my iPhone and my iPad simultaneously , I get weird results -- occasionally , the iPad wo n't pair at all , or will give wild heart rate numbers . ( bouncing from 45 to 170 and back over the course of a minute . ) I solved the problem by going into my iPhone apps and depairing , or just turning off bluetooth on the iPhone during the workout . If you 're having problems , check to see if you might be paired simultaneously with more than one device .	1
Bought this to use it with the MapMyRun iphone app and it integrates perfectly . I play a lot of basketball and was a little concern if the bluetooth would work at a range of about 30-40ft . It worked perfectly , I could leave my iphone in my gym bag and it would pick up the signal with no problem . Bought a second one for the wife ans she likes it as well .	1
Excellent strap and sensor . I like that it comes off the strap . So much easier to clean.Worked with Galaxy S3 and the following Apps : Map My Fittness ( Run ) RunkeeperRuntasticPolar BeatsWould n't pair directly with the Galaxy S3 via the bluetooth pairing settings . However , each of the above apps had no problem picking up the strap . Works great with most gym equipment that is compatable.Very comfortable and consistent . The Polar Beats App you can download is actually pretty good app.Overall this is the best all around HR Strap . Highly recommend .	1
I got this Polar sensor to go with my NordicTrack exercise equipment . This sensor works well and has a high degree of accuracy and works well with my Galaxy S4 and my Nordic track equipment.The Polar H7 is compatible with a multitude of devices , gym equipment and smartphones including an Iphone.Features : Bluetooth Smart connectivityCompatible with gym equipmentEasy to pair and configureMy only complaint is the strap can be a little annoying but it more of a matter of getting use to wearing it and putting it in the correct place on your body.The downside here is that you can find this much cheaper elsewhere , 61 bucks is too much .	1
I 've been using Polar products for decades.This is a great sensor . I pair it with my iPhone , my loop , and one of my polar & # 34 ; watches & # 34 ; . It also syncs with my elliptical trainer , but for some reason the heart rate displays about 30bpm higher . I know that , so no big deal.The sensor snaps on and off the belt . I broke a snap and Polar sent me a new belt , no charge , within a week . Great customer service .	1
I am currently doing physical training at a CrossFit gym . I wanted to have some record of my exercise sessions at the gym and at home . I started with a heart rate watch but it did not appear to provide what I wanted . Then , I located this unit . With the BlueTooth connection coupled to the Polar Beat software on my iPad mini I have what I wanted.This unit is comfortable to wear during the workout and maintains the connection with my iPad across the gym room . If I am concerned about the heart rate I can step over to where I placed the iPad and check . Since I started using the iPad I noticed that my instructor is also checking my heart rate during the workout . That can be both good and bad . If he does n't think i am pushing enough he scolds me about it.At the end of the session I have a graph of the various levels during the workout and a summery for the week . I like this much better than the watch solution . Both require the chest strap but with this solution the watch is not there to catch on equipment and it my instructor can monitor during the workout . As it stands , I am very pleased with both the workout sessions and the heart rate monitor .	1
I extensively tested this heart rate monitor before posting this review . I have used it on a daily basis for almost two months for several activities and using several apps , always on an iPhone 5 . Some people have complained that it does n't pair/connect with their iPhones . As long as your iPhone has Bluetooth 4.0 ( a.k.a Bluetooth Smart ) , this device will work . That means iPhone 4S and newer . I noticed however , the pairing is not as straight forward as it is with other Bluetooth devices . You are supposed to download the free Polar App and pair The Heart Rate monitor using that app *instead* of through the iPhone Settings . There is *stealth* mode that I think is on by default and prevents the iPhone from finding the device . However , once you 've gone through the initial pairing process , the iPhone has no problem finding the heart rate monitor.This device works with several iOS apps including RunKeeper , the free Polar App ( Polar Beat ) , Endomondo and SportsTracker among others . It has never lost connection and you do n't need to get the band sensors wet for it to read your heart rate ( like with other monitors ) . I have n't changed the battery yet , but after two months of using it about 1 hr daily , I think it 's safe to say that battery life is excellent .	1
Works great with Iphone5 , keeps track of my HR and calories burned . an essential tool to get fit . Buy one is your serious	1
I use it almost daily for running and working out at the gym . It 's fabulous to be able to monitor my progress and keep tabs on my heart rate along the way . I highly recommend this product . Easy to use and simple to change the batteries .	1
I have n't taken this to the gym yet , but it works seemlessly with my polar loop fitness tracker . It syncs almost instantaneously . It 's as comfortable as any other HRM I 've worn and it picks up my heart rate quickly and consistently . I recommend .	1
This works great for the iPhone 5 . I use it with the Polar app with all the upgrades ( $ 5 ) . I use it while running and rowing . I like the voice feedback through the headphones so I can focus on my environment , not on my watch .	1
I needed a brand-independent heart monitor that would work with both my TomTom Runner GPS Watch and my iPhone 5 . After looking around for couple of days , I decided to take a chance with this device and am surely glad I did . My TomTom Runner GPS watch recognized it without a hitch . Same with my iPhone 5 running MapMyRun and Runtastic . I would highly recommend this heart monitor to those who need it to work with a variety of modern low-energy Bluetooth devices .	1
I had an ANT+ dongle on my last iPhone , but that would not work on an iPhone5 , so I had to discontinue using that and its matching sensor and bought this.It works very well with both Walkmeter/Runmeter and even works with the Wahoo program which sees it as a Wahoo HR Blue.The strap is very nice , and the plastic used on the unit is of very high quality.I wore it all night and have HR data from 9 hours of sleep.This device seems exceptional to me , and it is shame that people are giving it poor reviews simply because they do n't have a phone which is compatible with it.I am so happy to not have to use a dongle , and for the price this is selling for , I feel like I got a good value .	1
Guess its not in my throat , like I believed . Good product , wore it an entire day to get a baseline and then did some workouts with it . Syncs with my loop , easy as pie . ( Not sure why people are complaining , it syncs just being near it for me ) Strap is nice , probably going to get , nasty , but you can forget its there after awhile !	1
I LOVE this unit ! It 's easy to use and very comfortable to wear . It is extremely accurate and really helps me know where my heart rate is as I work out .	1
I 've used this smart HR sensor along with the app numerous times and it has been working well . The Bluetooth signal picks up quickly and monitors activity accurately .	1
I use this daily for my walks and workouts . It connects to my iPhone 5 , recording the information in either the Polar Beat app or Digifit . Other apps will also work but these are the two I use . I wish it would record in multiple apps simultaneously , but it has been a great help in learning how hard I can safely workout and in managing calories used during a workout . I do use an electrode gel on the strap for a good connection .	1
Digestive Advantage now has as assortment of these gummies , candies which contain supplements . This one contains probiotics.These have corn syrup , sugar , gelatin and citric acid to make them super chewy , as well as colorings and flavorings . They taste good and have a very satisfying chewiness.I would n't personally buy any type of supplement disguised in such unhealthful candy . I 'm not sure who this is marketed to . I 'm all for taking supplemental probiotics every day , but I 'm against corn syrup and sugar . This is my own personal bias , as someone who has been trying to eat more healthfully every day , after reading such books as & # 34 ; Sugar Addiction for Dummies & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; The China Study & # 34 ; , and other books that talk about how important nutrition is , including avoidance of certain foods . It 's so hard anymore to avoid corn syrup and sugar.However , I really like the way these taste as a candy . They remind me of Dots . They also unfortunately contain sorbital , something I have a very bad reaction to in my intestines , as do many people , since it is not absorbed or processed by the intestines at all.If you need probiotics it 's better to simply swallow a pill than eat a mouthful of corn syrup , sugar and sorbitol.I ca n't recommend these , and while I do recommend	1
These probiotic gummies must be by far the yummiest probiotic supplement out there.. ! ! ! I love them , and they really help my digestive system . I do n't like the lemon ones but my husband does , so it works out perfectly for us . LOLHighly recommend this product . I will continue buying it .	1
As someone who frequently needs probiotics , I can say that this product works as it is intended . Not only are these great for digestion , they taste good as well . When I have them sitting on top of my counter , it 's easy to remember to grab 2 of them each morning . Love them and will continue to purchase them .	1
I really like these probiotic gummies ! They have a great taste and they are easy to chew ! I find that when I take a probiotic , it helps my immune system as well . I do n't feel as rundown with my allergies , either . It does help maintain a healthy tummy . The directions state you should take 2-4 a day per adult . I thought you only took 1 . I only take the 3-4 a day when I 'm feeling really run down or have had an upset tummy and I 'm back to feeling good again the next day !	1
I 'm a firm believer in probiotics to aide in digestion and boost immunities . My husband and daughter suffer from a lot of gas and stomach bloating , food sensitivities , etc . So , I bought probiotic capsules for my husband and myself , but 2 of my 3 kids just ca n't make themselves take pills yet ! So , when I saw these probiotic gummies online , I thought I 'd give them a try . I was wary about how they would taste , but I should n't have been because my kids loved them ! In fact , I have to make sure to remind them that they 're NOT candy and must be limited ! I now keep these on hand & my kids take them daily and find that there 's a lot less gas and stomach issues in our house ! In fact , when my kids now mention that they 're stomachs & # 34 ; hurt , & # 34 ; I have them take a couple of probiotic gummies and this actually seems to really help relieve the problem ! One more note ... .I make sure to order extra bottles from Amazon because the last time I ran out , I thought & # 34 ; No problem , I know they have the gummies in drug stores ... & # 34 ; but , I was shocked by the price ! I can get double the amount of gummies from Amazon for the same price ( or less ) that the stores charge !	1
Frankly , these taste like candy . It 's like allowing yourself a gummi bear or two a day . But we all agreed ( 3 family members took it ) that it was having some effect on our digestive systems . But like the three bears , our responses were different - Everyone liked the taste , one said it had a barely noticeable difference on digestion , one found it too strong , and stopped , and the third found it just right - making the digestive process more regular and easy . I like the idea of probiotics , especially if you have just taken a course of antibiotics . If you 've never had probiotics , this might be a good place to start .	1
These work great . They help my boyfriend with lactose intolerance . I do n't know why , but if he takes two of these with a dairy meal , it will & # 34 ; neutralize & # 34 ; the effect of the dairy . I do n't know the exact science behind it , but it works for him , so that 's great . Just a little expensive . When I take them on a trip in a separate small container so I do n't have to bring the whole bottle and they are in there for a few days , I notice they tend to get stale and hard . They also smell a little weird . But overall , they are great so I am willing to overlook those things .	1
I have used four different probiotics and drank quite a bit of kefir in an effort to restore my guts to the state they were in before I had a few rounds of antibiotics last year . Because I have been using a number of different probiotics , I can not attribute my results to this probiotic , but I still recommend it for three reasons:1 . The gummies are tasty and convenient.2 . The probiotic that the gummies contain , Bacillus coagulans , is one that is known to survive the stomach and actually make it to the gut . ( This is the origin of the label claim versus yogurt. ) 3 . you can not have too many varieties of good bacteria in your gut.Although I am thrifty by nature , given that an unresolved GI situation will inevitably lead to costly medical attention in the future , I would recommend getting a number of different probiotics . I list four below that I have taken . We should not be penny wise and pound foolish.Here are the four different probiotics I 've tried . I have no idea which one is effective , but together they made a difference . Recent studies suggest that diversity in the gut may be important.1.THORNE RESEARCH - Bacillus Coagulans ( formerly Lactobacillus Sporogenes ) - 60'sIf you had to choose just one probiotic , I would go with this one . It 's cost effective , highly recommended and produced an immediate response.2.Digestive Advantage Daily Probiotic Capsules , Dietary Supplement , 30 CountSame manufacturer , same probiotic as the gummies ( and as # 1 above , Bacillus Coagulans ) , but in pill form.3.Acidophilus Plus Goat 's Milk - 200 - CapsuleRequires refrigeration , different probiotics which may not survive gut as well as Bacillus Coagulans , but good for culturing yogurt.4.Enzymatic Therapy - Pearls IC - 90 capsContains six different strains of probiotics . Attempts to beat the gut problem through the design of the pill -- which I can attest to being practically impossible to cut open or otherwise mess with . Whether it survives the gut , who can say ? I think it is worth throwing in the mix , however.You can also get a yogurt maker like this : Euro Cuisine YM80 Yogurt Makerand culture some of these probiotics yourself . I did not find the B. Coagulans to culture well . However , theAcidophilus Plus Goat 's Milk - 200 - Capsule , which contains three different probiotic strains did work acceptably . There are apparently very old , heritage bacterial `` communities '' available for purchase that may give your gut even better diversity . You can also culture non-dairy products like coconut milk if you suspect you are allergic to dairy . If this interests you , you will find many resources on the net.Expect a few days of quirkiness in the digestive tract once you start taking probiotics . I did n't find the kefir to do much , by the way . The pill probiotics did the trick . Also , on at least one occasion I experienced an autoimmune response . Keep some Benadryl on hand , as some of these probiotics have effects on histamine . Good luck !	1
FINALLY , a probiotic my toddler will willingly eat ! I 've tried different brands of probiotic gummies and these are BY FAR the best.HIGHLY RECOMMEND	1
I 've read a lot of reviews on & # 34 ; gummy & # 34 ; vitamins & most complain that they stick together in the jar . Welcome this one ! I do n't know what they 're coated in , but these gummies have a kind of & # 34 ; sugar-grain & # 34 ; coating ( like gum drops ) , though they are ahealthy supplement.Taste is not bad at all & soft-chew ; I 'm very pleased with them .	1
THE GRAND CHILDREN LOVE TAKING THIS PRODUCT . THEY SAY IT TASTE GREAT AND THEY LOVETHE GUMMIES . SEEMS TO PREVENT COLDS AND STOMACH UPSET .	1
I have read several articles about how much money people waste buying probiotics because most of them are dead before they ever arrive in the stores , let alone after transport and digestion . This includes the refrigerated , expensive probiotics that some of my ridiculously healthy friends invest in.This product claims to have a way of delivering the little squirmers to your intestines alive . That would be great . I eat yogurt and try to eat fermented foods whenever possible ... the problem is that truly fermented foods are hard to find since food companies take the easy way out and pickle everything with vinegar . So supplementing with a live probiotic is essential.I have been taking these for a short while , but so far I feel like my inner workings are working smoothly . I have had no imbalances in the lady department and my daily business is business as usual.I will continue to take these , but will also continue to try to introduce real live fermented probiotics into the mix.Note : Costco has a bottle of 120 for $ 19.99	1
I was offered this under the Vine program , and since I get them anyway , I thought - woo hoo ! Free ! And now I remember why I did n't get them through Amazon . I live in Arizona , and it 's currently August . Or really hot out . Really hot . So I did n't so much get probiotic gummies as probiotic soup . Really colorful soup . So now that it 's cooled down , I have a big lump of probiotic goop.So , zero stars for shipping to Arizona any time between May and September.But why the 4 stars ? Because I get these normally from somewhere else , and they go from an air conditioned warehouse store to sort of air conditioned car to air conditioned house , and they do n't melt in between . So I know what these taste like . And they taste good ! I confess - I take these and other gummy vitamins so that I do n't feel guilty for eating candy . Hey - they have vitamins ! And probiotics ! It 's all good ! Well , at least it 's less bad than taking no vitamins . And I think the probiotics help my heartburn a bit.So - four stars for the product , zero stars for getting it in the summer heat .	1
There are very hard to find in the stores . Used to be easy . I spent three hours looking in different stores that used to carry them . These gummies are easy to take and are really a very good probiotic . Glad you carry them .	1
I 'm on this mission to shift from taking vitamins in pill form to taking them in gummy form- the gummies seem much easier on my stomach , and the sweet nature of them inspires me to take them more often.So , I 've experienced a wide range of `` gummy '' vitamins- tastes and textures . Everything from mealy goo to gumdrop-esque . The Schiff Sustenex are pretty much the most `` gummy bear '' like of the lot- super chewy ( prepare to chew these for a while ... ) , not terribly sweet.I do n't love them , but I do n't mind them , which is pretty much a good thing when it comes to vitamins.As far as the Probiotic power ... I 'm still figuring that out . I have stomach sensitivity issues and the Digestive Advantage does n't seem to be aggravating them . I have been able to go off another supplement because of taking these , which was a nice benefit . It does appear to be helping , but I would recommend those with ongoing issues start with one gummy a day and work up to what you need . I would n't start taking them the day of some big event , either.So , overall- super chewy , not terrible tasting/smelling , not too bad on the stomach . All in all , a decent probiotic experience .	1
My parents take a lot of pills . Getting vitamins that they can chew instead of swallow whole and taste good , makes it easy on every body .	1
I use Amazon Prime , but for these I do not . They are stored in the ( I 'm guessing ) hot warehouse and after multiple tries realized it 's a bad choice . They are never fresh , sometimes melted together or even have a funny taste . Using other vendors I 've only gotten fresh , which is a big difference once you 've had Amazon 's .	1
This product provides a delicious , fun way to gain the benefits of a probiotic supplement . And , because it is so tasty , it is just like a little dessert . So much so that there 's no way to 'forget ' to take it ! We have been taking it for some time , and like to buy it from Amazon because of convenience in ordering and prompt delivery every time . We no longer have to go from store to store looking for it . Highly recommended !	1
My grandson used to have such a difficult time with bowel movements until he started taking one of these a day . Has not had a problem since !	1
Let me start out by saying that I practice Ashtanga Yoga 5-6 days a week and eat a clean diet the majority of the time which already assists me in overall digestive health.This is probably the best tasting probiotic I have ever used and only the second one in non-liquid form . It taste just like gummy bears candy without all the flatulence and gas associated with eating candy . It 's easily digestible and worked for me almost immediately . My stool is on point and my colon feels like its eliminating and disregarding what my body does not need . You have the option of taking 2-4 gummies a day and you ca n't beat the taste . This one is a winner . Enjoy .	1
I 've tried a lot of probiotics for digestive problems . This is the first one that has ever done anything ! I 'm a 37 y.o . woman , I have MS and take a lot of medicines and am unable to walk . A few of the meds I take have constipation as a side effect and the inability to walk makes it worse . After just 4 or 5 days of taking these , things started to work ! It says take 2-4 daily , I started out taking 2 a day . I can now take 2 every other day and things are working with my tummy . I 've never been so happy to see poop ! ( wait , when my 6 yr old stops holding it and goes I 'm pretty darn happy , too . LOL ! ) If you have tummy/potty issues I hope these work for you , too !	1
It 's a probiotic my 6 year old looks forward to taking . It 's effective on his intestinal issues . Always high quality .	1
I have found this to be the BEST Probiotics I have EVER used ! I have tried a variety ... .for the expensive & # 34 ; exclusive & # 34 ; brands to the cheap brands . I have even tried certain yogurts that make claims . Nothing ... .and I mean NOTHING ... .has worked as good for me as these have . I take them every day and hope they never stop making them . On top of that ... THEY TASTE GREAT ! ! !	1
Ingredients : BC bacillus coagulans , corn syrup , sugar , gelatin , citric acid , sorbitol , natural flavors , lactic acid , colors from fruits and vegetables.These gummies certainly taste delicious , just likeGummy Bears candy , and they are clearly primarily meant for children . However , as an adult , I certainly enjoyed them . The dosage for adults is 2-4 gummies per day , which I willingly consumed.These gummies do include unhealthy corn syrup and sugar , and they also contain sorbitol , a sugar alcohol which can cause bowel distress . However , the amount contained in the dosage recommended for these gummies is small enough that it probably wo n't have a bad effect on most people , even small children . I 'm personally normally extremely sensitive to sugar alcohol , and these gummies did not affect me adversely.The type of probiotic contained in this product , Bacillus coagulans , promotes bowel health in general , but it is sometimes prescribed ( particularly in Europe ) for diarrhea ( including infectious rotaviral diarrhea in children , traveler 's diarrhea , and diarrhea caused by antibiotics ) . Bacillus coagulans is also used to aid digestion , and to treat various bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) such as Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis , a disorder of the bowels called Clostridium difficilecolitis , and as a help in healing ulcers caused by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori.In addition , Bacillus coagulans can help prevent respiratory infections , improve immune function , and help prevent cancer . Scientists are also considering adding it to vaccines to improve their effectiveness .	1
Feed these to my daughter twice a day . Just like gummy bears but with a sugar coating .	1
I 've been buying the yogurt with probiotics for some time now . When I saw these gummy versions being offered to try , I decided to give them a try . Shortly after I started taking these , my doctor put me on some new medication . He cautioned that it would have some - lets say digestive side-effects . However , I never experienced them - and I have to think it was because I was also taking these probiotic gummies . Whether or not that is true , I do n't know ( could have even been a bit of a placebo effect with me wanting it to work that way ) .Anyway - I found these gummies a very easy and tasty way of getting a daily dose of probiotics . The bottle I received had 60 gummies , so with taking two a day that is a months supply . I did think that they were a bit over sweet ( I prefer sour gummies ) and did n't need the heavy sugar coating that they are covered in.Will I buy these later ? Probably not - not because I did n't like them , more because my doctor wants me to cut out sugar & carbohydrates from my diet .	1
These are good for you , and they taste like candy ! These gummies are tart and sweet . If you have kids , or can not swallow pills , these chewables will be perfect for you . Adults can take 2 gummies.According to Amazon , `` Digestive Advantage Probiotic Gummies support your overall digestive health , helping you maintain a healthy , balanced digestive system and support your body 's immune system . It contains Probiotic BC30 , a unique , patented strain of probiotic bacteria that is surrounded by a protective layer of proteins that helps protect good bacteria from stomach acids so they arrive alive and well in your intestines where they 'll do the most good . In fact , laboratory studies show BC30 bacteria survive 10x better than other probiotics , including those found in most yogurt products . `` I 've been taking probiotics for 20 years . I have read book after book , touting the effects of probiotics . I recently read a book that claims that most illnesses are born of digestive problems . When I read the book it made perfect sense . Your intestines are what filter out bad toxins , and absorb nutrients . The gut is like a second brain , according to this book.Schiff is a big name in the vitamin world . They have been around for a long time . Longer than I 've been alive.I recommend this product . They really work .	1
I wish I knew about this 20 years ago when my gall bladder was removed and I was diagnosed with IBS . I have been taking them for about 3 weeks and I have seen such a difference in my stomach bloating and stomach pain after eating something not agreeing with me first thing in the morning.try these	1
I do n't know why chewable probiotics and vitamins seem to work best for me . These almost taste too good . I have to stop myself from eating more than two . These are much less expansive than other stores . I will buy these and have them delivered every month from Amazon .	1
Even if it 's not doing anything for my digestive system , I like the way these taste and it 's very tempting to eat them like candy , but I try to limit myself to just a couple in the morning and evening as recommended . I actually think they are helping regulate me in a positive way , but I am only half way through the bottle at this point . They are kind of pricey , but I intend to buy another bottle and see if the positive effects are long-term.Later : I got through a lasagna dinner followed by a bad hotel spaghetti dinner followed by being yelled at by my boss followed by a chaotic few days without having a crippling IBS attack , so I think these may be working ! I immediately bought a second bottle and will get a monthly subscribe-and-save to them.Later still : Nah , they do n't work . Must have been a placebo effect .	1
When you are taking medication to manage chronic pain , oftentimes it results in painful irregularity . Drinking powdery drinks or chewing chalky/fruity flavored fiber supplements just weber doing the trick for me . What 's worse , many have and can cause an onset of diarrhea and/or gas.This product is definitely worth the investment . Within 24 hours of taking the recommended 2 to start , I was back on track with no side affects . Plus , it does more than just regulate you ... it promotes healthy digestion overall . In a addition , this product improves overall digestive health , and of course includes the fiber needed to regulate you . I feel much healthier , and I do n't have to take yet another pill or powdery drink , etc. , in order to be where I need to be.I have been using this product for months , and it 's the only product that I use because I do stick to what works . Plus , I admit to bring a big kid that enjoys the fruity flavors of these gummies ! You should definitely give it a try !	1
They work ! I take 2 every evening and these keep me regular . Once I began using these , I noticed I no longer felt bloated , gassy , or uncomfortable . I now feel light , clean , and healthy ! Tasty . Kind of a workout to get them totally chewed , but that 's a minor thing . Great value , also !	1
These probiotics are great and have the best texture and taste of any gummy dietary supplement I 've had . ( And I 've had a lot of different ones ! ) They have a sugar like coating on them which completely eliminates they melting together into one clump , so even though I live in a very hot climate and these came to me in the middle of summer , they still arrived in individual pieces . When you can buy them from Amazon directly they are very reasonably priced too . Would definitely recommend ! !	1
My kids occasionally have digestive problems and they really like these probiotics . I 've started taking them too and I can see why my kids like them so much , they are really yummy ! It 's hard to only eat the recommended dose and not have these as a snack . As far as effectiveness , they seem to keep bowel movements regular , no more constipation or loose stools for my kids .	1
These Digestive Advantage Probiotic Gummies , Dietary Supplement , 60 Count are made by Schiff who are a trusted name in vitamins and supplements . They taste great and they 're gummies , who does n't like gummies ? Recommended .	1
Love 'gummy ' supplements , and I 'm in favor of probiotics . These taste good , they 're easy to chew and appear to work very well , thank you !	1
Wow , these are sweet ! They are coated with sugar and it 's so overwhelmingly sweet that if I am near a water faucet , I will rinse them off before eating them . The gummy taste is great , chewy and not hard . I like these because they are so convenient and easy to access for those needing probiotics . They are especially convenient for travel use and if you have a hard time eating yogurt or do n't want the extra calories of probiotic foods . I like these and will keep them stocked in my house .	1
I like the idea of gummies as a way to remember to include a probiotic in my daily regimen . A little bit of sugar is always appealing and the 10 calories it adds is n't a big deal for me . The label says that they contain `` Probiotic BC30 , a unique , patented strain of probiotic bacteria that is surrounded by a protective layer of proteins that helps protect good bacteria from stomach acids so they arrive alive and well in your intestines where they 'll do the most good . '' Well I do n't know if all that 's true but they do seem to help with digestion and `` moving everything along '' . Some of that may be because prior to testing these gummies I 'd been takingDigestive Advantage Intensive Bowel Support , 96 Counts Capsules , not every single day but at least four times a week . I 'm totally sold on that product and have been taking them since about 6 years ago when someone suggested it after I 'd gone through a nasty bout of C Diff . It was the only thing that finally helped to get my system back to normal after the antibiotics . So some of the effects of those capsules are probably still in play . These gummies seem to be a different formula , but so far , so good .	1
These are a good alternative to making my kids take pills . They do n't mind taking these to keep their digestive system in good shape .	1
I personally use these gummy probiotics for myself and my 4 year old daughter . We have both used them for over one year each . They do n't stick to each other like other gummy vitamins and taste really good considering they are vitamins . I do n't like taking pills and she is too young to so these work out perfectly . Her excema has improved since she began taking them for her immune system . My stomach is less irritated now that I use them . I would definately recommend them to others and will continue to buy them . The only nitpicky downside is the `` dust '' that you get on your fingers after handling . Well worth the dust ...	1
This product adds good bacteria to your body . It also helps with bowel regularity although that added benefit is not listed on the label . It 's a plus . However , they do n't taste all that great but well enough . Nice to use if you want a digestive aid that works and you are tired of swallowing pills .	1
I have a medical condition that causes my body to strip away naturally occurring probiotics . I know that this product works , because when I take it I feel much better . If I miss a couple of days , I will start having severe digestive issues . The product is easy to take and does not contain any of the top five allergens , which is critical to me .	1
It 's difficult to review vitamins since they take time to take effect . I started taking Digestive Advantage several weeks ago and have had them every day . I have n't had any ill effects nor have I gotten sick to my stomach ( probiotics should help you digest food better ) . So I would guess it 's working . At best I can review the taste . it 's pretty good - like candy . It does n't have a strange flavor like some chewable vitamins do . These vitamins are like gumdrops , and a bit tangy . Kids can have them too.In the past all probiotics I bought had to be refrigerated , and taken separately from food , to be effective . This vitamin had no such warnings . I am not sure if it is really working as a result.Best I can give this is 4 stars . It has n't given me any reason to give it less , but I ca n't give it five stars without being sure it 's actually working .	1
I 've been having some stomach problems for close to a year . In the past few months it 's gotten worse . I have anxiety which gives me terrible nausea , and fairly recently I 'd been getting a feeling of fullness after eating even small amounts of food that would last for 6+ hours after eating . I decided to try changing my eating habits and adding probiotics to my diet . I have an extremely hard time swallowing pills , so I wanted to give these gummies a try . First off , they taste delicious ! Almost too good , because it makes me want to eat more of them than the recommeded dose.I started off taking 2 a day for a little while . After about 1-2 weeks of this , I noticed a pain in my stomach right next to my belly button that would hurt if I touched it ( it felt like it was irritated from the inside ) . My boyfriend had experienced the same pain after taking a pill form of probiotics and said the pain would go away after he stopped taking them . So I pulled back my dosage . I now take 1 gummy a day and I have n't had that pain since . I also do n't get the full feeling and my nausea has gotten better ( I still get some nausea but it is nowhere near as bad and I am able to handle it better ) .I do n't know if these changes are from the probiotics or my diet change ( I have switched to eating mainly foods with natural ingrediets and no preservatives ) , probably a little bit of both .	1
It 's not that I had a problem but in an effort to get myself in shape I decided to take some measures that would help along that line . My cousin advised me of a probiotic she was taking but it was in pill form and I do n't do well with that.Dr . Oz is a big proponent of taking things that imp [ rove your digestive tract , especially cleansing of same and while I am not a fan of the sugar content , I find that this product does for me what it is designed to do and in a soothing way.I have been taking two or three per day and I must admit that my `` gut '' actually feels better . They say Yogurt does the same thing , and I take that too , but when I ca n't get it , this product is perfect . I highly recommend it .	1
This is a probiotic supplement that was very easy to take daily due to the fact that they are delicious . They taste like gummy candy and were a pleasure to follow through eating . While I cant say I noticed extreme changes in my stomach problems they certainly didnt hurt .	1
These products never taste very good , but with the cocoa added , it 's much more bearable to drink mixed in my a Kangen water and really does n't taste bad when mixed with berries and & /or almond/peanut butter with some almond/coconut milk in a smoothie ... After the first week or so , I could definitely tell the difference in my energy . When I ran out and had n't reordered in advance , I was honestly missing it , and kind of excited when it arrived : )	1
Not just for health nuts ! This is consumed by my children 3,6 , and 9 . I use it in a smoothie with choco almond milk , and a frozen banana ... . DELICIOUS ! They do n't even know I put greens in it ! It has stevia in it already . I like this product in plain water ... ..If you are unused to 'greens ' it can take awhile for your body to acclimate to them when you first start ... it actually takes your body awhile to get used the flavor ... but after about 3-4 times , within a week or two , your tastes bud WILL change and it will start to become delicious to you ! And for those of you in the 'not good ' camp who think it is not yummy , that probably means you need it more than those who think it is ok.. Look it is good for your body ; kids eat things because it 'tastes ' good , a TRUE adult eats things because they KNOW it is good.It is DRASTICALLY less expensive on amazon , than my local health food store .	1
I shopped around for quite a while to find a cold processed super food powder that does not taste like sweat socks ( after football practice ) . this is the best .	1
I love this product -- the chocolate green drink is very palatable and I notice that , because it is raw , powdered , and has enzymes added , that it is more metabolizable by my body . I actually make a thick shake with it , by using 2-3 scoops , adding unsweetened cacao and stevia , and a couple of scoops of raw , organic powdered greens , milk seed thistle , and cinnamin . Sometimes I add peppermint oil , too for a mint chocolate drink . This drink is best served blended and very cold or with crushed ice . There probably is n't a better meal replacement that GOL Perfect Food Raw ( unless you create your own at-home recipe ) . Happy drinking~*	1
What 's not to love about 34 healthy organic ingredients providing a whoping 7 servings of excellent nutrition ... As for the taste , it would be hard to handle it daily in water , but it 's doable . At least use a shaker bottle if that 's your route . I use chocolate almond milk with a scoop of chocolate whey protein and it 's not bad at all . Instead of forcing it down like I did in water , it 's actually enjoyable and has me wanting seconds .	1
I 'm a chocolate lover and I know that I do n't eat as balanced as I should on some days - a lot of days . This product is really okay tasting in different formulas of liquid . I like it in my Chocolate Soy Milk . I even put it in OJ and it 's good that way too . It does take some getting used too . The flavor is rather grassy tasting , but knowing that I am doing something good for my body makes the taste worth it . On days that I am feeling like my system is out of balance and that I need to eat something , but do n't know what , I drink this and it takes care of the need . Overall I like it very much .	1
This product has great taste and texture and great ingredients . Other similar products I 've tried tend to be more chalky . I mix this with a protein powder and sometimes frozen berries and it tastes excellent . I would definitely buy again .	1
First ... yes , I know that a LOT of people talk about how bad the taste is , ( even if it has a dose of chocolate in it ) . To keep this review short & simple , let me just say that it is a known fact that the more tasty something is the worse ( or more fat ) it has in it ... thus ... since this stuff & # 34 ; tastes like & # 34 ; a dirty fish-tank ... with chocolate ... ( lol ) , it has to be REALLY healthy ! ! ! ! ! Ha ha . Seriously though , as a health & fitness coach , I really recommend this stuff . Without getting into all the reasons , suffice to say this is a good product . A bit of advice I 'd give anybody who has trouble drinking this stuff:1 ) First , make sure you DO N'T mix a scoop with any MORE than 8 oz of water , ( pref less , only so you have less to drink & it makes the chocolate taste a bit stronger ) .2 ) Second , make sure you THOROUGHLY stir / mix the powder into the water , ( you 'll see it start to foam on top when it 's mixed pretty well ... though it 'll still be a bit gritty at the bottom ) .3 ) Third , ( & this is purely optional ) , try mixing a BIT of raw sugar , agave , or whatever sweetener you pref. , ( & I 'm not going to get into a debate / argument with people about sugar being & # 34 ; bad & # 34 ; , etc.. I 'm only suggesting , again , a BIT / DASH of sweetener , for one , & I firstly stated this this was YOUR OPTION . I 've tried it & it 's not bad , but not my pref . ) .4 ) And last ... drink it fast ! ! ! Drink it before it has a chance to separate from the water again . Like I said earlier though , this stuff will still want to separate at the bottom , so I just add about another 1 to 2 oz of water to kill off the last bit.Hope my method helps some people because I think this stuff is really helpful to a person 's body in the long run ... but that 's just my two cents . Cheers !	1
I drank mine for the first time today in unsweetened almond milk . It is quiet strong , but that is to be expected when you consider what is in it . It takes a while for your taste buds to get used to something so I am going to keep drinking them everyday . I feel good about adding something good to my diet . No noticeable changes in energy level , but I work nights and often am sleepy so we will see . I am going to use the whole container and post a comment after I am done in about thirty days .	1
THIS IS ONE THE BEST MULTI-POWDERS YOU CAN BUY . AFTER FINDING OUT THAT THE GARDEN OF LIFE STAFF ARE FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIANS , NOW I TRUST THEM EVEN MORE . I WOULD NEVER TRUST A NONE BELIEVING ATHEISTS ' PRODUCTS . CHRISTIAN VALUES ARE TOP NOTCH . DO N'T DRINK ALCOHOL , DO N'T SMOKE , ETC .	1
This is the best organic meal replacement powder I 've ever tasted ! After reading some of the other reviews , I was worried that it would make me gag - especially since I 'm a Raw Meal newbie . But after drinking it for a few days , I can attest that it 's quite good . While the taste is a little gritty , you definitely get used to it . Plus the benefits certainly outweigh the Yuck Factor . Mix it into 16 oz . of liquid , instead of the suggested 8 oz. , if you want to avoid choking on the grit . In fact , I 've been putting a serving of this powder in my nalgene every morning , and then filling it with water around lunchtime . Voila ! Insta-Lunch . It gives me a boost of energy and keeps me from stuffing carbs into my pie hole.Does it taste like a Snickers bar ? No . It 's not overtly chocolatey , but does have a hint of cocoa . Remember , you 're eating this stuff for it 's health benefits , not necessarily for the taste . Buy it ! Your colon will thank you .	1
This product has pretty much everything that a person needs except fruit . I consume this everyday , sometimes twice a day.My doctor does n't know I take this but she tells me my blood work is just fine . I am 65 . As long as Amazon carries this product , I will keep ordering it .	1
This creates very little mess and washes off easily . Also it is such great value for money and it truly is worth it !	1
I am always looking for natural products with no harsh chemicals and this fits the billNatural sugar hair removing gel . Most chemical hair removing treatments have a horrible smell but this is differentAfter hair removal the skin is left soft and smoothRecommended for customers who like a natural product	1
I have made our own sugaring many times before ... It is a time-consuming process for me and the consistency of the sugaring is n't always right.Using cocojojo sugaring was such a breath of fresh air . The sugaring is smooth and goes on beautifully . It stayed at just the right temperature the whole time instead of overheating and then cooling too much like my home-made variety . It has a numbing/pain relieving effect on the skin . It smells delightful ! I bought more because it is so much better than my homemade sugaring that it is worth the extra money to buy it.Excellent !	1
This hair removal wax works great ! I liked that it had 100 % natural ingredients because my skin is very sensitive . It removed all the hair from my legs on the first try and left my legs feeling smooth . I did n't start to feel the hair growing back until about 2 weeks later . I 'm so happy I found this , I 've tried a lot of similar over the counter products that were crap . No move shaving or waxing for me ! Highly recommend !	1
It is great and adjustable hair removal product ! For me , it & # 8217 ; s the ideal solution for hair removal , if you do not mind . It might surprise you to know that the sugaring hair removal hardness from this company is adjustable according to your needs ! !	1
I have only worn these for two days , but the first morning I woke up and walked around my house , I felt hardly any pain in my heels , when before I would have to strectch as much as I could and it would take a good 15 minutes for the pain to go away . I could hardly walk some mornings . I walk everywhere , and am very active and these feel really good in my shoes . I love these and will probably buy a few more pairs for my other shoes . These have been a life saver for me .	1
All-in-all they are a great help if you deal with plantar fasciitis . They lift and support your foot enough to really alleviate the pain . I like that it comes with little glue dots to use in the shoes so they stay put and do n't slide around , I found that particular feature helpful because other inserts move around when you walk and can get uncomfortable . I also like that they 're fairly inexpensive when compared to other brands . I wear them 5 days a week , 40 hour work weeks , and spend maybe an hour total time each day actually walking in them and they last me 4-5 months before needing to be replaced because the grey fabric has peeled off , they stop really supporting , etc . But I 've purchased them a couple of times now so I 'd still recommend them overall . Minus a star for durability overall .	1
I have bought 4 or more inserts for my shoes and these worked the best . A great price too . They do get stinky quickly .	1
This works and provides more support that higher priced inserts . So glad I orderd these , and at this price you can easily order a few pairs to keep in your shoes .	1
I wear a size 8.5 medium in women 's sizing and have high arches along with plantar fasciitis . The arch hits me perfectly and gives good support , but I could actually use a little more . Keeping my foot upright and more on the outer edge seems essential to lessening the pain of the fasciitis , so I even use these with my sandal-style sneakers and they are not obvious .	1
I bought these , put them in my sneakers and the pain was gone . Okay not quite that fast but with in 24 hours I was walking again . I now have a pair in all my shoes and sneakers ,	1
I have another product I like better , but this is ok for some shoes I do n't have the full inserts in .	1
I now have these in several of my shoes and they really do decrease foot/heal pain . They do not crowd the shoe either .	1
Great inserts , fits just about any casual shoe and really helps with the pain i feel at the end of the day after wearing shoes !	1
I bought these to help out with the plantar fasciitis problem as I have to do a lot of walking on campus . These were an add-on item , so they were n't a financial gamble and I did n't have high hopes for them . For me , they 've worked pretty well . The arch support has been really good . I wish they had a little bit more cushioning in the heel .	1
Developed plantar fasciitis and tried several heel pads from different companies that are supposed to help but they did n't . I happened to see this product in the local supermarket and since it was on sale , I tried these inserts -- and they work great ! They work so well I ordered another pair from Amazon . As long as I use these inserts in regular shoes and/or tennies , or wear Orthaheel sandals , my heel pain is greatly diminished . I highly recommend these comfortable , effective , and inexpensive orthotic inserts if you have heel pain .	1
I have been very seriously suffering with plantar fasciitis foot pain and I bought this product as well as a night foot splint . In one weeks time I have a 60 % improvement in the pain I was feeling . I am a heavy woman and I still felt like these orthotics were very supportive and incredibly comfortable to wear . They have helped my foot so much , I would definitely buy this product again .	1
Of all the insoles that I tried ( many ) for plantar fasciitis , this one worked the best and was certainly the most cost effective.I also used compression foot sleeves , MSM and ibuprofen in conjunction with this orthotic to obtain relief . I tried a different direction when my doctor , who had plantar fasciitis for 20 years , cured herself by following the advice on [ ... ] and I too am having very positive results.I found these worked best when I sandwiched them between the shoe and the sock liner when that was possible : I could n't feel where the orthotic terminated and it kept it from shifting out of place .	1
fits well in all my shoes because of 1/2 length sizeI can feel the gel softnesscons : wish it had higher arches	1
I use these in flat boots or shoes for insole support and to raise my heel . They work well and are comfortable .	1
This Product enabled me to walk pain free after a terrible plantar fascitis episode that caused me pain and suffering for almost two months .	1
I use these in my slippers around the house ; these inserts do n't fit in the Danskos that I wear outside the house . But I 've had no foot pain since my switch to these and good , supportive shoes during the day.After 15 years on my feet as a classroom teacher and a distance-running hobby as an adult , I am happy to be able to give my feet some much needed support and pampering !	1
I 've got multiple problems/old injuries that have made me walk 'favoring ' a certain side of my body - except it 's done me no favors . My plantar fasciitis came back with a vengeance recently and I was wincing when I walked across the room at work - and I 'm 33 . 33 and stubborn , so I refuse to wear ugly shoes . Well , I got these this WEEK and I still have pain but it 's drastically reduced . I expect it will continue to improve . They 're helping to correct how I walk and helping everything else in the process . I will say that the first two days I wore them , they did increase the pain and caused 'new ' pain ( which was fairly significant at moments ) , but I figured that was my feet adapting to the difference and stuck with them . I am glad that I did because I am amazed by how fast they are making such an impact . I would recommend to anyone - honestly at this price and with the amount money you could spend on other treatments , even if they do n't help you , I feel like this is MORE than worth a shot . I do n't usually write reviews here but I had to write this one . Also , size-wise , I went to take a 10W or an 11 depending on the shoe and these work fine , so I think the 'large ' is accurate there .	1
I have these in all my footware that are not Birkenstocks . They work well at helping to relieve my plantar fasciitis pain .	1
I had plantar fascitis , and every associated pain and discomfort that goes with it . Went to Runners Depot In Miami to buy custom Shoes , Inserts , Socks , expensive office shoes and Sneakers.. Some of them helped marginally . I tried the insert also and it certainly helped to alleviate the pain.Then a review aboutNorth American Healthcare Foot Rockermentioned to test for Vitamin D. I did not wait to go to test . but with little hope decided to tryNature Made Vitamin D3 2000 IU , Value Size , 220-Countfor a week and if improves continue or it will end up as expensive Urine . Voila , within 2 -3 days the pain had substantially gone down and in a week was 100 % cured off plantar Fascitis . Apparently the Vitamin D in theOne-A-Day Multivitamin , Men 's Health Formula , 200 Tablet Bottlewas not enough.You need sun to produce Vitamin D. I live in Sunshine state of Florida and several of my friends have Vitamin D deficiency ( many of them severe to a point of Doctors prescribing 50,000 IU ) . So If you have plantar fascitis , Please test for Vitamin D .	1
They work . My son has feet which could use surgery . He prefers not to have . These do help alot ! His ankles are much straighter now .	1
Bought for a woman with wider feet than most women . It took a few days of wearing them but they make a huge difference . Foot pain after standing for hours is noticeably more tolerable . I would n't have lasted in this job without them !	1
This arrived in good condition and time . These have helped with my husbands feet , he has less pain after standing on his feet at work . He was having more pain and having a hard time walking after a long day at work before we received these . Now he is comfortable and can walk well after those long days at work .	1
I use this charger to charge 18650 batteries ( used in a portable charger ) , 18490 ( for my pro-vari ) , and 14500 for other vaping mods . This charger has three LEDs per charging port to indicate how much charge the batteries have . The casing is higher quality than average for a china made charger . This thing is BIG , twice the size of the average charger . Mine came with the car adapter that another customer said they did n't receive . It was in a retail box . I have n't had it long , if it breaks I will be sure to update . So far I am very happy with it.I have no tried it with any NiMH batteries yet .	1
I got this to charge 18650 cells for my flashlights . It seems to work pretty well . It is n't the quickest charger I have but it does n't cook the cells either which I like . Like someone else said it would be nice if there was a LED to indicate which type of cell it decided that it detected so you could be absolutely sure it detected correctly . The other thing I did n't like ( pointed out by others too ) was the sliding action of the metal contact for each bay . A couple of them would jam up like they were getting stuck or cutting into the plastic . I tore mine apart and put some NyoGel that I use to lube my lights on the top and bottom of each bay rail and now it works great . They should have done this at the factory . Overall it seems like a pretty good charger for the price .	1
My Grand-Mumzy suffers from Vertigo . It is a BAD feeling , both for the person who suffers , and for the family members who feel as though they are so very helpless , because they do not know as to how they may help . This is why my Mumzy spoke to some friends , who also suffered from Vertigo , and having done some research , she purchased this product for Grand-Mumzy . Vertigo is a bad feeling , especially when it is accompanied by the nausea , vomiting , etc . One never knows as to when it comes along . One may have no attacks for quite a while , and then all of a sudden it might happen . Bam ! Not a good feeling . This is why Mumzy purchased this product . She then checked with the doctor as to how much , and as to when Grand-Mumzy should take this product . This product is quite helpful when those awful feelings come along . There are also some exercises that one can do for the Vertigo . One may Google them for further information . I wish you all purr-fect health ! Phffft ! ! !	1
I have just started to have problems with vertigo and I 'm actually going to see a specialist for the problem . In the meantime , these tablets have helped me to sleep at night since laying down seems to cause most of my issues related to the vertigo . It 's a good deal and a good product because it works ! ! !	1
I 've been buying this brand in 100 count at my local druggist to treat the symptoms of a long term inner ear issue . There was always a problem getting this . So I ordered this huge bottle and it 's solid value . the pills do not get mushy over time and the drug seems to work . Solid buy if you can use this many pills and your doctor says using this drug is a wise choice .	1
She was almost out . And I got these off Amazon for her . She takes one a day . They will last her for a long time maybe . AAA+++	1
LOVE , LOVE , LOVE this product . The liquid we purchased tastes terrible and these are yummy . Sister hides hers so her entire house is n't eating them just because they are good .	1
this is the way to take vitamins in the morning no more hand fulls just a quick chew and you are done	1
Loves these makes it easy to get my vitamins and no big pills to swallow . The taste is also good .	1
Smaller than I expected for so , e reason , but smells wonderful !	1
You can always appreciate an excellent deodorant , and i really like this one . This is one i would purchase over and over again	1
I 'm not one to rate deodorant , but I like this . The smell is n't heavy or offensive , and it 's really nice . It has made my skin under my arms softer . It does work -- in fact , it works better than the men 's deodarant I was wearing before . Well played , Dove , well played .	1
dove makes all of the best deodorant . period . I will never ever use any other brand . dove deodorants actually do what they say they 'll do and go sleeveless nourished beauty smells sooo good ! there 's also a scent that has the word & # 34 ; cashmere & # 34 ; in it , I ca n't remember the exact name , but that one smelled fabulous , too . I even got my mom hooked on dove lol . I 've been using dove for years . please , never stop making this deodorant ! !	1
I 've been using Dove deodorant for years . I typically go for the cool essentials cucumber & green tea scent but this one was offered at a price I could n't pass up so I decided to give it a try . I found the scent to be surprisingly nice . In my experience the non-fruity scents are typically overpowering and obnoxious with an overabundance of floral and musk but that 's not the case at all here . This one has a nice light scent that 's not overpowering in the least , yet it lasts all day.Dove deodorant is great stuff and this variety is no exception . I love how smooth it goes on , the fact that it moisturizes , and for someone like me who epilates I find it to be incredibly soothing . My underarms are one of the few places I do n't get irritation bumps post-epilation and I attribute that to my Dove deodorant . I ca n't say enough good things about this product !	1
This product really does work for reducing darker pigmentation caused from underarm shaving and it has a nice , light fragrance . However , it does not work as well as some other antiperspirants that I have used . Nevertheless , I like it enough to continue using it in the future .	1
Really smells good and fresh . Definitely would buy again . Now whether it changes textures or something in your armpit area I do n't know .	1
This is my favorite of the Dove collection ... .as far as the smell goes . Unlike the soothing camomile this leaves a residue and kind of cakes up throughout the day - So apply lightly ! It is great to use after shaving . Dove is always a great choice as far as deoderant .	1
I love Dove deodorant ! I 've used it for years but this is the first time I 've used this scent . It smells great and works well .	1
I like the smooth feel of this deodorant and it 's not greasy or quick to moisten . I do n't use that much deodorant and I do n't have to .	1
This leaves your body feeling so smooth and soft Cleans very well and only need use a very small amount at a time . Happy with purchase .	1
I got deodorant for my fiance , and she loves it . It 's a very subtle scent , and she says it works as well as move expensive deodorants .	1
I have seriously tried ever brand of deodorant ever created . I do n't know if its me , but no matter the brand or the amount applied , my deodorant cakes up into white balls in my arm pits . It drives me crazy.Until I bought this stuff . And man , this stuff is amazing . I never thought I 'd actually like a deodorant , but I sure do now.I 'm hooked . Give it a try and so will you .	1
There 's not much to say about deodorant , but this smells good , makes your underarms feel nice , and using the Amazon coupon I got it at a price that even the big discount stores could n't beat . Would definitely purchase again .	1
Nice sweet smell . I like that the smell is very soft so it does n't interfere with other perfumes . Keeps me dry all day and I smell better .	1
This deodarant is amazing ! Soothes under arms after shaving every day and very good odor protection , the only thing that could be better is if it were clear	1
I like using Dove deodorant . This deodorant does not leave film on my clothes . It also does not cause itching .	1
This deodorant is great ! It smells awesome , goes on smoothly , does n't rub off on my clothes , and it works well .	1
I was using Secret Clinical Strength deodorant and had a horrible reaction to it after a few weeks . ( Got an itchy , dry , flaky rash . ) I got rid of that and tried using Dove Go Sleeveless instead.I 'm pleased to report that my rash is gone . This deodorant was gentle on my irritated skin and may have even helped to promote healing.It has a pleasant scent that 's not too strong . I think it 's effective as both an anti-perspirant and a deodorant . We 've had a couple of very hot days here so far this year , and I have to be pretty active during the hottest part of the day ( walking my dog , climbing the stairs in my office building ) , but I 've always been completely protected.I 'm definitely a fan of this stuff !	1
Dove keeps you drier than some of the other brands and has a soft light scent . Does not show on any of the clothing and does not & # 34 ; roll & # 34 ; up under your arms . I am completely sold on this product , will make it my # 1 choice for deodorant .	1
see through which is nice . pretty tight fit . Its perfect for me as I try to take my vitamins spread out through out the day , it gives me 8 compartments with a a big one for misc . Each one can hold from 3-4 large B complex capsules or lots of very small pills like folic acid . I have 4 so on mon I fill all and do n't have to worry till Friday and all my doses are spread out . Pills do n't mix when closed .	1
This is a good product for carrying a variety of pills , whether prescription or OTC . Nice for week-end trips or the soon-to-be mandatory ( LOL ) & # 34 ; Go bag & # 34 ; we should all be packing . The closure seems like it will hold well - just need to figure out a way to identify what goes in each compartment . Small Dots ?	1
I take pills 4 times a day . This pill case is great . With all of the compartments , I can easily seperate out my pills .	1
I was looking for a pill box that would hold enough for when I traveled but also was n't too big to carry in my purse . This little box is great and I 'm now using it to carry my pills all the time . Since I do happen to forget to take my vitamins from time to time . This is compact enough that I do n't have to worry about forgetting anymore . I even dropped it once by accident and it stayed shut ; nothing came out . Very happy with this and I love the color .	1
The case works great , even for the tiny pills that I carry . They stay in their respective compartments in my purse and it has n't popped open once , even after being banged around in there all day , every day . The reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because you need to be careful when opening it . Make sure you lift the tab in the center straight up , without touching the sides on either side of the tab . Those sides are sharp and will scrape your fingers up .	1
I know they made the closer a bit weak so older people could get it apart , but I 'd prefer it to be stronger . I put a rubber band around it when traveling .	1
ONE STAR : The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging , but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale . Lights powered by them are semi-bright , and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS : From the same supplier , MyBatterySupplier , I ordered the50-pack , which did come in the new hologram package , and the difference was dramatic . Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant , and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars .	-1
These did not work at all - absent of enough power to work . these were cheap - waste of money	-1
I bought a pack of these a while back from Sam 's Club . I used them in my appliance remotes but noticed that they do n't hold their charges for long thereby necessitating frequent recharges . The cheap rapid charger 'CH30MN ' that came with the battery pack did not help matters either as it heats the batteries up during the charging process to the point of being unbearable to touch.Save your money and buy the newSANYO NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteriesinstead .	-1
As much as I want to be greener , I find that these batteries make me want to buy regular old batteries . Definitely do your research and stay away from these .	-1
The AAAs I have in my remote controls seem to last a very long time on one or two charges ; of course the power-draw of a remote control is minimal . In contrast , I have had many problems with Energizer AAs used in digital cameras . While some of these batteries keep the Energizer Bunny going and going , for no discernible reason , many of them start showing as `` bad '' in the charger ( blinking red light ) after only a few charges , meaning ... pregnant pause ... the rabbit died . *Update , 27 FEB 2012* I am still using 4 of these batteries ( of the 16 that I bought ) , and while they continue to limp along , the Rayovac Hybrids that I bought at the same time are by far superior ... The Energizers power my camera for only a few hours , whereas the Rayovacs that I bought at the same time are still good for several days of camera use.Day and night . Even if the Energizers were being sold for $ .25 each , I do n't think I 'd go there again .	-1
I 've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now . The last few times I 've taken them out for vacation use in camera , I 've had the same problem : I charge two sets ( one Kodak and one these Energizers ) when I put the camera away . A few weeks later , I go off on vacation . The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before . The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day , having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.After missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries , I 'd had enough . The Energizers are going in the bin , and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them .	-1
Plain and simple , they do not work . They do not charge . I exchanged them for a second set , and they had the same problem . I will stick with the Duracell rechargables that have worked perfectly for me so far .	-1
Usually my rechargeable batteries last longer the year before I need to buy a new set . Not this time . Maybe I just got a bad batch	-1
I have 4 kids and we were using batteries like crazy . I do n't necessarily like throwing all of those batteries away when there are rechargables . I went to the store without doing any research first and just picked up these Energizers 2500mAhs . Needless to say , most do n't work after a year . I could n't get my programmable thermastat to even work because it had such a low charge coming straight off of the charger . And today , my sons batteries died in his guitar , took the ones that had just gotten done in the charger and they did n't even last five minutes , and boy he was n't very happy . I think I would have been better off getting those junky ones from the dollar store . Look for a better brand !	-1
This product is advertised as the NEW Energizer Rechargeable NiMH AA Batteries . But once you received it , you may be shocked to find out that : the rated capacity of those NEW batteries is just '2300mAh ' , lower than the previous generation of '2500mAh ' Energizer NiMH cells . So are you really getting a new and improved product , or just some old inventory from many years ago ? The fact is , Energizer has discontinued the '2500mAh ' series of rechargeable AA NiMH cells , presumably due to massive complaints about rapid-self-discharge problem . All new Energizer rechargeable AA cells on the market now are rated '2300mAh'.I have tested four of those new cells , using the Discharge/Refresh function of myLa Crosse BC-900charger/analyzer . Here are my findings : - Fresh out of the package , those cells hold an average of 330mAh , or just 14 % of the full capacity.- After fully charging them for the first time , they hold an average of 1040mAh.- After two more discharge/charge cycles , the average capacity improved to 2340mAhBased on the above observations , I can conclude that those 'New ' Energizer cells are just ordinary NiMH cells with lower capacity . They are not the LSD ( low-self-discharge ) type pioneered bySANYO eneloop . This is very disappointing , because other name-brand battery makers have already introduced LSD products similar to eneloop , such as theRayovac HybridandDuracell Pre Charged . In contrast , the Energizer Bunny simply 'rolled back ' its battery technology to circa 2004.The only positive thing I can say about those 2300mAh Energizer cells is : they _probably_ do n't self-discharge as badly as previous generation of 2500mAh cells.In summary , those so-called 'New ' Energizer NiMH cells have capacity just slightly higher than LSD NiMH cells ( 2000-2100mAh ) , yet do not offer the advantage of lower self discharge rate . As of this writing , this product is priced at nearly 2x higher than LSD cells . So it is just a bad deal .	-1
As many other reviewers have pointed out , these batteries have a very high self-discharge rate . This means that within a short period of time ( for me about 7-10 days ) they will be completely dead even if you completely charged them and never used them . The only reason I did n't give these batteries 1 star is because they do work well right out of the charger . But you pretty much have to use them within 2-3 days of charging . Wait any longer and it will already be significantly discharged . I know I did n't just get a bad batch either because I have a couple dozen of these Energizers which I purchased over the course of 2+ years . I did n't notice the discharge rate at first because I used to charge my batteries pretty frequently to make sure I always had a fresh set in whatever device I was using . But eventually I started noticing that even my `` freshly charged '' batteries were n't lasting very long . So I started paying closer attention to how frequently I charged my batteries and realized that even after a week they would be mostly or completely dead.I 've switched over to Rayovac Hybrids and Sanyo Eneloops which both have a much lower self-discharge . I 've very happy with both of them and would definitely recommend either of them over these Energizers . I hope that Energizer eventually comes out with some low self-discharge batteries because I really like their other batteries . But avoid the rechargeables . They 're just not worth it .	-1
I used NiCD batteries for a time years ago and gave up on those . When I tried the NiMH batteries I started with these ones and was very disappointed with the technology , we used it in a mouse that required about twice a week changes , later I changed to Sanyo 's eneloop and I 'm very happy .	-1
Avoid these batteries ! ! ! ! ! ! My experience is similar to many others . Good initial performance , and then these bloody Energizer batteries ca n't hold a charge . Unfortunately before I discovered how crappy they really are , I bought a bunch of them , for use in my digital cameras and camera flash units . When these babies fail , performance falls like a lead balloon . They might have enough power to operate a remote control unit , but you can forget about powering anything with a major power draw.Unfortunately Energizer is extremely successful at getting stores to stock this junk . I get real annoyed whenever I see them on display , because it reminds me of all the money I wasted . They seem to be available everywhere , a constant reminder of a disaster . How does a product that is so bad , get such great distribution and remain available for sale ? Energizer probably gets off easy , because it takes a while for their batteries to go bad . By then , it 's less likely that people will complain or return them . Blasting them here is like therapy for me.As an alternative , I strongly recommend Ray-O-Vac Hybrid cells , which have worked very well for me so far .	-1
While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands , I 've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries . I can not say for certain you 'll have the same bad experience , as it depends what you use them for , but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use . They 're nearly worthless to me . I almost never use them anymore.I 'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year , so hopefully those will work as promised . I just can not advise going with Energizer after using these . Try another brand .	-1
I had this Interplak until for just over 1 year and it just stopped working for no apparent reason . The pump runs but no water flows . I checked the water path and it 's completely clear . No blockages anywhere . The pump simply does n't pump water anymore . I would n't get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered . The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective . As other reviewers have pointed out , the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn . There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they 'll never use them . So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt . Overall I 'd rate this unit as `` build quality : poor , life span : short , effectiveness : disappointing '' .	-1
The ad shows batteries in a package , I got batteries that were shrink wrapped and no open to leave seller feedback . I just got a bunch of loose batteries . I do n't know if they are real Duracell or not .	-1
Best Deals sells outdated batteries . All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them . Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows . Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers . Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company . Whish I had read back and I would n't have ordered from them . They also never replied to my emails . I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon . Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit . It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has . No wonder the batteries were so cheap .	-1
These were described as guaranteed for 5 years , but have an expiration date that is only 3 years ( Mar 2016 ) . Since I am using them for battery back-up in clocks this is a real bummer . Not what I expect from Amazon . Will probably live with it rather than mess with a return .	-1
Item did not arrive on a cardboard card , it arrived in an easy to open plastic case and with the expiration date only 3 years out . Fresh batteries have a 5 year expiration date . The description and the picture of this item needs to be changed if they are going to sell Amazon customers a different and older item . They were nice and sent me a return label free of charge .	-1
Ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks . Better you should trust the negative comments and save yourself the hassle of returning dead batteries . I should have known when they arrived that something was wrong : They were shipped in a generic clamshell-type package with no label or indication they were made by Duracell - not at all as pictured and a red flag for fakes . Note to seller : How long did you think you 'd get away with selling dead ( and possibly fake ) batteries ? Note to Amazon : Please investigate this seller !	-1
I did n't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon . The Duracell photos were all different -- none of them D batteries in a package of eight . On the product description page , it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image . When I read reviews , many buyers received their batteries unpackaged , just thrown in a box . Others received them in individual bags . A few years ago , I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet -- not the brands they say they are , but fakes.SOOO ... no thanks . I 'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time .	-1
I play my radio 8-10 hours a day and thought I would buy Duracell , even though they are more expensive then the energizer batteries . These last no longer than the energizer , so no use in spending the extra money , they just are n't worth it .	-1
Had Chinese symbols on the bottom and Euro warning on the side . Ca n't find any in the USA with these markings . Avoid-you 're not really saving any money-you 're just throwing away what you pay . Would you trust your family to these in your smoke detector-I would n't ! ! !	-1
maglite used to be the standard for good flashlites . not anymore . this one has poor illumination and uses batteries like there 's no tomorrow . The battery cap does n't want to thread back on . And it should have a toggle instead of a screw on/off switch . and there 's no replacement bulb . and several times when the batteries have been replaced the bulb blew out and they 're difficult to find . a piece of S*** !	-1
I bought this flashlight after seeing all the advertising for Maglite . What a disappointment ! It is small and puts out maybe 20 lumens of light , if that . The lumens are so low that Maglite never even lists the lumens on any of its products , unlike its competitors.This thing might make a decent booklight but that is not what I bought it for . For the same price at this over-hyped , underperformer I could get a flashlight 5x as powerful !	-1
This flashlight looks and feels great but it runs down batteries immediately . Now my rarely used Maglite ca n't be opened to replace the battery - I suspect the battery leaked and glued the compartment shut . In any event , it 's dead after a very short life . Do n't buy	-1
I 'm clueless as to whom these trashbags are marketed . I bought them and find them pretty annoying . For one thing they DO NOT 'stretch and grab ' as the marketing info says . They just hang there . If you want grabbing , try Hefties & # 34 ; Hefty Gripper Tall , 13 Gallon Kitchen Bags ) . They 're awesome.The other thing Easy-Flaps do n't do is hold as much garbage as other Tall Kitchen bags . Because of their construction they barely fit our can , plus unless you under-fill them , there is not way to tie them off.The only good point about these bags is that they are 1 mil plastic . Otherwise they fall far short of what 's needed in the kitchen .	-1
Not very sturdy . Bristles are too soft . Only lasted about a month before I wanted to get a new one .	-1
Generally , I have many positive experiences on Amazon with the exception of this vendor . Please let me explain ; I received these batteries and noticed that they had an expiration date of 2027 . Wow ! I was `` pleasantly surprised '' for the long shelf life . I then placed the batteries in my drive way alarm and noticed that my drive-way alarm did not work properly . I immediately thought that I had a defective drive-way alarm . However , I decided to check the volts of these batteries with my multimeter and was quickly surprised that 5 batteries out of 8 were defective and actually was only producing less that 1 volt . They should be 1.5 volts . After contacting the vendor , they had me send the batteries back for testing which I had to pay for . Since then , I have not heard hide nor hair from this company . They will not communicate with me . That 's wrong ! Do yourself a favor and purchase these somewhere else ... .	-1
Supposed to last 6 to 8 times longer than alkaline or rechargeables and produce 600+ pictures on a digital camera . Took between 20 and 25 pictures . Next day , camera turned on , flashed low batteries , and died . Eveready wants the batteries for testing . Seems to me , they have already been tested . MJR	-1
Amazon lists these batteries under rechargeable AA batteries . They are NOT , repeat NOT rechargeable . I would not have ordered them for the application I purchased ( underwater strobe for week 's diving ) if Amazon had not incorrectly listed them .	-1
I used to love these Energizer AA Lithium Batteries . No more . The life of the battery is far too short compared to the ones I have bought in the past .	-1
i was uneducated in lithium batteries . i thought they were rechargeable . but have come to get info from energizer via their telephone rep..that only lithium ion batteries are rechargeable ... that lithium batteries as these are NOT.to me then , the price value is just not there . for the price paid for these i can buy around 36 good alkaline cells.update : i have found these batteries to not last as long as regular alkaline batteries ... .e.g . i get about 6 months use on a clock from an alkaline but only two months on these lithiums ... .obviously then i will stick with alkaline over these ... .i have tho moved to using rechargeable cells for nearly everything anymore- usually the enelop from sanyo- these are very good and certainly cost effective ...	-1
My old brush got all smashed together and had this sort of bald spot in the middle and could no longer reach a spot in the bottom of my coffee cup , so I bought this one . I wanted to like it , but it 's so soft that it does n't really scrub the spot on my coffee cup either .	-1
Great design , very poor execution . The bristles are so soft that the brush deforms if you leave it in the sink . Does n't clean my stainless coffee carafe thoroughly .	-1
I 'm not sure why this has such good reviews . It works decently for the sides of the bottle but the top bristles quickly flatten and it does not get the bottom of bottles clean . I would spend more money for a better brush .	-1
I was expecting something a little firmer to really scrub out the gunge in my water bottle . This only works if I use it while things are still 'fresh ' .	-1
Very disappointed in this product . The bristles are too soft to really clean grout and the shape of the head is n't optimal for that purpose either .	-1
I have stuff I needed to scrub really hard to get clean . The bristles on this brush bend and fold over . They are long and just do n't feel like I can get any muscle behind my scrubs .	-1
The box contains a large warning : This product contains/may contain a chemical known to cause cancer , birth defects or other reproductive harm . Now , why would I want to wash my clothes with a product that contains such a chemical ? Of course it 's being returned.Secondarily , the box states `` Made in USA '' , while the plastic wrapper inside says `` Made in China '' . They do n't even know where it 's made .	-1
I received this battery in the proper packaging just as the picture depicts but the battery was just as dead as the one I was trying to replace . Yes , I can return it for refund but after Ive paid the shipping to send it back I 'm hardly better off . I should have just gone to radio shack in the first place.Ive bought bateries three times on amazon ( two different sellers ) and they have always been useless.Lesson learned .	-1
Strange - the pack was definitely unopened , but one of the cells was pretty dead.Too much hassle to return , so I 'll just accept that I got one expensive battery .	-1
I had used Duracell previously in Mail Chime ( ASIN B00103FDDU ) and been very satisfied with the life and the simple and plain date code / expiration date on the Duracell . I have to change out the Duracell twice a year , so I thought I 'd see if the Energizer had a longer life . These Energizer only lasted a few days before failure . They were new and sealed in package with Use by date of September 2015 . Based on Duracells having expiration dates about 3-4 years out , I thought this was odd and contacted Energizer . Energizer indicated the A23 batteries have a 3 year shelf life and that my package was made in December 2012 , would expire in December 2015 and should be used by September 2015 . I wish they would print something like that or more consumer friendly on the package . So my batteries were reasonably fresh and I do n't know why they failed so quickly . Switched back to the Duracell version and they work fine , so I 'm sticking with them for my application . Both the Energizer and Duracell batteries came from the same Amazon merchant .	-1
There was no good till date on my packaging . This was taken off a strip of batteries not what is posted . No date on package . Does it expire 2013 ?	-1
Steel wool replacement my butt . You can go to the fish store and buy the filter pads that come in like a 1 ' X 1 ' sheet and cut your self up 6 of them .	-1
I purchased this because several reviews said that this comes with a prepaid label to dispose of the old battery . It does not . If I had known that , I would have paid a couple extra dollars and bought an original equipment battery from APC rather than this third-party knockoff .	-1
Said it would work for the shaver my husband has and did n't . Just through it in the trash . For the price of the heads one can almost buy a new shaver . So that is what I will continue to do without any compaints from my husband that we should be buying heads . Wrong .	-1
I called Norelco and was told this was the head for one of my husbands shavers . It was not , so it was a waste of money to buy these . I have returned them but have postage expenses .	-1

Do you have migraines or Meniere 's disease or just have a sensitive head ? Do n't get any of the pulsating Oral B brushes . They will just make you nauseous or trigger a headache.I have used the classic Oral B electric brush for many years . A fantastic simple white design by Braun of Germany - since discontinued after Braun was bought by an American company . Now I have the simple low end non pulsing model . Essentially the same guts and head as the classic but with an ugly , over stylized , blue body.When the battery started to die on my classic model , I picked up a pulsating Oral B . It is really banging away at your teeth and does as good a job as the non pulsatinging . But it vibrates your jaw and skull like , well , a vibrating electric tooth brush ! After a month , it was just too much for me . I went back to the dieing battery original , but soon got its replacement as a gift.The verdict : I 'm in my 40s and I 've had about 6 different dentists ( moving from job to job ) in 5 different states . One was a professor at a dental college . After each visit , they all proclaim my teeth are in excellent shape . I use the cheapest Oral B electric brush ( non pulsating ) in the morning and before bed with Colgate Total . I also floss just one time before bed and use the Crest rinse for night time . I get them cleaned every 6-9 months.Save your money and get the cheapest Oral B electric toothbrush . I think it is on sale sometimes for about $ 10 .	-1
The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers , which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves . Once they 've got you as a customer , they figure the red ink will soon be the customer 's , not theirs . Purchasing another screen ( my 3rd or 4th in two years ) for a shaver that cost me only 20 % more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive . ( The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly . ) I 'd try a Norelco or Remington , but I think they 're all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company ( Gillette ? ) . I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towel -- or trying a Panasonic .	-1
This replacement pack used to work with Braun Series 7 ( 799CC model ) and I 've ordered it multiple times . I used this one because it was better than their other advertised replacement pack . Sometime in about the last year and a half , this part has changed ( but the name of the item has stayed the same ) and it no longer will fit the razor . So , not pleased with this of course ...	-1
Did not come in a box also states that it 's Lemonfresh.It 's not.Will not be buying it again.You have a pictures of something you are selling then you send something different to the buyer in my book.You are not telling the truth .	-1
I bought the Braun shaver and those were recommended with it so I got them but it turns out that they are for self cleaning shavers only .	-1
If you have any inkling you might not like the shaver ... . because they wo n't let you return itFunny that it is save enough to mail to us but not save to mail back to them ! ! ! ! Very Bad PR for Braun Products ! ! !	-1
I no longer have the shaver which requires these since this liquid eventually starts to eat away at the shaver itself . I replaced the shaver with a Panasonic that uses water/soap based cleaning solution instead of chemicals .	-1
I wish I had listened to the other negative reviews . But since I had a great promotion coupon ( got it for almost free ) , I decided to ignore them and try it out for myself - now I wish I had n't ! It definitely is NOT a massager , just a vibrating machine . Now I must confess that I was n't 'fooled ' or 'tricked ' or anything , I knew it would vibrate . I just figured that with so many positive reviews I might like the vibrating action . Trust me , if you 're not sure whether you 'll like a vibrating machine at your foot , chances are you WON'T.Since I ca n't return this product due to the promotion , I 've learned how to 'tolerate ' the vibrations by putting only portions of my foot on the machine at a time . For instance , I just use the ball of my foot or the toes only - then the vibrations do n't feel so bad . Still , who wants to learn how to 'tolerate ' a product ! As for the infra-red heat - I think most other reviews said the same thing , it 's lukewarm at best . I seriously doubt it could keep you warm in winter.So unless you actually like vibrating machines at your feet ( or if you get it for practically free like I did ) I would strongly recommend that you NOT waste your money with this product .	-1
Your Description : Even if it were perched on a spoonful of sugar , most aspirin tablets do not go down easily . But they do if they 're chewable and cherry flavored . We bet Mary Poppins herself would have switched to these low-dose tablets if they 'd been available when she was caring for the Banks family . In fact , Mr. Banks himself might have taken them , as they 're designed for adults , too , especially those on a doctor-recommended daily regimen of aspirin.Funny you should mention that ... Dick Van Dyke ( the chimney sweep in Mary Poppins ) lost his 13 year old granddaughter to Reye 's syndrome after being given 'baby ' aspirin ! ! NO spoonful of sugar there ! Further more , Bayer does NOT make this product anymore . In 2007 the aspirin manufacturer 's agreed to discontinue Childrens Aspirin due to Reye 's Syndrome ! They will send you Bayer 81mg 'baby ' aspirin - which will soon go the way of children 's aspirin ! Why ? This aspirin product is NOT for children under the age of 19 ! ! This product is NOT used for children 's headaches ! ! This product is NOT used for fever , teething , or any other symptoms in children without a Doctor 's supervision ! ! This product has been proven to trigger Reye 's syndrome a deadly and often fatal disease in children ! Please learn more about aspirin and children at [ ... ] ! Please learn more at The National Reye 's Syndrome Foundation 's website !	-1
This works to help moisterize your nose but it contains 2 types of parabens which are bad for you and possibly cause cancer I 'm not even sure why these are needed since the only main ingreidtant is aloe and water . One might just use aloe juice . There are other things you can use in place of this and they might be better off than putting parabens in your nose .	-1
Smells good but did not help me .	-1
If you have dry , cracked nasal passages this will sting like nobody 's business.It 's moisturizing effects only last for a few minutes and then you have to reapply .	-1
Whats great about Vick 's Vapo Inhalers are that they smell nice , are a little soothing , and they easily fit in any pocket.The problem however is that they ca n't and/or do n't work the way I expect them to.A stuffy nose is due to swollen membranes in the nasal cavity . If you 're COMPLETELY stuffed up , then you ca n't even inhale the product through your nostrils to work . This is flaw # 1 as you ca n't use a nasal product if you ca n't even breathe in or out of your nose.The 2nd reason for me that I 'm not impressed by the product is that if I 'm only partially stuffy , the product DOES NOT reduce any inflammation at all , at least not in me , and even if it could , the effect is only temporary on levels of only a few seconds . Not even a minute later , I 'd be right back to stuffy levels.I like the product because of it 's portability and smell and may buy it again because of that , but its not any solution to my nasal congestion problems .	-1
I have a horrible armpit odor problem , I have tried everything it seems like so I bought this and tried it out and it gave me horrible bumps on my armpits , it took forever for them to go away , i was not able to wear anything on my armpits except for Bromi-talc which helped for a few days but stopped as well . I am not sure what to do about my armpit odor problem , it is embarrassing and i just want to find something that works .	-1
I know everyone 's skin has a different level of sensitivity , so please keep that in mind when reading this review.I would n't say I have overly sensitive skin , but it 's also not the most hardy . I followed the directions to the letter with this deodorant and could not get it to stop burning and itching . Even the lightest of applications were awful .	-1
When I first read the reviews for this product , I thought this could really work . My dermatologist had prescribed a similar product before and I figured this would be a good OTC alternative.When I got the product I applied it for 3 nights in a row . After that my hands and feet were completely dry . I thought it was heaven and it gave me so much more confidence . I used it a couple of more nights and at the same time I started having a severe allergic reaction . My whole body started severely itching and I broke out in hives in a lot of different places . I went to my doctor who tested everything and could n't find a reason for the severe itching . I was in severe discomfort from the itching for about 2 - 3 months ! ! ! I did n't make the connection to the deodorant until this week . I had n't used the deodorant ever since the initial couple of applications . But I did put it on my hands again last week . My itching had just started to subside and I was so relieved . But after putting the deodorant on again the severe itch has returned.I started to search through all the different reviews of Certain Dri to see if anybody else experienced a similar reaction and lo and behold another reviewer experienced the exact same thing ! ! ! ! ! I also have to add that I am not particular sensitive to allergens . I have no other known allergies . But this was one of the worst experiences in my life . PLEASE USE THIS PRODUCT VERY , VERY CAUTEOUSLY ! !	-1
I wanted to give this roll on a try for a few weeks before I 'd jump into a definite conclusion . I 've been using Certain Dri for about 8 wks now . I bought it at a local pharmacy , was n't cheap . I followed the instructions and I got ta say that it only helped for the first few applications . After that I started having irritation , itching , skin staining , clothes discolored and the perspiration was back.I stopped using it for about 2 weeks to see if my body had gotten used to the ingredients and perhaps that made it stop working . But that did n't do it . I still wash 2-3 times a day with antibacterial body wash and wear antiperspirant deodorant . Certain Dri seems a temporary fix for a permanent problem . Wo n't buy it again , it 's just wasting money .	-1
I have severe lactose intolerance ( not an allergy , `` just '' intolerant ) and I usually use the `` Ultra '' form of this product . However , since I used to be okay with the `` Original '' strength Lactaid , I thought this might be more economical , even if I had to take multiple tablets . I was wrong . For some reason , these tablets just did n't work for me , even when I took 3 or 4 tablets for something that would be managed by a single `` Ultra '' tablet.So , if you are really sensitive to dairy products , then you 're better off with `` Ultra '' Lactaid , rather than `` Original '' Lactaid .	-1
The lactaid product is wonderful for anyone that is lactose intolerant . The lactase supplement helps greatly . But go with the tablets . I bought a box of the chewables , and they are terrible . I take them now just because I paid for a box and want to get my money 's worth . And once I finish this box , I will always go with the tabs . Granted , ther are more convenient in a place without water ... but at the same time , when would you be eating without any liquid to take it down with ? Stick to the tabs , you 'll be happier .	-1
Caused severe nausea and vomiting . Only took it twice before I figured this out . I will stick with lactose intolerance . It 's more fun !	-1
The chew-able tablets , worked much better for me . These are not as good as the original product . This appeared to be a good deal for 120 , but it 's not . You do n't save any money .	-1
I sent these back because you have to take 3 pills each time you need it . I ordered the one that requires only 1 pill each time .	-1
I tripled the dose before having a small scoop of ice cream at some friends and it 's 9 hours later with no improvement in my terrible discomfort all around . I was tested for lactose intolerance years ago although no milk allergy . I normally avoid it . I hope by the morning I 'll be better .	-1
Never used again cause they did n't help . Could be because i have a bigger problem , or because they just do n't do anything .	-1
Lactaid Chewable Tablets are heavily sweetened with mannitol , an alcohol sugar that I find problematic . When I told my GI doctor that I do n't seem to tolerate mannitol , he said , `` you and the rest of humanity . '' For me , at least , mannitol causes the same symptoms as lactose . In addition to the mannitol , these tablets have a strong , artificial vanilla flavor that does n't go well with foods containing garlic , for example .	-1
WHY is the tipped to this hooked ? ? ? ? Everything is wrong with this drop , WHY would the tip be hooked ? I ALMOST poked my eye out , I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE LET ALONE ANYONE WITH VERY BAD EYE SITE LIEK MYSELF . The tips hooked so you poke your eye out then all the drops run down your cheeks NON get into your eye , WHAT genius came up with this ? You can not reseal these to use later in the day like most preservative free drops you can . AND the tip CLOGS so you cant even use it a few minutes later even . If you try with pressure to unclog it it will shoot across your bathroom . What a mess these drop are , I ca n't belive something this bad is in production.WHY would you put SALT in your dry eyes ? That would dry them even worst or cause your eyes to become dependant on these drops . I researched this and any salt solution is not good for your dry eyes.DO NOT BUY . I 'm going back to systane .	-1

He 's not even 3 and flying cross country so we figured & # 34 ; try anything to keep him comfortable. & # 34 ; Yeah he hated these . Would not , absolutely would not , wear them . He flew fine without them , though ! Great idea , probably a great product , just did n't work with our boy .	-1
The reason for this is because of the design . Instead of having a tapered curved sleeve style plug similar to the Etymotic ER20s , these have sharp ridges stab into your ear canal . They feel soft to the finger but in actuality apply more pressure on the ear canal than the standard sleeved style ear plug . There are four ridges that taper in size and they really do push out on the ear canal as you push them into your ear . It hurts like crazy . Curved sleeve tapered earplugs , those ones lay against your ear canal and distribute the pressure across more ear canal surface . With these all the pressure reside along these sharp ridges.I 'm very disappointed in these . I thought they were sized for kids ( which they are ) , they seem to hurt more . I know earholes differ greatly from person to person . Mine happen to be about 3/16th of an inch in diameter . I really ca n't see any child wearing these comfortably , much less an adult with tiny earholes like myself .	-1
I do n't understand why this deodorant had such good reviews . It takes forever to dry and even afterward remains sticky . Also not a fan of the white streak marks this deodorant provides .	-1
You can get this for under $ 4 at Target.. even better , you can buy the Target brand maximum strength for under $ 3.. the Target brand is thicker , and does n't smell like an old lady drenched in 40 year perfume .	-1
While there is nothing wrong with the product , I am APPALLED by the magnitude of over-pricing on Band-Aid branded bandages . I am not blaming the retailers . I have also noticed that Band-Aid seems to be & # 34 ; eliminating & # 34 ; competing generic offerings , especially if they are in similarly sized boxes.Right after I received this I found packages of generic bandages with 100 total strips of assorted sizes at Walmart for 88 cents . That 's $ 0.88 ! I checked several Walmarts BEFORE I ordered Band-Aid , but there was no better generic offerings , it was only AFTER ordering that I found them.Nonetheless , I do n't have a & # 34 ; good reason & # 34 ; to return these ( oh , I would , if I could , but it 's not the seller 's fault , so I do n't want to make them take losses on S & H ; ) , but I will be avoiding Band-Aid brand with even more resolve now .	-1
To add the to review titled `` cheap as can be '' , I would like to add my reactions . The band-aid which is so thin , and sticky , that it comes apart is also hard on the skin . After 24 hours on a cut , I removed the band-aid . It was very difficult to remove , and then I noticed my skin was numb where the band-aid had been . Some days later that skin peeled off and now my skin is back to normal.I would like to avoid this type of band-aid , but since every type of band-aid comes in the identical wrapper it is difficult to tell which type I have . Some types do n't stick too well and others stick too much . All in the same wrapper . Why not color code the wrappers so we could know and remember which type works for us ? Over the years we have seen different band-aid types , none of which seem as good as the original which would stick on for days , without being too sticky , or harmful to the skin.Band-aid seems to change for the sake of change , without real improvement . BTW- can any band-aid be opened without simply tearing the wrapper for instance ? Unfortunately , there does n't seem to be any competition , and therefore , evidently not a real effective band-aid.Update 9/24/2013 - I just found that Kroger now has a bandage , [ sheer bandages ] , that stays on for at least some washings , come off without coming apart , and do n't numb your skin .	-1
I did not think a `` Band-aid '' would warrant a review but thought otherwise yesterday . These bandaids are cheaply made and very strange . I have found similiar types bought in a dollar store to be better.DO NOT use these bandaids on a child or an older person . I am not sure what the adhesive material is but once on your skin the only way to get it off is by Carefully peeling , piece by piece , as though you were taking a rubber covering off of something.Yesterday , was not the first time I used one of this particular brand of `` Band-Aids '' from my box , but it was the first time skin came off with the adhesive . I had a cut I needed to keep clean while I worked with house plants . The bandaid got dirty but not wet . I had trouble getting it off . I have learned getting the bandaid wet really makes it worse . Thinking the last section would come off with no problem , I gentley pulled and a section of healthly skin came off with it.I hate waste . These bandaids are dangerous in my opinion . Mine are going in the trash . Sending them back to Amazon would amount to nothing . Johnson and Johnson 's quality has fallen so far off the grid by their outsourcing they no longer seem to care.Bottom line -- if you do use this Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandage be aware of potential problems with the adhesive strip .	-1
280 band ads into a big box and left it up to the user to try to find the right size while holding a wound . Good lock with that . I have to sort them out into baggies some day .	-1
I gave this product one star because I did n't even have the chance to really test it 's effectiveness because it started coming off the same day I put it on . I followed all the directions , washed and dried the affected area , etc , etc . My blister was on my hand , while most other people seem to have them on their feet from running.The directions clearly show that it can be applied to your hand ( actually their illustration showed the product being applied in the exact same spot I had mine ) . Well it stayed on for a while until I had to wash my hands and then it just started peeling off.The product says it can get wet and is made to stay on . Do n't get me started on the cost of these either . Regardless of which option you chose , your paying at least 80 cents per cushion . That 's a rip off . You could purchase 40 band aids for that price , use some neosporin and replace them each day . Much cheaper.Would not recommend .	-1
*This band-aid is the worst band-aid I 've ever tried . First of all , there is almost no way to cleanly take the backing off the individual band-aid . It is tough to do , and you have to touch the part that is supposed to go on your wound to do it . IF you can take it off and NOT have the whole band-aid wriggle up into a sticky mess , then you deserve a prize . It scrunches up and sticks to itself like saran-wrap . I had to use about 5 each time to get one to even go on . Then it does n't stick ! It lasts only a few minutes before it loses its adhesion and opens up . The only thing it sticks to for sure is itself and that 's before you get it on the wound . I 'm not sure what the `` water block '' does , as the band-aid comes right off if it is exposed to water . The band-aids are very light and appear to be cheaply made.The only reason I used them at all is that I needed them and there was a delay of a day or so before I could replace them . I went through almost the whole pack in that time . I only bought one pack , not the 6 sold here , and I 'm grateful for that ! Not recommended at all , for any use that I can think of . *	-1
MOST OF THESE ARE SMALL BAND AIDS - NOT HAPPY WITH THEM AT ALL ... IF YOU NEED LARGE BAND AIDS YOU DO N'T WANT A WHOLE BOX OF THESE AS MOST ARE ON SMALL SIDE.RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WITH SMALL CHILDREN .	-1
Folks , the `` active ingredient '' in this crap is Petrolatum - basically , that 's Vaseline Petroleum Jelly . And this junk contains 41 % of it . Regular Vasoline Petroleum Jelly contains 100 % . At less than 1/3 the price . So if you want to spent $ 6.00 on this vs. $ 1.50 on a Vasoline , please do n't let me stop you , but I 'm simply telling you basic science . The `` inactive '' ingredients include mineral oil and glycerin.This concoction is why pharmaceutical companies are despised around the world . Take $ 0.50 worth of Petroleum Jelly , throw in $ 0.02 cents worth of mineral oil and glycerin , and tout it as `` Advanced Therapy '' .It 's B.S . folks - pure and simple . Junk.Save yourselves some money and do yourselves a favor - but the cheapest Petroleum Jelly you can find ; Vaseline or store brand .	-1
I do n't know if technically the thing on my dogs ankle was a boil , but was hoping this stuffwould help draw out the gunk in it and it really did n't do much of anything after several daysuse . Others have been satisfied , but honestly I 'd give it half a star but to be fair I was usingit on my dog and probably the skin is tougher than what you 'd encounter with your average boil.If there is such a thing .	-1
I used a different product that is Acetone based so it dried & disappeared , leaving just the medicine in place . I like it still but thought a different product might be good so the fungus does n't get immune to it . As you might know , there is NO cure for nail fungus , not even by prescription , you can only control it . This product here is an oil , think what it can do to your socks or if any of it gets on carpeting etc . Also my nails started getting a dark cast to the top of the nails where this was applied . This product is no good .	-1
Tried every day for over a year . No improvement whatsoever and fungus spread to 8 other toes . Did n't work at all for me .	-1
I started using the Fungi-Nail solution shortly after my first order on 5/1/2013 . A lot of the reviews mention dramatic results . Given the vast differences in human constitution , I 'm not disputing these reviews . I have used Fungi-Nail religiously for 5 months , including regularly shaving down the nail to maximize exposure of the nail bed . I personally have not noticed any hugely discernible differences using Fungi-Nail . A slight improvement at best using only this solution . The name is indeed misleading , as mentioned in other reviews , and it does state is does not work on nails . On 7/2/2013 , I visited my dermatologist . I can not take Lamisil . She recommended using a solution of original flavor Listerine , distilled white vinegar directly after showering and letting it dry on the nail and surrounding tissue . She said to wear open toed shoes and no polish . She said it could take a year for a new nail to grow back healthy . She further explained that the deformed nail is the fungus ' opportunistic effect on healthy tissue . ( I knew this ... ) I 'm still using the Fungi-Nail solution several hours after the Listerine/vinegar application , once a day . I 'm seeing better results since using the Listerine/vinegar solution . We 'll see how my toe looks next May ...	-1
I purchased this stuff along with two other brands comprised of the same exact formula . It failed ! After trimming back the affected nails as far as possible , I saw significant healthy nail growth creep in for the next 9-10 months . However three bottles later , I was n't out of the woods yet . After a year and two month 's passing , now one toe is looking pretty bad again ( the nail lifted and turned yellow ) . It 's partially the same thing with two adjacent toes . There was some sign of good results ( pink healthy looking nails ) . But the still ever uncured infection remains present , still . So no dice ! The newer resurfaced infection came under new growth of healthy pink nails -- very unlike the first time . A whole newer ultra-paper-thin ( pseudo ) nail showed underneath the new grown nails ; they in time got re-infected . The newer nails eventually became thick and yellow , and very itchy again and then painful.Anyway , I suppose everyone 's constitution and physical make-up varies and this stuff does kinda work . Well sorta ! But I 'm looking for a new remedy , because this did n't get the job done well enough for me . One good thing is no other nails became infected after I began using the product .	-1
My wife needed something to protect the bottoms of her feet and reduce pain caused by several corns on her toes . She tried these and said it increased pressure making it more uncomfortable to walk . We were n't expecting it to feel like fluffy pillows , but these did n't help at all . Maybe someone with a different condition and foot shape would benefit from these .	-1
This is neither anti-fungal or antibiotic . The packaging is small and cheap . Go elsewhere to find a good product . Expensive .	-1
UPDATE AFTER PURCHASE : PLEASE READ ! ! ! THIS IS *NOT* WHAT YOU THINK IT IS ! ! ! The title of my original review was `` There 's NOTHING better than this '' And it read `` I have used this for years ... First as kids in my parents house and then for my own kids.Have been guarding the last container like gold ... soooo happy to have discovered it here anew ! etc etc `` I even ordered not one but SIX bottles of the stuff from American Wholesaler , Brooklyn , NYHOWEVER when I received it IT WAS N'T THE SAME PRODUCTThe container IS SIMILAR BUT IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT.What I received is labelled `` Soothing , Protective Powder Helps prevent chafing and irritation - Keeps skin drier '' The original product ( the one pictured here as of Sept 10,2010 ) instead is `` Antiseptic First-Aid Powder For CUTS , Chafing and minor abrasions '' If it was just the label , who cares ... but the ingredient list is also different ! ! IT DOES NOT CONTAIN the active ingredient which is the antiseptic ingredient.Original : Active Ingredient Bismuth-Formic-Iodine followed by Inactive Ingredients : Bismuth Subgallate , Boric Acid , etcNew One ( the one on this listing ) Has NO active ingredient and the INGREDIENT order is different : Boric Acid , Magnesium Carbonate , Talc , etcThis stuff as listed is a fancy talcum powder like Goldbond , not the wonderful product we all remember.Make sure what you buy lists Bismuth-Formic-Iodine as its first and active ingredient.I asked for an exchange for the original antiseptic product I ordered or a refund .	-1
My gastroenterologist said to take sugar-free Metamucil . First I could n't find it ( must have been out of stock ; later was there ) then researched ingredients of the sugar-free and discovered it contains aspartame , which I feel is a poison ( Google it ) . If I occasionally get a little I do n't worry about it , but will not ingest it on a daily , deliberate basis.So I bought this regular Metamucil , started with a regular dose with plenty of fluid , experienced a pain like concrete at the duodenum , halved dosage and took daily with plenty of water . Every day I had worsening pain and cramps until one day it felt as though another dose would kill me . I have no way of knowing what reaction my body was having but I do suffer from more than my share of allergic reactions . Now you read what the ingredients are . FD & C ; yellow # 6 ? Google it . You may be startled . But that 's not all . Do you really need the sucrose ( sugar ) ? What about & # 34 ; natural and artificial orange flavor & # 34 ; ? Note the exact composition of & # 34 ; artificial orange flavor & # 34 ; is not specified . How does the manufacturer get away with that ? Then I asked friends whether they had any difficulty taking Metamucil . I got repeated stories of difficulties . Most simply refused doctors ' orders and discontinued the stuff.Now obviously I was determined to find a way to take the prescribed psyllium . So I did research then talked to my MD . It turned out that I could buy pure powdered psyllium husk by the ounce at a local health food store , so did n't have to sink yet another ten-spot in an unusable product but could assess with a tiny amount . The product is from a trusted company . Then I did more research and purchased pure powdered psyllium SEED capsules online , actually via Subscribe & Save from Amazon . Before I did that , I called the manufacturer to be sure there were no additives . I was pleased with the response.Guess what ? The pure psyllium is working . I prefer the capsules because when I mix the powder and take it that way , it 's hard to get that last bit of psyllium out of the glass . Then , obviously , I wash the glass which means that every day some grains of psyllium go down the drain where as we know , they expand to 50 times their size . How long before I 'll be calling the plumber because the drain is plugged ? Think about it.Metamucil - the use of psyllium husk ( or better yet , the seed ) - to solve health problems - is a real step in the right direction . But for some ( many ? ) of us , the additives are unnecessary and/or troublesome , to put it mildly . Thus I present my experience and my solution .	-1
This stuff burns my face and a bottle of it does n't last very long either ! ! ! ! I will never use it again . I once bought a bottle of Stetson Pre Electric that worked pretty good , but it was kind of oily ! For the most part , I 'm gon na used my old stand by : William 's Lectric Shave ! You ca n't beat the best ! ! ! !	-1
The odor was too strong for me . It was a fruity sweet smell but it was n't working for me . I had to wash my moustache within five minutes because I could n't stand it.Also the brown mustache had a strong white layer look to it . It was looking bad to me visually.It did hold the hairs into place for the brief time I used it.The only useful thing I got out of it was the small brush . Managed to pull one hair out but still nice addition to my comb / brush collection .	-1
I have heard rumors that some tubes of this stuff rock , while others do not . Regardless , I will not give it benefit of the doubt since inconsistent product is inexcusable . It did nothing for my mustache and I recommend it to nobody .	-1
I tried this product to get my mustache to stay down and not to bristly . Did not work as well as I had hoped .	-1
I received the product and tried it as per the instruction ... What a mess and very displeased ! WM	-1
The quality of the product was fine . It 's just that it does n't seem to really do anything . I 've had better luck with a pair of fine tip metal tweezers . I imagine a metal one would do the job better .	-1
I have used Superfloss for years- this new version is a caricature of the original product.What 's wrong with it ? 1- the threader part used to be longer & stiffer , thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework , especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth . Now it 's short , flimsy , & bends so easily , it does n't do the job it was designed to accomplish2- the floss portion used to be much thicker , fluffier & stronger . Now it is a mere shadow of itself , and as such is totally useless . And , it shreds ! I had read the poor reviews , and always try to keep an open mind . Now I know that the poor reviews are spot-on . This stuff is worthless . Do not waste your money . Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution .	-1
I had to try this after reading its description . My denture comfort liner had come off ( as my orthodontist said it would ) and I could n't afford an airline trip to have him reline my upper denture . I was tired of my denture cream liquefying on me , and replacing the cream at least twice a day to keep my dentures comfortable . Even after I faithfully followed the instructions , I got poor results . It felt like I had a liquefying gummy worm candy in my dentures after several hours ... and , much to my surprise , the stuff came off in a gooey mass . I even tried letting the cream air out on my dentures -- it 's an effort , just getting the cream out of the tube -- hoping that exposure to air might mean better results , but that did n't work either .	-1
This may be the world 's worst product . It is hard to work with , even when following the directions carefully . Once in place , it squishes out of your dentures all over the outside . No matter how much you clean it off , moer of it squishes right back out again . In addition , even after letting it set for thirty minutes or more , when the denture is removed , the cushion grip plastic like substance stays in your mouth ; not in the denture . No doubt , this manufacture was trying to make a product to help people but it does not work .	-1
This company is horrible . I purchased a certain type of Peroxyl and they substituted it with a Canker and Sore version which is not my problem . I wanted the regular mouth rince . Yhis is a bad way of doing business .	-1
The wonderful reviews prompted me to buy this product . I did read the back panel as shown for the product before purchasing but I did not realize salicylate is a sulfa drug . Within an hour after taking the first and only dose I tried I had terrible intestinal cramps followed by ... well what that is usually followed by . The good thing is this has lead me to find out that this chemical is not just in antibiotics . Here is a website with more information about salicylate . [ ... ]	-1
This product did not work for me , after the patch was on my arm for several hours i still felt i wanted a cigarettei bought the E-cigarette and it helped a lot , i will not buy again	-1
I quit smoking twice , so far ( hope I wo n't have to quit a third time but that remains to be seen ... ) .The first time I used NRT , specifically NicoDerm . I followed all the three steps , for as long as it was recommended . It worked , I was able to quit smoking . Staying quit though , that was a whole different matter . I took smoking again after about 3 months , and kept smoking for 6 months when I quit again . This time around I used Allen Carr 's method , and it was by far a more efficient method . It 's all about mentality and unfortunately , NRT reinforces the wrong kind of mentality .	-1
These razors do not shave as close as mach 3 blades . They do not pivot and are quite dull . I used two and quit before cutting my face .	-1
I have a tough beard . Barbers have said no to giving me a shave . I have been using Gillette Sensors for years and thought I would try Gillette 's latest marketing innovation.I 'm now on blade 5 and believe I can make a decent assessment of them versus Sensors , for my beard.Comfort : Poor , they started out dragging and they still drag . Switched to a vibrator handle , no improvement . Feels like the blades are bending rather than maintaining a stiff edge . My face feels it.Speed of shave : At first it was taking me twice the time to get a mediocre shave . After 5 blades , it still takes longer than a Sensor , with far more strokes and , only on occasion , can give me as close a shave.Close in places : Poor , they are simply to big to get into tight places.Ease of use : Different and not in a good way . They are large and the Sensors are far easier to put on and take off.Overall : If you have a tough beard , I 'd recommend you buy a few and be prepared to bail and go back to whatever you were using . Or , take a pass altogether . I bought 15 blades and am stuck for a while.Another Gillette marketing gimmick that , for me , does not deliver .	-1
These were usable but barely . I ca n't explain how or why but they came duller than what I usually get at the store . I love the convenience of ordering online but I ca n't get myself to try these again .	-1
Having shaved with Gillette Mach 3 blades for some time now , I believe these are a knock-off . They do n't have the feel of new blades and certainly not up to Gillette 's standards .	-1
I 'm tired of this game where you think you 're buying the same product you buy in the stores but it is anything but the same ! This was like shaving with a dull twin blade ! Took me twice as long to shave ! I assumed `` mach 3 '' was mach 3 ! I 'm going back to buying them at costco !	-1
Bought both the Mach 3 and Mach 3 Turbo blades here within the last six months and was sorely disappointed . I purchased my first package from CVS off the shelf and fell in love with the blades and razor , thought I 'd never use another razor . Then I needed some more and purchased here and was extremely disappointed . The blades were dull , some of the blue strips were already partially white , and I found that with both packs I bought . All the carts I used nicked and scraped and caused irritation . They cost too damned much to accept that . I do n't know if these were counterfeit , used/recycled/resold , or just decreased quality from the factory and really I do n't care : Never Gillette Again . I purchased a Schick Hydro 3 and was careful to get it from the Schick Store on Amazon as well as my blades along with my Prime shipping and am very happy with my decision . The Schick is better than the Mach 3 even when the Mach is a good quality and is less expensive all the time . After shaving with Gillette for 44 years I 'm a permanent Schick customer now . Gillette has forgotten it 's customer and arrogantly thinks it can charge what it wants and sell crap to prove it . Bye Gillette , hello Schick !	-1
I find that the Gillette Sensor 3 gives a far superior shave that the Mach3 for no other reason than the head swivels too much . I consider this a waste of money .	-1
Instead of producing billowing foam , these canisters produce a stream of liquid . I 've also bought the gel version of this product and have endured quality control problems . You 'd be wise to choose a different brand .	-1
I wish that I had not purchased this product . It only comes out as a watery liquid - no sign of 'foam ' or even 'gel . ' If I could give it a zero star review , I would . DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT - you would be sorely disappointed . I 'm just going to trash the remaining five cans and write them off ...	-1
Lac Hydrin is the best ever . But the bottle I received is not the one pictured . 8 oz ! It 's dinky . My fault for not catching the size difference , but shady to show the picture of the large bottle when you 're selling the small one .	-1
My husband brought this home to me and I was excited to use it . I have very dry skin and I am always looking for soothing body butters that moisturize . Well this stuff is not even close , and should not be considered by anyone with very dry skin . It goes on smooth and then disappears , never to be felt again . My skin sucked it right in and was dry again in about 10 minutes . There is a reason why it states on the label to apply twice a day , but it still did n't make a difference . Its an ultra liquified lotion.I 'm happy it worked for other people , but like Marissa , it did not work for me . For the record , I bought Nivea Essentially Enriched body cream . I love it ! Its greasy at first , but my skin is soft , smooth , and STAYS moisturized all day , AND you only have to apply it once .	-1
make you skin feel tight , light sunburn , and did n't work great for me.Have scars on my neck , and there is n't much difference after using this	-1
Purchased this to use on a thyroidectomy scar immediately after surgery . I used it for a year before giving up . It did provide some relief to the itchy dry feeling of a healing wound but it did nothing to diminish the scar.I also used this on a scar left from severe acne immediately when it was safe to use . It actually made it worse . My scar became beat red . I discontinued use and began to apply aloe gel to the scar . Within one day the redness was gone and the scar began to diminish.There are positive reviews on this product , maybe it will work better for you . It 's very expensive , I would recommend trying an aloe gel first , I purchased a large bottle for $ 3 at Trader Joe 's .	-1
I read the ingredients of this product and was no concerned about a reaction with any of them , and I allergic to almost nothing . However , when I used this product I broke out in a rash and even got hives . So , just beware if you have had any skin allergies .	-1
Does n't work ! Who is going to remember to apply this 3 to 4 times a day ? ! the advance one is much better , works quicker and only have to apply it once !	-1
IT IS LIKE YOU PUT ON SOME PASTE . IT DOES NOT GO INTO SKIN BUT LAYS THERE UNTIL YUOUR SO MAD YOU PEEL THE JUNK OFF.DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS I ALREADY DID FOR YOU	-1
Went to a dermatologist to have a mole removed , and also asked about my still healing scar from a laceration ( 5 stitches ) . She said that this product does n't really work . Most of the results people get are from the skin naturally healing .	-1
i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach . well , after just taking it for two days , i had a terrible reaction to it , felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something . your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level , so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill , but it definitely was n't good for me . i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills .	-1
This product ( by Nature 's Bounty ) claims that there are 1 billion ACTIVE Lactobacilli in the pills . The best established test for ACTIVE Lactobacilli is to give them substrate ( warm milk ) and let them grow over night . Test Result : Two pills smashed to powder and mixed with warm milk ( 37'C ) did NOT produce any growth ( fermentation ) overnight ! . That means that Nature 's Bounty is selling us Cellulose + Fructose flavored with strawberry . Should have done this test earlier . Will never buy from Nature 's Bounty again . And will start testing one after another other vendors . Hope there will be a product for real ? !	-1
The joke is that this deodorant is not the one we received , even though we wanted this one . Yes , I am aware that I am not rating the correct product , but another Speed Stick ( the one that comes in white and smears , and was the last one we wanted ) product . Makes anyone upset to order an specific product and receive a totally different product instead . That is why the 1 Star review . For if someone chooses this product and receives one they did not order , I think that would warrant a star . Noticed this has happened more than once , according to other reviewers , and that is Baloney , because what it means is that someone in a warehouse is substituting products at their whim.I know the actual product is great , exactly what we wanted , but since it is deceiving in showing the picture when there are no intentions on delivering that product , I give this one 2 Stars at most .	-1
My husband is very picky about shave gels , primarily because he is most concerned about razor glide and his sensitive skin . My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack , even though the price was under $ 3 a can with super saver shipping . He is not happy with this product . He 's been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products , namely , Gillette Fusion , which he prefers . Also , insofar as use on his sensitive skin , the gel is only so-so . The fragrance is okay with him . However , what he particularly does n't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide . Now we have about four cans left , which he will grudgingly use , unless I can find him a deal on Fusion . He 's encouraging me to find one ... soon .	-1
I used the paste day and night and it did nothing . I do n't drink coffee or smoke cigarettes neither do I eat foods that stain your teeth . This is probably only food people that have teeth-staining habits such as the above . I just did n't see a different after about 2 weeks of use . If you want a whitening paste , try a better quality brand .	-1
Friend told us this works for his aches and pains . We bought 2 tubes for my husband 's arthritic knee and it does n't work any better then over-the-counter stuff ; which does n't work . Everyone is different but I still can not see how any topical will penetrate deeply enough to work .	-1
Putting Ice Water bottles at the end of my feet when I am in bed is way better than what this did for me . I guess it works from others that have swelling in the knees or different pain than I have .	-1
Not too helpful ...	-1
I have fibromyalgia and this was n't effective for me at all . bummer . It was recommended by Dr. Oz but did he actually try it himself ?	-1
I purchased this after hearing about good housekeeping secrets to staying young . This is the second bottle I have purchased and honestly I see no noticeable difference . I am 30 , in good shape , and take care of myself - I think I would notice a difference but sadly this seems to be a bunch of B.S. , do n't waste your $	-1
Ok ... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night . The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed , fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes ( I was already a little tired ) and then BAM I felt hyper . Every other time I tried it since then ? Nada . I might as well be drinking water.As for taste ... I love me some straight up spirits , so the alcoholy part did n't bother me . It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of , I do n't know.. some sort of flavored vodka . I 'm certainly drank worse things .	-1
I tried to use this but could not get past the taste . I took it several times any way but it did n't work that well either . Sorry	-1
Gaba by source natural seems to be the only thing for sleep over the counter that works . When you use this you 'll tast a strong alcohol tase . Almost like taking a sot of everclear . I think that 's the secret it 's the alcohol .	-1
ABSOLUTELY DID NOT LIKE THIS AS IT HAS QUITE A LOT OF ALCOHOL IN IT - THE TABLETS DO N'T - DISAPPOINTED IN THIS LIQUID FORM OF MELATONIN.RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY ALCOHOL AND CAN TOLERATE IT .	-1
These caplets are fine to swallow and have everything I need in them . My doctor told me I was low on iron so I 've been trying different vitamins with Iron in them . In these vitamins though is an additive that turns my urine to bright yellow no matter how much water I drink . I do n't care for that . I went to the doctor to see if I was having a bladder or kidney problem and all is well . The doctor told me it was the food coloring that they put in them . Why do that ?	-1
Used as described and they did n't work for me at all . I actually got more often sick while using them then not using anything at all . Went back to my regular brand of vitamins as these just do n't do it .	-1
will my quest for the magic bullet ever cease ? i guess not , because i continue to be a sucker for these types of pills . after reading a good review in first for women magazine , i ordered two bottles . i have taken it religiously 3x day with meals , and nada . zero . zip . zilch . nothing . sigh ... .	-1
This product does not work . I tried it and after 2 bottles , I saw NO results . Not worth the money , its a complete waste . I do n't recommend this product .	-1
I have been taking this for a couple of months and I ca n't really tell whether it is really effective or not .	-1
***EDIT**** this edit is written over a week after the original review , my original review had been very positive as I had noticed a quick response after taking this and seemed to notice fat loss and increased metabolism . However , after a week of taking this I noticed increased fat gain mostly in my stomach where I never gain weight which has been quite hard to lose . I 've also noticed that the side effects of increased temperature went away after s few days . I heard that cla only works if lifting weights or exerciseing heavily otherwise the acid turns into fat . I stopped taking it and am working on ridding of the excess stomach fat it gave me . Im currently trying cayenne pepper to speed up my metabolism which so far seems to be working.Note**I did NOT buy CLA Tonalin on amazon , I bought it in the grocery store ( Hannaford ) for about ten dollars but before I even got to the cashier , I was on my smart phone looking up the product on amazon to see how its rated . I trust the reviews on here so I decided I 'd make my own.Also**I am not overweight but I have gained ten pounds since the semester started at college . I could blame it on the beer or pizza but the only reasons I was indulging in those things was because I had gone through a very stressful event right before fall semester started and stress apparently makes me overeat all the wrong foods . I usually am extremely healthy and eat a gluten free , paleo diet.My weight was relatively stable in November ( and no still not overweight , just a much curvier version of myself ) . Then of course another extremely event had to occur right before final exams , by that point I given up the unhealthy lifestyle but still found myself over eating purely out of stress . I also never slept , I would n't fall asleep until past midnight , would have to get up at 5:30 am for school and then nap during the day . I was always tired and had headaches and stressed and anxious , and my sleep schedule and stress could add on weight , but eating too much on top of that made me gain weight like crazy . After gaining 4 pounds in a week I freaked out , I had to do something different , I could n't stand all of the excess fat , I could barely squeeze into my jeans ! I still was n't overweight but I definitely was n't considered tiny like I used to be ! So I started working out more ( not really but going from like one day to two days working out ) and tried very hard to eat less and de-stress during the day . I picked the CLA up while trying healthier habits and have noticed a big difference in fat loss . I gain weight mostly in my hip area and used to never have fat around my stomach so its very easy for me to tell if I 'm gaining or losing weight just by looking at my stomach and how much I can grab . ( Ten pounds ago I could n't grab anything ) . Well when I was at my heaviest I could grab quite a bit , around my bellybutton and my sides . This has decreased by about half . Also , my hips have a little less fat . And I had just picked up the CLA three days ago ! Now you could say , well this could be due to the increased exercise or eating less before taking the CLA and I agree , it could be . So I 'm only giving it 4 stars for now and I 'm going to come back and rate again . ( Though , my sleep schedule has NOT changed ) .However , there are things I have noticed immediately from these pills besides fat loss : -Increased temperature . I 'm ALWAYS cold plus I live in the second most northern state in the U.S. and its in the teens here . I 've gotten to the point where three hours or so after I 've taken a pill I have to go outside to cool down when my roommates are huddled in their electric blankets.-I 'm starving . Again , this is the same time frame as when I notice a dramatic increase in temperature ( about 3 hours after taking the pill ) . I feel like a teenage boy , I ca n't stop eating , and its not sugary fatty foods I crave like when I 'm stressed , its high carb foods , the quickest thing to fill me up , flavor not mattering . I 've been eating WAY more than usual from taking these pills . I used to only be able to eat toast in the morning , never for dinner or I 'd gain weight ( I love toast lol ) but now I can eat 2 slices at night ( 40 carbs ) plus potatoes and squash and soup and chicken and a whole bag of light buttered popcorn and hot cocoa and lemonade and a granola bar and coconut ice cream and not gain weight , which is pretty amazing , since before , I would only the vegetables and chicken and maybe 1/3 a bag of popcorn and hot cocoa and not gain weight.My schedule with CLA : *Breakfast : ( 6 am ) : I eat 3-4 slices of gluten free toast , greek yogurt , two cups of coffee . I do NOT take CLA , I figure my metabolism is highest in the morning and its not going to do much . *Lunch # 1 : ( 11 am ) : I have a spinach and fruit smoothie made with rice milk instead of fruit juice and only a little bit of yogurt . I do NOT take the CLA since the smoothie is really healthy compared to the rest of my meals . *Lunch # 2 : ( 1 pm ) : Full serving of Stir-fry with brown rice , light soy sauce , shrimp , and vegetables . I DO take a CLA at this point . *Dinner # 1 : ( 4 pm ) : Chicken , vegetables with light butter . I do NOT take a CLA . *Dinner # 2 : ( 7 pm ) : Chicken , vegetables with light butter , orange , hot cocoa , usually 20 min later..this is when cravings kick in . I DO take a CLA . *Dessert/Snack : ( 8:30-9 pm ) : Organic Popcorn , another hot cocoa , oranges , sometimes a granola bar or coconut ice cream . I DO take a CLA.So Overall , I eat like a hobbit . ( throughout the day ) . So I ca n't base it off the whole three meals a day thing but I do only take it 3 times a day . I take it with meals , usually later in the afternoon/night when my metabolism is lower . I also take it right after I finished my plate with ALOT of water.When I used to eat this much , I was gaining weight if I did n't work out . Now I eat this much and I 've barely increased my exercise regime , which is not intense , more weight training/resistance than anything , not much cardio at all.I 'm going to give it another week before I reply again.But what you should take out of this review so far is that I 'm young , healthy , not overweight , do n't eat really unhealthy foods , but I 'm used to being in a certain 5 lb range than I 'm out of . My increased weight was due to stress . The CLA seems to dramatically increase my temperature ( could be a direct correlation to metabolism ? ) as well as my hunger levels but decreases my cravings . I still have cravings but there very mild , I used to want to devour chocolate bars and cupcakes all the time ( I did n't but I wanted to ) whereas now , a hot cocoa suffices to curb my cravings .	-1
I bought 1 bottle , and took it faithfully as instructed while conbining excercise and good diet , but it did n't aid the fat loss process . I usually work out and eat healthy , and hoping that this product will accelereate the last 20 lbs that i wanted to loose after hitting a plateau , but unfortunately , it did nothing . It is like all other products out there , it 's a hit or a miss . It 's up to you if you want to spend $ 30 to give it a try .	-1
I love the peanut butter Balance Bars . People say these are good , but I thought they were horrible . My husband and older son did not like them either .	-1
I was hoping for a bit more energy and hoped these capsules would deliver the high claims from so many positive reviews . However , I observed no remarkable increase in energy . In fact , the only remarkable thing was the fluorescent yellow shade of my urine . Wo n't buy again .	-1
I bought mine a few months ago but only took them like 10 times or so . I only tried these because of the Rave reviews on here & I must say Im disappointed . Not only are they WAY TOO BIG , and have to take 2 which makes it a choir to take , a forgetful one at that ; but they dont really do much at all for me . It generally doesnt make me feel noticeably calm , relaxed , energized or anything . I expected so much better . Ill stick to my oneaday .	-1
You clearly see Stess B-Complex Caps . Well look carefully on bottle on right hand bottom it has Vit C in it . I can not take the acid of Vit C , thus had also ordered Ester C , non acidic . Greatly disappointed when it arrived to find the line under what you can see with any ease is saying VIT C also . I do well admit it was on confirmation of order but had to go back and read for first time . I look at what is on screen to order and seldom look at confirmation as most who order a lot on Amazon . Amazon , LOVE IT ! !	-1
I guess the vitamns are ok , but the big capsule it comes in is the kind that gets stuck in the throat too easily . I just about gagged to death this morning ( well , not quite that bad ) but bad enough so that I 'd finally had it ! I threw the rest away and will find an easiler to swallow B supplement .	-1
I noticed my daily multi-vitamin did n't have any Vitamin E in it , so I was looking for an appropriate supplement on Amazon . While looking through products and reading current literature , I found the following : - Vitamin E does not decrease mortality in adults , even at large doses , and may slightly increase it.- It does not improve blood sugar or decrease the risk of stroke.- Daily supplementation of vitamin E does not decrease the risk of prostate cancer and may increase it.- Studies on its role in age related macular degeneration are ongoing as , even though it is of a combination of dietary antioxidants used to treat the condition , it may increase the risk.- It may also contribute to osteoporosis.The most concerning is a study from the Annals of Internal Medicine : `` Meta-analysis : high-dosage vitamin E supplementation may increase all-cause mortality . `` Their final conclusion : '' High-dosage ( > or =400 IU/d ) vitamin E supplements may increase all-cause mortality and should be avoided . `` Vitamin E is theoretically helpful , but realistically it appears to be harmful . Some people have suggested the harmful results apply only to the synthetic version of vitamin E ( Dl-alpha ) , and not the natural , but there has been no study in peer reviewed literature to suggest `` synthetic '' or `` non synthetic '' matters . The names do n't even make sense -- they 're both synthetic , one is just a closer structural mimic of whats found in food . It is still synthesized , specifically by methylation of gamma and beta tocopherol vitamers ( plant oil extract ) .At the *very least* please try and stay under 400 IU/day . Good at chess , bad at life , as the saying goes .	-1
I thought I was ordering regular tip tweezers . I knew it said slanted but it does n't really warn you that the slanted tips are pretty sharp and thin . I do n't like them at all . I only gave them 2 stars because they are of a decent quality material .	-1
... not sharp edged enough , crooked when pinch/close together . Now I know to buy tweezers in person only , to ensure sharp enough with more precision .	-1
Bought this and found it didnt grab so good . Better to invest in the tweezerman equivalent which costs more i believe but better as a permanent solution	-1
I purchased these blades from MG Electronics via Amazon . These blades are horribly dull compared to the same brand of blades you may purchase from a reputable retailer . I was unable to get even one shave from the blades ( I have attempted with two ) . I will attempt to return these to Amazon . Do not buy these blades.Update : I have had a prompt call from the seller and they have informed me that they received a bad batch of blades and have happily agreed to accept the return and cover my shipping costs . I 'm pleased with the resolution from the seller and their prompt attention .	-1
The test solution is only good for 3 months after opening . This fairly means thata new bottle needs to be purchased every 3 months . We pay a significant amount of money to Lifescan for test strips that are useless unless tested using their solution that expires 3 months after opening . If Lifescan 's policy is to not rip-off its customers , then they need to include the test solution with the test strips .	-1
I DONT KNOW WHAT I GOT..BUT WASNT WHAT IS PICTURED AT ALL ! ! IVE BEEN USING TENA FOR 2 YRS THATS ALL ( TRANQUILITY IS THE BEST BUT CANT AFFORD ) I ALWAYS BUY THE TENA `` ULTIMATE '' THICK & SOMETIMES THE THIN ONES THAT ARE GREAT TOO . I SAW THIS SAID EXTRA LONG AND WHY I BOUGHT ... ..WHEN I TOOK THEM OUT I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE IT HAD A BLUE LINER STRIP IN IT ? ? NEVER EVER SAW THAT IN A TENA PAD BEFORE ... I KINDA LIKED THEM BETTER THE WAY THEY LOOKED AND WERE A LITTLE LONGER BUT STILL CONFUSED BECAUSE THE PICTURE HERE DOES `` NOT '' SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT STRIP IN THE DESCRIPTION IT DOESNT SAY IT AND NO REVIEWS MENTIONED IT ( USUALLY ALL WHITE SO THOUGHT I 'D COME HERE AND SEE IF ANYONE MENTIONED IT ... BUT NOONE DID SO IM REALLY THINKING I GOT SENT SOMETHING..OLD ? ? BUT THATS NOT THE THING ... .THIS IS GROSS I HATE TO MENTION IT BUT AGAIN WHY IM WORRIED I GOT THE WRONG THINGS ... .THEY ... ... ... ..REEEEK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! BEYONK REEEK ! ! I KNOW YOUR SAYING UM MAYBE ITS YOU ... .LIKE I SAID I USE THESE TENA PADS DAILY EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE NEVER HAD ONE WHEN GOT WET EVEN JUST A DRIP WOULD MAKE THE PAD HAVE THE ULTIMATE GROSSEST SMELL ! ... I AM RETURNING I ONLY USED 3 WANTED TO VOMIT FROM THE SMELL..I EVEN DIDNT USE ONE I TOOK `` FRESH AGAIN '' INCONTINENT ODOR SPRAY ( GREAT STUFF SMELL GREAT ) AND WET THE PAD WITH THE THAT AND ... OMG ... THE ODOR CAME OUT ! ! NOW NOT ONE OF YOU MENTIONED THIS ... .SO OBVIOUSLY GOT SOMETHING ELSE INSIDE A TENA PAD ? THIS WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD FROM ANYTHING LIKE THIS ! SO BE BEWARE IF YOU GET A BAG WITH THE PAD AND A BLUE LINER IN THE PAD CHUCK THEM LIKE THEY ARE ON FIRE LOL ... ..	-1
lately with all the style changes I ca n't find what I want but they wo n't send me samples because I had samples before ... yes , I did , a long time ago and they keep changing the product and so I asked for current styles samples ... I am not happy with the changes and finding it difficult to find a brand that suits e as well as Tena USED TO DO	-1
These are useless ... they claim to be for heavy flow and long . They leak and are so short and thin , they should n't be misrepresented with the description you are using	-1
What happened to the quality of TENA pads ? They are nothing compared to what they used to be ! I will not be purchasing these any longer . POISE has much higher quality pads ! !	-1
This item does not provide full coverage as the picture suggests . It is small and the picture is deceiving . This product may work during the day , but I do not suggest overnight .	-1
I wanted a 'booster pad ' .. I thought that I had ordered 'booster pads ' .. I wanted a pad specifically designed to be placed inside of an adult wrap-around brief to add extra capactiy to the wrap-around brief by absorbing liquid until the 'booster pad ' was full and then passing excess liquid through the 'booster pad ' into the outside wrap-around brief . In effect making the wrap-around brief much more absorbent .. 'boosting ' its capacity.This is NOT what I received . I received a pad that is designed to be used by itself . These pads have a plastic outside cover designed to fully trap all liquid into the pad . While this is fine .. this is not what I thought I was purchasing.There is nothing in the ordering information to clarify this . There is nothing on the package to clarify this . IF I was purchasing this item in a store .. and holding the package up reading about the contents .. there is no disclamer stating that these pads are NOT 'booster flow-through pads'.The problem is that I ordered and that I received three ( 3 ) shipments of these pads .. each of a different design .. made by Tena and purchased through Amazon . Again each different but each the same in NOT being 'booster pads'.OH YES I KNOW.. You cut .. You slice .. the exterior plastic covering of each pad as you use it and you thus modify these types of pads to become 'flow-through ' pads because you have .. by cutting the plactic outer covering .. made them 'booster pads'.Smiles .. NOT The End Of The World by any means ..	-1
What obviously should have been listed as a three-pack of 36 pads each for $ 49.50 is a priced ( AND SHIPPED ) single pack of 36 pads . If this is , as Amazon claims , a change in supplier that has resulted in this HUGE increase , then Amazon NEEDS TO FIND ANOTHER SUPPLIER . Telling their customers that this is a legitimate product price increase just shows that Amazon.com is not paying attention to their customers AND their products . I hope someone at Amazon.com is looking at these recent reviews , since they do n't seem to be taking their e-mails seriously about this ludicrous price increase ! For people who need this product for medical problems , many of whom are on fixed incomes , these pads can still be found elsewhere for between $ 17 and $ 19 for a package of 36 pads .	-1
These are made for an obese woman not for a man . These are so wide and way too long that they are uncomfortable and do not fit normal men .	-1
This box is hard to open , and I have rather strong fingers . But it is designed for medical use , so many of it users are sick and/or old people , who are physically weak . A pill reminder which requires physical strength is an absurd .	-1
I love the clearblue monitor . It has been consistently reliable for me and I used it successfully to conceive my son . Once I bought these test sticks off Amazon , however , the monitor is n't working properly anymore . I 'm backing up my ovulation tracking with OPKs I bought at the drug store and despite the fact that they are showing an LH surge , the monitor is n't . This has never happened to me before . The ovulation tests from the drug store always coincide with the monitor . My cycle is so reliable and the monitor has been so reliable in the past that I suspect something is wrong with these sticks I bought off Amazon . I will not be using them next month . I will be buying a new box from another vendor .	-1
I bought this from someone NIB some time ago and have been using it for two cycles , and I 'm not yet impressed.I 've heard it `` takes a few months/cycles '' to `` learn '' your cycle , and some of the reviews I 've seen on here are making me very concerned that I wasted my money on this.IMO it should not have to `` learn '' my cycles . It should be reading if my LH and estrogen are increasing or not , no matter where in my cycle I am nor how many cycles I 've used it , as well as it should n't matter how many sticks I put into it . I do n't like the fact that it may read my levels incorrectly and cause me to be `` off '' on when my O date is . I might as well use OPKs and hope my husband and I have sex at the appropriate time to conceive.I like the six hour window ( three hours before and three hours after I hit the button ) . I like its ease of use.I am very unhappy with this product and feel that it is a waste of my time and money . The monitor has been reading HIGH fertility for the past few days , but the lines indicate it should be LOW fertility ( HIGH fertility shows two lines , Peak shows only one line , that is next to the pee end . Low shows only one line far from the pee end ) .Updated 6/7/2010 : Well today I decided to test my monitor by placing my LOW one from CD9 current cycle in the monitor for today ( CD26 ) . Now , remember , on CD9 the monitor read it as LOW . Well today the monitor read it as HIGH ! I 'm very upset and pissed that this monitor does not work . Unfortunately I most likely can not get a refund for this , or any type of compensation from Clear Blue .	-1
I got this monitor three years ago after trying for 5 months to conceive . I used the monitor as directed and it was showing high and peek days but I never got pregnant . I used the monitor for 8 months and at the end the monitor cause me to have depression cause all my life was based on that monitor . My husband and I converted into a machine and we did what we did when the monitor said its time to do it . It drove me crazy to a point that I told myself this is it and I took the monitor straight it to the garbage.So for some it may work right away but every case it 's different and every woman is different . Even though I gave it only 2 stars it does n't mean it wo n't work for you . I think everyone should try the cheaper urine test first for few months and see what happens . If that does n't work and you want to try it go for it . At the end I did get pregnant with my twin boys but it was via IVF no with the help of the monitor.P.S . Lot of reviews said the monitor did not work . There is a chance that the monitor you got was previously opened and used by someone else ( that happens with online shopping all the time ) however even then there is a way of cleaning up the entire information in the monitor by using old ( used stick ) and start fresh . That solves lots of issues with the monitor . It 's like resetting the entire thing and starting fresh .	-1
I have been using this monitor since January 2011 . I have not relied solely on it I am also doing BBT . The first month , since the monitor has to `` get used to your cycle '' I used in in conjunction with BBT AND ovulation sticks . The first 3 months , the monitor worked very well -- its readings were clear , accurate , and matched up with my BBT . After 5 months of using the monitor and 12 months of TTC total I started to get worried so I saw a reproductive endocrinologist -- I am only 33 years old.For the past 2 months , the monitor has told me my fertility was still high just a few days before my expected period -- and one month it told me I had not ovulated at all nor did I have any `` high '' fertility days . Yet , that same month my RE did an ultrasound and said that yes , I indeed ovulated ! ! I missed out on prime fertility time ! ! I am so disappointed . I had been scheduling around this monitor and to know it is this inaccurate makes me angry . And it is not cheap either -- neither are the sticks . So sadly , I am done with this . I thought I was some kind of freak since it was not working for me . Even my RE said to `` Throw it out , it 's only stressing you out anyway '' . What a waste ! I give it one star and I 'll give it an extra one since it did seem to work for the first 3 months . But if you do n't get pregnant within 3 months of using this , do n't worry , do n't stress and try something else .	-1
I normally do n't leave bad reviews , but this was a pretty expensive and frustrating item for us . The results were not consistent with other ovulation testing methods such as apps , temperature tracking , and tests done at the doctor 's office . I wish we had n't wasted our money .	-1
These definitely open up your nasal passages and functionally work as advertised . However , the first night I used them I woke up with a bruise-colored mark on the bridge of my nose where the strip was resting . The next time I tried them , I tried to put it on with more of an arch so it did n't rest against my nose . It did n't leave a mark in the morning but was surprisingly difficult to pull off and left a sticky residue on my nose that I had to scrub off . If this is the sensitive skin version , I definitely would n't want to try the normal version . Maybe I will give them another try and try to wear off the stickiness by sticking it to my shirt or something first , but I have n't been to excited about them thus far despite the many positive reviews that others have given .	-1
I really wanted these to work . I seem to get congested at night and these seemed perfect . I tried everything - different kinds of soaps , washing my nose two/three/four times , even different types of towels - but these would just not stay on . Even using two at a time did n't keep them on . They 'd only stay on for about an hour and then they 'd peel off the sides of my nose and just be stuck to the top . I 'm glad they work well for others , but for some reason , they do not stay on for me - and yes , I followed the directions/placement exactly .	-1
these are a dry wipesI ordered these wipes for my father , But they are useless , these are dry dry wipes	-1
Lightly scented waste of money . Like others I wanted this to work but it was n't going to happen . My quest for a natural deo continues .	-1
Only reason I gave these two stars is because I got them so cheap and they last for a time . Overall , I find that these ear plugs simply do not last nearly as long as virtually any other ear plug I 've used . I might use them for a week and they 're shot . The comfort level is good but they quickly get deformed . If I had my choice , I used to use these 3m ear plugs and a set of those would last nearly two months . But I have a hard time finding those anymore . *sigh	-1
Do not waste your money . This thermometer only measure 1/10 of a decimal point and it is such a pain to use . It remembers your last temperature and displays that instead of taking your current temp when you turn it on . There is only one blue button and I have yet to figure out how to make it start recording my temp - I push the blue button once and it shows yesterday 's temp , hit it again and it flashes blank but nothin else happens . The beeping while it records ( when it finally starts ! ) is pretty quiet and I do n't really mind that . I just wish it worked consistently and actually measured the extra decimal point . I 've been using this to help diagnose hypothyroidism , but I would not recommend this thermometer for any purpose !	-1
I think there are better options out there . I like that it 's pink , and the back-light is helpful on dark mornings , but this thermometer makes this super annoying beep every time you use it - like every five seconds until it 's finished . Though some reviewers here say you can put your thumb over the little hole where the sound comes out to dull it , that really does n't solve the problem . It wakes my husband and my dog ...	-1
This is potentially a good solution for some , not me . After a couple of hours of use it became uncomfortable . There is a thick inner ring that becomes uncomfortable . It may be right for a smaller , lighter person . I am over 200 lbs .	-1
I used this after I had a baby and needed stitches . I thought it would take the pressure off the stitches and give comfort , but it actually seemed to irritate my stitches instead . : (	-1
I found this cushion to be too small , and too firm . I did not find it comfortable to sit on and returned it back to Amazon as it was of no use to me . Those that prefer a lot of support might like this cushion .	-1
sitz baths are always recommended for people with inflammation in the nether regions , but it 's so uncomfortable to use . Normally , I sit in an inch or two of really hot water in the tub , so I 'm going back to that . It 's easier and more comfortable . I 'd return this but that would seem really gross and weird .	-1
The shipping box was in good shape but the product box arrived opened and the inner sealing bag was open as well . The product had multiple hairs on it , various other dirt , and oily rub marks were visible in light where perhaps someone attempted to rub it down to clean it . The inner bag 's sealing tie was broken and the product box appeared banged up and used . The overall impression I got from the product and it 's inner packaging was that it had been used . Needless to say , I will not be attempting to use it . In a hygiene-sensitive item like this , cleanliness is paramount . The thing should be sparkling . Great care should be taken to provide NEW , clean products , and especially so when selling products for the `` nether regions '' . Disappointed with this transaction but thankfully Amazon allowed a quick refund .	-1
If your thinking about getting this , becuase of the review rating , think again . This stuff is terrible . It did nothing but give me a stomach ache . I 'm not a huge health fanatic that knows all about the detox and clease process . A year ago I took Yerba Prime and it worked really well . I decided to try this one , becuase it was cheaper . Well you definitely get what you pay for . I do not recommend this product at all . Horrible ! !	-1
For all the risk of putting this into my body , it was n't worth it . There are many different bodies though , and needs ; maybe it will work for you .	-1
Same review left at other link for same product -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I have tried several wrist braces , including this one . I have theMueller Wrist Stabilizerwhich is maximum support ( I 'd say ) which is MUCH better than this Futuro Deluxe Wrist Stabilizer which is ALSO maximum support -- both have metal 'spoon ' equivalent . I had both of them , and it 's a no brainer to get Mueller because they 're Exactly the same expect that the mueller fits Both hands whereas the futuro fits only one . Dumb difference . I also haveMueller Hg80 Wrist Bracefor medium support , which is sturdy and flexible at the same time . For something with milder weightiness and noticeablity , I use the ACE wrap with thumb loop . ( Ace Wrist Brace Velcro 7306 - 1 ea ) ..I got it from Albertsons for around 4bucks , and it works GREAT . The thumb loop can be great ( keep it in place and prevent slipping ) or annoying ( when you want to wash hands ) , but in the latter situations I 'll just tuck in the loop and it 's like it was never there : ) I also usedFuturo Wrap Around Wrist Supportfor the same 'milder weightiness and noticability ' purpose , but those were horrible failures and I 'm now planning/trying to give them away.There are also wraps at the 99cent store which are AWESEOME.Elastic Wrap - For Wrist , Ankle & Elbow , 1 pc , ( SuperBand ) These are cool to have around if you have multiple injuries , because they 'll work on many joints Plus they have velcro on one end , so you literally just wrap and stick . Very quick and easy , and will make your joint happy.Ok , Good Luck ! I know I would 've appreciated reviews when I was making my purchases . Hope you get better and eventually do n't even need these .	-1
Homeopathic is just a fancy way of saying placebo . Its all about what you believe . I did extensive research after I bought these because it was not working for me . It might have worked , but a placebo is broken once you arent convinced it isnt doing what it says . If you want something to believe in to make you think your skin is clearing up , then this is perfect for you . However if you are looking for something that is going to ACTUALLY do something , you need to find another product .	-1
it product would have been good but it LEAKED ALL OVER THE OTHER STUFF THAT CAME WITH IT . problem is , it did n't have a safety seal , which seems very odd to me . my front door step is still greasy from the product that leaked all over the box . very disappointed to know that the company did n't use a safety seal on their product	-1
I am allergic to both almonds and apricots . This product is advertised as `` Pure vitamin E '' with no ingredients list . I take vitamin E and have used vitamin E oil before , and never have I seen one containing almond and apricot oils . I am SOOOO glad I read the ingredients . I almost did n't , did n't occur to me that I needed to , but as the bath was filing , I turned it around and read it . Just goes to show that one should always , always be careful when dealing with allergies . Needless to say , I 'm relived that I read the ingredients and disappointed that this was n't listed anywhere on the Amazon site . Many people are allergic to nuts . This product is going in the garbage .	-1
I tried this a while back and found that it irritated my sensitive skin ( even the one formulated for sensitive skin turned my face red ) . Aside from the ingredients probably causing my irritation , I believe exfoliating your facial tissue to be too harsh ( and scrubs like this with ground up pits can lead to micro cuts and scarring and just exacerbate more acne ) . I 'm happy that this works for others so well , but I 'll stick to my twice weekly homemade fruit acid peels .	-1
I have bought & used this product a few times over the years . Years ago this had concentrated scrubbers in it but now does NOT . To me a total waste of the intention . I want an exfoliator tht has a very concentrated amount of scrubbers to do the job with less . More cost effective & less work for me that way . I have bought & used MANY over the years . My skin is not sensitive so Im lucky that way . I really like Olay microbermabrasion in the little tub for exfoliating because its super concentrated . Overpriced though . I have found myself buying a few different scrubs that dont work well but I dont want to waste them so I am adding microderm crystals to make my own for much cheaper . I buy them here from Amazon it makes things much more cost efficient & really does the job . I also use Gly acid & a few other chemicle peels 1x per week during the winter for more maintenance on my skin as the years pass . I still get my ID checked at 38 so something must be working ! Im a believer in starting young for skin preventitive maintenance . Always use sunscreen too ; - ) . If anyone knows of any really good concentrated microderm , exfoliator , polish then reply post it please ! ! ! Happy scrubbing !	-1
I had read reviews by others saying that this really helps with sensitive skin . However , I found this made my breakouts even worse . The scent was n't bad , but I wanted something that would help control/prevent breakouts .	-1
I have sensitive dry skin with mild rosacea and was looking for something that could scrub off the dead dry skin but not irritate my face too much . I started using this and was initially happy with the results . It worked well and left my skin feeling clean and dead skin free . About 4 or 5 uses in , everything changed . My skin broke out into this weird texture . I had tiny skin-colored little bumps all over my face and my face felt like sand paper . I 've never seen my skin do this before . Everywhere I had used this scrub was bumpy and irritated . My skin was n't red but it felt like it was crawling and very irritated . I immediately stopped using this and after a week or so of just water , my skin finally started to clear up.Needless to say I will NOT be using this anymore . I guess my skin either did n't like something in this scrub or is just too sensitive .	-1
These do n't work . They peel your skin off though . Make your nose look and feel weird . I would n't buy these again . I actually went to a sleep study and have mild sleep apnea . I 'll be getting my cpap machine next Monday so I can finally stop snoring .	-1
I am impressed with the size of this thing as it has a huge capacity , the problem is with the doors . If you have the compartments filled with pills the doors can open up unexpectedly making a mess of your meds .	-1
I have two of these , and although each compartment is only partially filled , the lids pop open and spill the contents . This happens much more often with this size , than with the regular size . I have to tape the lids closed after each filling.The size is nice . But you can see a gap between each lid and the bottom , so they let humidity in more than the regular size.I would prefer the kind with a single lid , and 9 compartments , each about the same size as these , but this is no longer available .	-1
While it is exactly what it looks like ( A large box with seven compartments and daily labels ) , it is very difficult to open . There is only the tiniest sliver of plastic to push up to open one of the compartments , and it locks very tightly . I have full dexterity and I often resort to opening it with my teeth . I would expect that kind of clasp on something that will go in a backpack , not something for around the house . If you want something 'child-proof ' then this is good , but if it 's just for personal use then find something easier to open .	-1
strips repeatedly gave a negative result , even though I i think im in Ketosis ... they didnt work the first time i used them but i was just getting off of atkins . Now i started again and Ive lost 15 lbs in less then two weeks and i want to keep track of my levels.I will just shell out the cash for the ones in the store . they will work	-1
I was on a no-carb diet and wanted to see if I was in Ketosis . These kept returning a negative result even though I knew I was in Ketosis and Ketostix confirmed that . I 've heard similar complaints from other users of this product . Stay away	-1
oh yeah , disposable razors are cool ... . that 's why they use them in prison ! just kidding , as cheap plastic razors go , these are OK. Maybe good for travel . but if your looking for a great shave , no . spend the extra bucks for a cartridge-or , even better , and old school safety razor .	-1
I 'm not into the flavor of this . It tastes like Starburst candy with the same texture . I 'm not a fan of this .	-1
Why anyone would subject themselves to consuming this horrid concoction unless they are close to death is beyond me . This is the most foul tasting power bar I have ever had the misfortune to consume . It 's rather gooey in texture and bitterly sweet with an overpowering , intense , awful fruit flavoring . It 's loaded with sugar and calories , which is what a power bar typically consists of , but I 've had others that at least did n't leave your taste buds damaged for the rest of the day . Unless you are absolutely desperate for some carbs , avoid this one at all cost .	-1
Strawberry is definately there . There 's definately a ton of vitamin flavor in here also . The first taste , well , chalk comes to mind . Then bitter . Then sweet . Then strawberry . A little bit of dairy . Then , well I really needed to clear my mouth with something else.Smoothie flavor ... . not a chance . It 's stiff , sticky , chewy , and sickeningly sweet.How does it compare to those nasty marzipan bitter vitaminie energy bars ? Well this one is just vaguely tolerable compared to those.Sorry , I 'm afraid I 'd rather go hungry .	-1
Power Bar Fruit Smoothie , Berry BlastI like the flavor of this bar , but , the ingredients show too much sugar for me and not enough protein . If it had less sugar and more protein , I 'd recommend it.Gunner June , 2008	-1
These are n't terrible . I know , hardly a ringing endorsement , but I was a bit divided about the things . They 're not terrible . But they 're not particularly good either . Now , PowerBars have their own unique flavor to start with , and I can deal with that . I even buy them when I travel and need something to much on the flight . But this flavor was a bit odd . Okay , I know what it made me think of - those rubber taffee things we used to eat as kid , the long wide sticks - that 's what they taste like . Kind of a fake fruit flavor . Again , not terrible , but would I buy it again ? No . Try it if you 're curious , but buy one - not a pack .	-1
As someone who has eaten his fair share of Powerbars , I found this to be my least favorite of all . The first bite tasted like Flintstones chewable vitamins from my childhood . As I ate more , the Fliststone 's taste lessened a bit , enough for me to finish the bar.It tastes like a raspberry-blueberry mix might taste . It definetly does not tast like strawberry , which is the first-listed berry on the ingredients list . To its credit , only raspberries and blueberries are pictured on the wrapper.This product is very soft . The softness makes it feel like it melted , but that is not the case because it was room temperature . It is very chewy and is easily mishapen because it is so soft . The texture and grittiness reminds me of Airheads candy , but much , much softer.Overall , I probably would not purchase this product in the store now that I have tasted it . I would like to try the other flavors though .	-1
I tried this Powerbar with another person . We both were not pleased with the taste . We felt it was oddly grainy in texture and while we could tolerate the berry taste , we did n't think we 'd ever want another One ! I do n't think we are going to finish this bar . Not the best I 've ever tasted and I would never buy this again !	-1
I ate two small bites of this Powerbar ( it was a free sample ) , then decided my usual `` do n't waste food '' rule was not going to be obeyed in this case.I ca n't imagine anyone choosing this product for any reason other than perceived convenience . Basically , this is a paste which has been extruded into a rectangular `` bar '' shape . To me , it tasted artificial and highly processed ( maybe not as bad as a Twinkie or Fruit Loops cereal , but still kind of `` icky '' ) . It definitely did not taste like a berry smoothie to me ; instead , it tasted like finely ground oatmeal mixed with overly sweetened fruit juice.The first ingredient listed is sugar cane syrup , while the third ingredient is sugar . Rice flour , oats , soy and locust beans are mixed with dried berries , juice concentrate ( pear , pineapple , apple , and peach ) , milk protein isolate , and additional ingredients including almond butter , minerals , vitamins , and amino acids are added . The resulting paste is colored with beet juice.I 'm left thinking a far tastier and healthier snack for athletes would be a banana and a handful of almonds ( and that option would cost less than fifty cents ) .	-1
I was disappointed in this bar . It seemed at first like it would be a good item . It smelled really good , and I liked the texture . Kind of reminded me of Airhead candy.Now the fruit taste is pretty good actually . And it is easy to chew so no complaints there . But other than that , I have nothing but complaints about the bar . I mean come on , ultimately what 's the most important thing the consumer will care about . The taste . And that is a big F on the old report card.The bar is not smooth at all . It has a very fruity taste which is good . But soon it is replaced by a gritty , grainy taste that overpowers any tastiness of the bar . Overall , it comes across as kind of nasty . I would never spend money on this . Come on guys . You can do better..	-1
Good try , but these taste too much like over-sweet chemical mush bars that leave an semi-acrid aftertaste . The Chocolates are the best , hands down . This one tastes like sweetener that resembles oatmeal was added . Very fake . They are edible , but they are overpoweringly chemical .	-1
It 's a cheap aftershave that smells like original Old Spice to me . Or some other old man scent . Now for background , I do love the smells of some classic barber shop after shaves and shaving creams but this one is n't the one for me.Additionally , this leaves your face very dry and tight . I tossed it after a week of use .	-1
I purchased Pinaud 's Bay Rum and loved it . So much so I decided to give more of their products a sample since they are very affordable . This one is by far my least favorite which is a nicer way of saying my most hated . Aside from this and the Bay Rum I also used the Special Reserve and of the 3 , this is the only one I would never wear in public . The smell was very flowery with a bit of a baby powder smell . I think it sort of reminds me of Avon 's Skin So Soft or Magno Black Glycerin Soap by La Toja . It smells much closer to Magno , but since Magno is only slightly familiar here now in the U.S. ( I 've only seen it sold in Spain and here on Amazon ) Skin so Soft is also kind of similar . That in itself does n't seem so bad except it is REALLY strong and it stays strong for a long time.Overall , I think all of the Clubman products are great at soothing your face after a shave , better than most I would say . That is probably why so many barbers swear by the stuff . However , Clubman also has a load of different scents to choose from and this one is definitely NOT my style . I wish there was a way to sample the scents before buying , but Clubman is more likely to be sold in a pharmacy than a fancy department store where there is a girl at the perfume counter waiting to let you sample everything under the sun . The good news is that a bottle will usually run you between 3 and 5 bucks so even if you have to buy their entire lineup to find one you like , it would still be cheaper than most of those trendy expensive brands that smell great but feel terrible after a shave.I REALLY hated the scent of this stuff , but I have n't sworn off clubman just yet . Their Bay Rum is great and there are still lots of other scents in their lineup I 'd be willing to sample . It feels great and its cost effective provided you find one that fits you .	-1
I bought these expecting a soft head , but it was rather hard and I really do n't like them . It also has a large head ( as advertised ) .	-1
These were n't as soft as advertised . I wonder if they are mislabeled hence the rock bottom pricing ? I would n't buy again .	-1
IS NOT SOFT . not happy w/it , therefore do not use it ! I USE IT TO CLEAN COMBS & BRUSHES OK !	-1
Overpriced anywhere you buy it . Honestly , Bactine works better and is far , far cheaper . Bactine will heal your cold sore in 1 week where this can take 3-4 weeks and require 2 bottles of it !	-1
I ca n't believe how high the reviews are for this stuff , but I guess different things work for different people . I got a ginormous cold sore a few days before I was to start a new job ( I tend to get them when I 'm stressed and not getting enough sleep ) . I paid $ 14 for this itty bitty tube because I was desperate to get rid of the cold sore quickly ... well , Abreva did NOTHING ! I ended up going to the gas station and buying a tube of carmex for $ 1.29 which dried up the sore in a couple of days.I have since started using deodorant ... yes , it actually works ( has to be gel ) . I got this tip on youtube from a girl that suffered chronic cold sores after I got another huge outbreak before a big party . I use Almay gel hypoallergenic deodorant ( costs less than $ 3 at the drugstore ) . I apply it to the cold sore at night with a Q-tip and after the first application the sore is half the size . I use carmex during the day . I 've found that if I apply Carmex the moment I get that tingling , I wo n't get a cold sore so I always have carmex on hand . But if I do n't use the carmex in time and have an outbreak , I just use the deodorant and it works ... significant improvement after one use and within 4-5 days the sore is completely gone.Now I only get 1 or 2 cold sore outbreaks a year . To me , Abreva is way too expensive and minimally effective . If you 're going to spend $ 14 on this I 'd spend $ 5 and try the carmex/ gel deodorant 1st .	-1
My cold sores are rare and pop up without any tingling . Once it pops up ... not much you can do or abreva . I find regular toothpaste helping better than this.Abreva does not relieve pain either .	-1
this product is misleading . it relieves symptoms of cold sore , but it does not shorten the duration of cold sore . it 's way too expensive when you can get carmex for a buck .	-1
I have to deal with cold sores about once a month , and I 've always used Abreva mostly because their arguments seem compelling ... FDA approved , # 1 pharmacists recommended , TV ads , blah blah blah . About 3 months ago , one of my sores was bigger than usual that would n't dry out after 5 days ... it was ugly and painful . I decided to stop trusting advertising and went on buying every treatment available out there . I finally found one that REALLY helped me ... Campho-Phenique . It burns , but it dries out my sores in just one to two days day . I finally decided to write a review because two cold sores popped up last night , and they are gone tonight ... they never had to opportunity to completely come out , and they are now dry .	-1
Why would someone pay this ? Something is wrong with all the prices on Pepcid Complete ! I can buy 100 at my local grocery store for $ 10 . Even if it 's PRIME , who would pay it ? The product itself is great , although the cherry is better .	-1
These antacids work great . Better than the little pills . Better than Maalox , Rolaids , or Tums . But WTH ? ! ? My husband ordered these . 4 bottles plus shipping came to $ 190.29 ? ! ? That 's not right ! I think he must have thought he was ordering 12 total , or something like that . Gon na return these . They 're cheaper at the local grocery store !	-1
This review is not about this specific item but a warning before you order . I received another Osteo Bi-Flex product with only 375 mg of Chondroitin Complex , not the 1288 mg that this product contains . I 'm having some knee pain again , so it may be that the I 'm missing the chondroitin effect . This happened before when I ordered an Osteo Bi-Flex product on Amazon , so beware . I should have returned the substitute item instead of giving it a chance .	-1
I never have had a problem swallowing pills , however , these tablets are extremely difficult to swallow and scrape the throat . They are not coated which I think may cause the problem .	-1
I love this product..have been using it for years , especially liked when they added the 2000 IU of D3 . But check out the new ingredients . The Joint Shield with 5-Loxin used to be 1288 mg but now with the 33 % smaller caplets they reduced the Joint Shield to just 375 mg.I called the company about this and they admitted they changed the formula sooooooo ... if you want the old formula of the 1288 mg. Joint Shield you 'll now have to buy it without the 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 , they no longer make that formula . I had to purchase Vitamin D separately because of this new change.I bought the smaller caplets before I realized they changed the formula . Pretty sneaky of them to do this without advising their customers . If I did n't like this product so much I would switch brands .	-1
After the first day of using this product , I began getting headaches ; especially in the back of the head and neck.These headaches increased in strength & duration with each day of use until finally , after 1 week , I had to stop using them.The headaches became debilitating.As soon as I stopped taking the product , the headaches stopped.One month later I decided to try Osteo Bi-Flex and the EXACT same thing happened , again.Now , I was sure the headaches were due to the product , in my situation.Other people seem to have a good response , unfortunately , I did not.I felt I should report my experience with Osteo Bi-Flex.Plus , I had NO pain relief at all from this product .	-1
I dislike these very much compared to any other Gillette razor refill I 've ever tried . They seem dull right out of the box , and by the second use , they 're ready for the trash .	-1
I 've been using the Venus Divine for years but the replacement blades were out of stock at my store of choice so I had to downgrade to the basic Venus blades ( all Venus blades work on all handles ) . I figured it was a couple bucks cheaper and probably just as good . Maybe I 'd save some money in the long run.Unfortunately , I wo n't be saving any money . Although both blades have the same shape and 3 blades , regular Venus blades cut me up without fail . Sometimes I would n't even notice and I 'd find blood on my white towels or sheets . I noticed a major increase in irritation and even had some bumps become infected . Even my lower legs , which have always been the easiest place for me to get a perfect shave felt rough after using these blades . I 'd always find patches I missed later , too.I always use a very high quality shaving cream to reduce irritation but even it ca n't compete with the amateur performance of Venus blades and I can tell you exactly why . Regular Venus blades do not have the comfort coating , smoothing cushions or multiple moisture strips of the Divine . In my book , those features are definitely worth paying more .	-1
This product is tolerable ( if you make with cream for those on Atkins , or milk instead of water as is suggested for those not ) , but it is $ 10- $ 12 cheaper at the grocery store . It is a little grainy , the flavor is a bit off . Actually , it tastes like many of these items taste - not great . But , it does supply you with additional protein and is n't loaded with sugar .	-1
got this as I am doing the Atkins diet . Tastes horrible . Really horrible . I threw it out . I purchased low carb isopure-tasted much better but does cost a bit more too ...	-1
I was looking for an inexpensive replacement to some of the high-protein powders I was buying and/or the pre-made muscle milk/atkins drinks I 'd get . This did n't work out so well for me . First off , with water , I did not like the taste/texture at all . I gave it a try with milk and I ended up getting sick . That could have had more to do with drinking milk first thing in the morning , but either way it was an unpleasant start to my work day . I subsequently went and tried Muscle Milk powder which I like a lot better . It 's more expensive , but it 's worth it compared to this stuff .	-1
THIS BRUSH IS A WASTE OF MY MONEY BECAUSE IT DOESNT REACH FAR BACK INTO MY MOUTH W/O ME HAVING TI GAG AND BRUSHING LEAVES MY TONGUE RED AND BLEEDING SO I WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT .	-1
Just another product with a different name to use a toothpaste . Just buy a tube of mint toothpaste would be the same .	-1
The container/dispenser is poorly designed and these wipes do n't dispense properly - when a wipe is pulled out , the top of the next wipe rarely comes through the opening , requiring one to open the top and re-feed the wipe each time . This causes the liquid to dry out rather quickly .	-1
This toothpaste did not whiten my teeth after about 2 weeks of use there as no differenceone two three	-1
It barely works . Does n't cut well at all . Not a good investment . Replaced it with a $ 15 Conair trimmer and am much happier .	-1
While it does a good job of trimming the hair , it is REALLY bad about yanking the hair and catching my skin . I always have a bloody mess whenever I tried to use this . Just not for me .	-1
This was useless for me unless I took the guard off of it . I could n't get it to work at all with the guard on so I am returning it .	-1
This was just too big for what I wanted . I wanted something that would trim my bikini area and I really dont know how anyone could use this to trim that area . Just didnt work for me .	-1
It 's ineffective , it cuts you , and it went in the trash . I know this is n't a lengthy and descriptive review on the ways it did n't work , the cuts it inflicted , and/pr what sort of trashcan it met its end in , but I think in this case , less is more . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Seriously , the first listed inactive ingredient is `` Fragrance '' . The smell is so overpowering that my gf who gets migraines could n't be in the same house the night before or day of my surgery . Why ca n't there be a fragrance-free version ? Especially considering god knows what chemicals are in those fragrances that were surely still on my skin when I got cut open .	-1
I bought this per my doula 's recommendation to wash myself in order to pass my strep b test since I am pregnant . Unfortunately it did n't work , thus I do n't recommend it . I was very hopeful and I used it as directed per my doula and other internet websites . I am strep b positive and will have to get penicillin while on labor . Do n't waste your $ .	-1
I bought the same strength pills from a different manufacturer for $ 15 and they work a lot better . Nutramax claims they use higher quality ingredients and so on but even two pills a day did not do anything for my joints . One pill from the $ 15 ( nature way ) makes a substantial difference .	-1
I tried this after reading all the fabulous reviews on here . But I am impatient when it comes to my mobility- people seem to take that for granted . I do n't have the tolerance or moxie to wait around for something to work . Maybe if I was elderly , but I am young and I feel like I am imprisoned in this useless body.Anyway , sorry for the diatribe , but yea , I took Cosamin for a few weeks , and it did nothing for me , well I lie . It did raise my blood sugars a bit , but I am willing to trade off on high blood sugars for my mobility.The absolute best things for joints is Zymosine and Flexcin . But if you are allergic to shellfish or have diabetes , I would probably stay away from them .	-1
This stuff did n't work for me , plain and simple . I do n't seem to have any problems with shoes , other than my Sperry Loafers.I started using sneaker balls ... problem solved .	-1
I read the reviews that the vibrations were too strong and still bought it . It only has two speeds and low makes me go numb .	-1
This product is a knock off . I previously stated that it was a good product but have since then changed my mind . A friend of mine has a REAL Hitachi magic wand and it is way better than this . The weight is much lighter than a REAL Hitachi magic wand and it just does not have the power . After experiencing the real deal this is a disappointment .	-1
