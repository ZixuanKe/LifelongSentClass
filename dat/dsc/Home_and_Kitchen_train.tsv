There is no shortage of pop recipes available for free on the web , but I purchased the `` Zoku Quick Pops '' book , because Zoku has some good recipes for fruit pops on its blog . I was hoping there were more where those came from . This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops , however . There are 41 recipes in total , only 13 of which are fruit pops . There is a `` Fresh and Fruity '' chapter , followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled `` I Scream for Quick Pops ! `` , `` Bake Shop '' , and `` Coco Loco '' . As you might guess from the last one , there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on `` Tips '' and `` Techniques '' are useful . There is more detailed information about ingredients that do n't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual . The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners , tells you how to do different types of layers , how to add decorative fruit slices , how to do a quick shell , and how to make core pops . The pages about core pops are especially helpful , as they include recipes for pink , purple , and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops . The book recommends using Zoku accessory kits , but you can do without.The pop recipes tend to go out of their way to be as sweet as possible . Many , including the recipe for a vanilla base , call for vanilla pudding , where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well . I 've substituted it with no ill effect . On the bright side , many of these recipes may appeal to children , whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults . There are flavors like `` Cookie Dough '' , `` That 's a S'more '' , chocolate peanut butter , and peanut butter and jelly . All 9 recipes in `` Bake Shop '' are inspired by cake and cookie recipes.As a resource for light , fresh-tasting fruit pop recipes , `` Zoku Quick Pops '' is very limited . Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients . The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice , which is fine , but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor . The recipe for mango pops includes orange , apple , banana and lemon , which are too many competing flavors . Mango and orange together make a terrific pop . The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes . Tips and techniques are also useful . For fruit pop recipes , `` Top Pops '' by Emily Zaiden is far better .	1
This book is a must have if you get a Zoku ( which I also highly recommend ) . There is a large variety of recipes from simple , to fancy . The flavor combos are creative , and it gives you ideas for decorating the pops too . They turn out as beautiful as they are tasty . After reading it you will be inspired to create your own recipes too .	1
If you have a Zoku Quick Pop maker ( or two ... .I have the original one-slot and then I bought the double-slot here at Amazon ) , I recommend you get this creative little book , which will inspire you .	1
The Zoku accessories are pricey , but the recipes have the exact amount you need to make the pops . I have made it through 15 varieties so far , and I like them all .	1
This beautifully illustrated book featuring ten colorful , glittery butterflies is a favorite at our house . The nana-babies like to count the butterflies as they flit off ! The book is also good for learning colors , discussing the activities the butterflies do and the plastic butterflies are great as the babies and toddlers like to touch them !	1
I got this as a gift for my niece and she loved it . It 's a super cute book and ill be getting it for any other nieces that may come along .	1
had no idea about decorating cakes , by this booklet , now i can say that following the instructions and have the will and patience plus practicing , one day i wont be ashamed ofmy cakes . i added an image of a cake i made according to this book lessons , which i advice anyone who is interested ; to get this book ...	1
i loved it . do n't use it much but when i had it 's been useful . I recommend it to all who wants to learn how to decorate cakes	1
I 'm hoping that I can learn how to make gum paste flowers to perfection for my daughters wedding , and maybe a few other cakes .	1
This book is n't much help if you are not taking the wilton cake decorating classes . you can get the basics but its really just a visual for the class !	1
I have always wanted to learn how to decorate a beautiful cake , and I purchased this guidebook along with The Wilton Pastry bag kit . I appreciate how this guide gives tips on how to bake the perfect cake , and also gives detailed step-by-step instructions on how to use the pastry bag to make many different designs . I do , however , agree that this book did appear to be an advertisment for thier products , but the guide was helpful nonetheless .	1
This lesson plan is perfect for a beginner and definitely helped introduce working with fondant in a user-friendly way . Thanks , Wilton .	1
A good tool for home use . Shows several types of simple , easy to perform techniques . Would recommend for beginners and home bakers .	1
Wonderful to have a reference book handy with step-by-step instructions -- I used when I was covering my first cake in fondant and it was so easy !	1
I saw this book at Target and flipped through it . I was amazed at all the ideas to do with a simple brownie ! Granted what I make wo n't ever look as good as the pictures in the book , but I 'm okay with that . If I had sat down and thought about it I might have come up with some of these same ideas , but some of them are really clever . I have had fun looking through the book with my kids and we are making brownie pops for my son 's b'day treats at school and his party.PROS : - You can buy most of these supplies ( including the book ) at Michael 's Craft Supplies or Joann 's and like I said , I saw the book at Target with some of the molds.- creative uses for brownies . Great way to have an easy-to-make but fun treats for all sorts of occasions.- there are suggestions for b'day 's , sports , holidays , gifts ... CONS : - You need to buy the molds or supplies to make any of special shapes so it 's an investment up front . Once you have them it 's all about Brownie Fun ! I think this book is a great resource ( or a fun gift ! ) for any parent or person who likes to bake and be creative .	1
I ordered this lesson plan because I took the first two courses of Wilton 's Cake Decorating , and I did n't want to sign up for the 3rd course only because I did n't want to spend so much money for the classes . So I bought the kit in Michaels figuring I would teach myself but this time the lesson plan was n't included in kit like the first 2 kits were . This lesson plan is great and if you have some experience with working with fondant and gum paste this will be a piece of cake for you , no pun intended . But this definitely is n't for a beginner .	1
I loved all the information I found in this book , very good ideas and pictures I recommend it to new beginners	1
This book is amazing ! I love how Wilton publishes books for every stage of baking ! This book is a must have for beginers !	1
This book was recommended by my cake decorating instructor . If you want to get started on cake decorating this is the book for you !	1
Easy to follow even for a clutz like me ! Very informative and the instructions are straight forward . Im new to cake decorating so I have really enjoyed this book .	1
THIS WAS EYE CATCHING AND WHEN I ORDERED IT I KNEW I HAD TO HAVE IT . IT IS QUITE HELPFUL	1
What a great book to help you get started on learning to decorate cakes . Very usful ! Highly recommend buying this !	1
This short-but-sweet ( ha ) book gives all the basic information you need to get started with cake decorating . It shows how to make a number of shapes with the icing , an icing recipe , and has lots of helpful illustrations . Between this book and how-to videos found online , you could probably get enough information to be able to make pretty cakes without having to attend lessons .	1
Good guide for beginners . Helpful resource . Clear pictures and instructions . If you can learn from just looking at a page on a book with a few written details , it will teach you without expensive classes . But if you are using in addition to the class , all good too . Keep it handy to look back at once in a while as a resource .	1
I got this book for my daughter as the local craft store would n't let her take this class unless she took the other two first which she does n't need . The book is full of color pictures so very well illustrated and the directions are clear and easy to follow . I also bought the class kit to go with it and it works great . would recommend for people wanting to learn how to do this on their own at home without a class .	1
I needed this for my third Wilton 's class , and it was cheaper on Amazon.com than in the store . It 's part of the curriculum , so it 's required . Whether it is good for skill development or not , I take my classes very seriously , and get alot out of them . I also believe in checking prices everywhere for the class supplies . Amazon was cheapest , and I received it in 2 days , free shipping , Amazon prime .	1
This is a small simple book but tons of basic information on baking . I really loved the graphs regarding the piping tips - I have so many of them but never knew what exactly do they do . So that was really nice to figure out everything on the chart with the pipe tip number !	1
I really like the Wilton Method courses . I do have some background in cake design , but this really helped me take it all to the next level . I still need lots of practice with flowers so this is perfect for me . I would have liked a few more tips and a bit more direction , but on the whole it was worth the money .	1
This book shows you how to decorate different items . It explains the in 's and outs of doing it . Covers how to do different items .	1
On the whole , I like this book very much . I have to say , however , that some of the instructions in it were contradicted by our instructor and she said she was instructed by Wilton to do so . I certainly felt that her way was better and , since it involves such basic instructions , I wanted to share it with you.For all the projects in this book other than covering the cake base and the cake itself -- that is to say all the flowers , the bow , the leaves , and the borders along the bottom -- wherever it says to use just gum paste , you should use a 1/2 gum paste and 1/2 fondant mix . Sure enough , it made it easier to do everything , there was less hardening and bumps , and everything looked prettier . ( I had previously worked with gum paste on my own and wish I 'd known this ) .Another thing that I noticed is that , in some cases , ( especially the bow ) the final product would have looked MUCH nicer if we 'd made them thinner rather than as instructed in the booklet . It may be that , since this is an introductory course to forming decorations by sculpting rather than by piping , maybe they thought that thinner would have been harder to work with.But , all in all , it 's a very nice reference ( as well as an effective advertisement for countless Wilton products ! )	1
great book , so many fun ideas..ca n't wait to get startedgreat product , fast shipping.I love the Wilton books and will keep buying them	1
Easy to understand , great tips . Learned alot and looking forward to creating the wonderful creations they show on the book .	1
Nice quality bag ! Vibrant colors . Worth it !	1
I 'm a Star Wars fan and I bought this with the intention of using it for groceries but it turned into my new diaper bag . It 's huge ! I can fit everything i need in it where before I had my diaper bag and another bag and my purse . It has started to come apart on the side but I can sew it or order a new one it 's so cheap . I am sure the intended purpose is n't for it to be used as a diaper bag daily but it works and I have gotten compliments on it even ! It goes great with my Star Wars Vans too : D	1
It is perfect ! I am using this bag as a gift bag for a guy 's baby shower who is a die hard Star Wars fan ! He will be able to use it after for carrying toys or whatever ! Mini diaper bag even . Very pleased !	1
This makes a great reusuable gift bag for the Star Wars Fan . Well made and fun design for fans of the original movie .	1
It 's a must for report writting . It has ten thousand words in it 's data base . It 's small and compact . Good price too .	1
Works well but wish the display was just a bit larger . For the money it does what I want and I would buy it again .	1
If you are a crossword addict you need this product . The best on the market.Z	1
Marveling over this just arrived Spell Checker ! ! Three words already in less than twenty minutes ! ! Stylus or finger nails for this very light cell phone size cutie ! ! Quarter inch read out is way easy for the eye ! ! And to use too ! ! Starting , hopefully , into a happy future together ! ! Thank You ! ! ! !	1
This book stand is highly adjustable and functional . It works great for most moderately sized hardcovers and paperbacks . For overtly thick professional books you may have to consider The Easi-Reader Bookstand which is much studier .	1
This is a very versatile book stand that is easy to carry around and easy to store . It is ideal for smaller books and for those readers who do n't need variety of reading angles . However , it can accommodate larger books as long as you are a bit careful how you use it . In addition to books , it works really well with a variety of electronic book readers and the new generation of tablet computers . I 've used it with myKindle Wireless Reading Device ( 6 '' Display , Global Wireless , Latest Generation ) and iPad . In fact , when I was looking for an inexpensive way of propping up my iPad so that it does n't lay flat on the table I settled for this option and so far it is working perfectly for me . In fact , I am writing this review on iPad that is propped up with it.The only problem that I have with it is the manufacturing quality . The first holder that I bought broke after a few months of use . I still went ahead and bought a new one because I feel that its many advantages far outweigh this shortcoming , and hopefully if I am a bit more careful with how I store it and handle it it may last longer this time around .	1
This thing rocks . It will hold your book where your want it to be . It will save your neck and keep you hands free to take notes or whatever as you read . It is super lightweight and convenient . I just keep it in my backpack at all times . It handles my 1000 page law books , so no worries in that department . The price is right . I see other people clunking around those huge , expensive wood book stands . This is way better . Go with this .	1
Excellent product . Efficient ( including wide enough ) for it 's use . Sturdy while not impeding the process of actually reading/viewing the book .	1
This mug is fantastic , it washes well , has a good weight , and can double as a nifty negotiation tool . After all , who messes with a guy who has brass knuckles on his coffee mug ? Anyway , my husband has big hands and he says the knuckles are comfortable and easy to grip . It arrived quickly and well packaged . It 's a winner , you wo n't be disappointed .	1
I bought this for my boyfriend and he just loved it ! It was really good quality for the money.Very cool mug .	1
I purchased this for my son 's first birthday and the theme is mickey and it will make great fun mickey shaped cookies and fruit shaped Mickey 's . Was a little smaller then expected but over all good product , durable and very cute .	1
I like this . It 's a little small but that 's OK ( keeps one from overeating too many cookies . Seems very solid and Ithink it will last . Came faster then they said it would .	1
so cute but super small . Just pay close attention to the measurment . Have not yet used it but the cookies are sure to be micro .	1
I really like these ice trays , because they for one have a cover and therefore prevents any freezer odors from getting in . Also , they stack nicely on top of one another . Another thing I like is the Purple color lids . I would definitely recommend these to my friends .	1
I do n't use many ice cubes , and they would evaporate form the tray before I used any . But every once in a while I do need some , and they would be gone.With the tops on these trays , the ice cubes last many times longer . Maybe two years or more .	1
Finally ... ice cube trays with covers that really work ! These are great ... there 's nothing like fresh , clean , great tasting ice ! I ... like many other reviewers do not use the pop top to fill these , I find it 's easier to fill these the old fashioned way . They do work very well and a little water on the bottom pops them right out ! A great product !	1
I like the handle length on these and the added bonas of not having to use my nails for the pith removal . I have had the finger ring style , Already gave 2 away , Hope I do n't loose them in DW .	1
I needed just one more of these but this set was too good to pass up . I like having more that one color too .	1
Sure does save on the fingernails when I peel my oranges with this handy little gadget and love not have to go to a party to get it , Thank you Amazon .	1
if you have never used one of these to peel an orange or any citrus you do not know what you are missing . they last for ever and work every time	1
I take vitamins . Most containers are n't big enough to hold them . These are perfect . * They have plenty of room - I do n't have to methodically arrange my vitamins to allow the lid to close . I estimate these will hold around 20 big vitamins . 9/9/11 Update : I just attached an image showing this with 16 vitamins . I think it would hold 20 if you work at it . With 16 , I can just drop them in and pop the lid on . * They are compact enough to fit into a jeans pocket.Yep , the lid is hard to get off the first couple of times . No worries after that . The bonus is that a snug lid means I do n't worry about them opening and spilling my vitamins . Nice ! My daughter loves these in her purse , too.The uses are practically endless ( aspirin , gum , paper clips , skittles : ) HIGHLY Recommended !	1
No more using silverware and/or fingers to get pickles out of the jar ! This 8 cup container by Tupperware is very durable ! It 'll hold an entire 64oz jar of pickles ! I absolutely love this container !	1
Works great for storing anything you need to keep submerged in liquid in the fridge . I typically use mine to store celery in water .	1
Great set to start with or to fill in the gaps . No frill , and no damage after months of use . Very flat looking and simple .	1
These are good because they are inexpensive , but they are not the most aesthetically pleasing and are very light weight .	1
perfect for my three year old triplets . we have the bowls , cups , and plates from ikea and love them all	1
These are perfect for my home daycare , perfect size for little hands , compact to store , and do great in the dishwasher multiple times a day ! ! Get em ! !	1
I ordered these to go with the plates and am very pleased that they are exactly 8 oz as I monitor the amount of liquid I consume each day and I love the colors even if I am a senior citizen .	1
Little hands will love these . ( ages 2-8 ) Bigger kids are okay , but they really work size wise for the young kids .	1
I was doubtful about getting two sets of these , but I am glad I did . They are just right for children . They do n't hold all that much fluid so if there is a spill ... and there is ALWAYS a spill ... it is n't so bad . I put them in the dishwasher on the top shelf . They 've been holding up well . We 've had a couple left in weird places that ended up holding science experiments but they washed up just fine . Get them . They 're terrific for families .	1
these were just perfect for my kids . they love them . they are the perfect size for kids to they do n't get to much of whatever they are drinking	1
You get 12 small tumblers in this order , they are just as they appear in the picture . They are sturdy , IKEA quality , they will last years . I like the matte texture that acts as a grip agent on the bottom half of each cup .	1
They are cups . There are 12 of them , they are nice and durable , I was able to write on them in permanent marker with no problem so the kids knew which cup was theirs . They are not BIG cups , but that is actually perfect for my students .	1
I was looking for tumblers to replace the use of paper cups in the bathroom . Unfortunately , these were a bit too small for what I had intended . They appear to be well made and were helpful when I had visitors with little kids .	1
We assigned each family member a color , and purchased 3 sets . They are wonderful , and they do n't tip over due to the proper design of the weight distribution of the liquid . However , they were smaller than I expected . For any person over 6 , you need to drink 2 cups of water to feel like you had one cup .	1
The metal is a little more thin than I imagined but it is cute . Easily bendable , it can become hard to close , but it can be bent back into position .	1
I like it , but the material it was made can bend easily . My son love it it match with his collection .	1
My son is a huge Curious George fan and one of his favorite stories is the one where Curious George Rides a Bike . So , it could n't be a better lunch box for him . He loves it !	1
I got this so I am able to carry snacks on the weekends . We are never home so when I saw this I had to get this . First our toddler loves curious George and second it was just darling . Item looked just like picture . Best part so easy to clean with just a wipe . It 's perfect in size not too big or small . Perfect for on the go .	1
Kids are really into Curious George so they love this tin box to keep all their & # 34 ; stuff & # 34 ; inside . It works great .	1
Was a little skeptical of how this would hold up . Very impressed . It gets much more use than the larger cuisinart .	1
Besides myself being a Cuisinart snob , I will say that I would n't use any other product in my kitchen . This does a wonderful job on small jobs such as pestos , or making peanut butter .	1
Bought this for my Mother who had her version from about 8-9 years ago finally die out . It looks almost identical ( other than some minor cosmetical changes over the years ) to her previous version.Judging from her original version , if it lasts at last as that , she 'll be thrilled . Great little food processor .	1
I also own a large food processor ( also a Cuisinart ) that I use for substantial tasks like making bread dough , slicing vegetables , etc . Because of this , I use this mini-prep processor as a backup when the parts of my larger food processor are in the dishwasher or when I only have a small task that does not justify taking out my large food processor.Overall I get a lot of use out of this and have found it to be very durable and consistent . I 've owned it for almost four years now and over that time have used it to do everything from make homemade nut butters to rough chop vegetables to make my own oat flour out of oatmeal . It has performed very well at all of these tasks and years later , still has lots of power and cleans up beautifully . It is fantastic and I could not say enough wonderful things about it.That said , I do have a couple of caveats . The first is that I would never buy it as a primary food processor . It is just too small for normal tasks . Even when I am making something in a small quantity like a dip I typically find it is too much size-wise for this processor . Using it in an application like this would take forever . However , it 's great for doing basic chopping tasks because it is so easy and light to pull out onto the counter and efficient . I also love how the stainless steel look coordinates with my appliances and other gadgets . Overall it is a great product and if it ever dies I am likely to replace it with another Cuisinart .	1
Bought this to replace an old Mini Cuisinart Processor that was worn out ( it was about 12 years old ) . Love the red color , matches my toaster and coffee pot . Works great . Use it for small jobs instead of dragging out the big food processor .	1
I am a fanatic about kitchen appliances , specifically Cuisinart . Even though I have two other Cuisinart food processors that work perfectly well , I thought this would be good for small jobs and I could n't resist the look . Not only was I not disappointed , but this has become my most-used kitchen appliance . I can mince garlic , make guacomole , turn garbanzos into hummus , and perform a host of other useful tasks . It is perfect if you want to make something quick , and do n't wo n't to drag out the heavier , full-sized food processors . There are some culinary batches that you would ordinarily need to process , but are too small for a full-sized processor - this item is your answer . I have found the pulse control to be superior to the larger processors even - you can custom-chop tomatoes and walnuts ( a quite difficult task ) to your liking . The reason that I would recommend this specific model over other Cuisinart mini-preps is that this one is truly a miniature version of the full-sized processors - same Cuisinart quality , same original design that has worked for years . I have repeatedly washed the removable parts in the dishwasher with no problems - much easier to clean than any other processor I have used.The only mild complaint I have is that the blade does not seal as well as the larger Cuisinarts - it does make a perfect , restaraunt-quality smoothie , but I would use less than the amount suggested by the recipe book if you do n't want a liquidy mess on your hands . But , it 's better to do smoothies in a blender anyways .	1
I 've been using this almost daily for about a month . Easy to use , easy to clean , and looks nice on the counter . No real complaints , except that the bowl feels kind of thin , like it would crack easily . I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini ( a cheap-o brand ) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier . I hope I 'm wrong about the bowl , but I guess only time will tell . Other than that , no complaints , and I 'd recommend buying this ! Update 6/27/13 : After three months of regular use the bowl is still holding up , and it 's still doing what it 's supposed to do . My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube . Obviously I knew this when I purchased it , but hindsight is 20/20 .	1
This mini-prep-processor is the second Cuisinart product I have bought from Amazon . The first was a refurbished convection toaster oven . The careful engineering and attractive , simple design of both products impress me . Also impressive is how wonderfully well they work ! After reading a lot of the Amazon reviews -- not all 350+ -- I was convinced this mini-chopper-processor would be a better replacement for the small , inexpensive Black and Decker that burned out with no warning after one year of very mild use . Avoid Black & Decker in the kitchen is my conclusion . Anyway ... this Little Honey , that 's what I call him , arrived the day before Thanksgiving . Before that I 'd only used the B/D to pulverize cat food twice a day . The cats spit out meat or fish pieces they 'd have to chew . Waste of money , so they get instant grind instead.What good timing ! I put that Little Honey right to work . The slightly larger cup capacity , two speeds , a strong sounding motor of the Cuisinart , and its crisp good looks kept inviting me to whip up quick dips , sauces and icings for unexpected company -- as well as , the morning and evening cat food.The compact size lets me keep it up on the counter . I get more use out of it than my large food processor down in the cupboards somewhere . If it were a little larger I would replace the big processor.Why only 4 stars ? I think it is a great little tool , but I am waiting to see how long before the motor burns out . And 4 stars because it does not chop evenly , when I chop such chunky things as celery or certain mixtures of wet cat food large pieces are left . ( No , not together ! I wash it out well between food types . ) Usually I run it until I smell the motor burning then stop . That is after the recommended 10 to 12 seconds , alternating between Lo and Hi speeds . Some other reviewer mentioned the burning smell also , so I assume it is normal ... Anyway , if it is still doing this before the warranty runs I will have to send the Little Honey back . For now , I love it very much .	1
I needed a way to liquify single servings of food to provide nutrition through my mother 's feeding tube . She does not tolerate the commercial nutrition , but does well with her customary food . I tried using a blender , but the end result was inconsistent for bolusing through a feeding tube even after adding additional liquid . We have used the Cuisinart I purchased when they were first introduced to the USA , which worked well but was inconvenient for on-the-spot use and for travel . I read the reviews for this and other mini Cuisinarts and decided to try the `` cheaper '' one . I am impressed with its performance , ease of use and compact size . It is clearly worth the small price I paid . I most like the ports in the top for slowly introducing liquids . It is perfect for my intended use , and I can envision how to use it in cooking . I highly recommend it .	1
If you mainly use a food processor , or WANT to use a food processor for blending , chopping and pureeing foods , the Mini-Prep is such a good idea . It does about 80 percent of what a large food processor does , and it 's easier to clean and takes up less space.If you find you typically chop herbs , make pesto and blended sauces , herb butters and the like and do NOT use the food processor for batters , doughs and slicing , you might consider the Mini-Prep . The motor is very strong , the blade very sharp . I made a fresh tomato coulis out of tomato , dried tomato , oil and herbs in seconds and it had the right texture ( chopped but not liquified . ) One thing I hate about large food processors is scraping small amounts of chopped herbs or nuts out of the large bowl . If your typical job , like mine , is chopping small items in smaller quantities , this is perfect . It takes up a lot less space on the counter , too.The unit comes in steel color and white . Before you buy a food processor , consider what you typically process . If you do coffee , smoothies , pesto , chopped herbs and nuts and salsa , this may just be enough , saving you dollars and space .	1
I have had the Cuisinart Mini-prep Pro for years , which I use all the time , but because I am something of a minimalist , it is too large for my tastes to keep out on the counter top . I was looking for something to do the frequents small tasks of chopping nuts , onions , etc , that would be small enough to have a place out in public . This is perfect . It is about half the size of the Pro , and has a very elegant black chrome appearance and is about half the height of the Pro as well.It is lighter than the Pro in all aspects , but as with all my Cuisinart experiences , it does a great job on its intended tasks . The warranty is the very odd number of 18 months , so you get the idea it 's not supposed to be a workhorse . But used as recommended , I 'm sure mine will last `` forever '' . I 've been looking for something like this for a long time , and considered Kitchenaid and other brands , as well as other Cuisinart models , and this one is exactly what I had hoped for .	1
This does a good job of pureeing things for my mother and it takes up relatively little counter space . I can rinse the parts quickly and easily after I 've prepared one food and move directly on to the next course .	1
This is a MINI processor , and that 's why I bought it ... NOT to do the big jobs , I have the `` big boy '' to do that . I do like the how handy it is to do the small jobs , so I do n't have to use the big one . I use it a lot to make home made dressing . Clean up is easy and quick , as is the machine . It will scar the bowl if you try to grind hard spices , etc . however ... but it states that in the manual .	1
I bought this item specifically for grinding spices and herbs for indian cooking . It does a fairly decent job with the spices although you need to have at least 1/4 cup for it to work well . As to the herbs perhaps I 'm doing something wrong but it did not do as well . The herbs that were above the blade stayed put and it took a lot of scraping the bowl to get them chopped up . An addition of something solid ( perhaps an onion or a some butter ) would probably take care of the problem but just the leaves on their own give this processor a hard time .	1
I have had this cuisinart for about 2 years now , and it is still going strong . I have been impressed by its ability to chew through large volumes of basil when making pesto , and small things like sesame seeds for making tahini . It is also perfect for grinding cookies for pie crusts . And the size means you do n't have to be using a large volume to get great results . I do n't think this mini prep eliminates the usefulness of a full-size cuisinart , but it sure is much easier to clean up when you only need to process 1-2 cups of something .	1
I use this all the time to chop up nuts , grate hard cheeses , and make small batches of hot sauces . Works well when you do n't want to pull the full sized food processor out and assemble it and then clean it afterward . It 'll chop a good sized onion up to start a pasta sauce , or a couple of hot peppers for a finishing to a stir fry . Very handy and pretty well built even for couple time per week usage year after year .	1
I replaced my original mini-prep with this item after the plastic housing on the steel knife split . The first one lasted about ten years , and I used it quite often , tho it was not abused . Love the handiness of this item , it stores easily with a small footprint , parts go in the dishwasher for quick cleanup , just the right size for smaller jobs .	1
I had a smaller chopper of a different brand but wanted one that had a little larger bowl . This one is perfect . Thanks to my Daughter for recommending it .	1
I wore out my original one , so this purchase was a no-brainer . I pulse/chop carrots for salads , and just this use is worth the price . If I do n't have the mini food processor and I 'm going to make a salad , I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor , and wash all the parts afterwards . Carrots are so good for you , and I like small pieces of carrot in salads , not chunks like you get with a knife . I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces , dressing , and grating single servings of firm cheese . Very useful and versatile . This one is just like my old one , except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking .	1
I love this little guy ! I use it for just about everything ! I make salad dressing all the time , and yesterday I made topping for a cherry crumble . Easy to use , easy to clean ! I never put any of the parts in the dishwasher , I think its ok to do so , but from past experience , these sort of items tend to wear out more quickly if they are subject to the heat of dishwasher drying , so I do n't do it . This is definitely one of the handiest little gadgets in my kitchen . Great for gifts too !	1
It works well but is a little smaller than I had expected . This is my fault and not the fault of the machine	1
I 've had one of these little numbers for years and had to replace it recently when the piece of the cover that locks it in and allows the device to turn on sheared off . This happened after 4-5 years of regular use , though , it was n't new by any stretch of the imagination . I read reviews about other models thinking it might be time for a change - I was annoyed that Cuisinart would n't just sell me a new cover ; I had to buy the whole basket and cover apparatus for nearly as much as a new machine . In the end , though , I did just buy a new one . This baby chops , dices , and is great for making emulsions for mayonnaise or Caesar salad dressing . The blade can be flipped over for different uses . If you read the directions that come with the product , they explain clearly how to use the appliance so that you do n't get onion mush . The only thing I do n't do with it is grind spices - I have not had good luck with that and prefer to use an old coffee grinder . Otherwise , it does exactly what it says it does .	1
I love this little appliance for chopping small amounts of food . Does an excellent job . It replaced one that I had used for 16 years .	1
Seems to be a solid blender . I was worried about the negative reviews but after using it myself I am convinced that those were user errors . There is a possibility that the glass jar is not correctly placed on the base which could lead to accelerated wear of the plastic connectors . This should not happen with a bit of care . Only bit of criticism that I have is that the blender could be slightly faster and blend more foamy .	1
I may have lucked out with this item now that I 've seen all the bad reviews with it.I 've been using this blender almost everyday to make shakes/pina coladas for over five years , and it still works ! I use only four of the 7-speeds since you only really need high-medium-low settings . The glass is of excellent quality and very thick ; I 've banged it accidentally several times and there 's not a scratch on it . The top has a great grip when you close it . The base is made of plastic and feels a little cheap . I 'm not sure what else to say about this item , it blends well and it 's easy to clean up after , simple as that ! I admit I am a Cuisinart brand whore . I ca n't help it , they make well-designed appliances , that work fantastic , that match beautifully with my decor -- a trifecta of perfection ! And not one of them has failed on me ( yet , fingers crossed ) .Recommended from me , but please take the other reviews into consideration .	1
I chose this blender because I love the color pink . It is a fair price for a blender that works well .	1
This is a great blender . I had a Cuisinart Duet before - which still works but it 's not nearly as pretty as this pink one . It 's reasonably quiet and does the job . Cuisinart machines are generally a good investment . I 'll have to use it more to see if it 's really a great product .	1
I own several blenders . I love this one . The size is perfect . The color pleasant . It is easy to operate . A must have for a small kitchen .	1
This blender does a great job and is not to heavy or cumbersome . It 's easy to use and take apart for cleaning . Would recommend this !	1
I received this as a wedding gift and like it a lot . Although it is super easy to use , it is not really a practical gadget for regular use . The canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance . The appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath . Would be a good purchase for those who like different ice cream flavors , dieters , or those with special diet requirements ( like no sugar ) . I usually make mango ice cream in it . In addition to ice-cream , it is fun for parties to make slushy fruity drinks . In that case you will want to get an extra canister .	1
My mom gave me this ice cream maker as a Christmas present a few years ago . My husband and I are vegan , so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes . ( I eventually started compiling them in my blog , A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise . ) We 've never had a problem with the machine . Every recipe I 've invented has frozen nicely . I keep the bowl in the freezer all of the time , so I can make ice cream whenever I feel like it.I do wish that the plastic covering/shield thing was dishwasher-safe , because it can be a pain to clean , especially when I 'm using a high-fat coconut milk . Still , it 's not too difficult , and the reward ( awesome vegan ice cream ) is worth it .	1
We actually found this product on clearance sale at JCPennys last winter . It has been a wonderful kitchen gadget , as long as we keep a few things in mind ... 1 ) We store the bowl in the freezer rather than trying to freeze it only when we want ice cream . This ensures that it is nice andfrozen.2 ) We have n't tried to make frozen yogurt in it - only ice cream - so I do n't know how it works with the yogurt.3 ) Ice cream recipes that call for something other than cream do n't freeze as well and do n't last as long after they are made . When we make ice cream with just milk or with evaporated milk , we have to let the machine run longer and then we have to eat the ice cream within a couple of days . It will also have a more crystallized and less creamy texture . Ice cream with a combination of heavy cream and milk is phenomenal , though ! It will still form some ice crystals after several days in the freezer , but it 's not bad at all.4 ) If we chill a metal mixing bowl in the freezer for a few minutes and then mix up the ice cream in it before putting it in the ice cream maker , it starts off colder and freezes better.So far I have not figured out how to make a nice , creamy low-fat ice cream in this maker , which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five . I still need to try the frozen yogurt . But , for regular ice cream , this is phenomenal ! We love `` chunky '' ice cream , and love to experiment with all the different things we can add to the Ben & Jerry 's French vanilla recipe . With the price of good ice cream these days , this quickly paid for itself because it 's much cheaper to make our own . We love it ! ( Oh , and we bought the Ben & Jerry 's ice cream cookbook to go with this - it has a lot of tips for successfully making ice cream . )	1
This product works great , if the unit kept in the freezer for long enough , the consistency of the ice cream gets very good . It 's easy to clean as well . I bought an ice cream maker so I could use organic ingredients , and everything has turned out fantastic so far . I have no complaints .	1
I have had an old Donvier manual model for 30 years , so I 'm used to using a chiller bowl . However , there 's no comparison between hand turning the paddle in the Donvier model and letting the Cuisinart do it 's thing . I love the fact that the chiller turns and the paddle is stationary.I leave the chiller in the freezer for 1-2 days and make sure my ice cream bases are nice and cold as well . My ice cream is ready in about 12-13 minutes . So easy , creamy , fast and smooth . Love , love , love this Cuisinart.I debated on whether to get the 2 qt model or the 1 1/2 . My old Donvier makes 2 qts . I opted for the 1 1/2 qt and find that 's plenty of ice cream . Thinking about buying a 2nd chiller for times when I do want to make more than 1 1/2 qts or when I want to make 2 different types of ice cream on the same day.So glad I bought this ! Farewell Donvier !	1
Came without scratches , looks brand new ! Look forward to using it soon . Being diabetic I will be making my own sugar free ice cream and sorbet .	1
I had used an old ice cream maker for years , but got tired of the ice and salt mess , so was using the maker less and less . Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe . After reading some of the reviews , I was worried that it would n't come out ok , especially since I was using a recipe that has been handed down for years in our family . Well , let me tell you -- we were all delighted . If you just make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for overnight and that your ingredients are cold , it did the job just perfectly . We chose to make it the day before we wanted to serve it to ensure the proper consistency , but you would n't have to necessarily if you do n't mind more of a soft-serve consistency . Love the machine ; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again !	1
It really is . Firstly , I have to admit that I 've never made ice cream in it . I much prefer sorbets . And oh , what wonderful one 's you can make ! The machine is super easy to use , as long as you remember to store the freezer bowl in the freezer . Just pour in some juice , sugar and a couple flavorings , let it spin for 20 minutes or so , and you will have the most wonderful summer treats . My favorite ? Fresh grapefruit juice with sugar , fresh mint , and lime juice . People love it . You can also use it to make somewhat more & quot ; adult & quot ; fare . Use a bit of sugar and a bit of alcohol , for instance , a bit of tequila with the grapefruit juice and voila - wonderful adult party fare.Clean up is easy , storage is easy . The only down side to this machine is that once you start making your own stuff , it 's neigh on to impossible to stop . On the other hand , since you 're making it yourself and can limit what ingredients you use , the end result can be enormously healthy . And what better than sitting in the sun , enjoying a big bowl of wonderful sorbet , and knowing as empiric fact that what you 're eating is also pretty darned good for you.I 've given this ice cream maker to several people as gifts . They 've all loved it .	1
I 've owned this ice-cream maker for a month and just love it ! To avoid the problems other reviewers have experienced , just follow these tips ( some posted by other reviewers too ) :1 ) Freeze the bowl with a bag of ice cubes in it ( thanks for the tip , Cynthia Nelson ) . It worked for me , and now I only need to freeze it overnight ( instead of 48 hours each time I wanted to use it ) .2 ) Use a blender to mix all ingredients ! It 's easier to pour from the blender jar into the ice-cream machine , and the sugar is properly mixed and melted into the heavy cream.3 ) For fruit-flavored ice cream , use frozen fruits instead of fresh fruit puree , or you can buy fresh fruits and cut them up and freeze them . Blend away as you would if you were making a smoothie . I did this and compared it to using fresh fruit puree and found that the `` smoothie '' mixture chills and thickens faster in the machine ( 10 - 15 mins ) ; whilst the fresh fruit puree mixture tends to take about 30 mins or longer and yields more crystals when the mixture is frozen.4 ) Put a small bag of ice on top of the opening of the transparent lid - use the bag of ice cubes that you put into the bowl in the freezer . It helps with chilling the mixture faster while it is being churned . Mine did not melt nor drip into the mixture.5 ) Put an empty glass container in the freezer before you start making the ice-cream mixture . Use it to store the ice-cream . I use a Pyrex bowl with its lid as glass chills faster than plastic.I modified a recipe I found online , and get awesome creamy ice cream which does n't get frozen hard like a rock even when it 's been in the freezer for 2 - 3 days ! You can , of course cut down on the sugar or use fat-free products or artificial sweeteners ( which I have n't tried - I believe natural is better than those chemicals in artificial sweeteners . Our bodies can work off the sugar , but the chemicals stay in our system ! ) 1.5 cups heavy whipping cream1 cup Half & Half or evaporated milk1 - 1.5 cups frozen strawberries or any other frozen fruit1 + 1/4 cup granulated white sugar2 tablespoons lemon juice ( optional ) Put everything in the blender and blend until the ingredients are well-mixed . Turn on the ice-cream machine and pour the mixture in . Once the mixture thickens and has a soft-serve or thicker consistency , turn off the machine . Scoop and serve , or pour and scrape the mixture out with a rubber/silicon spatula into your chilled glass container and freeze for about an hour or so .	1
I love my Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice cream maker and would highly recommend it to anyone . I have made countless different recipes in it , and this machine makes creamy ice cream in mere minutes . I have also partly frozen the ice cream and then layered a combination of flavors creating a stunning semifredo dessert . When you can get Cuisinart quality at such a reasonable price , why pay more ? The only problem I had was that the ice cream was so good I wanted to make more shortly after and the freezer bowl had not completely frozen again . An additional freezer bowl is on my Christmas wish list this year !	1
Do n't know how it works , but my grown up granddaughter 's eyes lit up when she opened it Christmas day and it is a Cuisenart so I 'm thinking it should work well .	1
I really found this product to be wonderful , compared to others which I have used . It really lives up to it 's claims .	1
Most ice cream beside Bryers contains High fructose corn syrup a genetically altered product the goes the serial sets with acids enzymes and bacteria to create this very unnatural product and while its in alot of adult food suprising it never in baby food maybe that can be expalned as baby rats die in 5 weeks when feed it while normal rats lives an avarage of 2 years unlees there feed a high copper dietso making you own ice cream is much better for you the genetically altered [ ... ] and all those who had one die with in a month or two get over it as you got a defective one so return it . my recomendations is to use it a lot in the first month even if you got to give it to friends to make sure you got a good one . so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced	1
I usually just make ice cream , yogurt , or sorbet during the summer months only , but still I am so happy that this is still going strong ; thisCuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker , Whitehas outlasted my expectations as well as exceeded my expectations . I purchased ICE-20FR on February 6 , 2002 from Amazon for $ 29.99 re-conditioned and I am so happy I discovered it on Amazon and tried it ! I recommend buying a second bowlCuisinart 1-1/2-Quart Additional Freezer Bowl , fits ICE-20 Ice Cream Makerto freeze so that way you can always be ready to make another flavor ; when I purchased mine they were $ 29.99 as well ! Also presentation is fun so check outAnchor Hocking Tulip Sundae Fountainware , Clear , Set of 12 . When/if my ever breaks , I would buy another one on amazon PRONTO . I do n't remember ever having a single problem with it not freezing but I use very natural healthy products and it sounds like some other reviewers were unknowingly putting anti-freeze in theirs not being aware of it . I most often do n't follow a recipe but simply create my own . My easiest creation is simply pouring in half a quart of Blueberry Pomegranate Cultured Goat Milk Kefir and that froze fine and was great ! I also often use coconut milk , some sweetener choice , and a flavor ! I add fresh fruits in the ice cream or afterwards as topping . I do n't think I ever threw out any of my creations and I am very picky and do throw out other non-frozen recipes . I think my secret is to taste it before freezing it ; if you do n't like it the taste unfrozen , you wo n't like it frozen !	1
This works well , but there are a few points to make it a success.-First , make sure your freezer is cold . A lot of freezers are too warm . -10 to zero F is ideal . Recommended food storage is halved for every 5 degrees above zero F. At -10 you are golden for this unit.-Second , make sure you freeze the bowl for a long time . 24 hours should be enough.-Third , make sure your ingredients are cold . Even if they are cool , it should be ok , but will be softer.Custard based recipes work great . Regarding taste ... I 'm amazed how many people have become so accustomed to artificial flavors and conditioners , that `` real '' does n't taste right anymore . I find pure cream based recipes can leave a bit of a film on the roof of the mouth regardless of the tool used , but cutting with 25 % half-and-half or whole milk is a good ratio . Nothing beats a good custard based ice cream on a hot day , four or five ingredients : Cream , sugar , eggs , flavorings , home run.Some things I do n't like about it : Gel based freezers work , but they warm up from the second you take them out of the freezer . The old style salt and ice can maintain temps well , and the expensive integrated freezer units are about perfect , but obviously cost more . You need know know that going in . Gel is n't magic , but it works . You ca n't fault it for being something it 's not though.The dasher does n't scrape the side of the bowl , it sits off just slightly . This leaves a ring of frozen icy cream , not a smooth ice cream stuck to the side . I think the newer version has a better dasher/scraper.I might try running it in the freezer on an extension cord ... why not.No way I would pay full retail for this , but at the current price point , it 's a good deal.Also consider buying a treadmill or running shoes .	1
The ice-cream maker seems to work perfectly fine . It is everything I expected . The design is easy to manage . I have to say though , I am still working on getting perfect , creamy ice-cream from it while using quality ingredients . Sorbets turn out wonderful ! Overall , I am glad I have this gadget in my kitchen ! Playing with the idea of a perfect ice-cream is delicious in itself !	1
This works fineIt is handy when needing a small amount of ice creamIt beats turning the crank handle on the old wooden one we use in the old days	1
I 've had this ice-cream maker for nearly two years now and love it . My only complaint is I wish it were a 2-quart capacity ; the ice cream is so good but goes so fast ! The recipes in the accompanying booklet produce just the right texture in the finished product , and after a few tries you can easily modify them to make any flavor you desire.It 's ideal for whipping up a premium dessert in a short amount of time when you have last-minute guests ; just keep plenty of whole milk and heavy cream in the back of the fridge at all times ! Everyone who has tried my mocha-toffee-hazelnut homemade ice cream from this machine has loved it , and quite a few have proclaimed it the best ice cream they have ever eaten . And you just ca n't beat how quick and easy it is to make.One tip -- make sure you have a 2-quart plastic container on hand to store the ice cream ; you can not store it in the mixing bowl because it is easily damaged . In general , right after you take the ice cream out of the mixer , it can be served right away if you have kept your ingredients very cold , but its texture will benefit from spending at least an hour in the coldest part of your freezer.Some people have complained about the noise ; it 's loud enough to bother a cat but not so loud you ca n't talk over it . Definitely not a reason to avoid purchase .	1
What Donvier started , Cuisinart perfected ! There are a lot of great features to this machine . I like the 1.5 quart capacity , because most recipes that say they 're 1 quart are actually more when frozen , so I rarely have leftover mix.The opening in the top makes it easy to start the freezing process without having the dasher stick to the can . It 's also great for last-minute additions , which I do a lot because I generally add a bit of vodka at the end to keep my ice cream from getting too hard.I purchased an extra bowl and it 's come in handy many , many times . Sometimes you do n't want 1.5 quarts of the same flavor , so I 'll make the custard base and turn it into two different flavors of ice cream and I can freeze them one after the other . The extra bowl also helps if I 'm in a hurry and do n't want to totally chill the mix . Then I chill it almost to the freezing point in one and move it to the second one . Buy an extra bowl ! !	1
I received this item for Christmas . I wanted it so I could make more natural ice cream without all those additives . I used a simple recipe from off the web : Some whole milk , condesed milk , and cocoa powder . At first it was a failure because I only froze the container for 5 hours . It did n't swish when I shook it , so I thought I was good to go . After nearly 2 hours I just had cold ingrediants . I put them in the fridge and froze the container overnight and restarted in the morning . After only 30 minutes I had some of the most amazing ice cream I have ever had . I will never buy ice cream from the store again . This ice cream maker is awesome , I love it .	1
I was on the fence about getting an ice cream maker because I figured it would break shortly after using it , but I decided to go for it . I 've had my ice cream maker for about a week now and I have used it 3 times and so far , so good ! It only takes about 20 minutes to make delicious ice cream or sorbets . Some of the recipes in the booklet ( and in other recipes online or in other books ) might require some additional prep work . The ice cream maker makes 1-1/2 quarts which is more than enough for my husband and I to enjoy . It 's quick , easy and contains less preservatives than store bought.The only issue I have with it is the mixing attachment is made of plastic . It feels like it has to be handled very gingerly or it will snap in two . At times I am concerned that I will make an ice cream that is too thick for it to handle . I hope this thing last a long time so we can get many uses out of it . I 'll update if and when it breaks .	1
I love frozen yogurt . However , in my neck of the woods , sometimes it is difficult to find decent frozen yogurt that is not filled with sweetners and other additives . I make my own yogurt , and thought I would pick up an ice cream maker and give homemade frozen yogurt a shot.After reading the reviews on Amazon and other places , I was wary about getting the Cuisinart . I was attracted to the high end ice cream makers , but the cost was way too prohibitive for me . So I thought , what the heck , let me try the Cuisinart - it got much better reviews than the Krups.Well , I just tried my first batch . I was a little skeptical that I would get anything more than soft goo that had been described by other reviewers , especially since I made up my own recipe using evaporated milk and my own homemade yogurt.Wow - it worked like a charm ! In 25 minutes , I had a nice soft ice cream that I would be willing to eat right there , but I did put it into a plastic container for further hardening . Since there are no preservatives and it is sweetened to my tastes , the frozen yogurt is clear and bright tasting , without any after taste or gummy feeling on the tongue.I am sooo happy that I have bought this appliance . No more store bought frozen yogurt for me ! ! I just invested in a bunch of different Sonoma Syrups ( I used Meyer Lemon for this batch ) . Mmmmm.My tips:1 . I froze the tub in my deep freezer for 48 hours.2 . My ingredients were cold when I added them.3 . I took the tub from the freezer , turned it on and immediately added the cold ingredients . I did not allow any time for the tub to warm up.4 . I took another reviewer 's advice and placed a plate on top of the unit to help keep the tub cold while running.I do not understand why so many have problems with the ingredients not freezing . I could not be more pleased with the results ! I would definitely recommend this to others ! Just follow the directions , and the whole world of custom frozen desserts opens up - at a very reasonable price ! ! ! !	1
We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make `` Ice Cream '' with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products . We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy . We have make banana and strawberry `` ice cream '' using soy milk and both have come out perfect . The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing . We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original . We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first .	1
This is the first ice cream maker I have purchased , and this seems to have been a good choice . So far I have made dark chocolate gelato that came out fantastic , and some strawberry frozen yogurt . After 25-30 minutes in the machine , the consistency and texture are quite good ... definitely hard enough to eat immediately . I wish the recipe book was bigger , but I found the gelato recipe on line ( epicurious , I believe ) and it worked fine ( except the custard is kind of a pain to make , lots of stirring and constant attention ... ) . After having lived in Italy for a year , I really missed creamy Italian gelato , and so now I have my own way to make it . And it 's also nice because I know exactly what goes into every batch . After you remove the leftovers to the freezer , it is necessary to let them defrost for a little while before serving them , because the ice cream/yogurt , etc . gets hard ( no commercial softeners in there ) . Not a big deal though . This machine is pretty loud , but nothing too unbearable . I would recommend it for anyone interested in a small , easy to clean , easy to use , ice cream maker .	1
I have made sorbets and various full and low fat ice creams . It is easy to use if you follow the directions and easy to clean . It makes a product that is frozen but not hard . Good consistency for eating right away . We store the frozen bowl in the freezer with the bottom side down , it seems to get things a little firmer this way .	1
Ok , I am one who will pour through hundreds of reviews before making a purchase . I had a $ 50 giftcard ( for Macy 's ) and have a strict policy to only use them for something I would n't otherwise buy.I have wanted an ice cream maker for years . I would look at them , think about them , and ultimately put them back on the shelves as I thought it was unnecessary in the scheme of life for another small appliance in my too-small kitchen.Well , expiry was upon me with the giftcard ( yes , almost 2 years ) and I now live in a VERY rural area , where a trip for a container of ice cream is a 40 mile round trip . Did I mention I ADORE ice cream ? ? I finally bought this machine . My husband thought I was crazy and that I 'd never use it . Made the first batch of chocolate ice cream yesterday and let me tell you it was fantastic ! This will not go unused , my husband wo n't allow it . We both felt it was as good or better than store purchased ice cream without the chemicals they use to keep it nice for long periods of time in the freezer . Buy your milk and cream in large containers kids , you are going to a ) save a little $ and b ) make a motherload of HEALTHIER ice cream . I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still delightful.I am on Amazon today to buy an extra freezer container . I do think that is a bit pricey and am considering the whole reconditioned unit so that I can make two batches simultaneously . It 's that good.It DOES come out soupy when initially made . It 's yummy that way-I dare you to not put a spoon in the top as it 's whirring around , especially the first batch . Put it in another plastic container for a couple of hours if you prefer a harder consistency.Oh , as for the noise-come on people , it 's NOT that loud ! My standing fan makes more noise than this thing , and I 'd rather hear IT whirring knowing the sweet treat awaits me ! Honestly , maybe these folks got a faulty unit , or are particularly sensitive to noise- I do n't think it 's noisy at all : ) Only one small note to mention . When it 's done try to get it out of the canister quickly because it freezes very quickly to a very hard consistency to the sides , and it takes a bit of scraping with a wooden spoon to get it off ( but I had a heck of a taste test while I completed this arduous task ) ! HAHA.Buy it and enjoy , I think folks with kids would have a lot of fun with this machine letting kids come up with their own funky flavors . I know I will .	1
Gift recipient loved this product . I already had one and liked it very very much . It is easy to use and the product is great . The red choice made it an even more fun gift . I would suggest getting a second cylinder . Keep them clean and wrapped in the freezer .	1
Love , love , LOVE this ice cream maker . Very easy to use and clean and good basic recipes included in the appliance 's booklet . If you want a lighter ice cream that does n't have such a fatty aftertaste , however , try 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream . I wish Cuisinart would include some vegan options using almond and coconut milk , too .	1
Just had our first batch of ice cream from this product . All I can say is `` WOW '' . Easy to use , great end results and fun . My husband could n't tell the difference between this ice cream and the store bought kinds . I would highly recommend this to anyone for ease of use and cleanup .	1
This counter-top ice-cream maker works pretty well . It works best if you make sure that the bowl is 100 % frozen solid , which means leaving it in the freezer at least overnight . Also once you 've made your mix , put that in the freezer too for a little while so it 's very cold . I also add the mix to the bowl and then the paddle and then the lid , because if you try to pour it in thru the hole in the lid , like the directions say , you end up with a mess all over the counter.Another thing I 've learned is do n't even attempt to make the 'kids ' ice cream recipe in the book , the one that uses instant pudding mix . This just makes cement . You ca n't eat it and it practically ruined the bowl ! I had to soak it in boiling water and scrape it off with a metal scraper ! What a disaster ! The easiest , creamiest ice cream recipe is just to use 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup half and half , 3/4 cup fine ground sugar and 2 tbsps of real vanilla extract . Easy . Creamy . Yummy . Enjoy ! !	1
Buy this ice cream maker ! I considered purchasing an ice cream maker for over 5 years and I FINALLY convinced myself that it was worth it . I should have bought this years ago . I originally thought I 'd seldom use it , but it 's very easy to use and turns out great tasting results ! I have no complaints . I love making desserts and ice cream is easier than baking , and a great way to avoid heating up your kitchen during the summer when you want a homemade dessert . The recipe book included with the unit has great basic ideas ( I especially enjoy the Coffee Ice Cream , I add toffee to mine ) . From there , the possibilities are endless ! If you can measure , you can make ice cream . The most basic ice creams have 3 or 4 ingredients and if you are the type who enjoys stopping at expensive ice cream shops for gourmet flavors , this unit will save you money in the long run . The 1.5 quart capacity makes just enough ice cream for you to satisfy your craving without over-indulging ( and maybe share with friends and family ! ) .Oh , yes , the machine is a bit loud , but it only takes 20 minutes to make a batch . The noise reminds me to keep checking my ice cream to see if it 's `` done '' . Does n't bother me at all.Bottom line ... great price , good ice cream , you ca n't go wrong with this !	1
I 've made vanilla , strawberry ( using fresh strawberries ) and chocolate ice cream in this machine and it was all yummy . I just used the recipes that came with the machine . So far , the strawberry was the best . Each batch consistently took 25 minutes to make . It 's easy to use and easy to clean . I bought the red unit which adds a fun color to my kitchen when not in use . The opening at the top is also convenient for scooping up a spoonful of ice cream for tasting without turning the unit off . I 'm sorry I did n't buy this sooner . I love how simple and easy it is to use . I 'm going to start experimenting with my own recipes now that I 've got the hang of it.The only very minor downside is that it 's a little noisy while it 's running so you ca n't really enjoy a quiet meal and make dessert at the same time unless you can stick it in a another room . But I just make a batch early before dinner and store it in the freezer while we 're eating .	1
I bought my ice cream maker years ago and have never had a problem ! In fact , I bought one for my Mom a year or so afterwards . They both get a lot of use and get high marks all around !	1
This is our 2nd Cuisinart ice cream maker . We lost a part on our first during a move , tried a couple alternate brands , and ended up buying another Cuisinart as the other brands just did n't work as well for us.We found that the bowl on this brand seems to freeze more solid , thus making thicker ice cream despite the ambient temperature of the room . The others we used would barely hit super soft serve on hot days , whereas this will get to super thick soft serve.Additionally , it just seems to be more sturdy and the motor is n't quite as loud as the others we 'd tried ( but it 's not whisper soft by any means ) In addition , we 're dairy free , so have to make non-animal milk ice creams . We reverse engineered coconut bliss coconut ice cream ( coconut milk based ) and it is incredibly good ! Everyone we 've made it for has loved it - even die hard `` real '' ice cream fans ! Here is our recipe for those interested : Note : This recipe is sized to work in this specific Cuisinart home ice cream maker & makes about a pint and a half or so ... one big and one little can of coconut milkvanilla 1 tspagave 3 1/2 tbsp , and 9 drops of stevia ( to decrease the overall sugars ) 4 tbsp cocoa powder ( we use raw , organic ) 1/4 tsp Himalayan pink salt1/2 tsp hazelnut or almond extract ( makes the overall flavor more rich and full ) optional - 2 tbsp of kefir or yogurt ( we use coconut milk kefir - gives an added richness ) Stir all in a bowl until well mixed , add to ice cream maker bowl , turn on and proceed as usual . YUM ! ! ( no cooking or creepy ingredients required ! )	1
I inherited one of these that was my grandma 's and I am already thinking of buying a second bowl since I have been making ice cream so frequently . This is just as easy as running to the store and buying a carton of additive-packed ice cream . Freeze the bowl , mix your ingredients , fire it up , add your mixture , blend-blend-blend , ice cream . The owner 's manual comes with many recipes and with sites like Pinterest I have discovered many more . One of my favorites is 1 cup frozen pink lemonade concentrate , 3 cups milk , and 3 tbsp Splenda for a tangy frozen treat . I use fat free milk , so I tend to get 'icier ' blends than using full fat milk for creamier results , but softening at room temp for a minute or two makes it very easy to scoop and a batch lasts about a week ( mostly because it is my daily treat ) . A tip : do not use a metal sppon to scrape the bowl , it will leave unsightly scratch marks . Hopefully I did not ruin my bowl by doing that .	1
I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add . Also , I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream . It 's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender , pour it into the frozen bowl , turn it on , & 25 minutes later , you 've got delicious ice cream . Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors . We love it & there 's nothing better on a hot summer night .	1
I bought 2 of these so I would always have one chilled and ready to go . I really like how fast it makes ice cream . I use both of the bowls and keep the second unit in storage as a replacement when this one wears out . Its not that much more to buy 2 units compared with buying an extra freezer bowl . So I should be making frozen desserts for years.I also make frozen yogurt and pudding ice cream . The texture is just right when its finished . I added frozen fruit at the end and it was great.It does get firmer if you put it into the freezer . So I put it into individual portions and that way I do n't have to deal with a block.Clean up is easy	1
thats how good this is . i gave it to my sister after gaining a few pounds of making delicioso ice cream for one summer . my favorite is vanilla bean . this machine works and it is inexpensive and its awesome to be able to make ice cream in my own home . I will get an updated model of this next summer ( after i workout intensely for 3 months ) .	1
I really was not expecting the quality of product I received in the Cuisinart ICE-20R Ice Cream Maker ... I was buying on the name recognition only , best price , and expected a glorified toy . But , this little machine is not only cute ... it is EASY to use and delivers ! It 's truly a professional kitchen appliance that works like a charm ! In addition , it is easy to use ... just pour in the recipe ... flip the switch ... 25 minutes later you 're eating the real deal .	1
I was SO EXCITED when I received this in the mail because I 'm vegan and in order to have great and wonderful ice cream flavors - I have to make them . In the first few months - I must have tried about a dozen recipes - some good and some bad , but none were any fault of this ice cream maker . Once I learned that you have to put the freezing compartment in the BACK of the freezer and make sure it stays there for at least a couple days between uses - I no longer had soupy ice cream . Once I learned that you absolutely have to have a decent fat source in every recipe ( no low-cal stuff here ) - I no longer had hard ice cream that needed an ice pick to be chipped out . From chocolate candy cane , to cinnamon apple crumble , to avocado ( yes ! ) - this ice cream maker helped my vegan ice cream dreams come true . I gave only 4 stars simply because , with this design , there is no way to prevent ice cream from gathering on the edges and keeping the middle from getting as cold as it could . With better side-scrapers or some kind of middle-freeze-chamber - it could be better .	1
I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use , and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt , I 'd say I prefer the yogurt base better . Why you might ask ? ? I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat . Too much stress and time for me ! The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge ( courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON . ) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet , tart yet sweet , yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star . All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly . The noise is a 3 . I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m. Would I run it during dinner etc . no.I would recommend this product and purchase again .	1
Without a doubt , this is a great appliance ! Mine was a gift , but Amazon 's price is the best ( as is the service ) . It works exactly as Cuisinart says it will and what more can you ask than honesty.The bowl freezes quickly in my upright freezer . Some reviews say their bowl never freezes solid . Perhaps their freezers need adjusting ? In fact , after making ice cream ( about 20 minutes ) my bowl is still mostly frozen.Recipes do not seem to be as important as when baking , so do n't be afraid to try something innovative . Start with a proven recipe to get the feel of it , then improvise.We are healthy eaters . It 's nice to know the ingredients I 'm using are healthy . It 's also nice to be able to adjust the sweetness to our liking.Have fun !	1
I bought this for my elderly mother and she loves it ! It 's working wonderfuly and making some fantastic ice cream . She can see it make the ice cream from the top . I 'm sure it would be fun for kids to watch as well . No problems at all with it . Everyone should have one of these .	1
One of the best things about homemade ice cream and ice is that they seem to encourage people to join in making them . When I first started using mine for dinner parties , I would apologetically excuse myself , duck in the kitchen , muffle the noise of the freezer with a towel and scoot back every so often to check on progress.What I discovered was that people like to gather around the thing while it 's running , so now I simply hand people a drink while I get the ingredients and we all stand around watching dessert happen.This last-minute approach has another advantage : it gives you incredible freedom when it comes to recipes . You see , the chemistry of freezing foods has its own set of built-in limits . You need to add appropriate amounts of sugar and alcohol to lower the freezing point of your mixture so that you get an ice and not an ice cube*.Making your ice just before you serve it allows you a lot of freedom . Since you 'll be serving it right away , you can stop the machine whenever the mixture looks right . The whole process is really easy , so if you buy an extra bowl , you can experiment with different flavors in one meal or even try some unsweetened ices in the middle of a meal . ( Cucumber puree frozen with mint in the middle of a July 4th dinner turns out to be a million times better than it sounds . ) Be sure to allow enough time beforehand for bowls to chill in the freezer and make sure all ingredients are cold before you start.Lynn Hoffman , author of The New Short Course in Wine*A great source of explanation of freezing foods and some recipes is Harold McGee 's The Curious Cook .	1
I have purchased this ice-cream maker refurbished from Amazon.com and it works great . It is very quiet ( a bit louder than your average microwave ) and does n't take up much counter space . However , it is definitely not for impulse ice-cream eaters . You have to pre-freeze the maker 's bowl for about 12 hours prior to making ice-cream and all the ingredients you pour into the maker have to be chilled for at least an hour or two , and then it takes about half an hour to an hour for the ice-cream to solidify.The maker comes with a small instruction booklet and some recipes . The recipes are by no means plentiful but offer an idea how to make good ice-cream . If you know anything about cooking , it wo n't be too hard for you to figure out new recipes , but if you do n't , you can always buy one of the ice-cream recipe books.The good thing about this maker is that you control exactly what goes into your ice-cream , so it 's an alternative if you 're on a diet ( whether to lose weight or just ca n't eat walnuts ) . If make the ingredients before making dinner and have the bowl pre-frozen , you can let the ice-cream set during your dinner and end up having a nice dessert afterwards . It 's great family fun , from what I hear.The only downside though is that most ice-cream you make in this maker comes out a bit too soft and requires further freezing in the freezer ( about 2 hours ) . So if you like your ice-cream vey solid , you are probably better off just getting a pint of Ben & Jerry 's .	1
I am adding comments on 7/27/08 to my original from April 2006 : If I only used this machine once a year , it would deserve the space it occupies on my kitchen counter . I probably only use it about 3-4 times a year , but I could not do without it . I just finished making Nigella Lawson 's ( Food TV ) Margarita ice cream . If you have any doubts about an ice cream maker , get that recipe and try it , you 'll be glad you got the ice cream machine . Again , I recommend the Ben & Jerry 's ice cream recipe book to go with it ! -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I never knew ice cream could be so easy . Someone at work shared his Ben & Jerry 's book with me , which inspired me to get the ice cream maker . I love this machine . Seemed like it used to take all afternoon to crank that hand ice cream maker ( back in the day ) when I was a kid , now this machine does it in under 30 minutes . I feel like Rachel Ray ! Since half gallons of ice cream at the grocery store have gone down to 56 ounces , I 'd just as soon spend my money for the ingredients to make my own.My first batch was strawberry , from the Cuisinart recipe book that came with the machine . It was wonderful . Just be sure to have your bowl good and frozen , one batch i had to do twice because i only left the bowl in the freezer for 18-20 hours . Reviewer B. Pfahnl `` bpfahnl '' suggested putting a ziploc bag of ice cubes in the bowl when you have it in the freezer -- excellent suggestion.I do try making half batches since I live alone and do n't need a quart and a half of ice cream at a time . Because of the price and fat in heavy whipping cream , I use part half and half . Still good ice cream . And another colleague at work suggested using 1/4 cup or so of Dream Whip for smoothness . Jury still out on that one.But it 's all good . Seems like you ca n't go wrong . If you do n't have one yet , hurry ! Before summer gets here and you really want a delicious bowl of homemake ice cream !	1
I just received this yesterday , and after freezing the container for 6 hours we tried a batch of frozen yogurt . I was a little apprehensive , since I 'd read reviews where people were unable to get good results even after freezing the unit for 24 hours . My first batch worked flawlessly ! The machine was quiet , operated smoothly , and it was soooo simple ! I am going to buy an extra freezing cannister so we can do two batches back-to-back . We 've been using our old electric rock salt machine , but now we 'll probably get rid of it . Also , due to the ease of using this Cuisinart maker , we 'll make more of our own ice cream more often . I recommend it .	1
I 've had my Cuisinart ice cream maker for 5 years now and am still delighted with it ! I even bought an extra freezer bowl in case I want to make 2 flavors the same day . I do make sure to stop the freezer after 20-25 minutes of operation or the ice cream will start to soften . And I learned early on to chill the ingredients OVERNIGHT or the ice cream wo n't freeze - just gets thick . But it 's a great item , and does n't take up much space on the counter . I 'm especially happy with it since I ca n't eat regular ice cream because of lactose intolerance . So I use liquid nondairy creamer to make ice cream in this freezer and it 's very satisfactory !	1
The best and fastest way to make excellent ice cream and sorbet . Wonderful product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker , White	1
I bought mine at bed , bath & beyond for $ 40.00 . This is the best ice cream I have ever tasted.The ice cream comes out soft serve , but if you will freeze for a few hours it comes out hard just like store bought.My kids love the lemon sorbets . I would buy this product again & again .	1
I picked this up at the start of summer . i 've made quite a few batches of ice cream . My favorites come from the Ben & Jerry cook book . There are a lot of benefits from making your own ice cream . it 's cheaper . It 's rewarding . It 's healthier too . Even if you make the most decadent ice creams , you 're still using all natural ingredients with no preservatives.There are some tricks to this machine that greatly help performance. # 1 Make sure the bowl is frozen . Leave it overnight . Shake it and if anything sloshes , it 's not ready. # 2 Chill all ingredients . Even if the ingredients just came from the fridge , put the batter back in . I test my batter to make sure it 's 35-38 degrees before starting . This will make the freezing process more gradual , which means the ice crystals will be smaller . Small crystals mean a smoother texture. # 3 I let the machine work until there 's little or no movement in the ice cream . This depends on how much you 've got in the machine , but my recipes make the ice cream expand up above the lip of the container . When ice cream forms over the paddle and does n't get folded back in , that 's when I turn it off. # 4 Let it firm up in the freezer for 4-6 hours . IT WILL BE SOFT , maybe even runny , out of the machine . I try to avoid runny , so next time either let the machine run longer or your kitchen may be too warm . Why is runny bad ? Runny is liquid and you want to try and keep air in the ice cream , so the firmer it is going in , the better . Get it in the freezer fast . Also resist the urge to pack the ice cream down , with either a utensil or by dropping it on the counter . A smooth surface may look nice , but you want to keep air in the ice cream . The air is what makes it easy to scoop and gives it a good texture. # 5 Put the bowl in a plastic bag while in freezer . This keep the frost out and improves taste . Make sure it 's completely dry before going back in the freezer. # 6 I 'd also recommend going all out and using rich cream batters . These have the least water and will have the best texture . I 'd prefer one scoop of really good ice cream to 4 of a crappy sorbet. # 7 Add solid stuff near the end . Wait until the last 1/2 of freezing to add your berries , chips , etc . This will help to evenly distribute stuff throughout the mixture . I like to make strawberry , so I mash my berries , drizzle in the juice , then put the mush in during the last 1/2 of the cycle. # 8 Store ice cream in an air tight container with plastic wrap pushed down to the surface . I use 1.5 quart Rubbermade containers . They fit perfectly and allow the least amount of freezer air to touch the ice cream . Fat easily obsorbs oders and can make your ice cream taste funky . You could just keep it in the bowl , but I would n't do that unless you plan to eat it all later that day . Plus , the sooner you get the bowl clean and back in the freezer , the sooner you can make more ice cream ! I 've used a GE model that had two speeds . The slower speed seemed to freeze better . I also know of some machines that have a reverse function . I would be interested in checking these out if this one ever dies.Mine came with an extra bowl , which is nice to have one always frozen.In all , a great purchase and a pretty good price . Have n't bought ice cream from the store since .	1
In a cooking class , I shared a table with a lady who regaled me with all the different flavors of ice cream she experimented with . That idea appealed to me so that I went straight to Amazon and bought my first ice cream maker . Just two days ago , my Cuisanart Ice Cream Maker ( 1 1/2 quart ) arrived and the freezer bowl went straight into the freezer . This ice cream maker is very easy to use and comes with very clear instructions . I discovered that you must follow the instructions exactly . The `` blade '' must be seated in the bowl , the lid put on , and the power turned on in that exact sequence before pouring the `` batter '' into the freezer bowl . If that sequence is not followed the lid wo n't fit properly . One of the real plus factors of this product is that it is easy to make only a pint at a time , since I am experimenting with a variety of flavors . The fact that the ice cream is soft when finished is also a plus factor for me because it is then easy to pour the ice cream into my pint containers . If the finished product were as solid as it becomes after going back into the freezer , it would be too hard to get the ice cream out of the freezer bowl and into the pint containers . I have make five pint batches of ice cream in seven days and could n't be happier with this maker .	1
This was a good purchase and the recipe book is great ! I 've made half of them now ; some were awesome , some good , some did n't work . The only negative was that it was pretty loud and it got hot around the base after 10 minutes or so , which I found strange . An ice cream maker should n't get hot ! The ice cream is still really yummy , but the machine could use a few mechanical tweeks . Overall , for $ 60 , it does the job and there have n't been any major problems !	1
This is a great little machine . Without the hassle of using ice or salt , you 're always ready to whip up some homemade ice cream ! I 've made variations of vanilla , eggnog , lemon , cinnamon , dulce de leche , and others in this . This machine makes ice-cream making SO much fun . I highly recommend this !	1
I bought this for my husband who is an ice cream junkie ! We have both made ice cream the old fashioned way and the Cuisinart is so easy ! We keep the bowl in the freezer ready to go ! The bowl does need to freeze at least overnight . We run the ice cream maker for 30 min . It makes a nice soft serve ice cream , if you want it firmer put it in a container the freezer . The unit cleans up easily . I give this 5 stars !	1
I was impressed with the sale price , so I bought this on a whim . An ice cream maker rookie , I was rather skeptical by the ease-of-use claims . However , I was pleasantly surprised that the product *is* easy to use and makes yummy desserts in a very short period of time [ Freezing Time + 10 Minutes ( Prep ) + 25 Minutes ( Machine ) ] .In order to make frozen desserts ( anything from ice milk to margaritas ) , all you have to do is freeze the bowl , assemble the machine , pour in your ingredients and turn it on . That 's it.Notes : - The instruction book contains a few basic recipies , including vanilla ice cream and sherbet , to get you started . This is helpful if you want to make a batch right away.- Watch the proportions in the recipies , as they are not exact . You may want to taste your mixture before putting it into the machine . ( For example , the & quot ; Very Berry Frozen Yogurt & quot ; recipe featured in the book asked for only a 1/4 cup of sugar -- far too little . ) - The machine is *considerably* louder than you may expect . ( Think blender & amp ; old diswasher combined ! ) It would be prudent to make ice cream *before* guests come over -- or else you 'll all be yelling over the din.- The machine contains no small or sharp parts . As such , small children ( with your supervision ) can use this to try out their cooking skills.Enjoy !	1
Yes , upfront I 'll say it 's a little noisy , but that kind of goes with the territory . Works perfectly , just as described in the directions . I keep the bowl in the freezer all the time now . It does n't take up as much room as I feared it would . Makes great ice cream , ice milk , bases for margaritas and sorbets and of course frozen yogurt . I highly recommend going to the trouble of making a custard based ice cream . Once you do that you may never make it any other way . Once you price the ingredients , I can not honestly say making ice cream is all that much cheaper than buying it , but the quality is far superior to store bought , and you have the added bonus of knowing exactly what is in your ice cream .	1
I have tried 4 different recipes in this machine so far . 3 were from the manual that came with the machine , and one was from the internet . All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture . The ice cream was not creamy and melty , it was either icy or fudgy . I like the machine , it is easy to use , but also quite loud . We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned . I think the recipes in the manual could use some improvement so that people do n't blame the machine for the ice cream not coming out very well . The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream , but I did n't like that it had uncooked eggs in it .	1
This Product turned out to be what I expected based on other 's reviews , but it does what it says if you follow the directions carefully.The only thing is that it does not get the ice cream to a solid texture , like soft serve as other 's have said , so you can freeze it more within a few hours if preferred as I did.It is slightly noisy but it does not bother me , sound can be compared to a blow dryer on low perhaps but not exact , Other than that minor issue it works pretty good and I intend to use it plenty , also I was glad to purchase it in my favorite color red .	1
Excellent ice cream maker . Works as advertised . Quality is very good . Product produced , excellent .	1
This is a very good model for making sorbets and ice cream . It costs more to make ice cream at home than if you buy Hagan-Daaz in the store . But , if you really like to make your own concoction , than this is really great . Also , sorbet is super cheap to make with this unit ( especially fantastic when berries are in season ) ... And , if you like a daiquiri or margarita.. ; ) [ no point in adding vodka because , of course , it does n't freeze ] ) . I made a killer peach sorbet ! The booklet also says that it can make yogurt , but , I have n't tried that yet ... I may in the future though.The ice cream maker is a bit large , so , it 's not really a regular counter-top item . Also , the insert will take up some room in your freezer and takes time to ice up . Additionally , you will need to freeze the stainless steel insert in your freezer for at least 6 hours before making a batch.If you really like homemade ice cream , sorbets , margaritas , and yogurt , than you will have a lot of fun with this this unit.Also , comes with some recipe booklet with a some other paperwork.Have fun !	1
We were initially disappointed with this machine . We tried recipes out of the booklet that came with it , the Ben & Jerry 's book and another source . The ice cream was just OK. Something along the line of what we could pick up at the local convenience store . Then we tried the recipe out of Christopher Kimball 's The Desert Bible . Hallelujah ! Creamy , rich , just what we had hoped for.We had a similar experience with our bread machine . Mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook . So , do n't blame the machine too quickly . The fault may lie in the recipe book .	1
I bought this because my son was diagnosed with a dairy allergy . I wanted to be able to provide ice cream without breaking the bank . There are new coconut milk ice creams available but at $ 6 a pint I could pay for this unit in a hurry . I buy my Thai brand Coconut Milk ( not lite ) from Walmart at $ 1.42 per can . You just freeze the cylander , add 2 cans of coconut milk , a little sugar , vanilla and whatever else you want to flavor and let it go . 1/2 hour later I had what looked like soft serve ice cream . My children were so thrilled !	1
I bought this ice cream maker for my roommate because we eat a lot of ice cream in the warmer months and he loves red kitchen accessories . Our first batch of ice cream did n't turn out so well . It was n't very thick , but we quickly discovered we had not left the tub in the freezer long enough before we started.Once we figured out you should really put the tub in the freezer overnight and make the ice cream the next day , and only let it run for about 20 minutes as suggested , you get perfect ice cream every time . The small batch is plenty for 2 large servings or 4 small ones , so there 's never any leftovers . The tub cleans up very easily too.It 's great for a simple vanilla mixture using milk , cream , and sugar every time , but we 've crunched up M & M ; 's for a batch which was wonderful . During the holidays we added a touch of Baileys which was amazing . We did try a fresh squeezed orange sorbet as well but found it really needed a lot of sugar to cut the acidity . I 'd probably just try frozen juice concentrate next time.Be sure to keep the instruction book ! There are lots of ideas and recipes inside . I 'm looking forward to trying the fresh basil and lemon sorbet this summer . Overall , for the price you pay and the simplicity of the device , it was a smart investment for our kitchen . We generally spend about $ 10 in ice cream every other week during the summer , so this maker has already paid for itself !	1
This is very easy to use ; it 's just like another small appliance you can use on your counter top . It does a good job , except that a hard frozen layer forms around the sides and needs to be scraped down about halfway through.I 'm updating this since I 've had it a few more months . It still works great , and I 've been able to experiment more . Even if I do n't get the recipie just right , it freezes just fine . I use frozen berries to make sorbets with less sugar ( high fructose corn syrup ) than the grocery store kinds . I 've also made a batch of very rich vanilla ( with eggs carefully cooked ) and it came out wonderful .	1
I 've had this machine for over a year , and I LOVE IT ! It all started with looking for good low-carb ice cream and finding none that actually had flavor . We 've made some great recipes with this . It 's fast , easy to clean , and makes plenty for left-overs .	1
I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list , and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday . : ) I just made my first batch of ice cream today . I 'm very pleased with both the machine 's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream . My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was `` awesome . '' I agree.About the noise level : I 'm rather sensitive to loud noise , but I do n't think this machine is particularly noisy . It 's not whisper quiet , but it 's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender .	1
I bought this maker after reading reviews on forums . I use it to make non-dairy ice cream with Vances Dari-Free which is a powdered milk substitute made from potatoes . It works absolutely brilliantly and for the first time in a decade I actually had 'ice cream ' . With Vances you must pre-make the ice cream mix in a pot and heat it . The mix must be allowed to cool in fridge for a few hours . Then simply place it in the Cuisinart and turn on . In a half hour you end up with a soft serve ice cream that tastes just like the real thing . The device is so easy to use and clean we 've been using it every day ! This is one of the greatest items I have purchased in a long time and I only regret that I waited so long to get one . Here 's my recipe I developed : In a pot add:9 tablespoons of powdered Vances Darifree ( or any powdered milk ) 3 tablespoons of tapioca starch flour6 tablespoons of sugar3 cups of waterTurn heat on medium and whisk constantly to combine the dry mix with water and to prevent sticking to the pot . The mix will begin to thicken after a few minutes.Now add:1/3 cup of any butter , margarine of choice+1 or 2 teaspoons of Vanilla or other extractContinue heating and whisking until the mixture is completely combined and thickened . I do this until it begins a low boil - bubbles and steam begin.Cool in fridge and follow ice cream maker instructions . * If you want to use soy milk , rice milk or other milk simply eliminate the powdered Vances and water and replace with any 3 cups liquid substitute . * If you want to make Carob or Chocolate ice cream add 1/4 cup powdered cocoa or roasted carob to the dry mix .	1
This is a very nice ice cream maker . It is easy to use , easy to store and easy to clean .	1
This is my second summer using the Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1 1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker , and it 's never let me down . Now I find that this machine is Jeni Britton Bauer 's favorite . As she explains inJeni 's Splendid Ice Creams at Home , when the ice cream is done , it will . . . still be soft , but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable . Finish the freezing by . . . hardening it in the freezer . '' My only complaint is that this machine is a bit noisy , but it takes just 25 minutes or so to freeze a batch -- not too long to vacate the kitchen .	1
I love this machine . A cousin had tried a couple of other brands including one about 4 times more expensive and had to return both of them , so I read the reviews very carefully . This one is easy to use and it works . I followed the instructions exactly . The ice cream is great . I did freeze the ice cream for an additional 2 hours after it was mixed as the manual suggests . Works perfectly . Yumm It does n't make a lot , just a little over two pints .	1
We have had this maker a few years now and its reliable , fast and easy to use.Clean up is very easy and I just bought a second bowl to keep in the freezer if we need more than one batch at a time.I have also used it to make frozen lemonade concentrate from myers lemons and it turned out awesome.Then had my own home made lemonade concentrate to make fresh lemonade in the summer.This machine is not loud , and is easy to use and makes delicious ice cream .	1
I bought this for my son for his birthday . Wow , is it easy and delicious . A person could be in real trouble with this ice cream maker sitting around.We first made the vanilla recipe and it was better than wonderful ... just a few ingredients into the bowl and away you go . Fat City is on the horizon . I love it . Thank goodness my son lives 1000 miles away or I would be in real trouble with this little machine . The price is good and the ice cream is wonderful . Wonderful gift .	1
I just got this machine and made the strawberry ice cream recipe that came with it . Ben and Jerry , eat your heart out . This is so easy there 's no reason to ever eat store bought ice cream again . No locust bean gum , no artificial color , no preservatives - and you can make it with organic ingredients if you want . The ice cream tastes awesome , and I would recommend this machine to anyone , especially those who can not use a hand crank machine , or do n't want the fuss and muss of using salt .	1
My machine did n't work the first two attempts . The liquid never turned to ice cream . I tried two different recipes - I was very disappointed . Since my first two attempts bombed , I went online and read as much as I could to figure out why I could n't make ice cream and 900 other people could with this machine . Here 's what I found out . 1st ) Freezer temp is extremely important ( get a thermometer and lower freezer temp till it reads 0 degrees ) - mine had been set at the factory recommended setting of middle range , so I turned it down to the lowest setting . 2 ) Container needs to be really frozen - do n't put in a cramped freezer , allow space around container so it freezes throughly all around container . I had it in freezer three days this time 3 ) Recipe needs to be cooled as well ! With my first attempts , the ingredients were at room temperature and then in the frig an hour or so - on my third try I put recipe in frig for three nights in the back of frig where it is the coldest.Voila ! ! ! ! ! Trying out this new information produced the coveted creamy frozen ice cream I had read others were making ! ! ! ! ! I give this machine 4 stars because the company did n't offer thorough instructions in their booklet ( I was close to throwing the machine out into the trash ) , and the preparations took me several days to get the right temperatures in the container and the recipe . I am on a roll now though and look forward to making many more favors .	1
I love homemade ice cream , but have not had luck with the traditional ice cream freezers where you add ice and rock salt . Though less expensive , they are less consistant.The Cuisinart ice cream maker is the opposite . This handy contraption soft freezes your ingredients in a mere 20 - 30 minutes and is simple to use . Simply freeze the canister ahead of time , add frozen canister to top of plastic base , add ingredients and turn on ! Consistant results every time . The recipe book included with the machine is very good , and all of the recipes are easy to follow and are delicious . Some recipes are no cook Philadelphia Style ( only cream , sugar and flavorings ) though most are custard style ( involving cooking the ingredients and adding eggs ) . All are easy to make even by the kitchen novice.Once you learn the basics of making ice cream , you will not want to buy store bought again.I use this machine about once a week to make ice creams , sherberts , and water ices . Its definately a must for those who like fresh homemade desserts .	1
This is fun with the kid but a bit messy . Also freezing the coolant takes forever . Fun Though	1
One of my favorite kitchen appliances . This item arrived on time and is an excellent purchase . I like it very much and am VERY glad I ordered it . Thank you so much Amazon.com for the great price , good value and prompt delivery . I use this item frequently .	1
I 've just gotten this machine and have made the basic vanilla ice cream twice . Both times were a total sucess ! The ice cream is delicious ! No more ice and salt mess ! Preparation time is quick and easy ! The machine is a little noisy , however , no big deal . It was facinating watching it thicken up for the final result . Time in the freezer is usually needed after it 's done . That 's the hardest part ... .the waiting ! Clean up time is quick as well ! Looking forward to trying the other recipes in the booklet , I 'm sure they 'll be just as tasty . I highly recommend this machine ! ! I know that we 'll be having home made ice cream a lot more often now !	1
I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency ' , that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint . We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle . Note on the bowl : its possible to make two batches before refreezing , just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise , but for us its not too much . Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy ( mostly dishwasher ) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl ... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit . Sweet .	1
When buying the Cuisinart ice cream maker , I really was n't sure I 'd use it , as I rarely eat ice creams . The power to create is a heady experience , though , and the effortlessness with which wonderful concoctions can be made using this machine ensures it will not become one of those useless appliances collecting dust on a shelf somewhere.This is a great purchase even for those who assume they ca n't eat ice cream ! Since you control the ingredients , you can create recipes working around any sort of diet -- allergy , diabetic , lactose intolerant , vegan , whatever ! The machine also works equally well for sherberts and frozen drinks . It 's extremely easy to use and cleans very easily.Few notes for better results:1 ) The bowl must be *frozen* . I recommend at least 2 days in the freezer between uses ( you may want a second bowl ) .2 ) Upon removing the bowl from the freezer , add ingredients and use -- it will start to thaw immediately . A friend noted that covering the top of the unit while mixing causes it to retain its & quot ; cool & quot ; longer ( a plate over the opening works well ) .3 ) The ingredients must be very cold . If cooking ingredients ( such as for fruit or egg enhanced recipes ) , it 's absolutely necessary to chill the resulting mixture before adding it to the unit.4 ) Choice in ingredients can make or break your ice cream . While milk can be used , cream results in a much richer , thicker , tastier ice cream . Also , make sure you 've crushed or finely chopped any solid ingredients before adding , as otherwise , they will clog in the mechanism ; they should also be added during the last 5 minutes only or will impede freezing ( same goes for alcohol ) . Thorough mixing of ingredients is important , as well , since the machine does not churn the mixture ( sugar especially needs to be well dissolved or will result in uneven flavoring ) .5 ) Regardless of what you do , you will produce very soft ice cream . Pouring the result into a freezer-proof container and freezing for a few hours to one day works very well.I know that sounds like a lot of hassles , but it 's really not.The preparation of ingredients can range from moments to hours , as your options are quite limitless.It makes 1.5 quarts of ice cream , which is not a limitation ( should you feel you will consistently need more servings , invest in additional bowls ) . It stores very well , lasting for a couple of weeks without crystalizing . I would use mine every day if I could remember to buy cream !	1
The 4 & # 34 ; flex tubing fit perfectly over this fitting for my woodshop dust system . I 'd give it 5 stars , but I had to remove with a Dremel some casting slag from the interior . No big deal ; nice fitting .	1
I use these in my overhead flexible four inch system for dust control . The system is attached to an Oneida 1 & 1/2 hp system which pretty much covers my small shop	1
Its Incra , its accurate , it is well made . You need your trifocals for the angle indexes and a sharp pencil , but it is dead on .	1
I have used the T-rule so much , I decided to get this as well . These rules are very accurate , and easy to use . Use a 5mm lead mechanical pencil , and store the rule carefully . They are made of thin aluminum .	1
The whole line of Incra products are fantastic and the marking protractor is no exception . The build quality is fantastic . I like how the aluminum edge stop at the bottom is easily removable with two thumb screws . It has many different indexed cutouts for precise marking .	1
This item works as expected and shows no signs of problems controlling audio/video gear . I am happy with it as I always am .	1
Aquarium light go on and off each day . Works for me !	1
While I ca n't vouch for the build quality of this timer ( it feels cheaply made and I 'm not sure how long it will last ) , it works well , is easy and simple to use , and is silent . Being silent is important to me because it 's annoying to hear buzzing especially if you are using it in a quiet room.In my case , I use it on my refrigerator so that I do n't hear the fridge on when I 'm watching a movie on my HDTV in the living room ( which is in close proximity to the kitchen ) .I do n't use any red 'off ' pins on the timer and just use the manual switch to turn off the fridge before I start watching a movie . Then I turn the dial so that the green pin is about 2 hours away , which nicely turns the refrigerator back on two hours later.This setup works very well for me and my food does n't suffer any . Before I got this timer , I used to turn off the circuit breaker for the refrigerator but I would forget to turn it back on ! Needless to say , this timer has been a life saver in that my fridge comes back on and my food does n't spoil like it did when I forgot to turn it on manually.The fact that this timer has a 3 prong plug is also a plus because many of the non 'heavy duty ' timers only have a 2 prong plug .	1
This is a nice window fan with good power and not too noisy , adaptable to different window sizes if you need to move it . However , the sliding panels are flimsy and do n't move smoothly ; the fasteners that are used to clamp the panels in place are cheap and can easily be unscrewed and fall out . The single knob control works fine but the settings are hard to see ; you will end up turning it by click or fan noise to the desired power or direction . Well-packaged in the box .	1
I have never spent more than maybe $ 10 on a fan in my life , so I was kinda antsy about buying this one , but seriously , it was absolutely worth the price for me.Let me explain my situation : My building is really old , retains a LOT of heat , and the wiring is such that tenants are only allowed to have one small window AC unit per apartment . Moving it back and forth from one side to the other is a huge pain , but it results in a sort of less-dramatic Sophie 's Choice : do we leave the AC in the bedroom so we can actually sleep , or leave it in the living room/kitchen so that we can actually get things done without dying of heatstroke ? So that 's why I bought this fan -- to help move air in the kitchen/living area and hopefully make both rooms habitable during the heat . I have n't gotten the chance to test it during a major heat wave yet ( hopefully I wo n't NEED to *crosses fingers* ) but so far , I could not be more pleased with how well it works.What I love the most about it is the versatility . It is nearly silent on the `` low '' settings , but when you set it on `` high , '' it moves a LOT of air . The fact that you can flip back and forth between intake and exhaust is really one of the selling points -- it 's super-handy in our combined kitchen/living room because , when my partner is cooking , we can flip it on to draw out a lot of the heat it produces . If we open up all the rooms , it helps a lot with cross-ventilation -- way more than the box fan we were using previously . In addition , our old building has huge radiators which produce a TON of heat in the winter , and the exhaust function , when placed in a window near the radiator , helps a lot with keeping it from becoming too hot in here . Bonus ! Basically , it does everything I hoped it would do , and a couple of things I did n't even anticipate.I also love the way it 's shaped -- it fits nicely in the windowframe , and has a cute retro appeal . It 's front-heavy , but still quite easy to move . It 's also easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning , which is a HUGE plus.My only complaints , all of which are extremely minor : -I wish it were a little flatter , just because now we ca n't really close the indoor shutters on that window , but that 's an unusual situation ( most people probably do n't have those ! ) and I wo n't fault the design for it.-I 'm a little concerned about the switch -- it seems a bit flimsy and I 'm afraid it 'll break if I turn it with too much enthusiasm . But , so far , so good ! -while it 's pretty quiet , it does make a distinctive noise on the exhaust setting . It 's a bit annoying , but if you 're more than a few feet away , you ca n't really hear it -- I 've used it while napping on the couch before and not found it distracting .	1
I have a Lasko fan that I bought around 1989 which still runs and I live in an apartment on the second floor that gets very hot in the summer so I decided to get another fan to have cross ventilation . I am really pleased with my purchase , this fan is lighter and easier to place in the window and you do n't need to screw it in the window for it to stay in . It is much quieter than the older fan even on high speed and does n't shake in the window like the older model does.I like the fan so much that I plan on purchasing another one next month and give the older model to a friend .	1
We raise & show rabbits so we bought this fan for our rabbit barn because the ammonia smell was getting really bad in there & we needed something to pull that smell out . The barn is n't real big so there 's was n't enough air flow in there with only 1 window & 1 door so ... needless to say we are VERY pleased with this exhaust fan ! ! ! We keep the fan on exhuast 24/7 & you would never know that rabbits lived in there ! It gets the smell out seconds after turning it on . I love that you can put it in the window & still be able to close the window behind it during bad weather . I was surprised at how inexpensive this fan was too ! Definitely worth buying ! & If something were to happen to the one we have we will definitely be buying another one !	1
I searched for an exhaust fan for our new , hot garage . I did not believe some of the negative reviews and neither should you ! This fan fit right into our garage window and has been working every day for months ! Who cares if it is not made out of a heavy metal ; you do n't have to touch it except to turn it off and on . It pulls and exhausts a lot of air and that is what it is supposed to do . Do n't make life more complicated then it has to be . With all my searching , Amazon gave me the best deal and with my rewards from my Amazon credit card the fan cost me $ 54 . What 's not to like when other stores wanted as much as $ 110 ?	1
I live in LA and summer can get to the low 100s . In the evenings though the temperature can dip into the 60s . So I though of venting out the heat and drawing in the cool air , at night and early morning . I installed this in one of the casement windows in my house . The way I installed it allowed for the window to be closed without taking down this fan . So at night , I turn this on and vent out the hot indoor air , and it creates a negative pressure in the house so it sucks air through my front door and windows of the other bedrooms . It does create a cool breeze as it is drawing in the cooler fresh air . I have not turned on my Air Conditioner since I installed this.During the day , I turn this off and shut the window and leave a small crack just to have some air . The indoor temperature does increase by about 5 degrees by dusk . When the Outdoor temperature goes below the indoor temperature , I open all the windows and doors and turn on this exhaust fan . This system works very well for us and I am very happy with this purchase since I am saving so much money . This paid for itself after only 2 weeks . You have to love that .	1
SO ITS DIFFICULT TO RATE . AS I AM IN AN APARTMENT , FORCED TO INSTALL WINDOW FAN WITH WINDOW SCREEN STILL IN WINDOW -- -WHICH DECREASES FAN PERFORMANCE . STILL , ITS BEST FAN IVE OWNED . HIGH-LOW SPEED DIAL DOESNT TURN EASILY	1
This is not able to go in front of my window , as the window I use it in is a double . However , I popped the screen out , and this fan fits perfect . When you go outside , and stand in front of it , you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house ! It 's a lot of wind ! I 'm considering getting another , but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house . I make sure at least three windows are opened , and it works great . I 've used the reversible feature a couple times , and I 'm glad it 's there , but mostly it 's on high and exhaust . Hope this review helps . I LOVE this fan .	1
There are too many reviews already to fret over one detail or another , so here 's my brief take : my fan is well balanced , no perceptible wobbling or shaking at any speed . The blades spin freely suggesting little bearing drag to strain the motor . I found that it easily fits several of my windows without actually mounting it ( i.e. , installing the four screws that come with it ) . That 's a plus for me because I may want to use it in different rooms at different times - I can just set it in a window when needed , then remove it when I want it elsewhere or not at all . My wattage meter says it uses about 63W on low and 78W on medium ( very quiet at both low and medium speeds ) and about 110W on high ( noticeably louder than low/medium but not at all intrusive or annoying in my view ) . If my house were bigger I 'd buy another . Good stuff .	1
I just bought this heater after seeing a co-worker 's unit . My office area , in the corner of a very large room , is extremely cold all year round . I have been getting by with a small DeLonghi Safeheat , but wanted something taller to provide heat to my upper body . I also suffer from hot flashes so I needed something that oscillated.I did n't read any reviews here first . Just went by my co-worker 's glowing praise for hers . She does sit in an office and I do n't . However , the features seemed to fit my bill.I am quite happy with the heater . I appreciate the different heat and fan settings . The oscillation works as I 'd hoped - not concentrating the heat right on me . It keeps me warmer and cuts the draft from the windows . It is very nice to have a remote so I 'm not jumping up and down to change the settings . I bought it knowing that it would never really heat my area up to the temperatures given . I just need my area warm enough to work in without a coat.There are only two drawbacks for me so far : the heater vents are about 5 or 6 inches up off the floor so the heat does n't keep my feet warm . I have to use the small one for my feet . The second problem is the beep ! I can understand fully how this would be a problem in a bedroom . It would wake me up ! The light does n't bother me since I only use it during the day . I understand people 's problem with them in the bedroom , though . Between my Powerbook and the TV boxes , I swear my bedroom has more small lights than some Xmas trees ! I wish more engineers were aware of the studies on blinking lights and the concept of atavistic threat movement . [ g ] For me , the heater only misses a score of 5 due to the annoying beep sound .	1
I just bought mine from rural king for $ 59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed . At 1/6 hp its enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights . But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like . You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in . The fan can not cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler . The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two . Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before . But we will see how this fan holds up .	1
Really , this is close to an ideal fan if you want a window fan . The biggest issue is the way the fan mounts to the window frame . When you do it correctly it is secure , but not tight . There is just enough play in the way it mounts ( drops down on screws ) that there is a rattle when the fan is on . This was dealt with easily enough with some foam tape , but the tape needs occasional fixes.The ability to close the window while the fan is on , and reverse the airflow is great . For our apartment ( 1200sf ) this fan can make a noticeable difference in temperature and air quality in about 5-10 minutes depending on the fanspeed . This is way more effective than sitting a box fan at the window because the airflow HAS to go through the window instead of cycling back into the fan .	1
I needed a good window fan to keep the air moving in my country cottage . I am able to limit the use of A/C if I have a means for proper ventilation . This fan satisfies that need.It was fairly easy to install but still required a bit of ingenuity as the side panels were a bit of a challenge . They will slide but be patient because they will also break if forced . The fan is very quiet , emitting a hum rather than a roar when running at full speed.I will leave the fan in the window for the entire season so I will not have to struggle with the side panels again until it is time to remove it .	1
This fan has run non-stop in a window since Feb 2013 without issue.The expansion panels are a bit flimsy.I note a $ 10 price increase since I bought mine . Still the cheapest whole window fan I could find .	1
Terrific fan , but pretty noisy . It 's great if you are trying to move a lot of air and do n't mind the noise.I am glad that I made this purchase ; it has been great this summer .	1
I bought my windmachine after my smaller honeywell fan finally died after a number of years . In truth , I wanted it first and foremost for white noise for my bedroom at night . To that end , it 's been perfect . It 's a powerful fan , so both the high and medium setting easily drown out any unwanted noise . Note that this is not a small fan . It 's just shy of 2 ' tall , so while the handle on top makes it portable , and it 's built to stand on the floor , it 's not made for a tiny bedroom . The sound is smooth and steady and it does a tremendous job circulating air in a hot or stuffy room . I leave it on every night and it both helps me sleep and keeps me cool . I could see this fan lasting for quite awhile and I 'm still very happy with it a year later ! Included 2 images for a visual .	1
Before I finally installed air conditioning , I used this fan . In fact , I had two of them and used them for several years.This is the most powerful fan I 've ever had . It does n't rattle or clang like metal window fans . It really stirs up the air and cools the room.The three settings - low , medium and high - are achieved by turning a huge and easy to turn knob . You can tilt the fan up or down and than lock it into position using the knobs on the side . By placing one fan upward and another downward you 'll get a wonderful and refreshing cross breeze.If you ca n't afford air conditioning or you live in an area that only needs a fan , you will love the WindMachine . I still use mine to dry clothes that I do n't want to place in the drier . I hang them over the shower rod and turn the fans setting to high . The clothes are dry within a couple of hours .	1
It is an outstanding fan ! I 'm using it with another older wind machine from Lasko to help cool down my home in early morning hours !	1
I need a fan to sleep by ... the white noise is perfect . It 's quite powerful and slightly noisy . I 'm extremely happy with it and I think you will be too !	1
In my experience , Wind Machines are the best fans out there . They are essentially the only type of fan we have used for years . An added bonus is that they are ready to go right out of the box , no assembly required .	1
I do n't often rave about a product , but this one deserves it . This is what I so love about it : 1 . Works like a dream . No rattles , shakes , quivers . Just a steady strong stream of wonderful air . 2.Well built . It arrived in the military pouch system with the box a bit smashed , but not a single dent on the item . 3 . It 's light . I can cart it room to room very easily . Even though it 's so light , it sits on the floor very stably . 4 . The only sound it makes is the sound of air moving . no whine , no rattles , no vibrations . 5 . No assembly required . None ! 6 . The design is compact , extreme care given to maximizing output for the footprint . I 'm impressed .	1
This fan really moves the air . To give you an idea how good this fan works , do you know those 20 '' box fans they sell for 15 or 20 bucks , well this Lasko 3300 fan on low blows as hard as the 20 '' box fan on high . No kidding . I think this is by far the best fan I 've ever owned.Will post a couple pictures for you to get a better look at it . I would recommend this to anyone in need of a fan . Do n't hesitate , buy it .	1
A great fan , light weight , easy to move and aim ! I have especially appreciated this fan in our immediate 100 plus temps . We use a heat pump which looses effectiveness past the ground level . I place this fan over the top of the floor vent in the kitchen and it sucks up and sweeps the slower trickle of cooler air and spews it out quite well ! Love this FAN !	1
The price is right and it moves air very well . It is almost impossible to clean . I used my two seasons , chucked it and got another one .	1
This fan is really doing a good job . It is very powerful . This fan helps the whole house and keeps the air fresh and moving .	1
This was my first pressure cooker . I bought it because it was cheap and be easy to operate . It was both of these and more . I learned to cook with this aluminum cooker , how to gauge time and amounts of water etc . Mirro has been around forever and replacement parts are readily available for all their cookers . As with all aluminum pressure cookers , the metal will react with some foods and can overheat if you are not careful . This style cooker has the `` jiggler valve '' on the top that rocks back and forth and hisses when pressure builds . Personally , I like this as it provides audible and visual feedback as to what is going on inside . You can go in the next room and still hear the hissing and know everything is going well.This ( and all modern cookers ) are very safe if you follow directions . I was afraid of pressure cookers most of my life and this inexpensive one has soothed my fears . It comes with a heat diffuser disk that sits on the bottom of the cooker and a nice instruction/recipe book.You ca n't go wrong with this , especially if you are a novice who does not want to spend big bucks on the electric cookers or expensive Swiss ones . It does the job and does it well .	1
Thing that surprises me is how expensive these can run . A sound pressure cooker is a sound pressure cooker -- not much too it . Never thought I 'd own one ( grew up with one -- home cooking ) , so thought I 'd try it myself.So you know , bought one at Walmart ( has the Wearever brand ) -- $ 40.00 , and it comes with a real return policy vs. Amazon 's 30 day return policy ( make sure you read that before buying anything here ... surprising how inflexible they are if you miss it by only a few days , even for long standing customers who have never asked for any special preferences . )	1
Used this food press for making jelly and to prevent seeds and other impurities when canning strawberry jam and jelly .	1
I got this for my parentsThey did n't want a large size , and this was just what they were looking for . They 've had it for a little over a month , and so far they have no complaints at all .	1
Working Great ! I have only used it a few times but so far very happy with it and it 's smaller size . As always with Amazon , fast and easy delivery ,	1
I have owned and used 3 Presto Pressure Cookers in the past 35 years , they are the best ! I owned another brand for a short time , it did not perform the way my Presto does , so I gave it away ! I have never had any problem with my pressure cooker 's , Presto is very easy to use , just be sure to use the right amount of liquid with whatever you make , after time you will be a pro and will be able to make up your own recipes , it is fast , and makes the most toughest cut of meat super tender ! I usually cook my 7-bone roast for 45 minutes , and the meat just falls apart ! Great for cooking Artichokes too , add 1 1/2 cups of water , your Artichokes , place the lid on and when the cooker comes up to pressure , reduce heat to a slow rocking ( the pressure regulator you put on the top of the lid ) and cook for 15-17 minutes depending on the size of the Artichoke , they will be perfect ! Do your own experimenting and enjoy the cooker , you will be hooked just like me !	1
i love using a pressure cooker because it makes meats tender ... also is faster too cook with . I got for camping and keep my big one at home . Also as its aluminum it 's much lighter weight for the trailer .	1
For those of you who eat things like wheat berries , this is the gadget for you . If you have a family , get the next bigger size , but this is good for one old guy who camps .	1
I was finally convinced that I need a pressure cooker for meat due to my work hours . I looked everywhere for the smallest size , they were either unavailable or too expensive . Reviews here showed great product so I bought it . I used it the very first day and I could n't be more satisfied . Meat cooked in 12 minutes vs 30-45 minutes . I gave it four stars only because the color changes after washing it but that does n't affect the cooking . It comes with directions which explained how long each food takes to cook .	1
I have read several comments about loose screws on the handles . Go to your local auto parts store and ask for & # 34 ; Loc-Tight & # 34 ; . You clean the screws of any oil , put on a few drops of & # 34 ; Loc-Tight & # 34 ; and replace the screws . Let then cure a few hours per the instructions ... and ... Problem solved .	1
I have vivid memories of my mother and grandmother back in Cuba in the1950 's when Cuba was free and beautiful and can yet see my mother cooking with these Presto pressure cookers almost every day ... So many great meals she prepared with it . I came to the US in 1965 and had to left them in Havana until 1970 when she and my father finally came to joint me here in the US . After a few days of them here we went to buy cooking utensils and kitchenware for our new home here in Miami . I purchased for her a Presto 6 quart and 4 quart cooker . Do not have to say she was delighted . She used them like in Cuba , almost every day for many , many delicious meals , until she was very old ( 92 years old ) and passed away in 1995 . I still have these Prestos and they are like new . I just have ordered the gaskets and pressure valve through the Presto site here in the Web . Just to say I cook a lot myself and used them very often . Presto stands back on all their models and have replacement parts for all their cookers old and new . They even have the originals Manuals with recipes and user instructions and times for every model the have ever produced . I should say these cookers would last for generations if well treated and cleaned . They are part of the dear memories I have of my family .	1
This is my first pressure cooker and I ca n't complain so far . Only advice I would do : make sure you screw the handle very tight otherwise you would get a loose grip , which is not the best experience to have while carrying a heavy hot pot ...	1
This thing has been great . I am still terrified every time I use it but it has n't blown up on me so that 's a plus lolWould have given it 5 stars if it did n't scare the hell out of me .	1
This pressure cooker is great for getting all of the flavors out of chicken and the broth gets a lovely golden color.Also good for stews.I know many people are afraid of using pressure cookers , but when you know the taste will be much richer , it 's worth using , definitely.Highly recommended .	1
This is the first time I owned a pressure cooker . It 's very easy to use and helps me cut down the time to cook beans , meat , .. subtantially .	1
This is my second presto pressure cooker in a year . I loved my first one and used it several times a week , but I did n't add enough water once , scorched the heck out of it , and it was never the same . I tried all the thrifty tricks to get out scorched ick but it did n't work . However , I liked and used this one so much I bought another one exactly like my first.I have a Russel Hobbes electric pressure cooker that is larger and really nice for food that cooks longer because I can set it and walk away . However , it 's big and bulky . My Presto is my go too pressure cooker for potatoes , makes great cheesecake , I love pressure cooking squash , carrots etc . The construction is heavy and seems well made .	1
I have only had this for a few weeks . I have cooked Winter squash a couple of times and it worked great . I do n't admit to being an expert on pressure cookers but this one seems to work very well . The handles came loose the first time I used it , so tightening them really good the second time seems to have done the trick .	1
It 's the right size to cook a roast and it 's easy and safe to use . What I usually use it for is to cook up a 3-5 pound boneless chuck roast ( when it 's in sale ) . Here 's what I do : put in a couple of tablespoons of oliver oil and brown the meat top and bottom . Take the meat out , toss in the trivet and put on top of the roast 2 cut up carrots , 2 stalks of celery cut up and half one large or two medium peeled onions . Throw a few peppercorns , 1 or 2 bay leaves and some dill weed on top and pour in a can of beef stock and add a little water.close the lid firmly and put on the regulator , and after it starts up , it 's 45 minutes to a perfect pot roast.Everyone 's got tricks for lowering the pressure , I just use a wooden spoon and after turning off the gas burner , I simply push down on the round black rubber and release the pressue until the silver button drops . There ! No fuss or hassle and this method does not hurt the unit at all.Yes , the handle is a bit short , but it still works very well , especially since I never have to carry it full to the sink to run cold water to release pressure . I 've never had a problem with this pressure cooker ( buy the stainless and not the aluminum ! ) I 've had mine for over 3 years and use it mostly in the winter months ... I 've probably made 20 roasts in the unit .	1
One of the better pressure cookers we 've owned . We cook rice and lentils a lot in our pressure cooker and this makes it perfect each time . No issues that we 've had with other brands like Prestige .	1
I 've had several pressure cookers . This one is easy to handle , good quality , and so far so good in terms of stains . I read the instructions , and follow them to the letter . Love my pressure cooker .	1
I had one of these great cookers long ago . My old one was very heavy . This one is made of stainless steel and seems to be lighter . I had to attach the handles , so some assembly on this one is required . My first recipe was , 'Ham Hocks & Navy Beans ' , and I cooked the pre-soaked beans and ham hocks in about 25 or 30 minutes . They turned out great , but had to guess at the cooking time , as the recipe was not in the enclosed instruction/recipe booklet , but in my head ! Since then , I have purchased two great pressure cooker cookbooks . I plan to cook many more dishes in this quick-cooking appliance . Be sure to read THOROUGHLY , the instruction booklet , to safely use this ( & all ) pressure cookers .	1
I cook daily in a pressure cooker so this product is very important to me . I have a Hawkins 2 liter cooker , prestige 3.5 liter and a presto 6 quart pressure cooker but they are all aluminum . I 've had the presto 6 qt aluminum for at least over 6 years . It works very well . The best thing about it as compared to Hawkins and Prestige is that it does n't let pressure off in loud installments ( which scares the kids ) , its more like a consistent whistle.The main reason to buy the 4 qt steel cooker was to have a size between the ones I already owned , suitable for a family of four , and also the reason that stainless steel does n't react with the food , which is important to me because I often marinate the meat before cooking certain dishes.The new presto has a flatter bottom which sits better on my cook top unlike the old one which rocks a little bit , the heating is even and its easier to clean as well . What I did n't like is that the steaming plate that comes with the cooker is made of aluminum . But its not a deal breaker for me . I think that Presto is a very dependable brand and I 'll happily recommend it to anyone .	1
It is a good pressure cooker . I only have one complaint . The handle seems to loosen after using it several times . I had another one , and it did the same thing . I just tighten it . Presto is one of the best , but I think they should address the handle problem .	1
We have tried Beef , Poultry , and Pork in various different vegatables in the cooker and have not had a failure once . The stainles version is the only way to go .	1
I love it . I would go for the 6 quart for extra room next time .	1
I have an electric pressure cooker that has a hard anodized interior that is sometimes impossible to clean . This stainless steel pressure cooker is a breeze to clean . As soon as it arrived I went to my local hardware store and replaced all of the screws with stainless steel because that seem to be a problem with other users . I soaked some black beans and after only 4 minutes cooking under pressure , I had a pot of beans . The 6 quart size is perfect for me since you ca n't fill it too much . I just love my new pressure cooker . Looking forward to many great meals .	1
I had purchased a Kuhn-Rikon cooker but it finally failed . I bought this one from Amazon and it works great for one reason : It can not fail . The old fashioned jiggler weight is fail-proof . Cookers with springs and valves will fail over time-the heat and pressure do damage.My little weight became crusty with water salts , so I bought a new one . No problem .	1
I 'm a novice pressure cooker user but this one `` just works '' . Simple to use both for pressure cooking and for sauteeing . I like that it 's stainless and that it was cheap !	1
Presto is one of the few old time manufacturers that have maintained quality . This pressure cooker is very well made and works perfectly . Looks nice and cleans up easy . I would recommend it to a friend ( or even a stranger ) . I am very happy with it and fully expect it to last for many years .	1
I like it , and I use it occasionally . It seems sturdy and safe . I 'm glad I got it . I have no complaints .	1
my mother used her pressure cooker to feed 5 kids on a regular basis , and the stories of her mother 's old ring-style pressure cooker , well ... just hilarious . I have no such entertaining stories , just dozens of great meals cooked quickly and well in a cooker that goes directly into the dishwasher , no fuss , no muss . Learn how to use one and you will never live without one . This one is quite good because if the cooker is n't stainless steel , putting it in the dishwasher will turn it white . And certain ailments claim a link to higher levels of aluminum in the blood .	1
This order was a terrific bargain ! The product is excellent . The results are good . I 'm very pleased . I would recommend to prospective buyers that they ascertain their needs first . I should 've gotten a 6qt size . Unless you 're apt to prepare fairly small meals the 4 qt is small.If you cook for one or two and do n't make large meals this 4 qt is ideal .	1
It 's a good pressure cooker that works well for most of my cooking . The only drawback is the pressure is fixed at 15 psi ( my old pressure cooker had 3 different weight rings that you used individually or in combination to vary the cooking pressure ) . However , unlike my old one , this one works on my induction plate which makes it much more economical to cook by using so much less electricity .	1
I use this to cook mostly my meal consisting of a vegetable & fish mixture . It works well . I use 1/2 cup of distilled water ( which in my opinion is the bare minimum ) . You must always start by adding at least a 1/2 cup of water before adding any vegetables . My veggies & fish cook in about 2-1/2 to 3 minutes , after which i run cold water over the cooker to cool it down . The only problem i have had is getting the lid to go on sometimes . I think it gives me problems if the black rubber gasket inside the lid is not positioned correctly , then it is impossible to get the lid on , probably because the cooker is new to me and needs to be & # 34 ; broken in & # 34 ; a little , especially the lid gasket . If you have a problem with the lid not shutting closed , then try rotating the black gasket a little or maybe remove it and turn it over on it 's other side . But these pressure cookers are really good , you can cook some really healthy food quickly in them .	1
This item is replacing an aluminum 5 QT cooker . Stainless steel is far superior for cooking and cleaning , and the 6QT size is perfect when four are being fed . Even spaghetti sauce is a snap with this unit , something I never attempted in the old aluminum pot .	1
Awesome . It is worth every penny I invested . Moderately priced and cleans up well I hand wash this . I highly recommend this product !	1
Been using pressure cookers for years - grew up on a farm - pressure cookers abundant.Needed to replace the 30+ year old Mirro aluminum one.Still have my aluminum 2 1/2 qt Mirro but wanted a bigger one.So I bought this one to try . Cookers are all basically the same.HOWEVER -- -- -I wish SOMEone would have posted SOMEwhere that this product is- wait for it - - -MADE IN CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA ! Oh I get it - if we are told it is not USA made , we will look elsewhere.What a rip ! I am so very disappointed that we can not purchase something made in the USA anymore.Thanks to all our government officials by helping every one on this planet but our own people.We can not even buy a cooking pot for cripes sake ! Let 's see if in another 30 years I still have this CHINESE pot.For cryin ' out loud ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. : o (	1
I already own a 6qt Fagor over 15 years old and a 2qt Kuhn Rikon . This is much better than the KR and in every way as good as the Fagor and it cost 1/5 the price of the KR and half the cost of the Fagor similar model . Based on other reviews I replaced the Steel Screws with Stainless 2 each 10-24 x 3/4 pan head , 2 each 8/32 x 1/2 pan head and two 8/32 x 1/2 inch flat head . I used locktite red on each to prevent them from loosening . So far no rust and no loosening . Cost for the bolts was around $ 3 and since I had to assemble the handles anyway only the two flatheads inside the lid had to be removed from the original item . Note the top is not stainless though or is a cheap imitation thereof.. It is magnetic so probably steel . The pot itself is stainless . Unlie the KR and FAGOR this pot weight wobbles making a noise . I like that . Aural and visual indication of pressure . Nice.. Finish and fit are fine . Bottom thick enough but not very thick . All in all for $ 36 a good deal . I am retiring the KR . because the screws keep pulling out of the handles ( no inserts like this one ) and other things keep failing like the gasket and handles themselves . KR maintenance $ 30 per year , Fagor $ 0 per year ( gasket once during it s 15 year life so far ) This pot , who knows , not much to go wrong .	1
I did quite a bit of research online before purchasing this pressure cooker . It 's definitely not top of the line but it absolutely does the job at a economical price . This is my first pressure cooker so I was n't even sure if I would use it often , but the Presto has won me over . I use it multiple times each week - it 's a fantastic convenience . Note that there is some minor assembly required .	1
I had an older model for years , and I wanted another Presto . This one , as my older model , works great !	1
Much safer than the traditional ones we grew up with , great size and useful recipe book enclosed for time comparisons .	1
I bought this cooker 6 months ago from amazon for $ 35 , and frankly , although the reviews I read on this product all said that it 's great , I was very skeptical about the $ 35 price tag and was not expecting much . On top of that , both my mother and my mother-in-law warned me that cheap pressure cookers are dangerous , and I *must* buy something more expensive for safety reasons . I am just very glad that they were both wrong ! This is definitely one of the best purchases I have made on amazon . I still can not believe they sell this for $ 35 ! The pot does not feel cheap at all . It has very sturdy handles , and a thick , heavy bottom , which holds in heat well . I like this pan so much that sometimes I use it instead of my skillet to sautee meat , because of the deeper pot + the cover , less cleaning up for me : - ) I love making soup and stock , but it usually takes up so much of my time when the stock is simmering . With this pressure cooker , I can make a meat-fall-off-the-bone soup in an hour ! Some might find this pot to be a little on the small side , but this pot works great for my wife and I . Although we have guests over regularly , I find the capacity of the pot to be very good . I would guess that this pot would work well for up to a 4-person family.Pros : =====- Cheap , at $ 35 , it 's hard to beat- Sturdy , I was afraid that the plastic handles would break easily , but they are in fact quite strong- Stainless steel makes it great for browning meat pieces for stew or stock , and it heats up fast and holds heat well.- Safe , you can not open it when it 's pressurized.- Dish washer safe , though I prefer to wash it by hand.Cons : =====- The handle can be tricky to hold with one hand . My hands are small , and when you 've closed the top , the handle is kind of big . Luckily , I do n't need to do this very often , and when I need to move it around , I just use both handles.- The top cap can be tricky to clean . I usually soak it in hot soapy water , and then clean it thoroughly with Q-tip.Watch outs : ===========- The handle curves in a way that it catches any dripping liquid , I 've hurt myself once when I was n't careful at opening the cover.- Do *NOT* remove the cap while it 's blowing ! The steam from inside is extremely hot and as soon as you remove the cap , the hot steam will shoot up faster than you can move your hand ( s ) away.Tips : =====- I keep some water bottles in my freezer , and when I need to cool this off in a hurry , I can make a bath of cold water in my sink , put the hot pot inside , and throw the froze water bottles in . This usually cools it down very fast , great when I want to refrigerate it overnight to skim off the fat , and did n't want to wait too long for it to cool down .	1
I have long been familiar with the Presto brand . Presto Pressure Cookers have been used in my family for many many years . I have to admit that I was a bit afraid of them due to some urban legends being passed around , but I decided to try this one . It is amazing . After the first use , I was totally sold ! ! ! It is easy to use and the directions are very clear and easy to understand . This one is foolproof and safe .	1
Funny story , because my mom was used one before and blows up . So when I got first time try it out I was hide in the backyard until the trimmer running then I m relax . It 's good one I love it . Shorter my cooking time and pretty good meterio .	1
This is a great addition to my kitchen . It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal . I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also . Now I use these 3 cookers for everything . I am happy about `` stainless steel '' because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration ( they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it ) . This is a well-made , top of the line product for such a great price . Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws ( holding the handles on the lid ) since they rust after a while . Other than that , I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others .	1
This pressure cooker is great . I would definitely recommend using this to speed up crockpot recipes . In fact , we used this pressure cooker twice to make a corned beef brisket and agreed that it came out even better than using the crockpot .	1
Magic ! I do n't know why I have n't used a pressure cooker before . You can make lentil soup in like 10 minutes . It 's amazing . And this one is nice and sturdy and easy to use .	1
Of my 25 year old pressure cooker , the exact same brand and style , anything that you can use for 25 years is an amazing product !	1
I use this all the time I would n't want to be without it.Cooks fast & would buy again	1
As a child I was scared to death of my mom 's pressure cooker and swore I 'd never have one . But this one is very nice . There are two ways to cook with it after the little toggle starts rocking you are instructed to ( 1 ) put the pot under water and it cools down all at once , or ( 2 ) let it cool down on its own . If you are instructed to let it cool down on its own , it can take up to 30 minutes to cool down . I thought cooking with this would be a lot quicker ; but that aside , it is a great way to have something that really does cook in a fraction of the time it normally takes to cook something ; but it is not a & # 34 ; microwave & # 34 ; quick type of instrument .	1
My mom brought a pressure cooker from Brasil 15 years ago , and on our last trip she was not able to find replacement rubber gaskets for it . I talked her into replacing it for something new , shiny and fancy . The quality is there , and the locking mechanism is STRONG . It 's not a latch on the handle like a traditional pressure cooker . This unit has slots all around the pan that link up to the lid , and you rotate the lid to seal the unit . That means there 's more than 8 latches on the pan . Those beans are n't getting out any time soon .	1
I decided to get rid of my old aluminum pressure cooker due to concerns about cooking in aluminum . This one is way nicer , once I figured out the gizmos .	1
I bought this one to replace a weight-less pressure pot . That one has an issue of leaking steam and hence does not work.This cooker is lightweight , but works very well .	1
I am so pleased with my purchase of the Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker . For shorter cooking times , pressure cooking is certainly the way to go for beans and grains . I am totally in love with this cooker . Simple to use and a good looking cooking tool .	1
I 've owned several pressure cookers over the years . This one is my current favorite for several reasons . First , I like the 4-qt . size . It 's the smallest pressure cooker I own and perfect for cooking for one or two people . Next , I 'm happy with the quality of the product . It 's hefty enough to feel substantial , yet not so heavy that it 's difficult to use and clean . The stainless steel seems to be of very good quality -- I 've had no problem cleaning it . Last , this pressure cooker seems to cook faster than my Fagor 6-qt . model . I do n't know if it 's a difference in the pressure cooker or because I 'm cooking less food in this one , but I like the speed . I do n't find this pressure cooker particularly noisy -- I turn down the heat once pressure is obtained . I have nothing negative to say about this product -- I 'd buy it again .	1
I have not used this yet , but other than that ... the quality of the cooker is awesome -- -not cheap ! All I need to do is just learn to use the pressure part of it ... I will most likely need to get a cook book for pressure cooking.I actually bought this for two reasons -- to cook meals quicker and using less electricity.Hopefully I can come back to post how the pressure part works .	1
Full size thick heat disk on bottom for even heat distribution , heat retention ( for searing ) and efficiency . Easy to use . Nice straight up sides ( easy clean up , no scorching , and even heat from disk rather than heat caught going up around sides ) , well constructed and handles can be re-tightened . Handles do n't get hot . Capacity lines are a part of the steel so they wo n't rub off , and are n't indented or stamped ( many come with no lines or cheaply printed lines ) . The most dishwasher safe pressure cooker I 've looked into ( though I do n't have a DW and would n't bother to use one ) . The fairly wide base was not too wide , and worked fine for cooking a single serving of rice ( 1/2 cup dry rice ) . I feel totally safe using it with all it 's safety features.Though it 's not billed as a quick release PC or commonly reviewed as one ; you can fairly safely lift the weight off with a silicon mit ( safer I dare say than I 've seen some that are considered quick release ) . I 'd even dare to do it bare handed as the metal under it is hot ( do n't touch ) , but the plastic part of it has n't gotten too hot to touch . I have the fingers of a professional cook and have touched the metal part w/o getting burned , but it is freaking hot . It 's not like the handles get too hot to carry it to the sink anyway ( if it 's available ) .No electric / computer parts to fail and leave you with a pile of junk ( this should last a lifetime aside from some affordable replacement parts like gasket and safety plug ) . Higher pressure than electric models . No toxic Teflon or shady/ reactive aluminum . Not dependent on electricity or any particular heat source : you could use candles , camp fire , solar , induction , etc.I like that I can hear how it 's doing from my living room without it making annoying sounds . If it 's clanking : I know to turn the heat down.Any improvements that could be made to it I think would be personal preferences ; like some might contend that the handle is too long restricting storage space .	1
all the reviews are really good which led my purchase . after three uses , i found the quality is not any superior than my previous pressure cooker . i give a four star rating for its quality and three star for its price .	1
Works great . We love the Stainless Steel pressure cooker , instead of the aluminum pressure cookers that are apt to leave contaminates in your food .	1
this is by far the best product for a family of two . We enjoy the ease of use and easy clean up .	1
This is a simple but good pressure cooker . I have owned the same model for several years . You have to be attentive when you use them , but they work great and make a great quick homecooked meal - think of it as the opposite of a slow cooker/crock pot . I bought this one for my daughter and gave her a few & # 34 ; cooking lessons & # 34 ; with it . No disappointments here .	1
This is a heavy gauge stainless steel pot ! The gaskets are thick and sturdy . It has a lid locking mechanism that is a great safety feature ! It is a roomy 6 quart pot . I highly recommend this pressure cooker !	1
Easy to use , manual easy to understand and assemble and cooks super fast.I followed the guidelines for cooking dry beans and noticed that they can use a couple more minutes more of cooking than the cooking book suggests , just make sure you have plenty of stock or water or it will burn the bottom . The only down part is that you can ; t see through the lid to notice if you are running low of liquid : (	1
Well engineered , inexpensive , SAFE , does the job . What more can you say ? Replaced an old Presto pressure cooker that served over 30 years before the handle broke . I expect comparable lifespan for this one . Steer clear of the cheap Mantra pressure cookers sold in Target . Those ones are dangerous and are not UL approved !	1
Gas and electricity has gone up so much lately . Pressure cookers can help you save by making cooking a lot much faster . It comes with a compact user guide and a small cookbook.Pressure cookers can be dangerous , so make sure to read the safety precautions . Never fill it more than 2/3 of its capacity . You can not open the lid while it is still pressurized with the built-in precautionary lock , but the rocker valve can easily get toppled and extremely hot steam can escape through it.Pros : - Stainless steel . You do not want aluminum for health reasons.- We have been using this for more than 5 years . We just have to replace the rubber gasket around the lid.- Although not as cheap as we like it to be , if you compare it to other manufacturers , you still save some money.Cons : - The pressure valve rocker . Other pressure cookers ( but more expensive ) has a non-removable pressure valve . It is often get misplaced.- The rocker makes quite a bit noise .	1
Am a strong believer in pressure cookers and have used them for many years . Have always used foreign made cookers because years ago they were better quality than the American made cookers . Have a Magefesa and several Fagors and started having quality and service problems with them ( see my review under Fagor 's 6qt . Splendid model ) . Finally , in desperation , decided to try a new American made Presto since they were now made of Stainless steel and had good ratings with Amazon . Got one on sale from Amazon with free shipping and received it lickety-split in great shape ( thanks Amazon ) . Read the user 's guide which walked me through an easy assembly and proceeded to cook a pot of beans . Wow ! Such simplicity and everything worked great . Straight forward simplicity and as well engineered as one could ever expect and as a bonus , much easier to clean . Ca n't see what could possibly go wrong . One more thing that I was highly impressed with is the users guide for the Presto ; it is super clear and easy to understand with nothing left to chance . Kudos to current American products for a now great cooker . If you like pressure cookers , give the Presto a try ! ! !	1
Oh , how I wish I had n't waited so long to try Pressure Cooking ! My mother instilled so much fear in me about using a pressure cooker that I did n't even want to try it until a friend finally convinced me . Now I 'd absolutely hate to be without this fast and safe way to cook.My first experiment was a recipe for Chicken Cacciatore . Three pounds of chicken cooked for 10 minutes ( at 6000 ' altitude ) and was fork-tender and delicious . My next endeavor was a ham and bean soup , which cooked for 35 minutes without having to presoak the beans , and it turned out perfectly . Beans were completely cooked but not mushy . Next came a pot roast with potatoes , which cooked for 45 minutes starting partially frozen , and was perfect . Then tried a chicken with plum sauce -- again a nine-minute success . Most recently we tried pasta with meat sauce , which was a delicious one-pot meal ready in 7 minutes cooking time.I love this Presto model cooker , because it has all the safety features , but still allows careful monitoring of the '' jiggle top '' , and allows me to judge how fast the dish is cooking . This is a heavy and well-built unit . The safety precautions are easy , and are fully described in the accompanying manual.I also recommmend Lorna Sass ' book `` Pressure Perfect '' , for beginners . This book is a well-written primer on pressure cooking , with recipes that are reliable and carefully written . The recipes have a degree of creativity , but are all things that `` real people '' eat.Happy cooking !	1
Only thing that surprised me was that I had to put peas and lintels in a pot , inside of the pot.I bought a 10 dollar pot to fit inside and now I can dal with the best of them .	1
I 've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it 's working like a dream . My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast ( from a recipe found on the internet ) , the best roast I 've ever had ! Before buying this 6 qt . model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size . My only criticism is that , unlike my 8 qt. , this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve , so the traditional cold water method is necessary ( and thus four stars rather than five ) . While the `` jiggler '' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models , Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve -- a welcome safety measure ! I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority .	1
I 've owned and used a 4 quart pressure cooker for 38 years and have been delighted that parts are still easy to get for it . So when I decided that I needed increased cooking capacity , I was happy to see that the current models are similar to the one that I bought in 1974.The cooker is pretty much what you need to cook with little more , no basket you might find convenient for jars used for canning . Other models specifically for canning have this . It is , however , well designed for cooking and the design well executed . The handles ( there are three ) are not attached but are easily assembled using 5 phillips screws . I used some heat resistant anti-seize compound sparingly on the threads . The same as I use on the spark plugs in my car . The handles on my old 4 quart cooker are slightly loose but the screws are hopelessly seized , despite being made from stainless steel.The handle and helper handle on the opposing side is just right for managing it on the range . The low aluminum rack , called a trivet , has not changed at all , it allows the food to sit above the water in the bottom and prevents it from burning . The pressure regulator has changed little and the over-pressure emergency relief plug is the same , except that the poppet valve is now incorporated with the lid pressure interlock . The poppet valve allows steam to escape until the rate is high enough to close the valve and seal the cooker allowing the pressure to begin building . The lid interlock prevents the lid from being opened when the pot is pressurized . This strikes me as a redundant feature since it is almost impossible to open the lid when even it is under even a small amount of pressure , but I guess someone has done it . Consequently , with the safety interlock , closing the lid must be done with a little more care than on my old cooker which did not have it . It just takes a little more attention to alignment . The lid sealing ring is thinner , but is actually easier to grease and install in the lid . Finally , the gauge of the stainless steal is exactly as thick as my older 4 quart cooker although it appears thinner . The sides , lid , and bottom of the older models are uniform thickness and are heavy enough to spread heat evenly . This cooker now has a layer of aluminum to help spread the heat evenly across the bottom of the pot . This layer is clad in stainless steel , so all exposed surfaces , most importantly , the bottom , are stainless steel . The pot and lid are highly polished , but the bar code sticker was a little difficult to get off the side . There are indented markings at the levels of 1/2 and 2/3 capacity which are visible on the inside and outside of the pot , a nice addition.The inside dimensions are 8 1/2 inches in diameter and 6 1/4 inches deep same diameter as my 4 quart and about 2 1/4 inches deeper.I cooked a 15 lbs pumpkin using it an my old 4 quart in parallel ( cooking several pots in each cooker ) and I 'm with happy with the results . Despite the extra complication of the lid interlock it proved easy to operate and the thinner seal seems less likely to leak as sometime happens with the older cooker.While I was a little put off by the lighter-looking gauge metal ( actually the same thicknes ) and leery of the complication of the lid-interlock , after using it I was very pleased to see that Presto is still maintaining excellence in design and construction of a classic cooking utensil whose basic utility is often overlooked in today 's gadget filled kitchen . I can do things with a pressure cooker which can not be done with a microwave !	1
My Mom always told me horror stories about pressure cooker , but I really wanted one after listening to my friend 's successful experience with it . I got this 4-quart one several weeks ago , and I am super happy with it ! ! I have been pulling an entire beef top round and pork shoulder straight out of FREEZER to cook in pressure cooker , and I was able to serve dinner in an hour . It 's perfect for a poor planner like me.I did read the manual over and over to make sure it is safe , and yes , it is safe !	1
I 've had one before and someone from the moving company we used stole it . We had used it for 10 years and it was still nice enough to take . And now I find it on Amazon for $ 29.99 ! Ca n't beat the price.I hope the stew recipe is in the new owner 's manual . It was some of the best stew we 've ever had . I love meals from a pressure cooker way more than meals from a crock pot anyway .	1
I have had the 4 quart pressure cooker for quite some time , and based on its performance , I purchased the 6 quart for myself and one for my daughter as well . We are very pleased . This is a good product , but it is important to read and follow the instructions for use and care in order to get the most satisfactory results . I was raised with Presto pressure cookers , and have used others . None have performed better , in my opinion . The reasonable price is an added bonus.5/10/08 : Presto offers a stainless steel steamer basket and a glass lid as optional accessories that fit both their 4 qt . and 6 qt . pressure cookers . I purchased the steamer for my daughter and myself , and the lid for myself . These products have been welcome additions to our cooking tools . Do not be afraid to spend the extra money for them ... they are well worth it !	1
I was so delightfully surprised to see how quickly this pressure cooked cooked my meat and stews . This pressure cooker packs a real punch by tenderizing my poultry in a short space of time . Great value for such an awesome pressure cooker . Also very easy to clean . Very happy with my Presto Pressure Cooker .	1
Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker . Now ... many years later ... .I bought a new Presto and I do n't know why I was ever nervous . This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear . I especially wanted it to cook dried beans . Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better . I can not recommend this product highly enough ! I trust Presto because of their longevity ( I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town ) and because they are priced competitively . Have no fear ... ... !	1
We actually wanted to just purchase parts for an older Presto Pressure cooker but was disappointed to find out that parts were no longer available so we ended up buying this unity instead . The thing is holding up and has not been discontinued yet so we are quite satisfied with it	1
I purchased this for my mother who loves to cook ( for everyone ) . She uses it and has never complained . It helps her cut the cost of using her oven.A good buy .	1
I am very happy with the quality , price , and versatility of this pressure cooker . I have made some great tasting quick meals in a pinch , and use it as a 6 quart sauce pan as well . It works well with my induction cooktop . As with any pressure cooker be careful with moving it !	1
Extremely well made . Assembly was pretty 101 easy . 6 quart is the perfect size for beans and lintels . If we were omnivores we 'd need a bigger pot , but for vegans , 6 quart is perfect . Stainless steel is high quality and supposedly healthier than aluminum .	1
I look a lot of lamb and beef , this makes the job quick and easy . 1 min pressure and meat is tender but maintains flavor . Needs rubber change in 3-6 months depending on usage	1
This is nothing fancy , but it works wery well . Replacemenat parts are easy to buy . You ca n't open it if it 's under pressure because it has a lock by the handle ( safety feature ) . Actually I think it 's very safe as it has other features as well.I think one of the most important things to look for is what it 's made of ( after safety of course ! ) . This is stainless steel which is good because you do n't want aluminum ( aluminum will stain and get eaten away with acidic food such as vinegar or lemon juice ... ) .Another thing to consider is that it takes time to heat up and cool down so even though all pressure cookers say it takes a lot less time to cook , they do n't take the heat-up cool-down time into consideration , even though they are correct about the actual cooking time.Good pressure cooker.EDITIn 2007 , I bought a Kuhn-Rikon pressure cooker and I 'm even more pleased with that.It 's quite a bit more expensive ( 4-7 times ? ) but a *lot* quieter as it relies on an internal spring to maintain pressure as opposed to gravity for the Presto . The Kuhn-Rikon also allows less water to escape . I keep both of them but I have n't used the presto for 4 months now . Considering I bought the Presto in 1999 , it 's amazing that it works perfectly even though it got heavy use . I even put the rubber seal and the lid in the dishwasher every time and it still held up . It 's my backup cooker now as I ca n't let go of something that still works fine .	1
I needed a 4-quart stainless steel sauce pan and a stovetop pressure cooker . This Presto cooker doubles nicely for both . I already own an 8-quart electric pressure cooker but wanted something smaller for the smaller meals . So far I have used it as a pressure cooker 2x , searing meat 1x , and sauteing unions 2x . I 'm glad I went this route instead of buying this Presto cooker and shelling out another $ 50-60 for another stainless steel sauce pan .	1
Do n't kid yourself into buying non-name brand belts . These belts are not joined horizontally which would cause them to break much , much more quickly . They 're bonded vertically all the way around which makes them very strong . It 's worth a few extra pennies to buy something that 's going to last much longer .	1
Great suction/vacuum power . Used in an apartment with wooden floor . The $ ( dollar ) value of the vacuuming power is awesome . It is a great advantage to not have additional attachments that will take away from the main vacuum . At the value of this vacuum , one can afford an independent and highly effective smaller hand-vac if hose attachments are desired .	1
I just moved into an apartment with a new synthetic carpet that sheds like a pack of afghan hounds ; it choked my bagless vacuum in under a minute . I needed a sturdy , no-frills , bagged vacuum like the Montgomery Ward upright I used for over 20 years before it died.This model was almost identical , and now that I 've had it for a few weeks , I 'm happy as a clam . It has an old-fashioned rotating brush/beater roller , 5 carpet height adjustments , great suction for 5 amps , and comes pre-fitted with a humongous disposable liner bag ( type F & G ; ) , plus a spare belt for the roller . Some parts that used to be steel have been replaced with thick plastic , but it seems plenty sturdy , and it 's much lighter to maneuver and carry than my old all-steel model . The on/off button and lock/unlock for the handle are both on the base , so they 're foot controls ; carpet height is adjusted by a dial on the front of the base . The long cord ( 20 feet or so ) does n't retract , you just wind it over hooks on the handle . The spring-attached fabric bag has a full-length zipper , inside which the disposable bag ( which fills the cover from end to end ) slides on with another spring . Quick , simple.One pass with this puppy picked up enough carpet fluff missed by the bagless to knit a throw rug , but there 's still plenty of room left for future dirt . It 's also a lot less noisy than my smaller bagless . The only qualm I had in buying this was the lack of attachments for cleaning upholstery & suchlike , but I found an inexpensive accessory kit made for it ( crevice tool , round dust brush , upholstery brush , extension tubes , looooong flexible hose ) right here on Amazon : the `` Electrolux Home Care 60E 6-Piece Deluxe Tool Set , '' so my joy is complete.Though the image on this page looks rather green , the vacuum is actually jet black , and the bag is a black-white-red random print . It comes in a flat box , minor assembly required . Highly recommended for those who remember how good the old vacuums were , do n't want to spend a fortune just to clean their carpets , or are into retro styling .	1
My original vacuum had a hepa filter on it that needing replacing and apparently the manufacturer no longer made them . I ordered this vacuum because all it needed was a bag . I am very pleased with it . It is fairly quiet for a vacuum cleaner , my old model used to scream like a banshee , and it does n't have a bunch of hoses wrapped around it constantly coming loose like my old model . It cleans the carpet just as well as the old model.If you just need to vacuum the floor , this model is great .	1
Great to be able to get replacement parts for my machine . Have enough to last me for guite awile now .	1
These are real Hoover vacuum bags . They 're easy to replace , and they do a good job filtering the dirt out .	1
These bags are as advertised ... They fit the model of vacuum I have and do a good job of filtration . Also , they were shipped quickly .	1
Easier for me to purchase from Amazon than to go out to the stores . I am satisfied . They fit my vacuum perfectly .	1
I love buying things I use constantly from Amazon instead of searching through stores looking for different items . When you get a bit older and knees and arthritis bother you , Amazon is heaven sent . These bags work perfectly for my old Hoover vacuum . Bought enough so I wo n't run out for quite some time . Thanks Amazon .	1
works in vacuum , ok	1
These bags are durable and easy to install and remove . I 've used a number of them and never had an issue of bags breaking or leaking . RECOMMEND !	1
Although I have n't used it yet , ( due to a leg injury ) I had one years ago and I found it to do a good job on carpet and linoleum . I am actually looking forward to when I can use it . The price is also well within range for the average person . I have used Hoover products regularly for most of my adult life .	1
Good product for the dough . A bit tricky to put together , tube to the water dispenser did n't fit right , but I rigged it up and it works fine . No other alternative in this price range , I 'm overall happy.Mike	1
Good product . I expect to be using this buffer for years to come .	1
My Mom bought me one of these from Walmart when I was in middleschool . Ive kept it ever since ... Its lasted through highschool , going to summer camp , it went to college with me ( I used it as extra seating and as a bed a couple of times ) . It made it through moving 3 times after college and the only reason it didnt deploy with me ( much better than Army Toughboxes ) is that it didnt have wheels . its lasted half a lifetime and still doesnt even have a strach on it . I love this thing !	1
I bought four of these for $ 27 each at Home Depot . I carry them in the back of my pickup truck when I need tools and toss them in the garage when I do n't need them . It makes it easy to load my truck in a hurry.What I like about them.1 . They will stack with the lid on.2 . They nest inside each other when empty3 . Lid is fairly sturdy -- you can sit on one if you are careful.4 . Having a bunch of them , means they all are the same height if you want to build a platform.5 . With the lid on they are waterproof.6 . Locking handles have a solid secure feel to them.7 . With only one handle locked it act like a hinge -- you can open it from one side.8 . You can write on the lids with a Sharpie pen.9 . Good size for lifting and carrying . I 've had something similar but larger and found it was too hard to lift when loaded . These are a good size.What I did n't like.1 . One had a damaged handle . I was going to return it , but they were out . I can repair it with a drill and a cotter pin -- so I decided to keep it anyway.2 . Hard to find more locally.I 'd buy more of these if I could find them . I use them to sort tools and activities by type . For example , I use one for power tools , one for fiberglass materials , one for general tools . I 'd like one for camping gear.I 'd give it five stars except for the one defective one I purchased . Functionally they are excellent . I 'd recommend buying them locally and carefully inspecting them to be sure you have ones that are defect free .	1
For transport or storage these ca n't be beat . I use them for power tool storage and another for camping stuff ,	1
We purchased two Action Packer cargo boxes to fit on our Valley Cargo Carrier . The 48-gallon and the 32-gallon boxes fit perfectly side-by-side on the carrier . We expected the boxes to be rain-proof and waterproof , and they do not disappoint . We have driven thru heavy rain with driving wind with these babies , and everything inside was a dry as could be - not a drop of moisture inside . We leave them outside when we camp , through some severe thunderstorms and still no rain gets in . They fit our purpose perfectly.We did not purchase the cargo boxes from Amazon ; our local Wal-Mart had much better pricing in the automotive department.If you want to add wheels , the 48-gallon model has drill-out spots for attaching casters . Personally , I do n't want to do that because I want to keep the integrity of the water tight properties intact , and I do n't want wheels on the cargo carrier . But it is certainly an option for those who want it , and looks pretty easy to accomplish.So why 4 stars instead of 5 ? The handles . I wish that the handles were deeper or perhaps had folding handles . The boxes are difficult to carry when heavily packed . I might try to drill out holes to add rope handles , but that water tight issue has stopped me so far . Other than that one detail , these cargo boxes are perfect for us .	1
OMG ! ! ! this thing is HUGE ! ! ! I just love these things . there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment , on a vacation , a fishing trip , the list of uses is limited only by one 's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one ( not sure if they still make this size ) & I thought that held a lot ... this one is so much bigger & roomier ... the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15 , & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this , it can be used for extra seating , a footstool , an extra table maybe ... These things are built like a rock ! ! These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends ? yes I would .	1
Excellent durability . Good space inside and latches closed . Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it . As built now , you will need two people to handle this huge bin . Would also help if the handholds were deeper . Overall , very good.Update 11/22/11 : Not as durable as I had originally thought . Sat on one of these ( I 'm not very heavy ) and the molded seem on the lid split , so now I 'm getting water inside the hollow lid . And yes , the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance . Still , it 's a decent box that continues to function okay .	1
I fit a metric crap-ton of stuff in this thing . It does exactly what I wanted and is just the right size where I can fit a LOT of stuff in it , but it does n't take up a HUGE amount of space riding in the back of my Suburban .	1
It 's very durable & holds a lot . I bought it for the back of my daughter pick up truck ( dodge Dakota ) . My only disappointment was that it was n't long enuf to kinda touch each side of the back . I was hoping for it to fit snug but otherwise it 's exactly what I was looking for just not long enuf .	1
This Rubbermaid cargo box is really nice . I purchased it to store my hunting clothes . It has plenty of room for bulky down jackets and insulated coveralls .	1
I bought an ActionPacker box exactly like this one many , many ( 20 ? ) years ago to serve as a newspaper box on my front steps . It has sat out in broiling sun , freezing winter , pouring rain , and the worst that happened was that the color faded and it started looking a bit grungy . I was delighted to see that these were still available , and the new one looks just like the old one , but with brighter colors ( and less dirt ! ) It should be good for another 20 years !	1
Here 's the question : does your stuff have to stay *absolutely* dry ? Will a teaspoon or two of water seeping through the seal destroy your cargo ? If so , then this is n't for you if it 's going to be in the bed of a truck or in a receiver carrier . OTOH , if a tablespoon full of water is something you can tolerate , then it 'll do that OK . I suggest drilling weep holes in the bottom . It 's *pretty* tight ... but not totally so . It worked for me carrying camping gear where I can live with a *little* bit of water in a rainstorm .	1
I have to say that I have this box mounted on the back of my KLR650 and it is freaking awesome . It is keeping my things that fit in it dry and safe for a fraction of the cost of & # 34 ; luggage & # 34 ; for a bike of my type . Hurry and buy this now for your KLR . It is great for what it is .	1
We 've used a couple smaller ActionPackers for camping . Got this one for a `` camp kitchen . '' Should have room for all the gear plus dry goods , etc . These things are great -- can be used as a seat or table . Tough enough to deter many pesky small critters and should stay dry in most storms .	1
I installed two Lasko 3012 fans in my fitness room after some modifications to enable them to mount them directly over the power receptacles which are at 72 inches above the floor.I replaced the existing room duplex wall receptacles with the Leviton 688 recessed receptacle and modified the fan by removing all but about 20 inches of power cord and drilling a 1.75 inch hole in the back of the fan allowing the remainder of the cord and the rear of the plug to recess into the fan . The end result is that there is no power cord showing ( just like in the picture ( where the power cord must have been removed ) ) . The Leviton 688 and fan mounting plate also had to be modified just slighting in order to accommodate each other . Naturally , I tested the fans before making the modifications which were not difficult at all.The fans are n't noisy and they move plenty of air on low speed .	1
Wall-mount fans are so practical , yet difficult to find . Never have figured out why . This fan was the perfect solution to keeping cool in a small office with absolutely no space to place a fan otherwise . It is easy to mount . However , read the instructions because , while easy , mounting is not necessarily intuitive . The fan has 3 speeds . In a small space ( my office is approx . 9 ' x 10 ' ) , the lowest setting circulates the air plenty . It runs quiet and has an extra-long cord to minimize the chance you will have to use an extension cord . It includes a convenient cord , one tug on which turns the fan off . The fan head adjusts up and down by hand-clicking into one of several pre-set positions ( nothing to loosen ) . The oscillation knob is in the traditional position on top of the fan , so keep that in mind when mounting . If you mount it too high , it will be hard to reach . Not an issue for me , because I always let it oscillate . This is the second fan of this model I have bought and have not been disappointed yet .	1
I have had an older model Eureka mighty mite canister vacuum for over ten years . I like it so much that when the newer model went on sale , I decided to get another so that I could keep one upstairs and one downstairs.My favorite thing about this vacuum is the availability and affordability of replacement bags . I have had quite a few vacuums over the years where models have been discontinued and it becomes virtually impossible to find bags . Eureka , fortunately , has kept the same MM bags standard across the various model changes.Unfortunately , one thing that I discovered with this latest model , is that the hose quality has deteriorated . The new hose is much softer and tends to kink easily . One can hear by the sound of the motor that there is a kink in the line but it is such a nuisance constantly turning and trying to straighten the hose . I 'm glad that the hose connections remain the same since I switched out the hose from the older model since I plan to use that one upstairs where it will get less use.I would rather have paid a bit more for this vacuum and have the stronger hose that Eureka used to produce . I still like the product but have to deduct one star for the hose quality .	1
This was a gift for my mom . She says it works great is lightweight and easy to move around .	1
We have only tile and wood floors so this is the best little vacuum for us . It is light weight , has a fairly long cord , and I prefer to have a bag over the bagless types which can smell and clog after time . The wand easily gets under furniture and it has a strong suction.If you have rugs this will not work well for you as there is not a beater bar .	1
I used to own a Mighty Light , which is a very similar vacuum from Eureka.Used that one for about 5-6 years until it finally broke.This thing is slightly stronger and a little louder.This vacuum does a great job getting dust and Cat hair from just about anything ( carpet , velvet drapes ) . Best part is you do not have to run the thing over every inch of the surface ( unlike other small canisters ) , it 's powerful enough to suck dust in even when it 's in the close proximity .	1
I ordered this vacuum nearly a year ago and absolutely LOVE it . BUT the hose that came with it was flimsy and would collapse , thus limiting suction . I contacted Eureka about this and they shipped me a new hose which is much stronger . Apparently the flimsy one was faulty . I was very impressed with the customer service .	1
I use a Shark upright for area rugs and it does a great job . However , it was a hassle to use on my bare floors and I did not like the hose feature so I was looking for something light and maneuverable for bare floors , dusting , and upholstery . I 'm very happy with this little vacuum which I think is a great value for the modest price tag.PROS : I 've had many canisters over the years and they were heavy and awkward . Dragging them around was like often like trying to drag a reluctant mule out of the barn during feeding time . Plus the hoses could be like wrestling a boa constrictor . The Mighty Mite is light and easy to carry , follows along easily when pulled , and the hose is easy to handle . When I first looked at the hose I was afraid it was way too flimsy and would kink like crazy but that has not been the case . The hose swivels easily on both ends and it is long , light , and easy to deal with . It makes vacuuming the bare floors way easier than it has ever been.The cord coils up underneath the vac rather than retracting which is actually a plus as far as I 'm concerned because it 's one less mechanical thing to go wrong . The vac sits up politely while you coil it around the cord holders so it 's not a hassle to wind in place . Suction is good for such a small vac and it does a fine job on bare floors . The bags are a decent size.CONS : Suction control is in an awkward place near the handle so it 's easy to accidentally adjust . Wrapping a piece of blue tape ( the handy girl 's secret weapon ) around it solved that problem . The attachments are a joke as you might expect from a $ 56 vacuum . However , this is easily solved by purchasing a high quality floor brush , duster brush , and upholstery cleaner . I had several I had saved from previous vacs and they fit just fine on the round end of the wands . You can get adapters if the attachments are too big for the wand . You will probably NOT be happy with this vac if you have wall to wall carpet . It does not have a powered carpet head so you can only do superficial cleaning of low pile rugs . The cord is fairly short : 20 feet , so you 'll have to move the plug more often than one with a longer hose . It is fairly noisy but ear plugs are cheap and easy to use.I have n't had mine for very long but others who have report that durability is good . Even if I had to replace it every year , the price would make that not prohibitive .	1
Good price and light weight , makes it easy to store and carry out to the garage to clean the cars .	1
I wanted a small hand vac to get into tight places and to suck up bugs from the windows . Mighty Mite was recommended and had good customer service rating plus the price was far below what I would have paid locally .	1
Noisy , but it sucks oh so good . So light and easy to move around , it 's perfect . These are very hard to find at local stores for some reason . Great buy .	1
Absolutely love my Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum ! The suction is great , unbelievable . Now I remember why I loved canister vacs more than uprights.The plastic hose got kinked once and did n't crack.I give it 5 stars but I just wish they made them with the old style cloth hoses . Plastic ones make my nervous .	1
minus a star because the cord is manual . I love this style of vacuum and it works well on carpet ! I have n't tested it on a really dirty carpet , but the suction is nice . It is a little awkward to move around , but I 've managed to work with it .	1
The Eureka vacuum itself is amazing . It is very powerful in such a small unit . It is surprised me at the first time when I used it . There is a small vent hole in conjunction of the handler . I accedentally put my left hand over the hole ( I should xeal the hole first ) . The vacuum suck force made a bruise on my hand.The unit is very convinient ( portable ) . I used it for the hard wood floor and on my Mini-Van . I do not need to buy another one for my mini-van .	1
There seems to be some confusion about the name , I 've seen this advertised as both `` Mighty Mite '' and `` The Boss '' and the manufacture listed as either Electrolux and Eureka ( interchangeable companies ) . The model number I am reviewing is the 3670G . Regardless of the name , I really like this vacuum cleaner.We recently purchased a Hoover bagless vacuum , and I was less than excited about the suction of the extension wand and attachments . This plus the fact that we are soon getting rid of a lot of carpeting in our house and I wanted to get something more suitable for hardwood.This is a powerful , but relatively quiet little machine . Fairly basic , but with all the necessary tools . The hose is long enough to reach the ceiling without effort . It 's also removable and can be attached to the back of the machine to create a blower ( not a very powerful blower , but a blower nonetheless ) . The suction is adjustable and far superior to that of an upright with attachments , which is exactly what I wanted . Works very well on bare floor and carpet too . Note , this does not have a beater bar , and do n't think it was really designed for carpet only . So , it is not going to take dog hair , for instance , out of a carpet as well as a regular upright . For the purpose I need it for , it is wonderful.My only complaint is the cord , which is stored/wrapped on the bottom of the machine . I find this location to be quite inconvenient , but since the tools are stored in the back , and there is a handle on top , I guess this was the only location left.I am very happy with this vac and would recommend to anyone .	1
I need something to reach the ceiling easily - this fits the bill very well . We have ceiling fans in most rooms and I was tired of standing on a ladder to clean them - this is lightweight and super easy to maneuver - ( I did use another attachment from my old machine get the top of the fan blades ) Baseboards are a breeze - no bending anymore with this . I have popcorn ceilings ( ugh ) in most rooms - this gets all the dust out so easily - I was surprised to see it pick up fine cobwebs that could not be seen - so far all it removes it the dust and cobwebs - no 'popcorn ' on the floorI have the 2nd in my studio - It is great setting on the work table to pick up those tiny pieces of glass that can get imbedded in the palm of my hand - before I used a studio brush to clear my work surface - that always left a few stray pieces on the table and floor - with this small machine I can leave it under the worktable plugged in and ready.Very pleased with this purchase - if you have trouble constantly bending and/or climbing on stools ( or chairs ) to clean I would highly recommend this ,	1
This vacuum cleaner is so much easier to use than the one it replaced . The old one was a bag-less type that works only for a few minutes , then you 'd have to stop to tear it apart to clean the canister and filters . The HEPA filter it had was a royal pain in the ... . , it would clog up in not time at all . No suction until it was cleaned . Typical with all bag-less cleaners , they will not work with very fine dust.This little vacuum cleaner has plenty of suction and it allowed me to clean the whole house without loosing suction . After the first bag filled up I pulled it out and replaced it with a new one , simple , easy , done in no time at all . It made cleaning the house a pleasure ( for the first time ) , and I did n't have to stop to clean the filters like I would have with the bag-less cleaner . It is so easy to maneuver it around the house you almost forget its following you . The floor cleaning wand and nozzle take no effort at all to use , plus I can now get under the furniture without having to move anything around . This vacuum cleaner is one I should have bought in the first place , not to mention the amount of money it would have saved me . Very pleased with this unit , and also the super service from Amazon .	1
I have all hard wood floors and love this . The hoses and cords are really long too . I can vacuum really fast with this , very good suction .	1
I have two Oreck uprights ( upstairs and down ) , am a single , widowed guy with a housekeeper who loves the upright Oreck vacuums but they are not good for wood floors ( great for carpet ) , we BOTH disliked the Oreck canister vacs which I had received free with the uprights as they were weak in power and had VERY small bags . We BOTH REALLY like these Eureka Mighty Mites , a LOT ! They are great for multiple cleaning projects and I just got my 2nd one for my upstairs home office . The bags are large for a small canister vac , they are VERY powerful ( no comparison between this and the Oreck canister ) ! ! ! . For wood floors , Eureka does have an attachment for sale on their site which is a little better for bare floors but the one with this will do just fine . I also use this for my car-great for cleaning cars and in garages . I also use one for cleaning the wood floor on my screen porch . A GREAT price , large bag , powerful , lightweight , could not be more pleased.UPDATE : After a few years now these are still running strong without a glitch ! They are awesome for the price , great power . Would replace them again with this in a minute .	1
My unit is an older model which is called & # 34 ; The Boss & # 34 ; but is the very same as this . Mine has EXCELLENT suction and I do n't mind that it is a little noisy . Mine is used for cleaning up around the woodstove . It does an excellent job of sucking up ash and wood particles of various sizes . I do n't understand the negative reviews , unless these people received & # 34 ; lemons & # 34 ; . I would highly recommend this vac for small jobs , I do n't think it was intended to be used for whole house vacuuming .	1
This is one of the best household products I ever bought . This is a very powerful little unit and makes all those hard to clean areas a snap to clean . I do n't know what I did without this before . From day one it was in use . I now can get all the floor corners and ceiling corners that were so hard to get with a regular Vacuum and attachments . And , you can vacuum your car with this too . You ca n't go wrong with this canister vac .	1
We needed a new vacuum and I could not decide on what i really wanted . So far this thing has been pretty sweet for the price . Your are obviously not going to get quiet , super cyclone , bagless , blah blah blah and I was not expecting that . This thing is loud , takes bags and has is not easy to store . But it does the job we needed and that is what counts.I am taking one star off because I really wish there was a place to clip the hose and attachment tubes to the housing for better storage . Other than that , color me impressed .	1
We own this vacuum and it has performed wonderfully for several years . This purchase was a gift for our daughter .	1
I have 4 dogs and this little vacuum has worked miracles for me . So light weight and easy to use . Changing the bags is a breeze ! Great purchase for the money .	1
Bought this as a gift for elderly mother . She was carrying her canister up and down the stairs and I wanted her to have one for each floor . She did n't want the sweeper , she thought she had enough , but I left it at her house and I see she is using it but has n't commented on it -- My nephew tried it and he says it is nice .	1
we had one of these vacuums before and loved it until my wife turned it into a wet/dry vac which broke it . we tried other replacements but in the end this vacuum was the only one that could do the job .	1
This is my second one , exactly same model . I bought one for my summer house and then bought one for my other house . They both replaced Hoover windtunnel uprights . The uprights pulled up the nap from my hand-knotted rugs and was causing bald spots . The Mighty Mite has just the right amount of suction to clean the carpets but not denude them.I 'm very happy with these canister machines .	1
I already had this vacuum for the first floor and wanted another for the second so I do n't have to lug one upstairs . At this price I was able to afford it . This is one of the best vacuums for hardwood ( or linoleum , tile ) floors . The suction is excellent . I also use it to suck cobwebs and dust off the ceiling with the brush attachment . The attachments sit securely on the vacuum . But , be warned , the suction is so strong that if you have wallpaper it could suck it right off the wall . Be sure to lower the pressure which is adjustible on the side of the hose . I ca n't say enough good things about this product . It 's lightweight , is easy to manuver , and cleans very well . The only downside is that the hose is very thin and could easily break as could the door hinges when replacing the bag , so be careful when using these parts . But , at this price , you ca n't have everything . For those who do n't want to deal with that , Eureka makes a much sturdier model but it also comes at a much higher price ; about 3 times as much . For me , this is the ideal machine , and at this price , even if I only have it a few years it 's cheap enough where I could easily afford to replace it .	1
This vacuum is light weight , powerful , and maneuvers easily . It is noisy ( my cats vacate the room when I turn it on ) but no more so than my 10 year old Mighty Mite which it replaces . It works well on bare wood , tile or vinyl floors , upholstery , cobwebs , dusting , etc . It does not work at all on carpet or rugs . The hose , wands and attachments are all made of cheap plastic so be careful or they will crack . ( I wonder , how much more this item would cost if they put decent quality parts on it ? Considering the price of plastic it might add , $ 2 or maybe $ 4 ? It would certainly be worth it that small price . ) Would have rated this vacuum 5 stars except for three things 1 . The vent between the wand and the hose is located exactly where you hold the wand . The first time I used the machine , my hand twisted it in such a way that it pinched my palm . The pain was sever enough to make me consider returning the wretched thing . My solution was to wrap the vent in duct tape . Now it is useless but it ca n't bite me again . 2 . The flimsy plastic hose and wand make it feel fragile . 3 . The cord stores in a very unhandy place . Should store somewhere on top for easy winding .	1
I have a Mighty Mite that I got 2nd hand 30 years ago . We always thought it was the best , but my husband has it in the shop now , so I decided to get a new one for the house . It is great .	1
I have a laundry room in the center of the house and as anyone knows doing laundry creates dust ! I decided to keep a straight suction smaller BAGGED ( hate bagless ) vacuum like this in the laundry room and it fits perfectly where I need it to because of its shape . It takes months for the bag to fill up and it does n't seem to lose much suction at all or smell because I 'm only really using it for clean dryer lint and to vacuum all around the laundry room when I 'm finished doing laundry . Bag 's are n't that expensive and are super easy to change ... .Nothing on this vacuum has failed as of yet , however , the switch to turn it off/on is on top and I 've noticed recently that you have to push the switch a few times to turn it off/on before in works . I 'm thinking the switch is going bad ... ... ..But I paid 60 dollars for this 8 years ago and I have used it a lot here and there . If anyone has any recommendations about the switch , let me know . I 'm not handy with things like that though unfortunately .	1
Seems to have lots of power , and wheels ! Also bought a small shop vac that has lots of power but no wheels . I use that in lanai , and this on my tile floors inside the house . Attachments work fine . Would not buy for carpets , got a lightweight vac for my rugs . I have lots of tile so this helps a lot ! Good price ! Always liked Eureka !	1
Since I have mostly tile floors , I like the fact that the floor tool is not motorized ( and so does n't throw bits around the room rather than sucking them up ) . I 'm very happy going back to a bagged machine -- cleaning the filters and canisters in my no-bag hepa vacuum was getting to be a real pain . On hard surfaces I have had no problems with the unit turning over while dragging it around as some folks have complained about . In fact it is light enough that sometimes I just pick it up and carry it . The only thing I really do n't like is the combination tool . I use the brush and find that the hard nozzle tool on the back side gets in the way when I 'm trying to get into a tight spot . The hard nozzle side is a bit redundant as well -- I find the longer and thinner crevice tool more useful . I always have trouble with black plastic and/or rubber bumpers from machines marking things up , so I generally wrap the tools with a bit of masking tape . This unit will mark if you are n't careful , but not nearly as bad as some , especially the ones with rubber bumpers .	1
This is the second Mighty Mite I have owned . It 's a great little machine , a bit noisy , though . Personally , I do n't like how you have to wrap the cord around the prongs on the bottom of the machine but that 's only because I 'm in my 80 's and it 's a bit awkward for me . It 's a 4 1/2 star product .	1
I figured it was time to write a quick review after three years of regular use . This Eureka Mighty Mite is a bit like the little engine that could - could clean up , could be easily carried , could make leaves blown into the garage go away , and could dispose of little balls of dust or dog hair . Not only 'could ' but 'does ' quite effectively . As my age progresses , it is getting more difficult to get certain household appliances from one room to another . Not so with this little Eureka - small enough to store under a work bench in the garage , light enough to carry up the stairs . Two areas of concern keep it from a five star rating : it does not do a good job on dog hair on auto carpet . It 's larger cousin has to handle that job . Additionally , the attachment hose jams up quite often . That 's easily fixed by running a long rod ( like a skewer ) through the hose to loosen up the debris . Then it will usually just pick up where it left off . Be sure not to go bonkers with the unjamming process - you do n't want to poke a hole through the hose . The main question : does it do the job effectively ? Answer : an absolute yes .	1
this is the third mighty mite vaccum i have owned , but this one gets hot when i use it , so that do n't impress me . as a mater of fact it sort of scares me .	1
I read all the reviews on this one before purchasing it , they were very helpful . This is a great vac , I have tile throughout the first floor of the house and it works great on tile . As in other reviews it is ok on carpeting , and they are right . It is good for a quick spot pick up on carpeting but not a full vacuum . I did n't buy it for carpeting . The suction on this canister is powerful and I would recommend it .	1
What a powerful canister vacuum ! I had owned several expensive name brand vacuums over the years & I must say this powerful Mighty Mite is exactly that it advertises . I love it ! The suction power is unbelievable ! Anyone wanting a great machine at a low price I say buy it . You will be as happy with it as I am . I ca n't say enough about my Mighty Mite .	1
Bought this for general use in our house which has mostly hardwood floors therefore no need for a & # 34 ; heavy duty & # 34 ; carpet vacuum.The Mighty Mite is plastic and lightweight , no doubt about that . The & # 34 ; carpet attachment & # 34 ; is fairly useless but the other attachments for doing stairs , crevices and cleaning the car make the vacuum is a decent tool with a fair amount of suction to do the job at hand.When put in perspective and for the price point , it is a good value .	1
After reading many reviews the overall ratings for this vacuum were quite high . For a small sweeper it has good power and the price was reasonable . I am well satisfied with the performance .	1
Nice lil gadget . Has a broader mouth than the one I purchased previously . Light-weight , so it 's easy to carry around . Really cool and effective . Vacuums well , too , I might add .	1
My mom owned one of these . Then I bought one . Then I bought another one for my church . They have GREAT suction , light-weight , easy to use , and last forever . My mom has had hers for probably 15 years and I 've had mine for 6 .	1
I purchased this as a classroom vacuum , but ended up using it in the art studio . It 's light , powerful , and gets the job done . I would have given it 5 stars if the hose were better quality -- it 's thin and cheap and twists easily -- I ca n't see it lasting long at all .	1
I had a Eureka Mighty Mite years ago ... then I had another brand ... came back to this one because it served me well before	1
Nice and easy to handle machine with a strong motor , easy to clean filter and good accessory package . Overall this is a good little vacuum for cleaning stairs and car interiors . However , it has 2 problems . First , the plastic suction hose is cheap and kinks and collapses easily . It has no reinforcing , so you do n't want to step on it or bend it around a corner . Second , the hose is a corrugated pipe style with accordion pleats the entire length . This gives the hose a little strength , but it makes it very prone to clogs and things sticking in the folds . I have learned to check the vacuum suction each time I use it . If it feels weak , I need to take off the hose and shake it clean . In good clean condition , it works as well as any canister .	1
The suction on this little machine is unreal . Sure , the parts are made of plastic and with careless throwing around , parts will break . But if you are careful and do n't step on the hose , you 'll find this is a gem . I have no carpets ; just 2 throw rugs with non-rubber backing . The 'carpet ' feature totally cleans these rugs . The floor feature is just what I need for my 2 floors of hardwood . And the price ? OMG , if it quits in 2 years , I will have gotten my money 's worth .	1
I purchased this machine . So I could get into the really hard places to reach.That my Hoover Vacume fears to tred.Like behind the Headboard of my Bed . up against the wall . And under the cabinetes . Close to the edge of the Moldings . This machine , for it ' ; s weight . ? Has a lot of power . It is totally made from plastic.And plastic components.Like the Hose , The Machine body and the attachments. , It runs a little hot when using it . The only drawbacks I could find with this machine ? Is the fact , that , Eureka only supplies you with & # 34 ; two & # 34 ; bags for the machine. & # 34 ; 2 & # 34 ; is hardly enough considering what the machine is made from.I would think that the whole idea behind it 's being made from plastic.Is for light weight ... .And production costs.But when it comes to cleaning power ? This machine is no light weight..It comes with a Crevace tool , a floor brush , two extensions , And a furniture drape brush combination.As well as a 25 foot power cord.The reason it is only getting four stars is because I feel they should have included a few more bags with the machine.I mean at least 12 paper bags would have made up for the fact that , the Machine is totally made from plastic.. The machine , looks a bit like a Shop Vac . Being Bright yellow with black accents.However it is not made to pick up water and tells you so , on the Instructions.It has a blower motor at the back of the machine which is good because , this will help to clear any clogs you get in the hose , should you pick up something that gets stuck in the hose..I do not care for the slip ring suction ring on the handel of the machine . I see no purpoise in that . You want to have a machine that is powerfull . And when this ring rolls around ? It cuts the suction power in half . So you must be consciencous of this fact.Why they put it there at all is beyond me.Anyone who uses this machine wants it to be powerfull.So this slip ring makes no sense to me.Dollar Value is good . It ' seems like a good macine and is very light weight for when you have to climb those Stairs.It is also good for vacuming the floor mats in the car . So this is a plus and can be used to clean the cars upholstery.So it 's a good machine all around . Just wish they were not so stingy with the vacume bags . I mean , if your going to save Money Eureka . By making the machine totally from plastic ? Would'nt it Wiser ? . to add a few more bags for the Customer ? Two , , is hardly enough . and I own a small home.GREAT when it comes to reaching into the spaces where a floor machine just can not get into . I would have given this machine a & # 34 ; 5 & # 34 ; Star rating except for the inclusion of only & # 34 ; Two bags & # 34 ; for the Tank Unit.Had you done this ? Included MORE bags ... ... ... ..You would have a winner .	1
Excellent small vacuum for tile or hardwood floors.Does n't clean carpet very well at all , but Eureka does n't claim it will . It 's adequate for getting lint or cat hair off an area rug , but if you have wall-to-wall carpet , please buy something else.The small bag capacity might be a nuisance if you have exceptionally hairy and shedding pets .	1
Love the vacuum , I 'm all hardwood and tile and this powerful little guy is doing very well.My only negative is the main vacuum head for the Mite , One setting has a little too much of a seal and just pushed the dirt as it can not enter the vacuum . the other setting is a little loose , needs a middle height setting .	1
I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum . I live in a small place with all hardwood floors , so something small and light was on the top of my list.This vacuum is perfect for my needs . It has great suction , I feel it suck down to the floor ! And is lightweight.The only cons ( and they are n't big ones ) are : the unit gets really hot , really fast . It 's not a big deal , but it 's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage . But I guess you can really only expect that with a larger unit.Other than that , its ' great , lots of power.I do n't think I would recommend for long carpets , or an all carpeted place . We have one area rug that 's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that .	1
This is the third or fourth Mighty Mite that we 've had over the years . They are extremly durable , useful and can be counted on to last for ten years , with normal use . I 'm not in love with the new style floor tool that comes with the vacuum but maybe I 'll learn to like it ? A very good value .	1
I purchased two ; one for our main house and the other for our vacation rental . I own a Miele fior the heavy duty cleaning but this little vac is wonderful for quick pick ups . Works great on my area rugs and jute rugs . Love that it 's cordless . I also purchase extra filters and the extra battery pack . I rinse out the filter and always have a back up filter and battery pack . Love it !	1
I am very happy with this cordless vacuum . I had previously purchased the Hoover Linx ( approx $ 150 ) - which I loved . However , the Linx roller stopped working within a year . I purchased a second Linx - which also had had a problem with the roller . So , I began looking for a much cheaper vacuum that would work , but be much cheaper to replace when needed . The Eureka does not pick up as well as the Linx ( which picked up as quickly as a standard vacuum ) , but it does pick up most items on a single swipe . Heavier items may need 3 or 4 swipes with a change of direction . I 've had the Eureka for several months and it is working well . All things considered , this is a much better value than the Hoover Linx .	1
Vacuum is very powerful , and collects lots of stuff . Hairs tend to get stuck on the brush , which I sometimes have to cut with scissors to remove . Spare battery is very useful . Would have paid a bit more if there is some way of attaching a smaller hose ( like for the car interior and stuff ) . Overall , I 'm very happy and would buy it again .	1
Best and easiest little vac for kitty litter and short carpet areas ever . I now own 4 of these , one for bedroom , kitchen , garage and our garden shed . Saves your back compared to the old dustbusters . The brush roller works great ( I always use it , even on flat surfaces ) . I ca n't think of anything to improve it .	1
This is a great small vacuum I 've had one of these since they first came out and I would n't want to do without it .	1
Best Price I can find for a cordless . It 's new so in 6 months I will update if it is as good as I hope it is	1
I see there are some mixed reviews , but I am really loving this gadget so far . It has been really helpful in picking up kitty litter and dust on my wood floors and low carpets . It seems to have a good amount of power , especially when running the beater brush . The battery is lasting quite a while , too . It 's nice that it came with an extra battery . I think the handle is a bit flimsy , and could have a better design .	1
I bought this because my mom had one when I lived at home , and when I moved out on my own , I could n't live without one . I believe this is the best cordless vacuum out there for the price . ( I 've tried Shark vacuums and they were awful . ) The suction is great . It does n't miss anything . It mounts easily on the wall . It 's easy to dump the dust bin . The battery lasts long enough for me to vacuum three rooms using the carpet setting . I will own one of these for the rest of my life ! PS : These make awesome housewarming or wedding gifts .	1
For a number of years , I 've used the Hoover Linx Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner , and it really does have the suction force of some of the larger vacuum cleaners . However , with 9 cats and 3 dogs , all of whom shed , I found that not only would that vacuum become very clogged with pet hair and other debris , it was very difficult to clean out all of the residue that remained , after vacuuming . It 's now gotten to the point where the machine needs to be taken apart , and professionally cleaned . I decided to try another type of cordless vacuum , and chose the Eureka Quick Up Cordless , after doing a fair amount of research . I will say that , for the most part , it works well . I like the idea of having an extra battery pack . The suction with this vacuum is adequate for what I need , and pulling excess pet hair out of the brushes , after vacuuming , is much less problematic than with the Hoover Linx . The cleaning head has a much more open design , and has easy access for cleaning it out . In my household , there is absolutely no getting around this last step , after I have vacuumed . For the time being , I think this little vacuum will serve the purpose for my needs . There is no question , however , that it will never take the place of the larger , more powerful vacuum cleaners . But , for quick pick-ups , it does the trick .	1
I have a very large apartment with all bare floors . Once a week I sweep and use a dustbuster to pick up the piles , then wash all the floors using the Twist n Shout mop system . During that week , I use the dustbuster to just go over the floors between washings . Bending over using the dustbuster would just kill my back . I used this machine Sunday for the first time-wow-it 's as strong as the dustbuster but I do n't have to bend down at all . Today I used it again and got perfect results . I have a 55 lb . dog and it picks up all his hair with ease . I took the handle off and vacuumed my couch . I could n't believe all the dog hair it swept up from the couch because I did n't even see the hair on the couch and my dog is black . Only reason to keep my dustbuster is to get behind the toilet and my tv stand . The Eureka does n't fit there . Great Product !	1
I Love this sweeper . I love the fact that you can charge the sweeper and the extra battery at the same time . It does a great job sweeping . I swept our whole first floor and it did n't even sound like the battery was starting to die . I definitely would always use it with the brush on . It sweeps alot better . Good power and suction . I 've only used it a couple times so I 'm hoping the batteries have a good life in them.Update 2/20/14I still love this vacuum a lot but one of the batteries never would hold a charge . I disregarded it since the other battery was more than enough to vacuum our fist floor . When we refinished our hardwoods on our second floor I definitely needed that second battery to hold a charge to finish the whole house . When I contacted Eureka about the problem with the second battery never charging , they were kind enough to send me a replacement battery . I was so amazed at the great customer service provided by them I had to give them another 5 star updated review on here . After almost two years with this vacuum is it by far the best little sweep vac I 've owned . I would totally recommend this .	1
This little Eureka vac works well for me to pick up cat litter , crumbs , and easily tackles quick clean ups on the hard surface floors around my home . It also works well to get pet hair off both carpeted and fabric surfaces ; I 've used the beater brush setting on my couch and has the couch looking new again every time . On carpets it does a good job grabbing surface dirt except when *really* close to the baseboards . I find it lightweight and easy to handle for quick tasks.I love that it came with two batteries so it 's always ready to go . I do n't use the extended handle portions so for me this stores in a really compact space . The beater brush setting can be on on or off . The dust cup is relatively easy to empty.This model provides just enough power for the tasks I need it to do and I leave the bigger tasks to my full size vacuum . Pleased with this purchase and recommended for light cleaning tasks on all flooring types and low to medium height carpet .	1
I had to rate this well , although I 'd never buy another one . I purchased this on recommendation from my local vacuum shop . It works fairly good , short battery life with the beater brush turned on ( 10 min . Max ) but that 's okay because it came with two batteries . I 've had it a few year now so it 's been reliable.Here 's what I do n't like . Everything about a bagless design is horrible . Do n't even think about removing the dust cup indoors . March the entire vacuum outside and take note of wind direction before you remove it . Another issue is the amount of dust this kicks up . Remember , for fifty bucks this is n't sucking up fur balls that are 4 inches away , so it 's not sucking up everything the beater brush kicks up . I was using this in a room where sunlight was shining through the window and the sir looked like a snow globe there was so much dust floating through the air.If I were to buy another cordless vacuum , I 'd probably look for something without the beater brush . I know I do n't have to turn it on but then it 's just in the way and blocks debris from getting past it . For now I may splurge for the Miele s194 because of the bag and hepa filter . After knowing I was inhaling a gazillion dust particles , the Miele might be cheaper than the co pay on a lung transplant .	1
I needed a vacuum but was at a loss because there are so many to choose from . But one day in the doctor 's office , I saw a clip of an asthma prevention program in California and they were recommending Eureka because unlike other vacuums , it does n't blow the dust back out . Although this is not the exact same model , I like the portability of a cordless and it 's a strong vacuum . I have two dogs and I can get the whole apartment clean and it does n't even lose its charge so I have n't used the spare battery yet . It 's easy to maneuver and there are two settings , one for carpet and one for bare floors . It 's also relatively quiet .	1
This is a pretty awesome vacuum . It 's perfect for my 515square foot apartment . The battery stayed strong for my first go around and looks to be ready to go a second time . Cool stuff .	1
O.K , I took a chance even though some reviews had complaints , and bought this with the extra battery . I AM SO GLAD I DID.It works and it works WELL . I am 'aging ' so bending over , extra steps , weight of objects all matter , now . I do not have to bend over to unwind a cord . I do not have to bend over at all to use this not even to empty the dirt cup and filter . Simply lift it to you . It 's lightweight but sucks great ! . I use it practically daily . It is astonishing what this picks up . You did n't know that dirt was down there ! Great for the cat litter box , little tiny hard objects , dust , dirt , hair etc . I am going to order one soon for the travel trailer . I hope they do n't stop making this . It works on hard floors and on low pile carpet . I can do my whole house on one charge . And so easy and convenient to just pop a recharged battery out and in ... Wish I had had it years ago . I use it on the furniture too ... The handle 'seems ' a little loose . It does 'seem ' that way , but it 's actually the way it works . NO COMPLAINTS HERE AT ALL . I have had it going on a year now..UPDATE January 2014 , I own 2 of these . Have not had the first problem with either of them . No problem with their batteries either . I can go over my house and still not have to change the battery if it 's just a quick pickup . It DOES pick up hair , dog and cat hair , dust bunnies , small items , and cat litter etc . I wonder how people are having complaints and claiming it does n't pick up . Mine is excellent , both of them !	1
We 're pretty pleased with this vacuum - it cleans our rug ( it 's a felt-type of material so it has very little pile ) and cleans our wood floors well . I like that it has 2 battery packs - we 've never had the disappointment of picking the vacuum up and realizing it 's out of charge . The only issue was the first time I emptied it , dust flew all over me when I removed the cup from the vacuum . Also , the screw somehow came out of our handle and wo n't stay in anymore so the handle is pretty much useless now until we find a nut to use . The brush got pretty wrapped up in hair , but it was easy to cut free . Overall , a solid vacuum , but nothing insanely life changing .	1
This is easy to use , easy to clean and perfect for quick clean-up . It works on carpet , but is not meant to be a primary vacuum cleaner .	1
The vacuum is light weight , and picks up dirt and hair quite well . It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base . The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws . I 'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years . The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging , but it 's designed for wall hanging , and it slides on the counter , and the shape is not made for flat surfaces .	1
This is a great cordless vac . I have two dogs and this picks up all the hair without getting clogged ! ( works great on floors- medium success with carpet so if you have carpet this may not be your solution ) . I have an Electrolux that was specifically advertised to be good for people with dogs- what a waste of money- it clogs with the first pass- do n't make the same mistake . The Eureka is very reasonable priced and does a great job . It 's also pretty quiet for a vacuum and my dog who is terrified of the regular vacuum is not bothered by this at all .	1
For the money , this little Eureka is excellent . It does my little 3br apt . with no problem . It seamlessly switches from carpet to tile without effort is surprisingly powerful . I 've never had to use the extra battery because the first one holds a powerful charge . I would recommend it to apartment and condo dwellers without hesitation .	1
I have a very small kitchen area with tiles , and before I use my swiffer to give it a good clean , it 's difficult to pick up all the crumbs and scraps that inevitably end up on the floor each day . We keep this very lightweight little vacuum right in my question , making clean up such a breeze !	1
This vac is amazing for picking up dog hair , broken wine glasses ( who said that ? : ) , leaves that blow into the house , crumbs , party remnants , etc ... . I ca n't believe I lived without this thing for 40 years ! If you have the kind of floors that show everything even after you 've just mopped - get this ! It 's a two minute swish through the house and it 's all picked up - it 's amazing . My son actually loves it because it 's 'just his size ' so he is suddenly vacuuming the entire house everyday - well , if you insist ! : ) I do have to put in the disclaimer that if you 're taller then 5 & # 34 ; 5 ' you will be scrunching yourself to use this . Others have posted recs on how to elongate the handle but the mfg . should man up and make it up to par .	1
I have a huge house and I hated unplugging and plugging in the vacuum just to pick up the crumbs every day off my hardwood floors ... .OMG ... .this is the coolest thing ever ! I just unplug ... ... ..vacuum ... .and 2 minutes later it is back charging on the wall of my laundry room ... ... ... I love it ! I even tried it on some carpeted stairs ... ... omg ... ... It weighs nothing ... ..now it is all I will ever use on my 1 carpeted stairs and 2 hardwood stairs ! !	1
If more than one speck is on the floor my husband drags out the vacuum . So I bought him this little one that hangs in the closest . He is in little vacuum heaven buzzing around .	1
If you 've never tried a stick vac , I highly recommend them . Super great for quick pick-ups or a run-thru when company is coming . I have owned several stick vacs over the years but this one tops them all . The extra battery comes in handy and the clear top makes it easy to see when the brush needs cleaned . Hang this near your mess area and make clean up quick and life simple . It does a great job on hard surface flooring or carpeting .	1
The battery really does n't last long but it comes with two & we always keep them charged ! We use this in our camper . During the winter we bring it in the house & let our 6 year old use it to help with the household chores ! She loves it !	1
First- I love this light weight vac but it does have a couple of cons that lowered the rating.Con 1- has a hard time picking up little leaves or kitty fur ( which seems to tangle up the rollers easily.. ) con2 . Do NOT buy unless you get two batteries . I have tried everything but the battery life is not anywhere as described and if I had n't received a second battery I probably would have returned this item.The pro is it does still pick up other stuff pretty well and its so light weight .UPDATE : Increased the star rating due to excellent customer support from Eureka direct . Notified them of the charging issues and they were awesome and provided the type of customer service that we rarely see anymore . Hoping a new charging unit and batteries will improve the use time but regardless.. customer serviced from Eureka has me believing that if I ever have more problems , they stand behind their product	1
I have birds , so before getting this stick vacuum , I was sweeping my carpet area every night around their cages . This vacuum works beautifully , and picks up things very well . It 's not a & # 34 ; suction & # 34 ; type & # 34 ; vacuum & # 34 ; , but it does a great job mimicking one . The other great thing is this comes with TWO batteries , so you are never without power . I had a stick vacuum years ago ( different brand ) , and it only had one battery , so if the battery died before finishing , you were screwed , and had to recharge . With this , if your power dies out , you have another one waiting , and you continue on . I can vacuum my living room area , the hall , etc. , maybe three nights before it starts to sound low . So it has a good longevity to the battery . Again , I love this thing ! I 'm so happy I bought this !	1
So far , so good ! This vac will run for 20 minutes or so , but if you are n't finished , you can pop in the other battery and keep going . I use it on bare floors , and it works great . It is not so loud , and I appreciate that .	1
I ordered this primarily bc it was cordless since I have handicap issues never expecting it to pick up like a regular vacuum . this eureka cordless vacuum is absolutely amazing ! it picks up as well as my dyson ball vacuum ! when I emptied the dirt holder it was packed ! I am so very very satisfied with the purchase . every time I use it i 'm amazed all over again . I wholeheartedly recommend this vacuum for anyone regardless of physical abilities or disabilities !	1
I 'm surprised at the power this little cordless has ! It picks up the dirt , dog hair and even little pebbles . A single battery lasts a long time , and with the spare battery ready , I can actually keep my place easily quick-swept . ( I 'm more a gardener , not a cleaner , so if it 's not easy it probably wo n't happen . ) Some cons : the filter case is a little difficult to remove , it would be nice if the `` on '' button was up on the handle instead of down on the base , and although the stick comes off for stair cleaning , it does n't have a `` Dust Buster-like '' snout like , say the Electrolux Pronto ( which does n't have the same power ) . It does clean so well , I 'd recommend getting a spare filter or two ( they 're cheap ) so you can rinse one out and have another ready . I 'm so glad I got this !	1
Bought this for my parents for quick clean up for their dogs . I like how it comes with an extra NiCad battery , even though I wish the batteries were Lithium Ion . I do n't expect this vacuum to last more than a couple years just because the batteries are NiCad . But it cleans the floors pretty well and can clean both hardwood and carpet with two different settings .	1
I had bought this for my daughter for Christmas because they have a big vacuum cleaner , but she wanted something quick and lightweight for quick pick ups . She loves this ! It came with an extra battery , so she always has it charged . It does a good job when needed and is light weight and convenient .	1
The Eureka Quick Up Cordless w/bonus Battery pack works great . Having the spare battery is perfect . It works great on bare floor and carpets . there is 2 setting/ one for each .	1
Light and easy to use , it is just the thing for those occasional pick up of spilled dry objects , those little gritty things that collect on the floor , and other such items , It is not meant to compete with the full sized heavy vacuums that do really good deep cleaning , but for just a light going over it works great .	1
This is my third one -- need I say more ? A great quick clean up tool -- surprisingly efficient -- super dog hair pick-up and light weight too !	1
We retired in Florida and about half of our flooring is tile . We needed a stick vacuum that would properly sweep the tile floor so we could then steam clean it with another device . It 's quick and easy to use and it weighs very little . When done , we put it on the charger and it is ready for the next time we have a need for it . It does take about 16 hours to fully charge the batteries , but it 's not really a problem , since we do n't use it every day . The extra battery should come in handy over time , since all batteries lose their ability to hold a charge . I suspect that it will take a year or two ( or more ) before we have to buy a new battery , which is available for purchase through Eureka . This cordless stick vacuum is exactly what we needed and it was a good purchase .	1
Arrived promptly . Works well on small stains . Used it on furniture and it had adequate spray and suction . No complaints .	1
The biggest problem in cleaning spots and stains out of furniture and area rugs is lugging around a heavy piece of equipment . This Hoover is small enough to carry with ease and fills simply from the top . It even has a built in mechanism so it ca n't overflow . I liked its performance overall and found it as good , if not better then other household machines . Of course it seems to work best with the cleaner it came with but since it 's an economical product that is n't a problem either . The best feature it has is two separate tanks which means you wo n't end up cleaning your sofa with dirty water . Overall this product is a good investment and pasys for itself in one use .	1
I bought this machine on the recommendation of reviews from amazon . This machine does clean and cleans well . We have cat vomit , juice spills and other marks made by little children and they all got cleaned out on first try . I actually used it successfully on a mattress which had some spilled milk stains . Even the loud noise which one reviewer noted does not bother me that much -- our regular Hoover vac is just as deafening.This is a SPOT cleaner , not a vacuum for general use .	1
BOUGHT TWO OF THEM , ONE FOR EACH BATH SO WE DO N'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF BED TO TURN THE EXAUST FAN OFF . VERY EASY TO INSTALL	1
After changing out a light switch in the full bath , I discovered mold in the box ( its a partition wall , was n't from another source ) . So I started using the fan , but could only run it for 10 minutes before I had to be out the door.This guy was simple to install , priced well , and now I can turn the knob to 30-40 minutes and not have to worry about it !	1
I have been using this timer for about 5 years and just purchased 3 more at the request of neighbors who wanted one for their apartments . Mine is used to time the hot water heater for my daily shower and has more than paid for itself in savings on the electricity bill . Previously it was necessary to manually turn on and off the heater and invariably it remained on longer than necessary , to the detriment of my electricity bill . The fact that I have used this timer daily for 5 years without a hitch is confirmation of its durability . I realize that nothing last forever , but after 5 years of daily use mine shows no sign of advancing age.Timers are also available for shorter periods , but I see no benefit in buying one of them . This timer gives me the option of a full hour , but also permits running the timer for any period less than that.If you need a timer , this is a very good choice .	1
I used Intermatic brand for several years , bought from Homedepot , but the store changed the stock to another brand , less attractive and probably cheaper manufacturing.I did not wire the switch box to have a neutral wire , so I need mechanical ( spring powered ) timer and I use the timer a lot . Mine lasted about 3 years . This one is beginning to get stuck and not winding down to off position . Probably the spring is getting weaker .	1
Works great for my reloading station . Each bin holds about 100 .223 or .40 . I mounted mine using a din rail .	1
Strong , stable , stackable , 'nestable ' - these boxes have it all ... except labels . Would be nice if Akro included a few labels for the front ... they do , but they want you to pay for them , so I 'll just cut out some card stock . These also can mount to the Akro wall-system which is nice , and may be the way I build my next garage work bench . Currently they 're sitting on the bench stacked 3 high . I liked them so much I placed a second order !	1
I can not downgrade this product for what bothers me -- my brooms bang a bit when I open and close the door . It does exactly what it is supposed to do without a lot of bells and whistles .	1
It is as expected . Fits over my indoor doors just fine . The only thing I dislike is that the brooms and such easily slam against the door when using it . But I do n't think it 's the products fault , that is just the way they hang . I do n't know how they would hang any differently though .	1
Was very excited to get this product -- installed it IMMEDIATELY as our house really is short on storage/closet space . I was able to get all my cleaning tools stored on it , including my steam mop ! Great product !	1
Vacuum cleaner bag - put it in and later take it out when it is full ( or nearly so ) . Works as it should and the cost - delivered to the door - is better than going out looking for it . I 'll buy some more soon .	1
Because my kids have asthma , it 's important to me that my Hoover upright not be spewing dust everywhere when I vacuum , so it 's worth it to go for the micro filtration bags . I 've tried off-brands , including Rug Doctor , but the Hoovers seem to be more substantial and better made , so I 'm sticking with them .	1
There was a review titled & # 34 ; Did n't Fit & # 34 ; which stated : & # 34 ; Be warned ! If you are looking for the & # 34 ; Type Y & Z & # 34 ; bag for a Hoover Wind Tunnel vac , do n't assume a & # 34 ; Type Z & # 34 ; bag will fit ... .it wo n't ! & # 34 ; I do n't doubt the reviewer got a product which does n't fit . Maybe hoover does weird things . I double checked , and the previous bags I used were & # 34 ; Type Y & Z & # 34 ; - the last one is still in the vacuum . I replaced that one with this Type Z - fit just fine . So , I 'm not sure what happened with the poor fellow which got ones which did n't fit , but worked just fine for me.It 's the genuine hoover product , not the knockoffs sold on here as well . I figured - why bother saving fifty cents a bag or whatever , when these bags last months . Not worth the hassle of having something not fit or work properly .	1
Worked like a charm . Was easy to replace . The belts are quite durable as we had the last one for 4 years .	1
There 's not much to say other than it works as expected , as it should being an original part from Hoover .	1
Bought when and if I need it . You never know when a belts decides to go out and then no vacuum cleaner . Very inconvenient .	1
I could ot believe it -- - i NEARLY BREAK FINGERS trying to get these belts on this cleaner - always running over something that cuts the belts ... and thenI saw AMAZON had the RIGHT SIZE HOOVER BELT - only I did not know it but for years have used the wrong size - this one size fits all stuff with offbeat brands because it is difficult for me to shop about to find these.I put this Hoover belt in in minutes -- -- the secret to easy installatin after it is in place ready to put around the brush roll is to pull the thing down and pushed down on the left side and right side at the same time -- - THEN ADJUSTING THE RIGHT SIDE ... ... IT TAKES STRONGER FINGERS BUT AFTER USING THESE OTHER BELTS this was easy for I DETEST PUTTING BELTS IN THIS CLEANER -- - no wonder -- -- this one size fits all is not cracked up what it is said to do.So I can recommend this to those who have a Hoover Windtunnel -- - I bought four of these and now watch before I turn on vacuum to be sure changing these belts is a nuisance but this Hoover I remember from the time I was a child in the 1930 time frame and prefer to a DYSON ANY DAY.Connie the seller delivered as promised -- price is good -- - AND ITS THE RIGHT SIZE	1
Needed accessory with new vacuum , get them up front when purchasing new vacuum , installed ones working well thus far , with no issues	1
So much better to have a belt on hand when one breaks , rather than ordering and waiting . And they are brand name , so I know they will work .	1
They do the job , and it is nice to have a spare on hand . A good deal for the money .	1
Hoover windtunnel belt has been in use over 6 months with no problems , what can I say it works I would purchase again if needed .	1
The belts as such are excellent but the Hoover keeps killing them every few months . My wife uses it carefully but the belt is so tightly stretched around the pegs it is bound to snap and thats what happens . There got to be much better design . I had to buy several belts and keep in stock but now I am really fed up with the above Hoover vacuum about this ! I have an older Hoover which has been working since 1988 without a hitch , really . They do not make things like that any more ! ! ! ! !	1
Work as I had hoped - decent quality and price . The belt seemed a bit tighter than what I had originally on my vacuum but that is okay since these do stretch . Would order again .	1
The belt in my vacuum broke and while I figured out the problem thought my vacuum was rendered useless . However , as soon as I found the broken belt , I placed the ordered , got my new belts and my vacuum was as good as new . I 've used my vacuum with the replacement belt for more than a year now , so I can say they 're good quality and long lasting .	1
I found that my Hoover vacuum 's belt broke after only 2 months after purchase . I bought these and they seem to last longer . They are difficult to get on , because they do n't stretch very well . You just have to be patient and ask someone to help you with it . But once it 's on , it works well .	1
I searched for these and in my area they were hard to find in the store . I have n't used them yet as the old one is n't broke , just yet . But I felt like having them in the house before it actually broke . I 'm sure they will work just fine	1
This works for a Hoover Widepath Tempo vacuum cleaner.Although the belt looks extremely small and too stiff to stretch , the belt will stretch easily once the belt is placed on the roller , and the long roller is used as leverage for stretching.Arrived within the time frame stated via USPS .	1
These belts are just like the ones I have bought at the dealer 's store . They fit the machine just as they should .	1
Great price for the belts . It goes for the Hoover WindTunnel T-Series Pet Rewind Plus Upright Vacuum , Bagless , UH70210 which I just bought and it is good to have extra on hand .	1
exact match and quality . very nice . The belts are going to last us a good while . they do n't seem to go bad too often .	1
Glad they came packaged with the vacuum so that I have them when needed , Thinking ahead is not a bad thing .	1
I really wish the vacuum would have come with more than one of these belts . These seem to break when I vacuum over something that gets wrapped around the agitator and then causes the belt to part . This product was perfect for my Hoover vacuum though . Thanks .	1
It replaces the original and works as expected That 's all you really need to know when making a purchase - right ?	1
This is an excellent product . Sturdy , I have used it every night for at least 8 hours for the past year . It moves a large amount of air , and is very , noisy.Its electric use in minimal , which is another bonus . It is also very good for blocking out noise from neighbors.For this price , this is an excellent buy.I have never owned a better box fan , and I have purchased literally scores through the years .	1
I got this for my sister when her fan stopped working for her . It makes her room much more comfortable for her to sleep in , thank you very much . I came very fast and she did not have to wait too long for it , only a couple of days after I ordered it .	1
This fan is essential for me ! In the summer heat it helped keep me cool . I 've actually had this one for 7months now , and had the same exact one earlier and it was perfect . Standard good fan .	1
I bought two of these , and they are mostly used to blow air through the house on cooler days-where it is not really hot enough to fire up the AC , but too warm to just rely on a breeze.=== The Good Stuff ===* They are reasonably inexpensive , and blow a fair amount of air . I have definitely seen box fans that blow more air , but for the price , these seemed to be a very good value on a `` cubic feet of airflow per dollar '' basis . * I also would n't call them exceptionally quiet . The motors do n't seem to make much noise , but there is a noticeable amount of turbulence noise from the fan blades . I do n't really mind the noise . * There are lightweight and easy to move around the house . * My three dogs love to sleep in front of them.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* The fans are fairly thin-the base is only a couple inches wide . There are little feet that are supposed to steady the fan , but they are quite easy to knock over , especially for large and clumsy dogs . * Appliance electric cords are either too long or too short . These are too short.=== Summary ===These are cheap box fans , and I found them to be quite serviceable . They could certainly be quieter , and move more air , but for $ 20 , they work great . If you are looking for the absolute highest volume of air , or quietest fan , you can certainly get it by spending more money .	1
I am an avid shopper of Amazon , however I bought this fan in a store , because I asked the clerk to open it up and plug it in so I could test it in the store before I came home with it.I have over the past few years bought so many other useless fans , lots of noise and no air movement . The blades were wrong or the motor was a piece of dog poop.This fan is near perfect ! The three speeds are great . The motor noise is NORMAL given the amount of air this thing can move . I use mine mostly outside on the patio because I love the outdoors even on a hot day . This fan keeps me and my company super cool.I often set the fan up on a side table so is is blowing on our upper bodies rather than just our legs.We had a heat wave recently and my air conditioner in my motorhome was struggling inside , so I brought the fan inside from the patio . It really helped cool the motorhome and keep the air conditioner from freaking out.The price is right , the fan really works , really cools . The noise is normal given the nice gale force wind you can get out of this on the high setting.My only complaint to the manufacturer is that the legs that are supposed to keep it from tipping over are ridiculous . First they need 2 on each side , not just 2 on one side . They are very small and super flimsy . Four legs about an inch or two longer would have been a huge bonus . If the fan is off and you accidentally bump it just the least little bit , BANG , it falls right over on the side that has no anti-tip legs.The fan is very light and easy to store when not in use . I am THRILLED it keeps me cool and has some great power in that little motor . Well done Lasko !	1
Replace the same model which we had used continuously for 5 years . That is saying a lot in the tropics . They are good fans . Lightweight , moves the air and reliably works .	1
i have for over two years the lasko box fan that i use in bedroom and it works very well , but being an idiot when i came to amazon to order another one i was too lazy to look up my old order and ordered this one becuse `` it looks the same '' . its not . the 3723 model from two years ago is fabulous.. really cools a mid size room . this newer model you have to be within 2 feet to even feel any aire . buy the 3723http : //www.amazon.com/Lasko-20-Inch-Premium-Box-3-SPEED/dp/B000HHJ2I2/ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1344856518 & sr ; =8-1 & keywords ; =lasko+3723	1
They a very useful fan ! to help move air to cool my place during the hot day of summer !	1
inexpensive fan , works just fine . i bought this for white noise when i sleep , and it makes a consistent whirring sound which suits my noise needs just fine . moves air too , but since that is not what i use it for , i can not speak for it 's abilities at that task.side note , the fan came packed only in it 's original box , and the first one was cracked and broken . i sent it back , got another , and , and , and ... the second one was broken also . it did n't affect the fan really , so i called amazon , got a 10 dollar credit , and kept it . they said they would be flagging the company , whatever that means . never a problem with returns etc at amazon . but since this is a review of the product , not the packaging , there is no star reduction .	1
I 've had many `` bottom end '' Lasko 's over the years . All basically the same.. rectangular steel box , 2 braces holding the motor ( one end only ) and a 5 bladed fan . The box owes its rigidity to the two plastic screen grids screwed to the front and back . All seem to have plastic `` feet '' to help stabilize it front-to-back so it stands better from the force of air being forced through . They typically are all 3 speed.Lasko 's are mass produced , American-made fans retailed widely at many outlets , at least in the USA.. usually larger chains.. during warm seasons . They normally retail for $ 15-20 and represent excellent value at that price . If you order by mail and have to pay shipping , much value is lost . ( this particular offering sells 3 units so the shipping is shared to bring the per-fan cost to around $ 25 each.. assuming of course you can use 3 fans ) Over the years , I 'd say they average 3-6 years or more of regular use ( many thousands of hours ) Their mode of failure is usually shaft support failure ... . they just get so they wo n't `` go '' when powered on . Of the many brand names I see on these box fans , I believe the Lasko is the BEST quality and longest serving.. they are designed and made in the USA.Good points*they are cheaper than virtually any other option ( except a few other similar clones.. they all are basically identical.. they often are offered as `` promo '' or `` loss leaders '' at the `` big box stores '' for under $ 20 each ) *barring physical damage they work quite well for many years . *they CAN move a lot of welcome cooling air ! ! *the most reliable of the box-fan suppliers in my experienceMinor `` problems '' ..*BIT loud on HIGH ( not unreasonably so.. when you move this much air , it makes noise.. the fan itself is quiet ) *plastic blades snaps rather abruptly if a child or whatever sticks something into the blades while its on ( at least I 've had this happen once.. not sure if all blades are that brittle.. I snapped blades from another unit onto it and it served a long life ) *the design is not `` efficient '' if you need truly forced air pressure due to lots of `` leakage '' front to back around hte blades.. Lasko makes a shrouded fan at a higher price which would be much better in that applicationLasko 20 '' Weather-shield W Thermo* The narrow width make them VERY prone to falling over ( even with the plastic `` feet '' attached ) .. I do n't think I have had a one that has n't fallen over several times.. luckily they are rarely damaged by this . You should just plan on putting it where you can `` lean '' one edge of it 's intake side against somethingI see no mention of power consumption in the product specs , but they seem to use about 90 watts ( all of them have power usage tags on them . but you 'd have to have the unit to look at it ) At average USA power cost ( 9-15 cents/kwhr ) they are cheap to operate.All in all I RECOMMEND THE UNIT if you can get it for the $ 15-20 range ( watch for sales or `` loss leader '' values too ) .It is worth noting that the above `` weather-shield '' thermo-controlled unit ( which is a considerably better fan in construction , water resistance , and air movement ) .. the thermo control may be a plus to you , but I just turn it off or on as needed ) is a `` good value '' especially if you 're having it shipped as it is only a couple of dollars more than this one ( as shipped ) and includes free super-saver shipping IF YOU NEED it shipped ! If you plan to use it in areas or where it will be exposed to some water now and then , you probably should go for the above-mentioned `` weather shroud '' unitLasko 20 '' Weather-shield W Thermo ... made to sit in a window and survive the occasional rain storm . In that case the thermo control could be more valuable for unattended operation .	1
Nice to see Made in the USA on the outside of the Lasko 20 '' box the fan arrived in ! Delivery was before scheduled and caught me and my two cats by suprize ! Cats have nice new box to play with and I have great smooth operating and quiet cooling Lasko 20 '' box fan just the right size for my apartment . If you run it on the highest speed naturally it is a little louder . This fan delivers the goods , goods in this case being circulating cool air . Appreciate the prompt delivery also . You may wonder why the early review since having the fan only a couple hours , well the reason is I trust Lasko for a good product since my previous fan was a Lasko I have used for the last 10 years ! Motor just wore out after good work for 10 years . Thanks Lasko !	1
This three speed box fan by Lasko is exactly the way it is advertised here . It comes already assembled so setup is a breeze -- just remove it from the box , set it up on a table and turn it on ! The three speeds all operate relatively quietly and the fan gets the air circulating rather quickly.The price is right for what you get : it works strong and hard to create good air flow . The box fan also cools the room down on days when you ca n't use an air conditioner or when you simply do n't want to use one . Moreover , like other reviewers have noted , it blocks out sounds and it 's even nice to have it on while I 'm sleeping ! I recommend that the fan stand on a flat surface about three or four feet high so that the air current it creates reaches you whether you 're lying down or walking around the room . It is economical in that it wo n't make your electric bill spike upward , too.Overall , this is a great fan and I highly recommend it as one of the best fans out there in this size and price range . It will not disappoint you !	1
My concern while purchasing this fan was air flow . Needed a substitute air conditioner for the summertime . Needed something that could create alot of air movement to suck in the cool air at night , and something that could be aimed at me could cool me off during the day , and this fan achieves that for it 's lower price . Box fans are great , place then in a window and they 'll cool a room down in no time . It is not a quiet fan like the ultra quiets on the market today but it is not as loud as those turbo jet fans . It has a normal good size fan noise that I do n't find irritating . Other than that , you really do n't need the foot attachments . I placed on the desk , turned on high and it did not fall over . So , to conclude it is a good solid fan for a reasonable price when your main concern is air flow .	1
I have been using these fans for the stalls in our horse barn for years . It keeps the flies away and cools down the whole barn . The barn is dusty and the fans collect a lot of dirt . I wash them down each year and they are like new . The fans I have now are on their third barn year . In a normal house I 'm sure they would last forever . They are a little noisy , but the horses do n't care .	1
Our air conditioning went out on the hottest day of the year so far . So we bought a few fans so we could survive until we could get someone to fix the problem . This fan is good for putting in front of a window to draw in cool air . It is effective for that purpose and does seem to keep a room cooler . As far as this having 3 quiet speeds I 'd have to say that is not quite accurate . It is not a silent fan as it does make some noise . But for the price it does a good job . One thing however is that this fan scares my cats . It might take some time for your animals to get used to the noise.~The Rebecca Review	1
This fan is perfect for cooling down my room at night . It is pretty quiet on the lowest setting and still moves a lot of air . It 's not that loud on the highest setting but it 's loud enough that I wont forget that it is on , and I will usually turn it down after my room cools off a bit .	1
I love this fan . We bought it years ago and have never had a problem with it . It 's pretty simple to figure out . It has three settings : High , medium , low . This is great to put in a window to circulate some fresh air . It runs pretty quietly on the low and medium settings but can get a little loud on high ( which is kind of expected ) .Overall , this is a purchase I have not regretted . I would recommend this to anyone who needs a durable fan . You could probably find it a lot cheaper in a local store . I got mine at Dollar General .	1
This fan has saved us on really hot days in a 2-story house with no A/C ! It blows at high speeds and can fit in a window sill . I ended up getting another one because it works so great . I highly recommend this one !	1
I , like many people , have become accustomed to having a fan on when I sleep . I have had a few other fans and most have not lasted . I bought two of these a few years ago and both are working like new . I use mine and my son uses his , every night on low when we sleep . All three settings work and the fan is as quiet as a fan rapidly moving air can be . According to my kill-a-watt , this costs me approximately 11 cents to run for 24 period on low . You can calculate more from there if you would like . My fans do n't go into windows so they have n't seen a lot of moisture and i do clean them semi-annually . The only problem is like all my other fans , the legs that keep them upright on high broke long ago . I would recommend them as they run well and have pasted the test of time in my home .	1
Whoever wrote the product description and used the term `` Whisper Quiet '' must have previously worked in the Boeing factory and had their hearing damaged ! However , that being said do n't be fooled by any fan marketing - no decent ones are going to quiet , by virtue of what they have to do - shifting large volumes of air mechanically is a noisy business ! This is a great cheap fan from Lasko which really does what it is designed to do - move air.Open the box , snap on the plastic feet to make it stand up , plug into the wall and away you go . It has 3 speeds , selected with a knob on top , and really does shift the air , even on setting 1 . Crank it up to 3 and the really noisy fun starts.We have a few of these which we move around the house as they are so light - there 's nothing to them other than a motor with blades in a case . One in the basement has run 24/7 for months on end so far to circulate the air , with no issues.Another one I use specifically to blow air into the side of my tower to keep my old computer cool in this heatwave . It works a treat - and , unbelievably , it 's quieter than the PSU fans which now do n't even bother to kick in ! Overall this is a great , cheap , simple fan that is well worth the money , and is widely available at many supermarkets and home improvement stores too at very competitive prices.Highly recommended	1
This is the real thing ! I have tried other ice cream makers and this thing worked flawlessly out of the box and makes real ice cream even in a hot and humid environment with ambient temperatures of about 33 degrees Celsius and 85 % humidity in a RESTAURANT kitchen and I have been using this everyday to make at least 2 or 3 batches everyday ! Would definitely recommend it . A durable item that holds up in today 's disposable times . A bit on the loud side as in other reviews but in a restaurant kitchen , who cares as long as it does the job reliably !	1
I did n't fully realize how nice this peeler is until I was at my mother 's over Christmas and tried to use two of hers . They were slippery , dull , and they HURT to use ! I had never understood that one peeler really could be better than another before that.This peeler is comfortable to hold , even at the end of a big job like peeling apples for a pie or potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner . It is sharp , so you do n't have to use a lot of pressure , which also helps decrease hand fatigue . All-in-all , a good product . ** Update 8/18/11 : I 'm back to purchase two of these as stocking stuffers for my mother . No excuses -- now she can throw out those peelers that have been hanging around since I was a kid . . .	1
Sharp peeler , owned one for more than 2 years . It has a big and non slip handle that makes it easy to grasp .	1
This is sharp , and therefore effective ... but its designed with a bar going from the handle to the tip ( for stability ? ) When shredding , food gets caught in the small space between the bar and the blades.It works well , but could be faster without having to stop every few swipes to get food unlodged .	1
I ave been using these peelers for about 10 years now , they last about 4 years and work better then most . With reasonable care they last well and hold their edge , the steel seems to better grade then most . Only drawback is since its so sharp you need to watch peeling yur knuckle by accident	1
Like all OXO products , it 's well made and does the job it 's intended to do .	1
Works well , especially needed now that I 'm getting some arthritis in my hands . Works as it should . OXO products are pretty darn good , overall .	1
I like how the handle on the peeler is larger than on most peelers . It is much easier to hold . It is great for carrots , potatoes , chocolate for fondue , etc .	1
My wife 's nascent arthritis can make it hard for her to grip small handles , but she LOVES to cook . The OXO products make her very happy .	1
Its great blade and handle makes for fast peeling jobs . Only thing would be : I wish the peels did n't hang on to the end once peeled off .	1
nice sharp peeler , good grip decent value for your money . I like OXO products as a rule , it is a good quality item	1
Sturdy , sharp - does the job ! I hate cheap peelers this has lasted months and does n't show signs of wear .	1
My husband got fed up with the cheap vegetable peeler I got at a discount store so I purchased this one . Wish I got it sooner . It is so easy to handle and wash and can even peel mangoes ! The blade is sharp and does n't shift out of place . Highly recommended !	1
My mom has shaky hands and this works great for her . She uses it on oranges , and takes out the seeds with the little scoop at the tip too . Removes 'eyes ' on potatoes too .	1
Just like the last post , We had one of these for years . Ours too suddenly disappeared without a trace ! How wierd ! Anyway , I went to my local walmart and they did not have this same model , so i settled for what they had in stock . Needless to say , I returned that piece of junk the next day , got a refund . And found one of these at another local store ! I couldnt believe what i had taken for granted in this potato peeler ! It is still very sharp after years of use , the handle is very comfortable and the swivel on the blade works perfectly.I dont know what the diff is between this model and the $ 12 model also made by Oxo , but this one is fantastic ! You will get years of use out of this peeler , untill maybe the aliens decide to snatch yours too !	1
This is a great peeler it is sturdy and peels fruits and veggies . I look forward to adding to my kitchen through more products from OXO	1
Good grip , though the edge should be sharper . Takes more effort to peel with this peeler than some others , though the grip is secure and good hand feel . If you do not like to peel anything , this peeler is acceptable , though not superior .	1
This work well . It is funny the guard hides the potato as you are peeling . I like the guard as you can not nick yourself when peeling , and I like the little 'plastic ' guard you can put back on it after cleaning . It is a great product . I have several 'OXO ' products , that was one of the reasons I purchased this particular peeler !	1
I really like this peeler . It is really smooth , easy to clean , and hold fairly well . I do miss the eye removal tool from the standard peelers but the one it provides works well enough . If the eye removal tool was better I would give it five stars	1
This peeler is unlike others , as it is made in one piece . Others are glued together and trust me , they fall apart while washing .	1
does the job , and is super sharp . im not sure if its the design of these types of peelers , or what but sometimes the peeled piece will stay attached to the peeler and affect the next attempted swipe to peel . slows you down as u have to fling it off , and it is why i know its super sharp as a few attempts at flinging a piece off failed , i used my finger and slipped off the piece of food and sliced my finger	1
This tool peels easily and feels comfortable in your hand . The gouger part at the end for digging the & # 34 ; eyes & # 34 ; out out potatoes is pretty much junk though . It 's so dull you have to use a lot of force to make it work , and in end up jabbing myself with it occasionally when it slips ( because it 's dull ) . Frustrating , but the main function of peeling is smooth and easy .	1
It is rare when $ 5.99 can make you happy ! This peeler will change your life . Carrots , cucumbers , potatoes , sweet potatoes , apples , really ripe pears , peaches , eggplant ... all the peels slide off with ease . My father use to fuss at me when I would nail : & quot ; Let the hammer do the work ! & quot ; With this tool I do n't need any reminders ! The peeler does the work . Excellent tool . Excellent gift .	1
We own a lot of OXO gadgets , and this one is a good example of why . Simple , easy to use , and durable .	1
I should have gotten one of these years ago . Fits nicely in my hand and peels great . I need to purchase a couple of more for my children .	1
I have bought three of these peelers . Our family of seven has meals some times with five pounds of potatoes or sweet potatoes and these peelers make quick work of them . The blades are sharp and the handles are comfortable to use . I recommend them .	1
This peeler is great , durable , and easy to use and clean . Beats using a knife to peel carrots and other veggies .	1
This one is so much better than the serrated one . I cut myself several times on the other one and have since given it away .	1
I DID ORDER TWO , BUT NOW I ONLY HAVE ONE . MY DAUGHTER WAS AT MY PLACE HELPING ME IN THE KITCHEN AND WAS EQUALLY IMPRESSED AT HOW WELL THIS PEELER WORKED . OF COURSE , I GAVE HER MY EXTRA ONE . I MUST REMEMBER TO REORDER ANOTHER ONE FOR MYSELF .	1
Peals potatoes so much easier than our old one , and it 's nice and sharp , too . Soft handle is comfortable to hold and easy to grip .	1
The grip is really the biggest things about this for me . It fits well in my hand , feels sturdy , and the blade is sharp . It peels cleanly and makes the job a lot easier .	1
I have a drawer full of potato peelers . This is the only one I use . The handle is comfortable and the swivel head makes peeling go much faster . I 've been using this Oxo Flexible potato peeler for years . It never breaks -- it works like a charm every time !	1
Bought this from my grandma in the Caribbean so she does n't have to use a kitchen knife to peel her fruits and veggies and waste good meat from her fruits . She love it . It no . Slip grip is great and it peels smoothly .	1
Love XOXO products . This is no exception and can be placed in the dishwasher for easy cleanup . No slip handle is perfect . Would definitely recommend !	1
Seriously , it 's the best peeler I 've ever used . Do n't look at any others . The peeler part swivels easily in the grip , and it makes peeling stuff effortless . It 's also cheap !	1
Once again , OXO delivers a quality kitchen product . It 's a good peeler for just about any job peeling fruits or vegetables . I even use it to make little ribbons of vegetable and parmesan cheese . It 's stayed sharp for months and months . It 's comfortable in my hand and the rubbery handle is grippy , even when wet . Great general purpose peeler .	1
The best thing about this peeler is the very comfortable handle . It 's easy to hold on to , plus its very sharp ! It makes peeling very easy , I 've used it on carrots and cucumbers with little trouble . Highly recommend !	1
This peeler is very sharp , peels potatoes and carrots quickly and does n't require too much effort . No waste of the peels either , it just peels what needs to be peeled : )	1
This is a perfect kitchen utensil . Keeps sharp forever , easy to clean , padded handle makes it easy on your hand , peels just the right amount of skin of whatever you 're peeling .	1
I broke my old peeler recently and after tons of review reading I settled on this guy . It is super sharp and gets the job done . Also the grip is comfy so even after peeling tons for a carrot cake it was n't as tiring .	1
This swivel peeler works so well ! ! I even peel mango using this peeler , and it does n't break the flesh of the fruit . It glides on the fruit or veggie super smooth and the non slip grip handle is great . It cost like $ 9 but so worth it because it works so well .	1
I went home over thanksgiving and used my mom 's Cutco vegetable peeler and found ( to my great astonishment and pleasure ) that my Oxo peeler did a better job and was probably a third the price . I 've had this for 3 years now and it looks and feels like it 's new . The tip is hollowed out so you can scoop out bad spots on potatoes etc . I love it .	1
I am a sharp and easy to use peeler . I boast a sleek design and wide handle . I glide over carrots , potatoes , and apples with ease . I romance them until I see their bare flesh , and then let you decide what to do with them.I will replace your old , worn out , rusted peeler in an instant to become your go to kitchen tool . Invest in med and enjoy .	1
This is our second one we have purchased . The first one lasted for many years before it finally got dull . OXO makes very high quality products.We also purchased one of these for my parents a few years ago and they still comment about how good it is.I would highly recommend this peeler .	1
This peeler works very well , comfortable handle . Stays sharp . Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe , too.HOWEVER ; The potato eye remover is nearly useless . The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade , near the handle . Much , much better . The eye removers near the handle are easy , quick , and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side , so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace .	1
Third gift for granddaughter at college . She is a Cheer Leader and eats lots of salads . This peeler helps to prep many of her fresh veggies and fruits .	1
This product is worth the price . Sharp and easy to clean . I would recommend it . Purchased as a replacement for the cheap stainless steel handled version which I seem to cut myself on regularly . This handle is bigger , and seems to create more separation between blade and back of fingers . : )	1
Pros : Unbeatable . I 've never come across anything that performs as well.Peels carrots , cucmbers , etc . with ease . I 've even used it to peel pumpkins ! Easy to clean ! Cons : None .	1
Very good peeler for BIG hands ! Sharp blades . Recommended by Cook 's Magazine .	1
One would be surprised how rare it is to find a peeler that is actually easy to use . The grip has to be just right , the peeling head has to swivel not too much and not too little and its edges have carry just the right amount of sharpness . I went though a number of peelers which I all eventually abandoned in favor of my trusted knife . However , once I got my hands on one these OXO ones , I never used my knife again.Nowadays , that seems you can not go through a single day without coming across Food Shows , this swivel peeler is a must in every kitchen.RECOMMENDED .	1
so far have no bad reviews with this brand . I like to buy this brand occassionally and have never had a problem .	1
I bought this peeler to replace one that was getting dull . My sister was here for a visit and also wanted one so I bought another .	1
I 've had this for about a year , it still remains sharp enough to do a good job peeling vegetables . I prefer a vertical peeler design because it is faster if you have strong wrists , if your hands are weaker , the horizontal design will probably work better for you .	1
To put it very simply , the blade is ultra sharp and the handle makes it ultra easy to use . For someone with a disability or arthritis ( or just weakness in your hands ) this is perfect . And even if you do n't have dexterity problems the handle makes it very easy to peel a lot of potatoes and carrots . Usually my hand is tired after two or three , but I just did more than 20 for a party and my hand was not tired .	1
This is a very good peeler . The only reason it lost 1 star , is that I have had better . I could not , for the life of me , find the same one I had before ( which was lost ) , so this is the next best option out there .	1
So far I have only used this peeler to peel potatoes because I have another peeler for carrots and other vegetables . It works well but the razor is loose and I do n't like that . I think it may have some function but my other peelers do n't have that and I find it a bit difficult to get used to it . Otherwise it fine , sharp and feels ok in hand .	1
Had to find replacement for my mother 's peeler that I 'd used for 20 years . This one did the trick . Nice comfortable handle , sharp and effective . Easy to clean .	1
The day I got this peeler , I compared how it peeled side by side with my other swivel potato peeler , just like an infomercial , or something . The size of the pieces that came off when peeled with the new one was incredible . It takes no time at all to peel a potato , whereas I had to spend at least 10 minutes on it before ! I 'm surprised that most swivel potato peelers do n't have any kind of grip on the handle , because after any length of time , holding it can definitely be hard on your hand . It peels carrots equally well , and it makes cooking much more leisurely and fun .	1
I do n't know , but from now on , I wo n't . It is my first peeler , so I can hardly compare , but it works very well , very smooth . I had it for 2 weeks , and peeling veggies is now a fast task in my kitchen .	1
i 've never owned a peeler before this . only used my parents ' growing up . This must be a sign that you 're interested in cooking and eating better when you need a vegetable peeler ! ! i would recommend to everyone looking for a peeler . the grip is soft where you hold it between thumb and index finger . The hole on the grip is just big enough to hang this if you want .	1
I rather enjoyed this peeler . In fact , when I first used it , I was disappointed I did n't have more stuff to peel . This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel -- you do n't have to apply any pressure . The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand . The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes . I am glad I bought it .	1
Nice potato peeler , it will hold up in doing what I need it to do . Very nice quality as most OXO products are .	1
I do n't use it much , but here is my 2 cents : The handle design is godlike . It is comfortable to hold and extremely easy to grip.The head swivels and makes peeling much easier.It 's about as easy to clean as you 'd expect ( maybe easier ; I was worried about all those nooks in the handle but as they 're made of soft rubber it 's easy ) .	1
This is without a doubt the best peeler I 've ever used . My hands never got tired , no matter how many apples , potatoes , carrots , or anything else I peeled . I first bought this peeler when I was suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome ( about 5 years ago ) and I 've been using it ever since and the blade is still sharp !	1
This is my favorite peeler and I now purchased a 2nd one . It is so nice in your hands , love Oxo !	1
I use it to core apples before I put them in the dehydrator , It 's well made and easy to clean ; a very good product .	1
This corer works as it is supposed to for coring apples . that is all I have used it for . It seems sturdy and well made .	1
This is a perfect quick and easy helper when you have two hungry toddlers that want their apples & # 34 ; big & # 34 ; and not sliced . I would definitely recommend .	1
You slam this thing down into an apple and PRESTO - gross seeds and tough core are gone-zo . I like to dehydrate apples , and this has simplified that process by a million minutes . The little teeth at the end help it break the waxy apple skin , and a quick turn pulls the core out .	1
Core an apple in seconds.Easy to gripe handle.Made apple slices , I am thinking apple dumplings are in my future !	1
excellent !	1
works well , pricey but what isnt these days . it is what is is . If you dehydrate apples , it is perfect for decreasing your workload .	1
I like eating apples with peanut or almond butter , but I used to hate trying to cut the center out of each apple slice . This device has fixed that problem . I put the apple on top of a cutting board and then push the Corer straight through the center of the apple . It is large enough to get the entire core out of small to medium sized apples .	1
It 's really tough and sturdy . I have arthritic hands and this handle is super . I highly recommend this item . You wo n't be disappointed . Also the price is excellent .	1
I bought this apple corer so I could core my apples more easily than with a knife . It works as advertised so I 'm happy ! : )	1
I absolutely love this corer ! It 's incredibly easy to use , and the best part is that it does n't seem to have any sharp edges I can cut myself on . Clutz-approved ! Despite lacking sharp edges , it still cuts through an apple very easily and without a lot of force . OXO handles are great , as I have quite a few of their other products in my kitchen , and this has lived up to it 's non-slip standard . If you miss getting all the seeds out the first time , no worries ! It comes out as easily as it goes in and and you can try again . Just try not to get too crazy with it , or you 'll end up with a bunch of apple cylinders and no apple left !	1
I have several OXO Good Grips gadgets in my kitchen and I find they are consistently well designed and do the job they are meant to do and do it well . This corer is right up there with the best of the OXO tools . The handle is large and sturdy and helps me get a good grip so I can get the core out with one motion . I have really bad arthritis in my hands so if this tool did not perform well , I 'd be looking for a replacement.I find this size takes out just the right amount of core . I tend to buy organic when possible and those apples are generally a little smaller than conventionally grown ones . This corer takes out just enough so the seeds and little tough seed casing is removed without taking too much of the apple flesh.Very pleased with this product and happy to recommend .	1
I no longer loathe using apples in recipes . An apple corer really does save time and reduces waste . I 've used this about 15 times and it 's still going strong .	1
This little tool is awesome ! it sure saves time as in one quick motion it takes out the core including all the seeds . Great time saver and well worth the money . Easy to clean . Wish I had purchased it years ago ... .highly recommend .	1
Okay ... let me start by saying that I have never used this apple corer on apples . I used it on potatoes to make a recipe called potatoe bombs ( stuffed baked potatoes ) . This little device worked great in coring the potatoes and I imagine it would do a great job on coring an apple too . My recipe turned out great and this corer worked very well , helping cut down on prep time .	1
Needed something I could grip & use easily and this definitely does the job . Base teeth are not sharp but rotating/twisting corer from the beginning of the process makes the job go smoothly , even if you have to expand original hole for a bigger apple . A definite YES if your hands give you trouble at the most inconvenient moment !	1
Purchased this as a gift for someone who wanted a cupcake corer . She said it works great and makes the filling process a lot easier . Definitely recommended !	1
This corer works exactly as advertised , it makes coring the apples extremely easy . The size of the whole seems perfect to get the full core out without taking out tons of extra apple . To me this is fairly straight forward , either it works well or it does n't , and for me this product works perfectly .	1
I watch the BBQ Pit Boys videos on YouTube and they make potato bombs by coring out the potatoes and stuffing them with all sorts of good stuff . I bought this tool for that reason and when I tried it it worked just like it was designed for that .	1
I just bought this apple corer in a local supermarket . I was using a six blade apple slicer/corer but I had to give it up because the darn thing would slice my fingers up when I pushed out the apple core from the center of the gadget . Now I have this and I love it . With an easy grip handle it makes coring an apple a piece of cake . One push and it 's all done . It 's not a hard push either . It is very sharp , but unlike the apple corer/slicer , it does n't cut my fingers to pieces . When the apple is cored cutting it into many cubes or slices is a breeze . It is a very quick job to cut an apple that has been cored.. I think I will give this corer to my friends and let them save their fingers as well . Great product and very functional , it comes out of the dishwasher as sharp as it went in . I would rate this corer 5 stars for functionality and usefulness .	1
Love it !	1
Not only do I use it to core apples for pie , I also use it to make filled cupcakes . Just push down the center of the cupcake to nearly the bottom , twist and pull out . Fill the inside and replace with just the top . Wonderful !	1
It is easy to use and simple to coring an apple . I can even let the kids do it with no fear of them cutting themselves .	1
This apple corer is awesome and very high quality . It is very easy to use . I am so glad that I bought it . My kids really enjoy eating the apple rings that I make from it and also eating apple ring and peanut butter sandwiches . A great product that inspires us to eat healthier .	1
I was a little skeptical about this because the corers I 've used in the past usually just mangled the apple . This one gives a nice clean cut and goes in and out relatively easy . The only fault which really is n't the product 's fault is that the apple needs to be perfectly straight up and down to get ALL of the core out and can waste a little bit of apple if it 's not .	1
After you master the coring angle , this thingamajig really does the job . Core removal was easy . I was using the standard & # 34 ; segmented ring & # 34 ; type corer but this is really nice .	1
Having an apple corer , I find , makes slicing apples so much simpler . And this is the one recommended by America 's Test Kitchen . I quite agree . Easy to use and easy to clean up afterward . Does the job .	1
Corer worked nicely , was easy to do , easy to get the core out of it . Just wish it was a teeny tiny bit wider so i didnt miss some of the seeds , but all in all , it worked really well , and came on time	1
Our daughter is starting her own cupcake company so these are perfect for getting her started . This came quickly and is great for coring to fill the cupcakes .	1
It 's an apple corer and it works . The OXO style handle certainly makes it easier and more comfortable to use . It 's very sharp and goes right through the apple with any issues . It 's not as wide as you think either . I was hoping it was a tad wider but it still gets the job done most of the time .	1
As far the typical apple corer , it 's a good one . It 's got a nice handle and goes in smoothly . The corer part could be a bit wider , but that 's something I 've run into with other corers .	1
This corer lives up to the excellent reputation OXO has established with it 's line of kitchen products . It feels good in the hand , and it is built to last .	1
I use this thing every time I deal with apples . You just press down and twist , and out pops the core ! Be careful , though , because it 's pretty easy to get off center and just core out a bunch of good apple .	1
I use this tool every day and love it . It 's very well built , simple , functional , easy to use , and only takes a few seconds to clean . What more can you ask for ? It 's really a time saver and makes eating apples more enjoyable because you do n't have to deal with the seeds . It also cores pears.To use it all you do is line up the center of the apple , apply a little pressure while turning the handle slightly and it takes out the core with very little effort . If you love apples and pears , this is a must have tool .	1
I needed an apple corer to dehydrate apples into apple chips . Man I was goin through like 9 apples a day with this bad boy ! Thank GOD for the ergonomic grip or my virgin hands would have definitely gotten fatigued .	1
We bought this hand grater to replace an aluminum hand grader with a looped rolled aluminum handle . That honestly was a pain to use.This grater has a very comfortable handle and does an excellent job compared to what we had been using.I would recommend this and all of the OXO Good Grips items to any of my Family and friends .	1
it was what i wanted . i pretended i was a chef in a restaurant as i grated my nutmeg ! it 's sturdy and sharp ! a good buy i do n't regret .	1
This OXO product is another winner . I like the padded handle , and it really remains straight while grating a hard hunk of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese . The cheese does not fly all over the place either . It washes up easily in hot soapy water . Take a few seconds after you wash it to towel dry it . Cheese graters are famous for rusting , and I do n't think even the OXO brand is immune to that .	1
Pardon the pun , but using a grater can sometimes be a really grating experience ! Most have thin inadequate handles , are hard to manipulate , are too large , too small , or just leave a huge mess for cleanup . I have a number of other OXO products and have been thrilled with them , thanks to their very user friendly grips and was equally excited to find this grater . Now that I have I can give away all the others cluttering my drawers and cupboards as none comes close to working as well as this . I have the old box style one with four edges , but honestly with a food processor who needs it , not to mention it develops rust . With this easily held grater you can position yourself over a plate , a bowl , a pan or whatever , and make precisely the grating you need . And did I mention the handle ? Even though I 'm hardly elderly or suffering infirmity , it 's nice to have a grip that is easy on the hands instead of some thin one that 's hard to hold.I ca n't say enough good things about the OXO line of products . They excel at utility , ease of use , and durability . Any chef or gourmand should be using them .	1
This is a sturdy grater and the grater holes are small . I do n't often grate more than 1/4 cup of cheese , and with more patience than a large hole grater would take , I can grate a cup of cheese if needed . This is just the right size for me and with a little rinse and dry , it goes back in the drawer . My regular box grater takes a bit more time to clean and work on getting all the cheese out of all the holes then dry without scratching my skin .	1
This is a handy , sturdy and attractive bottle opener you can use to either flip open pop-top caps or pierce the top of cans . Its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand , making it require less force to operate than the more traditional bottle openers do , keeping you away from cramped hands and other tension related injuries , and rendering it perfect for broth cans , soda bottles , cans of baby formula , etc.Like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line , this one is a great value of superior quality , unsurpassed durability and flawless performance . Its ergonomic design and big , pressure-absorbing , outstanding non-slip grip , complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers and an oversized hole for easy hanging , allow you comfortable , daily , wet or dry use . Its elegant , stylized , standard OXO shape will fit perfectly with the rest of your OXO utensils in the kitchen or in the bar.Its easy-to-clean , simple construction and dishwasher-safe , hard-wearing materials make this a tool that you will be able to depend on for years , and its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away.After submitting this product to over two years of normal use , mine is still just like new. -- Reviewed by M.

Got so tired of my old opener bending and not punching through the can and slipping on . This is so well made and works great . Very sturdy , and nice handle that is very easy to grip and does not slip .	1
I wanted a peeler that would work on large items better and bother my hands less . This was that such peeler . Great grip , easy use and a durable product . I 've had it for about a month and it is by far my favorite food prep tool in my kitchen . Much better than anything you 'd by in the dollar store . If you want to make short work of a butternut squash , this is the peeler for you .	1
I was looking for an easier way to peel butternut squash and ran into a reference to & # 34 ; Y & # 34 ; peelers on another website . That led me over here to Amazon to see what was available . I was delighted to find OXO made one . OXO products are good quality plus they are easy to handle because of the size and material in the handle . With my other peeler , my fingers always seemed to be getting in the way of the strokes . I usually always nick a nail when peeling with my old peeler . The & # 34 ; Y & # 34 ; peeler lets you push away from yourself with a little more control . The cutting edges on this OXO peeler are sharp . I 'm happy to have added this to my collection of food prep tools .	1
Oxo really does it the best , thisis a joy to use . I suspect it willast for years . log overdue buy .	1
I 've always switched between a regular peeler and just peeling potatoes or apples with a knife . Other peelers seemed to take more time than a knife . This OXO peeler is not like the others . It makes short work of peeling potatoes or carrots , etc . I have two other peelers that I do n't even touch since I purchased the OXO peeler . It 's my new friend !	1
Makes peeling easier ! I prefer the straight version however , because that was what I used most of my life . The wider blade covers more space but I find it harder to hold the item and avoid the plane of the blade with this style . It 's a great product though and when my DIL is in the kitchen helping me , she prefers this one .	1
If it is from OXO for the kitchen I am all for it . Have never been disappointed yet . Durable , long lasting , good handling and fit to hand . Large peeler for potatoes , squash etc . Just love OXO gadgets..I think I have them all , if not will keep ordering .	1
Love this peeler . It makes short work of the largest veggies and has a good feel in the hand . ( No peeled fingers or knuckles )	1
I love this peeler . It does a great job . It is the best peeler I 've had - I cook/bake a lot and have tried many brands .	1
This product has a good quality . I have 2 of these and for few years usage they are still sharp . We are using them daily .	1
This is my new favorite peeler . It is sharp and peels very cleanly . I use it with another type I bough t at the same time . This onereally does the best job of peeling potatoes . Anything OXO makes seems to be of good quality , and hold up well .	1
It works I have not found a jar it does n't open , it will not break plastic	1
This gadget has been a lifesaver for this single lady ! I have found that it opens most kinds of jar although it 's less successful on very small bottle caps , such as you might find on a Coke bottle . This is a sturdy , well-made product and I gave one to my elderly aunt , who has arthritis . She just loves this thing .	1
I have tendonitis in my hands , and this makes opening jars a bit difficult at times . There is n't always someone else around to open them so we picked up the OXO jar opener to give me a hand . It 's a funky thing , combining one of OXO 's large , soft rubber Good Grips handles with a fan-shaped piece of plastic that grips the edges of a jar lid in metal teeth , grasping it and giving you leverage with which to twist.You simply slide the fan over the lid until the lid ca n't sit any further inside the edges , which means it 'll adjust to fit a wide variety of lid sizes . The teeth grip , and you twist , holding onto the Good Grips handle.The good : That handle is very comfortable for hurt hands to use . It also gives plenty of leverage and thus works fairly well in opening jars.The bad : The teeth do n't grip perfectly , sometimes slipping a bit , so it still requires a bit of hand strength to push the opener on securely enough to work . Also , it did n't take too long before the metal teeth-strip along one side just came right out of our jar opener.For some reason our OXO products do n't seem to last all that long or hold together all that well , although most people I talk to do n't have so much trouble with them . Perhaps it 's just that we put our kitchen things through a whole lot of use ; maybe if we were less intensely active in the kitchen it would n't be a problem . Regardless , the good thing is that their products are designed so well in other ways , and usually not too expensive given that , that we keep buying replacements instead of simply going with other companies . I do believe the jar opener is a handy item , particularly for occasional use . Just be aware that it might not stand up to heavy use .	1
This is a nice little lightweight , flat opener . I got it to use on 2 liter bottle caps and it works great as I had hoped . Also works great on most jar lids up to a large peanut butter jar lid . Recommended .	1
This little gadget sure has made my life easier - no more pounding jars on the counter trying to loosen the tops ! It works great !	1
I love this . I make a lot of meatballs and this is so handy to use . Very hard to find one like this in the store .	1
I loved this scoop ! Love the grip on it as it was easy to hold . The ice cream was easy to scoop with it with no problems ! The only problem - no more ice cream ! : )	1
love the design of this scoop . I can achieve a firm grip , slices easily through hard ice cream . A wonderful , comfortable , and well balanced rubberized handle . As it glides over , it produces a curl that easily releases from the scoop . Excellent product .	1
The best online purchases are the ones where you receive the package and use the product ; and it does exactly what it is supposed to do and how it is supposed to do it . This ice cream scoop with the pointed tip is one of the best I have ever used . for the price , not to be beat .	1
I was so happy to finally find an ice cream scoop that does n't break or bend awkwardly after only a few uses . This scoop is very sturdy with a big comfortable handle for those of us with big hands . I like the shape of the scoop itself , it 's a little sharper and flatter and really does a nice job digging into the ice cream . Be careful though because this digging can lead to you puncturing the bottom or sides of the container . I would have given this 5 stars but after a month or so these little bumps began to form on the finish of the inside of the scoop . These bumps do n't impact the function of the scoop , but they certainly do n't look that great .	1
Just scored one of these OXO Ice Cream Scoop on a Manager 's Special at Fry 's Food in Scottsdale AZ . I love the OXO products for starting my Kitchen as newly divorced male .	1
I already had a Kitchenaid scoop and some generic one with a pushable lever . This is pretty good , not as much heft as the Kitchenaid one has , but works fine , going thru most ice creams except the hardest . Then all you need is to dip it into water . I would buy it again .	1
Just do n't like junky kitchen gadgets . I have a Kitchenaid ice cream scoop , that I 've had for quite a few years , so I will compare the the OXO with the Kitchenaid , which I think is fair as the prices are comparable . The Kitchenaid is heavier , has a longer handle , and the scoop has a little thicker metal . The OXO has more of a pointed scoop and is thinner at the edges , making it slightly easier to scoop hard ice cream , which is nice . As of this writing , I should point out that the Kitchenaid sells for $ 11.99 while the OXO is $ 7.99 , making neither a cheap choice . Do n't get me wrong , I think the OXO is a good product , just not quite the quality of the Kitchenaid . The OXO does work well , but the shorter handle is not as convenient when scooping in the bottom of the ice cream carton . If you do decide on the OXO I doubt that you would be disappointed . Wish I had more to compare it to , but this will give you an idea of the ones I have . They are both good but I think the Kitchenaid has just a slight advantage.UPDATE : I 'm liking this scoop more and more . When ice cream is really frozen hard this scoop with the pointed end outdoes them all ! Four Stars Now	1
OXO makes nice kitchen products that are reasonably priced and are of a high quality . This ice cream scooper is another example of this and is a nice purchase . The primary distinction between this and your average scooper is that this one has pointed edges . This makes it easy to get the ice cream out of the box , especially when it 's hard . It also helps with getting to ice cream out of the corners . My only con of this scooper is that due to the shape , you wo n't be able to get perfect round balls of ice cream . Of course , that is a minor issue and should n't be a reason to avoid buying it .	1
This scoop gives you a couple of great advantages that others do n't provide . First , the large , rubber like handle gives you great gripping power to dig into hard ice cream . Second , the leading edge of the scoop has a semi sharp edge on it -- which really helps it cut through as you push and and makes the job easier . Oxo makes good products , and this is one of them I would highly recommend .	1
This is a handy , sturdy and attractive ice cream scoop with a unique , pointed-edged shape that works its way through the hardest ice cream , frozen yogurt , sorbet or sherbet with minimal effort . Its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand , making it require less force to operate than the more traditional scoops do , and keeping you away from cramped hands and other tension related injuries.Like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line , this one is a great value of superior quality , unsurpassed durability and flawless performance . Its ergonomic design and big , pressure-absorbing , outstanding non-slip grip , complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers and an oversized hole for easy hanging , allow you comfortable , daily , wet or dry use . Its strong , stout neck is unbendable , and its elegant style makes it perfect to move back and forth between the kitchen and the dinner table.Its easy-to-clean , simple construction and dishwasher-safe , hardwearing materials make this a tool that you will be able to depend on for years , and its chrome-plated scoop will permanently keep your rust worries away.Be aware that there are a lot of negative reviews on this page that do not refer to this item , but to the lever-operated version , also from the Good Grips line.If you buy this product you will get your money 's worth guaranteed . After submitting this product to over three years of normal use , mine is still just like new. -- Reviewed by M. E. Volmar	1
My old scoop was the aluminum kind with the liquid inside that you are supposed to run under hot water before using . Problem was that it got all corroded and nasty looking over time . This scoop works so much better , even without running it under hot water first ! The handle is much nicer because of the grippy material , and it cuts through ice cream that seems pretty rock hard to me . i think the little points on the scoop help with serving harder ice cream . Easy to wash and my husband even used it to scoop out the insides of our pumpkins this Halloween !	1
It 's been a month and so far , so good , with this OXO ice cream scoop . The edge digs in nicely into the tub of ice cream and the handle is easy to hold . Also , the handle shows no sign of separating from the metal scoop part , so I 'm happy about that , and the shiny finish on the scoop is smooth and blemish-free still . We 're washing it in the dishwasher , so I will update if there are any longevity issues with this ice cream scoop.All in all , if you need an ice cream scoop , this does the job nicely . *Update : February 2012* It 's been 8 months , still looks like new .	1
This thing looks so deceptive.The edge will cut through even nearly frozen confections.And surprisingly nothing sticks.Now I can toss out the old ones ! !	1
I love ice cream . Even when I 'm dieting ( like now ) , I make sure that I have some room , calorie-wise , for a little of the stuff.Despite this life-long affection , I 've never owned an ice cream scoop . I have a large , stout tablespoon reserved for the purpose which has always served me well . That 's all changed , because now I have the OXO.Two features set this one apart from the herd . First , there 's the handle . It is just the right thickness and shape to be comfortable in the hand while in use and is covered with the same soft , black , rubberized material that OXO uses in most of their other kitchen utensils.Secondly , the scoop has an unusual design , its leading edge drawn into a broad point . It is n't the usual hemispherical shape that most other scoops possess . The shape makes it easy to excavate the surface of your ice cream while in the container , even in the corners . Creating a nice round scoop to go on top of a cone , however , is problematic . You can do it by sort of rotating the scoop in the ice cream , but it takes a bit of practice.Clean-up is simple . Into the dishwasher in the silverware basket and you 're done . I 've washed mine this way about 40 to 50 times with no issues.I have quite a few OXO implements and always find them well-made and well thought out .	1
You wan na know something about me ? I should n't admit this but I 'll go ahead and do it anyway since this is the internet and you know how people online can be . They can be brutally honest . I can be brutally honest too . When I 'm alone and making ice cream cones for myself , I do n't even use the lever that releases the scoop of ice cream . I just fling the scoop of ice cream into the cone by shaking it up and down and hope for the best that it lands inside the cone . Sometimes it lands properly , sometimes it does n't . Depends on my accuracy on any given day . Now you know how sloppy and careless I can be but when I 'm alone I do n't really mind . My family would n't approve of this behavior understandably , that 's why we 're not going to tell them how I conduct myself when making food for myself . It 's not like the flies on the wall or the ants patrolling the kitchen counters will tell me I 'm doing it wrong . This is n't one of the better scoopers out there anyway- the ice cream often gets stuck so flinging is becoming more of a necessity regardless who I 'm making the ice cream cone for . If the ice cream cone recipient walks into the kitchen and bulges their eyes at me in disbelief as I fling their ice cream carelessly into the cone , well do n't judge me people . It 's the scoopers fault the ice cream wo n't release , not mine ! Do n't blame the messenger as they say .	1
OXO Good Grips Lever Ice Cream ScoopThe other day I was searching for a different type of ice cream scoop . This scoop had to be multi-functional , not just for ice cream , but for other tasks in the kitchen . I wanted something that was ergonomically designed to fit the palm comfortably , pressure-absorbing , with a processed rubber handle that puts less tension on the hands , while still providing an outstanding grip . The handle had to be slip-proof , wet or dry , as well as dishwasher-safe.The scoop I was looking for had to be used for baking as well . Something that was the right size for cookies , meatballs , making melon balls . The size of the scoop needed to be around 2 Tablespoons . This size is perfect for scooping out my favorite meatball recipe , then I can roll it in the palms of my hands to finish off the circular ball shape . Now , all the meatballs are uniform in size.Around the holidays when cookie baking is more in vogue . I use this scoop for uniform sized cookie dough on the baking sheet . This is a great tool to use as the cookies tend to be more uniform in size . Biscuits come out more uniform as well.Now for the function that the scoop was intended , that being for ice cream serving . I found that that it works well to get this ice cream out of the container with ease . The thumb flip works well as the ice cream is easily place into a dish or cone . The softer the ice cream , sorbet , or frozen yogurt the flipper function becomes a problem and will pass right through the item you are trying to serve . There is a delicate balance ( temperature of the items ) that you have to get right for the scoop flipper mechanism to work at 100 % efficiency . This may take some getting used to.Some of the product features are : * Soft , comfortable handle is nonslip , wet or dry* Yields perfect round scoops of ice cream , frozen yogurt , and sorbet* Ice cream is easily released from scoop with the press of a lever* Large hanging hole in handle makes storage easy* Dishwasher-safe* Dimensions : 7.5-Inches x 2.06-Inches x 0.75-Inches* Stainless Steel* Made in ChinaOf course , there is another aspect that is high on my list . What good is a scoop if it ca n't be cleaned ? This scoop is dishwasher safe and I placed it in my dishwasher and when the cycle was finished I checked the results . The scoop came clean . There were no left over food areas around the ejection flipper or anywhere around the serving head . The handle was very clean and the handle remained viable , nonslip and fit comfortable in your hand.As an all-around tool for the kitchen I would highly recommend this scoop . It is multi-functional for different aspects of cooking found in the kitchen . I have found many uses in my kitchen for this scoop as I 'm sure will as well.An epicurean bon app & eacute ; tit	1
In a quest to acquire the necessary kitchen items I purchased this scoop . I love OXO and this item does n't disappoint .	1
I just realized that I 've had this brush , using it daily , a little over 5 years . Popped it out of the dishwasher last night and it looks like new . The bristles have yet to go slack . What else needs saying ? Oxo knocks it out of the park once again .	1
I felt compelled to write a review of this miraculous brush ... The lady of the house cooks and as such I am delegated to do the dishes , which is probably for the best as I do them right . You know how it is when someone does the dishes , but they dont do them `` right '' . As an avid and professional household dish doer , I appreciate the devices that make my life easier and this is the best thing ever . The brush is extremely comfortable for the many hours a week it spends in my hand . It is extremely effective at removing everything from stuck eggs , scorched sauce , and all kinds of animal fats stuck to a myriad of kitchen cookware.I absolutely love this brush because it is safe for nonstick and is super durable . I have punished it on many occasions and it still looks brand new . Whenever I feel like rewarding it for its valiant service , it gets a free ride in the dishwasher and comes out as happy and fresh as the day it was born.Seriously though , this is one of if not the best dish brush I have ever had the pleasure of using . It is strong , comfortable , and effective and looks good while doing it.If you are on the fence about it , I say jump and buy it . It is $ 8.70 at the time of this review and that is a steal compared to what it will do for you , especially if you are the household dish master .	1
My favorite dish brush . When the price took a big dip I bought several . They will last a long time too if you do n't use it on hot pans and store with bristles up or not resting on anything that flattens them . Run through the dishwasher monthly or sooner . The large diameter handle fits my XL hand well . If the price is around $ 5 - 7 jump at $ 10 no way ? But if ten is nothing then go for it . I have not found anything better .	1
I had a great little OXO brush with a suction cup that stuck to the side of the sink that finally needed replacing . Sadly they do n't seem to make that kind anymore . So I replaced that with a longer handled brush and liked the price ( $ 4.50 as an add on item ) and the reviews.I was n't sold on it the first use , but then I started getting more comfortable with the different style , and I like it.I would have liked the bristles a little closer together , but I figure I 'll buy another round dish brush if need be . It 's great for glasses and even for scrubbing pans . There is a soft plastic scraper tip for caked on stuff.I hand wash 75 % of my dishes , so I use dish brushes a lot . This is a good value dish brush and I am quite happy with it . It 's not worth paying $ 10 - $ 15 for a perfect brush when this is really good for a lot less .	1
The bristles are quite firm for a brush of this type but they 're spread out . That 's ok IF you use this brush to remove food from utensils prior to placing in dishwasher.If you 're trying to clean pans though , this brush wo n't be perfect . In that case , consider a brush just meant for that purpose such as this one : Cuisinart Round Head Brush , Black.I recently discovered the advantage of using both kinds of brushes depending on what I 'm doing . This way , the kitchen brush is n't ruined trying to clean pans and other hard-to-clean items . The sacrifice is having to keep two brushes handly instead of the simplicity of just one , but I found it better this way .	1
there isnt anything on any of my dishes that this brush cant take offused george forman and left the gunk on it overnight and you couldnt even tell i left it on overnight . the brush just easily gets it off	1
This is a great product to have for water bottles , travel mugs , coffee pots , etc . It 's got a sturdy handle and the bristles are a nicely firm for cleaning in spots you ca n't get with your hand . I have these for my kitchen , my office ( bowls , water bottles , coffee mugs ) since they work so well . Price on Amazon is great too .	1
I like to use this brush for deep scrubbing . It 's a very good brush . It does n't cost much , and it 's very good.Really , I like it , and it 's a trustworthy brand in my eyes . I recommend it .	1
I bought this to use for my cast iron skillets . It works great . Ive had it for a few weeks and it seems to have softened up a little already . I expected it to stay firm . I hope it lasts for a while . Performance is great . I just worry about durability . I will update review in a few more weeks .	1
Only a geek would respond on a review for a dish brush , but ... Works as advertised , as a dish brush that is .	1
This brush has lasted a few weeks and I tend to hand wash all my dishes . I will continue to order more of these as I need them .	1
I have big hands , and I hate dishwashers ( the machines , not the people ; in my youth I worked as a dishwasher ) . This brush is a perfect size for my hand , and makes getting stuck-on food off of dishes , pots , pans , indoor grill grills , glasses , mugs , etc. , much easier than scrubbing away with one of those sponges that has a regular sponge side and a rough side ( I only use the kind that are safe for no-stick pans , etc. ) . I have used the brush vigorously on no-stick pots and pans and it does not scratch the surfaces at all . The top edge of the brush is a scraper of sorts - not a sharp-edged scraper , but useful for dislodging food that is really stuck on the surface in question.The brush works great for cleaning coffee stains from the bottoms of tall coffee cups . I recently bought a Cuisinart Griddler Junior indoor grill , which has removable grills , and the brush gets those as clean as can be and eliminates the need for me to use the plastic scraper that came with the grill.I also like that the brush extends my arm so that I do n't have to bend down toward the sink when scrubbing away.I eat a bowl of spaghetti with spaghetti sauce and suddenly I feel incredibly lazy when it comes to cleaning up the dishes and cookware and so I let the dishes , etc. , sit ; I 'm guessing this lazy spell is a carbohydrate effect . Before getting this brush , cleaning up after such a meal - after the pasta sauce has had ample time ( sometimes hours ) to virtually adhere to all surfaces it has been in contact with - was a real pain . With the brush ( and hot soapy water and elbow grease ) , it 's very easy.Hey , it 's just a brush , but it 's a good one and it 's nice looking . ( I checked out the selection at my local WalMart before choosing the Oxo , and saw nothing there that struck me as being comparable in price , quality , and aesthetics . I have Amazon Prime , so shipping on this item was free for me . )	1
I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later , and with CONSTANT , REGULAR , FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen , the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most , thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle , not the black/white one shown in the photo , so do n't be shocked if you get something different !	1
Got this over 2 years ago and it still looks and functions like it did the day I received it . It can tackle any mess or grime I throw at it . Strong bristles that do not seem to ever wear out , which is the problem I have with every other type of brush I 've ever used . Probably the best kitchen brush ever made . I 'll just leave it at that . The fact that I 'm even taking the time to write a review about a kitchen brush should speak volumes ...	1
I use this for the mason jars and deep cups I have . Great for that kind of thing . Do n't expect to use it for the really tough stuff on your pans - for that , you use a toothbrush or something with wires .	1
Which is to say , sturdy , well-designed , and easy to use . The bristles are holding up great , the angle is good , and it cleans up dishes like nobody 's business . I kind of wish I 'd gone for the kind with the soap reservoir , but that 's my fault , not the tool 's . Thanks for another great idea , OXO !	1
I have tossed my sponges and use Oxo good grip brushes for household cleaning jobs . I have only had this brush a few days , but find myself using it constantly . It is perfect for cleaning the crud out of the seals in the garbage disposal , cleaning the burners of the stove and the vent hood , and all the other cleaning jobs that require getting into crevices . The brush can be put in the dishwasher , or easily cleaned by hand and soaked in a chlorox solution for a few minutes . This brush cuts my cleaning time in the kitchen by several minutes per task . It is definitely a good value for the price .	1
I have always felt that OXO is hit and miss with quality . I have tried several of their kitchen brushes over the years and this one is pretty good . It has a strong handle and I suspect it will last more than 6 months . At the same time , I 'll probably replace it before then for cleanliness purposes , since the head is n't replaceable . Regardless , it 's cheap and does the trick . Good for general cleaning of dishes , etc , but not for the true elbow grease stuff .	1
I bought this to clean my cast iron pans . Bristles are nice and stiff to scrape off crud , the flair pattern is good getting into corners , the handle is comfortable , and its easy to clean . Not bad for 5 bucks .	1
Excellent , long lasting brush . Most supermarket brushes & # 34 ; die & # 34 ; ( bristles go flat ) in no time . These brushes last much longer . They also are comfortable to hold .	1
Bought this just to get the 25 dollar free shipping , and am back for another . This is by far the best dish and mug brush I have ever had ( mind you I am not really a kitchen-y type ) . Anyway , I 've had it a couple months now and am impressed after using it to scrub the rings ( that never come off in the dishwasher ) off coffee/tea mugs , cleaning pots , etc . Usually with other brushes the ends of the bristles get `` mashed '' looking fairly quickly , but this is holding up well - even after my son cleaned mud , spider webs and other debris off an old army helmet with it - ( which is why I am buying another ) .	1
Great brush . Strong bristles . Nice scraper built into the handle . A good value . OXO makes nice stuff . Buy yourself one .	1
There 's a plastic scraper built into the front tip of this brush , which doubles the usefullness . What can I say , really ... it 's just a kitchen brush . But this is a really good kitchen brush .	1
I wanted a new dish brush that would n't fall apart after some use . This brush is well made with the known OXO Good Grips handle . I like to use it and then thrown it in the dish washer ( top rack ) to keep it nice an clean for the next use . I have been using this brush every day and it looks and wears very well .	1
Oxo Good Grips Dish Brush is one that will last for a long time . It has a very sturdy handle that wo n't , in my opinion , break like some handles of brushes The brush also has a good feel when you hold it in your hand . It does a good job of general cleaning of the dishes without any effort . I highly recommend the OXO dish brush .	1
For 35 years , I have been using a dishwashing brush with the bristles configured so that they are half-cylindrical with a rounded end , and with a plastic scraper incorporated . With the bristles in that configuration , such a brush is perfect for washing out a tumbler , a mug , a cup , a wine glass , a jar or a goblet . Also , I like to get all the greasy stuff out of an empty tin can before putting it in the recycling so it smell . This kind of brush is great for that . But it is just as effective to wash a plate or shallow bowl . I even like it for mixing bowls because the rounded end gets into the curve where the side of the bowl transitions to the bottom . On a rare occasion , something will be stuck to a dish that the bristles wo n't remove and that 's where the hard plastic scraping edge comes in handy . I 've had a lot of brands of this sort of brush over the years and they 're getting harder and harder to find . Of course , since this one is OXO Goodgrips , it has an improved handle with that squishy black rubbery grip that 's less slippery than hard plastic , and the handle is fatter , making it more comfortable to grip . I also have a grid system over my sink with a plastic hook for hanging my dishwashing brush ( along with other kitchen items ) and the hole in the handle fits nicely over that fairly bulky plastic hook . It 's also great for washing out my nonstick T-Fal pan without damaging it -- I never put that pan in the dishwasher . I think this dishwashing brush is the best one I 've ever had . ( For a standard pan without a nonstick finish , if there 's something really stubborn burnt onto it , no nylon-bristled dishwashing brush is adequate . I use a spongy pad with woven nylon netting over it and non-scratching powdered cleanser for that , and if that does n't work , I have some shredded stainless steel scrubbing pads that are a very effective last resort . )	1
We like this so much after several years use we wanted to have two of them and bought another . It is perfect for smaller hands and very ergonomic . We use them both pretty much every day .	1
I have a fairly big variety of the good grips knives and they are all really good . I just picked up 4 diff ones for my mom for her bday and she loved them also .	1
Love this knife . It is so easy to hold , particularly if you have any arthritic or other problems . It is also great for small hands . It does not slip and cuts beautifully . This is my second one : the last one was accidently damaged by someone who used it to pry something and bent it . It is meant for cutting food , not cement .	1
I love this knife . It is small and comfortable size to spread a butter . I use it for butter and cut some fruits and vegetables . Handle is very soft for me , because of my carpel tunnel problem .	1
Great knife ! Very sharp and cuts through the toughest crust ! I can cut very thin slices , too ! I had just removed my bread from the bread maker and flipped the bread on a towel . I cut the bread and realized I had also cut right through the towel ! Watch your fingers and the kids with this knife .	1
I bought this to replace one of those old , very thin serrated knives that comes with a set . I 'll bet that one is from the 1960s - it was just too thin , too flexible and had become dull . Seems I 'm the only one in this household who likes a sharp knife that does what it 's supposed to do AND is safer.This OXO Good Grips Bread Knife is excellent because:1 ) the handle feels good ; it 's thicker and certainly not slippery,2 ) the blade is wide and sturdy - it cuts a slice uniformly ! And,3 ) it 's S-H-A-R-P.It 's also good for slicing frozen English muffins . It 's also excellent for slicing open pita bread sideways - I mean that I place the pita flat on the board , turn the knife sideways and slice around the baked edges to create thin two rounds ( just like slicing a layer of cake to make two layers ) .Fabulous for cutting paper thin tomato slices . Nothing cuts tomatoes like a sharp serrated knife . : DFer sammiches , I like to use several super thin slices overlapping each other rather than one thick slice that shoots out the back when you take a bite .	1
I do n't have a complete knife set and was tired of ruining loaves of bread with my dull chefs knife and other basic kitchen knives . In all honesty the main reason I purchased this particular knife was that it was the cheapest . Having good luck with other Oxo products previously purchased , I was n't to hesitant to purchase yet another . It has a sharp serrated blade and a comfortable handle that have easily handled all of my bakery cutting duties ( bread and bagels mostly ) . This knife is also nice for heavy skinned fruits , easing through pineapples and cantaloupes . It has also stood up to the dishwasher rather well . You will not be sad with this knife and will be happy with the outcome of every cut you make .	1
OXO is such a good brand . I had bought the Aero knife and found it to be so dull and lightweight that it was downright dangerous . I threw it away . Ordered this . This is an excellent bread knife .	1
It 's nice to have a sharp bread knife again after so many years . We 'll try not to lose this one .	1
I have a few non-serrated knives , and they work great for cutting meat and stiffer vegetables , but they are terrible for softer things like bread and tomatoes . This OXO knife does the trick nicely , cleanly cutting bread , tomatoes , and melons without squashing them . For 10 bucks , you ca n't beat it .	1
Bought this knife to cut homemade gluten free bread , I wanted to avoid too many crumbs and crushing the bread , this knife cuts through it like butter !	1
Pretty sturdy . Have used it to cut more than bread and did a fine job . Not of the highest quality but very good knife at a good price .	1
I tried to sharpen my serrated bread knife and ruined it . This fills the bill completely . I did n't pay attention to the delivery fee though . I could have picked this up at Walmart or Target for a lot less .	1
Inexpensive knife but has performed well for me so far . I have n't used extensively yet and therefor it has not been through the dishwasher very many times . So far so good .	1
I know there are more expensive knives available . They even have pedigrees but for bread this works great pound cake too .	1
It 's sharp . The handle is light weight . It 's rubbery and non-slip , but I prefer smooth hard handles . If you want a rubbery handle , this knife will work fine for you.I got a knife at WalMart one time . Dull as a politician .	1
This breadknife did n't cost much and is nice and sharp with a good heft to the hand ; not too lightweight . I 'm sure I 'll have it for years . Cuts bread , sandwiches - perfect for the price .	1
Great working knife , holds up to MUCH use and dishwasher - so pain free and comfortable for my arthritic fingers - LOVE OXO ! ! ! !	1
Blade is fine , cuts great , handle is wonderful.if you just need a bread knife to cut bread and do it well , then this is the best value out there.Do n't cut reams of paper or try to saw through wood.I liked it so much I bought another after getting the first .	1
This is a great bread knife that slices with ease . Very effective blade that cuts bread like it was butter .	1
This is absolutely my favorite knife . ( including a few by Wustoff Trident ) I 'm not much of a cook , but WHEN I cook , I want it to be painless and hassel free . I picked up one of these at TJ Maxx here in the Chicago area about 2 years ago for $ 10.00 , and now I would n't be without it . It replaced a much more expensive chef 's knife by Chicago Cutlery that I found to be a useless piece of junk ( gave it to my brother - now the thing is his problem ! ) . This one has a much nicer balance to it , sharpens beautifully , and as with all the Good Grips products , love that no-slip handle ! I 'm not a gourmet or a professionally trained chef , but for the average household kitchen , I think this knife would be a great addition . Great for kids in the kitchen learning to cook too . Smaller hands seem to find this knife much easier to use than most.PS - my other two top Oxo picks : the red spoon shaped spatula , and the red regular spatula . Spend $ 30.00 for the 3 and make your life a whole lot easier !	1
I must say , for the very reasonable price of this knife , she 's a beaut . GREAT handle ... solid and comfortable to chop on and on . Nice rocking action . Nothing to dance in the streets about , but certainly a nice knife for a VERY nice price !	1
I bought this for my husband , who loves peanut butter . This little guy does the trick . It is wide enough to get the product out of the jar and onto the bread , waffle or whatever .	1
-Easy grip handle is great-Spread all kinds of foods very well-Alittle bigger blade than I like , but still very nice-Cuts wellGreat Gadget to have in any kitchen , dorm room or in break room at work .	1
use this OXO good grips spreader all the time ; love that it has one side that cuts through sandwiches ; handle is great	1
Was just what I was looking for ! The price was good . I use these for spreading butter , mayo , peanut butter etc .	1
This spreader really spread well . It has decreased my sandwich making time significantly . I am not in the food servers business , but this sure head a kitchen knife any day of the week . Sandwich specific .	1
I have had this spreader for several years now . I really like it , but you have to take REALLY good care of it , or buy a new one every year or so . You must dry it immediately after washing , so that it wo n't rust ( I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes , but make sure to pull it out right away when it 's done ) . Also , the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it . This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader , I remove the handle ( water will get into the handle and you do n't want that ) , wash it by hand and dry it off . Then I let it set a few hours more , and put the item back together again . If this sounds like too much hassle for you , then you might look elsewhere .	1
This is not a kitchen essential , but I love it . I only bought it to take advantage of the 4 for 3 promotion , and as it turns out , I use it almost everyday . I have had it for over a year , and it still looks like new . I rarely use the dishwasher , so I wash mine by hand . I probably would n't bother putting something like this in the dishwasher anyway.I like to bake , and I use the spreader to spread butter over the dough for cinnamon rolls , spread pizza sauce over pizza dough , and I have used it a couple of times to put the frosting on cupcakes . What a great tool for 5 bucks !	1
I really like this set . The nice is practical for everyday use . I like how the handle on the peeler is larger than on most peelers . It is much easier to hold . It is great for carrots , potatoes , chocolate for fondue , etc . This knife is great to use on just about anything . Whether it 's slicing an apple or cutting a sandwich in half .	1
I 've been using this Oxo set for at least six years now , and I 've even replaced it once , after my partner tried using the parer as a crow bar . [ Not recommended ! ! ] The peeler is fine , better than the old ratty one I 'd had for years , and never enjoyed using . Now I admit I do n't use it all that much , so perhaps a swivel-peeler expert would find it less satisfactory , I do n't know . For my needs , it 's more than adequate.I do like the knife . The blade is very good ; not the best , but certainly not the worst one I 've ever had , it 's easy to keep it sharpened , and the size is about right for a number of tasks . The handle is what I really love ! I do n't have arthritis or anything , but a lengthy veggie prep session will make my hand cramp with most knives . This one 's comfortable to use for an hour or more , long enough for the biggest salad or stir-fry marathon.I 've also bought sets for gifts , and my friends seem to like these tools , too . In fact , I recently replaced a set for one who lost hers during a move . Give it a try , especially if gripping a knife for long periods is starting to bother you .	1
I do not understand the negative reviews . Thanks goodness I did not pay much attention to them when I ordered , as I would have missed out on a great value with this set.The peeler is effortless and smooth as silk to use , peeler away from you normally . Great control and the blade is sharp as can be , making a carrot easy work . The paring knife is sharper than my brand new Victorinox 8-inch knife . Cuts through carrots and onions easily and with the barest effort.The handles are typically Oxo : large , comfortable , and steady .	1
This OXO item is rock solid ! Worth the money , and definitly does tenderize meat . Item shipped exactly as described ! Great .	1
This is a Nice solid tenderizing Hammer . It is built extremely well , and works great . Smooth side is GREAT for roulade , or any other flattening needs , The spiked side works great for cube steak , etc . Shorter than I expected , but gives great control , and easy to use . Handle is comfortable , as with all the good grips line .	1
I used this on the dead chic key and flatten it like a pancake . Also tried it on the wife and kids and works on them too . Yee Haw	1
Ordered it on Monday , and received it on Tuesday . Great service . Used it to tenderize chickenthighs and it worked great . Chicken very tender . Unlike some reviews it did have a do not put in dishwashersticker on it . Maybe Amazon added it to later orders . Feels good in hand , love the rubber grip . Reallyglad I got it .	1
This product has the right weight & balance to do what it 's supposed to with the least amount of effort ! And the `` grip '' is perfect ... I tossed my old tenderizer immediately after using this the first time ! Very easy to hold and control !	1
This meat tenderizer is excellent . It feels great in the hand and is nicely weighted . Go ahead , beat your meat with OXO . You 'll be glad you did .	1
I am yet another fan of OXO Good Grips products . The meat tenderizer is another good product . It is very ergonomic , and it 's heavy/solid so that you do n't have to pound as hard as you would with more lightweight tenderizers.I do n't like the fact that you ca n't put it in the dishwasher , but really , scrub it with some anti-bacterial dish soap and you 're all set . After shopping at several home product stores in search of a tenderizer , I came back to the OXO Good Grips because I found it the best , in spite of not being able to put it in the dishwasher .	1
This is a good tenderizer , but DONT put it in the dishwasher . It is NOT dishwasher safe : ( which is unfortunate	1
I bought this because I split the older wood meat tenderizer I had used for years . Better weight and balance and more even tenderizing . I also use this to flatten meats before grilling so they cook evenly . Very pleased !	1
Its a meat tenderizer ... what can I say about it in at least seventeen words ? It looks nice , flattens the meat ... .and I 'm done !	1
received as a gift -- love it . the handle is comfortable and I am able to flatten what i need quickly . great gift !	1
OXO products are always great quality - - - a good addition to any kitchen .	1
I do n't know if I have ever purchase an OXO product that I did n't like , or that did n't suit its purpose , but Amazon offers a great selection and price for these tools . I got this for my daughter , who loves the weight and the balance .	1
This meat hammer arrived quickly and is of great quality . The handle is rubberized for an easy grip and the hammer has two heads for different applications . Highly recommended !	1
Works very good	1
Very easy to hold while mashing taters . It does leave them fairly lumpy unless you 're a mashing master . Easy to clean , easy to use . Simple sturdy product that does what its supposed to .	1
Great sturdy design ! ! The handle is well made , soft on the hands , good non-slip grip but yet durable . The heavy duty stainless steel designed wire mesh does every job perfect.Charms	1
I am so happy to have this larger , wider handle grip on this potato masher . Our old masher had a thin handle and was tiring to use . The wider grip makes mashing potatoes easy to do without any strain .	1
Sturdy metal potato smasher , which gets used by us for everything but mashing potatoes . We use this metal potato masher for breaking down ground beef , ground turkey and sausage for things like spaghetti sauces and lasagna or any other dish that requires crumbled meat . It is a trick I learned from some show on Food Network , and once I learned this trick , it really made that step in cooking so much easier . Also , we have tried it with plastic potato mashers and it does not work as well . Metal potato smashes for crumbled cooked meat . It just makes sense .	1
I need a Potato Masher . Works great . It is strong and durable . Has a good feel with the handle which feels good in my hand .	1
For my husbands and I 's first Christmas I asked for a potato masher . He got this exact one and I can say that I 've used it once a week for 10 years and its still perfect . The handle is just fine and it never rusted or anything . I love all the Oxo products , they really do last years and years . I 've bought other companies products for the kitchen and they fall apart , is I specifically look for Oxo Good Grips whenever I go get a kitchen gadget because I know it will last for years . One tip , after you mash the potatoes rinse off the potato from the masher because once that potato dries it takes alot of work to remove .	1
I have always used my electric mixer for mashed potatoes . I saw this in the store and thought I would try it out . It works great.. easy to use and best of all I do n't have to mess with my mixer . Love it . 5 stars ! ! !	1
Comfortable handle , food adequately mashed . Better quality than the similar style one that this replaced ; since it 's OXO , expect it to last for awhile .	1
I love OXO Good Grips , and own a ton of their products . This one is solid , durable , and awesome , except it is more difficult than my previous masher to get the edges of my pot . My previous masher has a circular head , which works well for curved pots , but this one is straight and just takes a bit more effort . It really is n't a problem for me , and I still use it , but it 's certainly a flaw .	1
I purchased Several OXO Good Grips including a Lemon/Lime Reamer , Cheese Plane , Wire Potato Masher and Box Grader . They were all reasonably priced and are made of good quality material . The potato masher is the best that I have ever used and I use it for everything . I like to mix bell pepper and onions in ground beef instead of using a large spoon . Add a can of black olives in the mix and mash them up also . I would recommend this brand . The handle has a nice grip and is nice and soft . I considered this brand because I have the wire whisks and other products by OXO .	1
It mashes the potatoes just great . Easy to use , and easy to clean . No complaints from me or my husband .	1
This replaced my old masher of 20+ years , love the OXO grip . You ca n't go wrong with an old standard , it worked great for breaking up potatoes . My only complaint is that it could be longer , this is great for a standard pot but if you 're using it for a bigger stock pot you 'll have to really get in there to get it to reach the bottom .	1
What can you say it is built solid and does its job	1
This `` potato masher '' is perfect if you like `` smashed '' potatoes rather than mashed , and you like to leave the skin on your potatoes . I had the kind with the flat head and holes and it works fine for peeled potatoes . If I left the peels on , they got stuck in the holes and I kept having to clean them out . You also end up with smooth potatoes rather than lumpy like I prefer . So I purchased this `` masher '' and could n't be happier . It makes perfect `` smashed '' potatoes and any other root vegetables . The other thing I use it for ( and one reason why I bought this kind of masher ) is to break up hamburger or sausage in a frying pan . It works so much better ( and faster ) than a wooden spoon . Just be careful if you are using a non-stick pan not to scrape the bottom of the pan . Another good use for this masher is to break up whole tomatoes from a can . Just dump them into a bowl and mash away.Like all other Oxo products , this masher is well made and will probably last for a very long time .	1
This works very well . It is very much like the one my mother used when I was a kid . It is also much cheaper to use than a hand mixer .	1
I love making mashed potatoes . It 's cheap and you can make it all different ways . This bad boy makes things a lot easier .	1
OXO does have a pretty good record of making good , solid and useful kitchen utensils . This is no exception . It 's a bit shorter than some mashers , but seems extra solid with a good , easy-to-grip handle . Mash away . . . potatoes , winter squash and sweet potatoes have no chance . . .	1
Well crafted potato masher that was desperately needed in my kitchen ! It 's merely been used a couple times , but can not foresee it falling apart or having any problems due to its sturdy build .	1
Nothing fancy , just mashin ' action . I would give it 5 stars if the handle was a bit more comfortable ( just hard plastic as opposed to something more comfortable , but it 's not like you use it that much ) and if the design was closer to the honeycomb open-hole idea instead of the curvy wires , which leave more lumps in your mashed potatoes . But really , if you want perfectly lump-free mashed potatoes , you should be using a ricer , not a masher .	1
What can you say about a potato masher ... It mashes ... .I bought this one because its a Oxo . A brand I can trust .	1
I 'm happy with this product . It slices just the right size pieces . The grip handle feels sturdy . This is also very easy to clean .	1
Who cut the cheese ? I did . And it was perfectly sliced . Good grip with good balance make this a must have for the cheese enthusiast .	1
I love the OXO products and this is no exception . It cuts the pizza easily . I would recommend this to others .	1
I am a HUGE pizza eater ladies and gentlemen . The amount of pizza I can insert inside my always-expanding mouth and swallow ( and what is becoming quite a reccurrence these days- cramping my belly up ) is ... haha , a very disturbing ( or perhaps enlightening ) situation to be in ! Seriously , do you friendly readers have any idea *just* how much pizza I can eat in one sitting ? I 'm not setting world records or anything ( well , unless we were all insects , yes , participating in some pizza-shoving competition WOULD be rather impressive then ) and I definitely do n't mean to toot my own horn or anything ( I 'm a tootless tooty ! ) but my goodness- you can never put enough pizza in front of my hungry lips.This Oxo ( Wait what ? Ox ? Where is it ! Run for the hills ! haha ) . Er ... sorry about that , hehe . I 'm terrified of wild animals you see . Just the sight of one makes my feet weak . Anyway this Oxo Good Grips 4-inch Pizza Wheel is admittedly a tad small for my big hands ( remember- big hands are a requirement in order to shove more delicious pizza down my throat . Did you forget already ? ) but it *works* . I enjoy it.What is that smell ? Do I smell pizza in the air ? Yes I do ! Because I smell pizza in the oven ! My family is making me some tonight , and I 'll be sure to pay a little bit of respect to the pizza wheel that changed the course of my life . Changed me into the pizza-obsessed feisty wolverine that I 've embarrassingly become today.Oh and stay away . This is *my* pizza ! That 's right ! I do n't share : ) Alright I better write down something serious so amazon does n't think I 'm writing a prank review . This really is a very good pizza cutter and works splendidly , and HAS been working splendidly for over 10 years now . There 's a reason this particular model is so popular .	1
This thing does it 's job ! It cuts a mean pizza . Seems sturdy . I bought it as a gift but considered stealing it and giving my old one . Sadly , I decided to be a good friend and let the good one go . Probably going to buy another one for myself !	1
Have had this almost a year , and hands down it is the best pizza wheel I have ever used . Good value .	1
I finally broke down and got one of these after getting fed up at dragging my knuckles through the pizza with my old , small wheel cutter . Boy am I glad I did ! This cutter works sooo much better . I do n't know if it 's sharper , or if it 's because it has more heft , but it cuts right through those pizza crusts , like a charm . I have also used it to cut pastry and dough and it works really well at that , too . Finally , it cleans up quickly easily . Definitely a great gadget every kitchen should have .	1
It cuts pizza very nicely and is a good size . It is also dish washer safe . 10 out of 10	1
Sharper than my old one , larger , and definitely easy to use . I like it and it 's holding up well . ; - )	1
This pizza wheel is so much bigger and nicer than the little $ 2 pizza cutter I had that I uploaded a picture for comparison . First of all , it 's huge and makes quick work of even your deepest deep dish pizza . You hardly have to apply any force at all . It has a very nice weight and quality feel to it . I hand wash and dry this so that it will last a really long time.I have been adding Oxo kitchen tools to my arsenal over time , and it has become one of my favorite brands along with KitchenAid , Cuisinart , Calphalon , etc.If you are willing to pay $ 12 for a pizza cutter you wo n't be disappointed with this one . It may be the last one you buy .	1
Our beloved pizza cutter finally broke after ten years of happily wedded bliss , and so I took to Amazon to find the most highly-reviewed replacement . I landed on this one ! And then it came in the mail . Great quality , expect it will last five times longer than our first ( somewhat cheap ) one did . BUT . This thing is giant ! Do you know how big four inches is ? I may just be really dumb but I 've never seen a pizza cutter this big for home use . It looks like something you 'd use in home defense . Who needs a pot when you 've got a gigantic sharp round blade to swing ? Seriously , I did n't know I 'd have to lock it away from the children , but I really do n't think it 's safe to leave in reach of even our oldest . It works great , though . I guess it 's for serious pizza eaters .	1
We have had this cutter for around 6 months now and I still love it . I use it for pizzas as well as cutting dough and simple pastas . It still works just as well as the first time we used it .	1
This pizza wheel was better than expected . It really is a professional kitchen tool , and it easily cuts an extra-large pizza with little effort .	1
It does a very good job . Larger than expected , but that 's fine . Has done fine in the dishwasher.It is a bit wobbly during use , but , I 'm cutting a pizza , not walking a tightrope .	1
when given the choice , i always buy oxo . it 's the most comfortable for my hands . this pizza wheel is great , sharp , and cuts clean . and i found it for a steal at ross dress for less at $ 3.99 ! ! ! ! ! ! would i buy it at amazon for the inflated price ? uh , no . even if i did n't find it at $ 3.99 , i would have bought it at bed , bath , and beyond for cheaper with their 20 % off coupons . amazon , if you want to stay competitive , price your items lower !	1
This pizza wheel is of excellent quality for the money paid . It has a big wheel and cuts through everything .	1
I love this pizza cutter ! The grip is great and blade is awesome ! This pizza cutter is very easy to clean .	1
A pizza cutter is n't something you think about all that often until you need one . Well , I did . Not only does Pizza Hut never cut my pizzas all the way through , but frozen ones do n't come with any slice cuts at all . So you got ta have one of these . My old one must have been about as sharp as a spoon because it took many , many rolls across the pizza surface to make a cut . Missed a lot and created too many super narrow slices . This little guy does it perfectly in one pass , so I 'm a fool for having waited so long to buy one .	1
... Rollin ' , rollin ' , rollin ' on the pizza ... Even though I very clearly read that this is a 4-inch pizza wheel , I really did not expect it to be this ... big ... This is one hefty pizza cutter . I like to make pizza with lots of veggie toppings , and it slices right through every time . Whether or not you have to go back and forth seems to be dependent upon how crunchy you like the bottom of the crust . A softer crust slices easily with one pass . A crunchy bottom crust requires a bit more work , but not enough to give this a negative rating.What I really like about the cutter is the feel in the hand , and the easy cleanup . ( Spray the cutter lightly with no-stick spray before using , and cheese , etc . rinses right off . ) The bracket that holds the wheel in place is far enough away from the wheel that cheese and bits of topping do not get stuck between the bracket and the wheel . ( I had that problem with my previous pizza cutter , and had to literally soak it in water after every use , and push the debris out with a toothpick . What a pain ... not to mention the yuck factor in not being able to really get it clean . ) I hand wash and dry the cutter after every use , which I hope will avoid the rust issue that other reviewers mentioned.I am very pleased with this purchase .	1
This is a brilliant device and the Daddy of pizza wheels , all pizza parlours should buy one or two they would save themselves a fortune ! One spin across the pizza and it 's done ! no repeated to and froing or worse , finishing the job with a knife ! It does not need sharpening either , just as well cos I am clueless as to how on earth you would do that job ! Oxo brands are just really really good so start collecting now !	1
It 's sharp and works well . The rubber is nice . I just wish there was a bigger hand guard in front of the blade . Especially on the bottom .	1
This pizza cutter is comfortable on the hands , and does its job of cutting pizza well . You will not need second swipes , and the amount of pressure needed to cut the pizza is modest , a blessing for those with older hands . It also does a fine job on Quesadillas , or so my son tells me . It far surpasses using a knife to cut pizza . Finally , it far surpasses the quality of the store-brand pizza cutter we previously used .	1
Just used this for the first time . I 've always used a real fine grater for lemon zest , but this is SO much better ! I got nice , thin strands of lemon zest and no issue about getting into the bitter white pith .	1
I am a quadriplegic/tetraplegic ( C5-6 for any of you who care ) . I have only about 1/3 use of my hands and about 1/2 use of my arms , but I can use this zester -- not with great ease , but I can use it ! I can not use any other zester I have tried.My mother has mild arthritis and she likes my Oxo tools better than her own ( even the ones she 's grown to love over the years ) .The zesting blades are sharp and at the perfect angle . You get perfect zest with little effort . And you get NO pith ( bitter white part ) .As with almost all Oxo tools the design is excellent : it is highly ergonomic -- it fits the hand and works the way it should .	1
Most kitchens probably do not have a lemon zester as a routine item , but the OXO zester is a must for both casual and professional cooks . The problem with most zesters is they are n't sharp enough to properly zest only the lemon peel but instead give you white pith along with the zest . But the OXO only gives you the best of the lemon as it stainless steel blade cuts sharply and cleanly . Another excellent feature is a built in garnishing tool that allows you to cut designs into citrus fruit thus giving you two kitchen gadgets for the price of one . The zester is quite durable and goes through the dishwasher quite well too . This tool is also extremely safe for even the youngest of hands as its slip proof construction allows you to grip it easily without fear of slipping and hurting oneself . So add some zest the OXO way !	1
This kitchen tool does all that is expected of it and oxo never lets anyone down . Love the sharp teeth on this.Fabulous for making limeade .	1
I love this zester for making cocktails . It 's very comfortable to hold and extremely sturdy . It 's not meant to zest for cooking , though , especially if you need fine/small pieces . Highly recommended for you bar at home !	1
I 've been looking everywhere for this type of zester . Finally found it on Amazon . I was a little worried that the handle was going to be too big for my small hands because it is fat . I have a much skinnier handled one already . Well , it works like a charm , even better than the skinny handled one I have .	1
I buy a lot of OXO good grips items , and I 'm never disappointed . Well made and easy to use , I always love them .	1
Before purchasing this nifty little zester , I would always leave the zest out of any recipe that called for it . Whenever I tried to use a grater , the colored zest would stick inside the holes . If I kept on grating until the zest came out the other side , then I 'd also get bits of bitter pith that would ruin the taste and the recipe.This tool makes perfect zest that includes only the flavorful colored part of the citrus peel . You run it lightly over the surface of the peel , and it makes ultra-thin strips of colored zest . The tool is easy to control , and a snap to use . I use mine to make non-bitter-tasting orange , lemon , and lime zests for homemade sorbets , ices , and ice creams .	1
this little tool enables you to add another , fresh dimension to yourcooking . The bright , sharp tang of citrus peel is a wonder in dozensof dishes . pancake batter ? sure . a reduction sauce ? of course.In fact , any time you have meaty , salty or hot flavors in a combinationthat seems to lack something or other , a bit of citrus zest is a good fallbackoption . If you 're really scrupulous , it pays to get organically grown fruitbecause of chemical residues and paraffin preservatives on the skins ofconventionally-grown fruit.A zester can also be used to raise butter curls or to scrape a carrot intoshreds as a last minute addition to a sauce , or to shred some parsnip intohot soup.It 's unlikely that you will ever wear out the sharp edges on a zester , butthey are remarkably cheap and if you amortize the cost over-let 's say-a hundred recipes , this is a downright cheap addition to your batterie.By the way , the little notch that you see in the side is a cannelling or caning blade . It 's for cutting long thin strips . Those striped cukes that you see on salad trays are done this way . You can also use the strips themselves as decorative additions to stir-fries , pasta dishes and soups.OXO is well known for their ergonomic grips . This one looks most unlikelybut actually proves to be very handy ( so to speak ) . -- Lynn Hoffman , author of New Short Course in Wine , The andbang BANG : A Novel ISBN 9781601640005	1
This is very easy to use . I love how the orange rind comes of in spaghetti like strands . I dry these in the dehydrator to produce a wonderful aroma throughout the house .	1
Works well as a zester and making twists for martinis . But my daughter found a new purpose for it ! Scraping out the seed of pumpkins and winter squash , works like a dream .	1
This handy and attractive zester comes with very sharp holes set at the perfect angle to make zesting rinds virtually effortless and give you more peel without pith on lemons , oranges and even the toughest of citrus skins . The built in channel knife for garnishing is a convenient addition you can use on chocolate and other foods to produce the perfect decoration every time . Its sharp blades never seem to need sharpening , and its hefty body fits comfortably in the hand , making it require less force to operate than the more traditional zesters do.Like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line , this one is a great value of superior quality , unsurpassed durability and flawless performance . Its ergonomic design and big , pressure-absorbing , outstanding non-slip grip , complete an oversized hole for easy hanging , allow you comfortable , daily , wet or dry use . Its injury-free , elegant , stylized , standard OXO shape will fit perfectly with the rest of your OXO utensils in the kitchen or in the bar.Its easy-to-clean , simple construction and dishwasher-safe , hard-wearing materials make this a tool that you will be able to depend on for years , and its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away.After submitting this product to over two years of normal use , mine is still just like new. -- Reviewed by M. E. Volmar	1
This is a really good peeler , and I am really happy with it , my only complaint is that it peels a little narrow for my taste .	1
I have n't found an OXO kitchen tool that I have yet to like or think is better than any other brand I 've used . I give this 5 stars for a reason .	1
This is among the best of the OXO tools I 've owned . It has exceptional sharpness and is a pleasure to use . Any serious cook who uses zest should strongly consider this tool .	1
great potato ricer.i bought it and used it right away.it made a great smooth mashed potato.it is a little too bulky for my taste but it a good tool and it gets the job done : - )	1
Results in significantly better mashed potatoes than when you actually mash the potatoes with typical mashers or whatever the squiggly masher with a handle thing is called . Also good for gnocchi . Ricing is the way to go and this one is of good quality and a decent value .	1
Decent capacity and relatively easy to use , although I now wish I had bought the one with the compound leverage for easier squeezing .	1
I had my doubts about this item because it felt a little flimsy when I removed it from the box . It 's lightweight and the handles seemed a little small . However , it worked flawlessly and made super-smooth mashed potatoes . It 's very easy to press the potatoes through the holes.The only downside is that it takes a little time because you ca n't fit a whole potato in the ricer , you need to cut the potato into workable chunks , and it 's a little bit messy . But the consistent smoothness is well worth it . I liked this much , much better than a standard masher.A couple of tips : make sure you use soft enough potatoes ( I used russets ) and place the potato so that the peel faces the top , not the holes . You also must remove the peel each time you press ( that 's where the messy part comes in . ) Recommended !	1
Excellent product , well made . The only small problem is the cup size , on the small side if you are doing potatoes for more than just the family .	1
This is a well made product that works wonderful ! You will love the way mashed potatoes come out using this , and it is so easy and quick to use . Hand wash or dishwasher .	1
Great Product as my wife has approved it and she is very picky so I am on her good side .	1
The OXO Potato Ricer is a great kitchen tool that has held up well for the past 6 years of fairly regular use . No unnecessary bells or whistles , this works exactly like it should and is easy to keep clean.We like ours so much that we have given them as gifts to our friends with young children for making baby food.Highly Recommended !	1
I had a larger version of one of these potato ricers for years and was very satisfied with it - it had interchangeable plates and could even handle a well scrubbed peel without clogging or even unloading the peels in between presses , but with a newly empty nest my cooking habits/needs as a single person have changed and I 'm trying some different equipment these days . After using both my old and this new OXO potato ricer over the past Thanksgiving week , this one wins my 'cooking for 1-2 people ' approval.Comparing side by side , this basically one piece design does a great job creating smooth mash - the other model had different size plates but if I want it a little more homestyle/chunky I can keep a little of the potatoes in reserve and mash with a fork , adding texture to the smooth batch as desired . There was no struggling with this one to unscrew any parts to clean - just tossed it in the dishwasher . I never realized this was a bit of a chore with my other ricer until struggling to get it apart after it was tossed in a sink at Thanksgiving with other greasy items and pretty much glued itself together until it sat in a little soapy water for a while.The handles are significantly shorter than I 'm used to but even with pretty bad arthritis they are easy enough to work and get the job done . The smaller handles mean this is much easier to store in the drawer with my most used tools as opposed to the larger model which had pretty much made an appearance once a year because it lived in a pantry . The OXO version has already been used twice in the past two weeks - I 'd almost forgotten how well meatloaf goes with mash - yummmm !	1
I honestly only use this ricer on potatoes , and only after my `` food mill '' has done all the work , yet has left me with a few hard scraps that wo n't pass through the blade . I place the scraps into the ricer and voila , no wasted potatoes.I was watching Chef Michael Chiarello on the Food Network and this is the exact model he uses on his mashed potatoes . It 's construction is solid and smooth.I myself do not make spaetzle , so I can not comment on its uses for making that dish ; however , for making potatoes , when combined with the food mill , it serves a purpose for me . If I could only afford one tool for mashed potatoes , I 'd opt for the `` food mill '' .	1
Once you use the potato ricer , you will never go back to traditional mashed potato methods again . Use that extra time you save to concentrate more on the main dish . Clean up is a breeze . Does not rust in the dishwasher .	1
This is absolutely one of my favorite kitchen tools . I use it to make gnocchi and mashed potato . The tool is kinda heavy ... or ... heavier than you would expect . Good quality and highly recommended .	1
There may be some variations in manufacturing of this product , but I have n't had the problem some people have had with the food oozing out the sides . It works great - I 've so far used it with yukon gold potatoes , sweet potatoes , carrots and turnips and everything has worked just fine . I like the fluffiness of the vegetables and the fact that they hold together a bit more than if I puree them in a blender or food processor . It leaves a little more integrity to the veggies in a soup or a sauce over pasta or in breads , but still gives a nice soft fluffy texture . Even though it 's fairly small , processing the foods goes pretty quickly and it 's easier to use than the larger ones I 've tried . Easy to clean , dishwasher safe but I usually wash by hand , which is also easy to do . I 've used this every couple of days since I got it and I 'm very fond of it . I have n't found any other way to duplicate the texture this gives , although I have and use a blender , food processor and very nice knives . It is important to know that you need to cook hard veggies to a fairly soft consistency - it wo n't work well with hard ( or extremely firm ) textures . And if you want to let the ricer sort out your peels ( I usually just peel first ) , make sure you put the peel side against the pressure plate so the fleshy bits can come out of the holes .	1
Great little kitchen gadget . Simple , well made and should last a lifetime when used properly . My wife is really happy with the contraption , it makes it a lot quicker when making cakes , pies etc to rice the fruits than cutting , squashing , smashing etc just insert and out it comes all uniformly so that it can be easily folded into your mixes.Originally was purchased because she wanted to make her own hash-browns ... Been over two weeks ... Still waiting on them.I have learned that whenever the wife wants a kitchen gadget to always search Amazon first . The heck with going to stores , calling around or asking . IF you ca n't find it here , you probably can not find it in a store . It is usually MUCH cheaper to order online than driving around searching or waiting for hours for someone that has no clue what the item is or IF they even have it .	1
I used this potato ricer to make gnocchi . It works well , but you have to make sure that the potatoes are very soft before you put them through ( otherwise it will get clogged up ) . I found it a bit awkward to hold and use , especially compared to other OXO products , which are usually designed to be extremely ergonomic .	1
works great , stainless steel design . great for making gnocchi ! that 's what i ordered it for . highly recommended . OXO products are usually high quality	1
I LOVE I LOVE I LOVE this gadget and it 's not useless ! I know I 'll be using this for years to come . I used itafter purchasing it two weeks ago , finally today for my Easter dinner . I used it for sweet potatoes and regular potatoes . In past , I 've always mashed them by hands but took a lot of work and time consuming and the veggies managed to come out lumpy . Not today after using this ricer . Wow ! is all I could say . Cut my time by half plus the veggies were smoother not lumpy and I used less milk or butter or etc . I 'm sold . I cut the potatoes in halved without peeling and boiled them til tender . Drained water and placed couple of them in the ricer at a time . I 'm impressed . I hope this ricer will last for a long time.Update 6/10/2013I use it all the time . I use it for sweet potatoes , apples and bananas , and strawberries . It still easy to use and easy to clean .	1
The best mashed potatoes require a ricer . This is a lifetime quality model . Simple to use and easy to clean . Results will be the same as 4 star restaurant prepares . Was a gift for my grown son and same as the one I use at home .	1
After reading a recipe on making perfect mashed potatoes , which recommended a ricer , I bought this . And yes , it does make a difference . It is easy to use , one small potato at a time , for a creamy uniform consistency . TIP : pour the boiling potato water through it before mashing ... keeps the potatoes hot .	1
I use this for straining tincture , with cheesecloth as a layer between . Im sure it works great for potatos too !	1
I had never used one of these in the past but OMG they make the creamiest mashed potatoes I have ever had . Great for camping too because you do not need electricity to use . Kids also got a real kick out of watching the potatoes & # 34 ; squish & # 34 ; out . I would definitely recommend this item .	1
I used to have lumpy mashed potatoes . But , not any more . This ricer does a great job on potatoes and it is a good size for a two person family .	1
Because my daughter is a HUGE fan of mashed potatoes I finally broke down and got a ricer for perfect potatoes every time . I LOVE this item.1 ) I boil my potatoes with the skins on until they are very tender.2 ) I rice them one at a time WITHOUT removing the skins . The flesh drops into the bowl of butter and cream below while the skins stay behind in the ricer ( and typically stick to the plunger , so I simply nudge them off into the garbage between potatoes . ) 3 ) I toss the ricer in the open position into my dishwasher and forget it ! 4 ) I give the potatoes a quick stir and voila ! Rich , creamy , smooth mashed potatoes with no peeling , dicing , or beating with a cumbersome electric mixer.Maybe ALL ricers perform this well , but honestly , this item is the best . I am so happy with this purchase .	1
OXO designs great products and this is no exception . It does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top . I just do n't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product -- it does exactly what it 's meant to do with ease . I liked it so much , I bought one for my aunt.Before this , I made mashed potatoes with a masher ; the difference is unbelievable . I kept my masher because I 'm a Southern girl and sometimes I want lumpy mashed potatoes.This is easy to clean -- throw it in the dishwasher .	1
IM ON A LOW CARB DIET . ITS HARD TO GET ALL THE LIQUID OUT OF SOME VEGIES . THIS PRESS WORKS WONDERFULL . ITS BIG ENOUGH TO HANDLE A GOOD PORTION . MAKES THE BEST MASHED COLI THERE IS	1
How I 've missed hashbrowns . There are no Waffle Houses in our area and that was usually where I got my hashbrown fix . They make them buttery and crisp ... just some of the best in the business.In fact , I had nearly forgotten about hashbrowns until a friend mentioned that they were making some , and when I asked how , she pointed me to the OXO Potato Ricer.IT IS SO EASY to do . ( slap-hand-to-forehead ) You clean your potato . You grate your potato while the pan is heating -- with butter or light olive oil . You use the ricer to squeeze out all the excess moisture . You scoop the potato shreds out and then spread in the pan ( with or without onions ) . Season and cook until crispy and golden.I could n't be happier . In the last two days I 've made hashbrowns 4 times . The Oxo ricer has been easy to hand clean , and in general I 've had no problem . I will note though that there are no side holes which means that some of the fluid accumulates above the plunger . I also do n't think that it would necessarily come as clean by putting it in the dishwasher.Pam T~mom/chief bottle washer and cook	1
Are you tired of lumpy mashed potatoes ? Look no further . This little baby will take your potato and squirt it out in 143 streams of creamy mashed potatoes . Solid construction , but boil the potatoes before you stick them in the ricer .	1
I only wish that the handles were about three inches longer for easier use . The ricer is very well made , as are most OXO Good Grips products and it works perfectly . A few more inches in handle length would make this device perfect and earn it 5 stars .	1
This product works great . I have never been able to make hashbrowns , now I can . I do n't even need to use oil in the pan . I dump hashbrown `` puck '' directly out of the ricer and cook it right up . The shape is just right . I have not tried to make potatoe pancakes yet , but I am looking forward to that too .	1
Okay , who has room for yet one more kitchen utensil ? ! ! Seems like those tools in my drawer just multiply over time ... so I finally ordered one of these Oxo potato ricers , and am SO glad I did . My mom never had one of these , nor my mother-in-law . However , I 'd heard they make the most amazing and lightest mashed potatoes ever , so I was in ! ! ( ( Did I mention NO lumps ) ) Ordered it , had never used one before , AND made the best mashed potatoes ever in my life . My family & friends went on and on about those potatoes ! ! Life is good.. hey , also , I have a new grand daughter and this thing works great for pureed foods for her ! Get one , you will not regret it . Why spend $ 45+ for one with multiple blades ? ! ! I 'm not a chef here , just want to be a really good cook ! Works very well , it 's very sturdy , looks good , too !	1
It 's only my husband and me , now that our girls are grown . I wanted something that would do the job , but in less time . This ricer is great . My husband often helps with the cooking and , he was was really impressed with this gizmo . It had great reviews and they were all right about it . It 's heavy duty and really easy to use . It will get a good workout in my kitchen .	1
I was n't paying attention when I ordered this . It 's very small , so time consuming to prepare potatoes for a family size meal . My fault on this one .	1
I bought this in 2006 and it still works great and makes the best potatoes . I never use the mixer anymore ! Also I use this little gem on juicing my pomegranites for jelly ! It is great . Put about 1/2 to 3/4 cups seeds in and squish then discard the pulp . I love it !	1
The consistency of potatoes 'mashed ' with this ricer is smooth - perfect . The clean up is easy in the dishwasher , and it 's easy to use [ even for us little old ladies ] .To those who had problems forcing the potatoes through the ricer , may I suggest cooking your potatoes a little longer - they need to be softer . And for an especially easy time , just use baked potatoes - you get more flavor , softer potatoes to squeeze through , and less clean up !	1
The Oxo Good Grips Potato Ricer is the first one I 've ever owned . It is a little messy and it is important to keep the potatoes warm after ricing and mixing in butter , milk , sour cream or whatever . The potatoes turn out ok . The ricer tends to be a little sloppy . but works ok .	1
My daughter received these knives as a wedding gift and they are used more than any in her kitchen . They are n't the quality of the best German knives but if you do n't put them in the dishwasher they will be knives you will enjoy for a long time .	1
Why do I say these are a nice way to start ? Well , they are great knives , but after using them I think you will want to progress to the OXO MV55-Pro.I started with these and really liked them . Nice handles , good cut . But then I bought the Pro ... and well , they REALLY live up to their name.But these are a good inexpensive way to & quot ; try out & quot ; the OXO line .	1
A very nice set - the only complaint I would have would be not so much a complaint but an observation that the cracker is seemingly designed for larger shells . It is not as effective for smaller pieces unless you place them and attempt to hold them in place right in the middle of the unit where the two pads come together and actually make contact . It is very heavy duty and comfortable though and does just fine . The only modification I 'd recommend to OXO would be to design the cracker to come closer together at the hinged end . I 'd still get it again though if anything happened to it .	1
High quality and sturdy for lobster and crab mealtime . Add another cracker to make the process go faster . Looks great at the table .	1
Very high quality set at very good price . I only wish the cracker had a spring mechanism , although I suppose that would be a failure point or difficult to clean ? Now we have to buy one more cracker to complete what I think an actual & # 34 ; set & # 34 ; should include .	1
We have two and have given 2-3 as gifts . Everyone loves them . They are solid and sturdy . Just the right weight . So far , no rusting or chipping . They feel good and are easy to use.The crackers work much better than the ones we 've had for 30 years ( and which probably cost 99 cents at the time ) . There is no wobble in the hinge and the large middle cracking area is perfect for just cracking crab and lobster legs without crushing them.The picks are well made . The forked design works much better than the curved single-tine picks and the spoon scoop end easily finishes the job.This set is expensive . Many sets are available for half or less . That 's the reason for only 4 stars . I have not compared the quality of the cheaper sets , so maybe these are really worth the extra . I 'm glad we have them .	1
I bought these for a crab feed that has n't happened yet . But so far they seem alot easier to hold and handle than my old ones .	1
These make cracking a lovely little lobster effortless . The grip is very comfortable in your hand and the cracker is substantial . Wash up nicely in the dishwasher .	1
Nice set of seafood crackers overall . The little fork/spoon things have a pretty large spoon side that does n't fit well into crab legs , and the fork side is n't great for ripping the shell open either ( I use a regular fork in conjunction ) .	1
I ca n't count how mant electric can openers have broken on me.Now I just use this handy and comfortable can opener , what I like best aboutit , is that it takes up no space at all , hardly.I like mine very much , I 've had it a good while and would recommend it.Of course , it 's great at work too .	1
When you live in Louisiana , after Katrina , you get prepared . Even in the northern part where so many people sought temporary shelter , you follow the Boy Scout motto . Because of the frequent thunderstorms that are part of hurricane periphery , one must take into account that electricity will go out . This is true of the entire year , not just hurricane season.I keep an assortment of emergency equipment and supplies to make myself independent . Can opener , tuna in both cans and pouches , other food items , a look-like kerosene lamp that runs on Big D batteries and throws out great light , my clip-on reading light , fresh batteries and bulbs , candles and matches , drinking water in reserve , other drinks of choice , and so on.This Oxo Good Grips Can Opener allows you to do just that : get a good grip to turn the machine and open that can ! Great job . Of course , with sardines , you just peel back the top , drain , dump , and eat . Add crackers , pickles , onion , cheese , and that white wine that is quite drinkable at room temp . Pluck some grapes from the fridge and time to eat , thanks to Oxo Can Opener !	1
Look no further . I have one of these at home and one of these for my office because I liked it so much . The handle is easy to grip and hold onto , and the blade is just sharp enough to open any cans easily .	1
I prefer a manual can opener to an electric one - this can be stashed in the drawer and taken out when needed without taking up counter space . Can also bring it with you camping , etc . Nice and sharp - easy to turn the handle - opens cans easily - highly recommend !	1
I bought this opener for my son who has difficulty opening can because of his arthritis . Works great - he loves it .	1
This is a great and easy to use can opener . The grips are n't really necessary , but they are nice . The can opener turns really easily , and it requires little force . Almost as easy as an electric can opener ...	1
This can opener works sooo easily ! I like manual can openers , but some of them are a pain to operate . This Good Grips opener works as good as the other Good Grips products that I have tried .	1
This was recommended by America 's Test Kitchen and I just love it . It is very easy to use with no stain your hands . I have used it for years and it is still working GREAT .	1
It opens the cans just fine . I prefer using this can opened to an electric . It is easy to use and comfortable to hold .	1
I consider this Oxo can opener the new base standard for can openers against which all others should be compared . It may not be the nicest can opener ever made , but it works well , is comfortable to use , and holds up well ( so long as you do n't let it stay wet for any length of time and you wipe the blade off if it gets dirty while opening a can ) .	1
This is a great item when I want to juice one or two fruits , preferably small citrus such as lemons or limes . It 's heavy and quite hefty , and the grip is not squishy , it actually feels very solid and does n't yield to pressure much but it 's not uncomfortable . It washes really well and I prefer it to the wooden reamer , those tend to get gross if left wet or in the sink and wood should never be exposed to too much liquid unless it 's still a tree sitting in the ground.I spend the last weekend making lemonade and limeade and this was in constant rotation . I just made up a simple recipe , juice of one lemon or two limes , good shake of sugar ( about 1.5 - 2 tbs ) and mixed in with tiny bit of hot water to melt the sugar , then I added 5 ice cubes and filled my 12 oz glass to the rim with mineral water . Quick mix later and I had a great , refreshing sip of something healthy ( minus the sugar I guess ) that I got to make myself . I always have citrus fruit on hand ; I get them in dozens and fill up a bowl in my room almost as a centerpiece , mixing the colors . It 's definitely better to make some iced juice than drinking Kamikazes all night long lol.If I 'm juicing a lot of fruits or oranges , I prefer the stationary juicer ; one with a little plate attached but for quick jobs this is great , just remember to roll the citrus on the counter while pressing on it with the palm , or a quick nuke in the microwave makes it even more juicy and fabulous.- Kasia S .	1
Love using these tongs ! For the quality they are very reasonably priced . Locking feature is great and the steel is thick . Very happy with the purchase . I bought the 12 and 9 inch , so far I 'm using the 9 inch the most while cooking .	1
A little device to lock these things shut when not in use seems to be such a simple concept , it 's hard to imagine why someone , including my very creative self , did not think of a way many , many , many years ago to lock them shut when not being used . They are an obnoxious nuisance when they are sprung open , falling off the grill side-shelf , or falling off the _______ ( fill in the blank as appropriate ) in the kitchen , or wherever they land because both hands are occupied and there is no way to close the things . Until now ! ! ! Yeah ! ! ! ! A simple little latch only requiring a tap with the palm of a hand , tap against a belly , leg , or whatever is close enough , so that it can be put down without the aforementioned nuisance conditions . Thank you ... thank you so much ! ! ! They work perfectly . The spread-open nuisance is no longer necessary and I , for one , very much appreciate the change .	1
Everyone should have tongs in their kitchen . And these are a great value . They lock closed so are easy to store . And they do n't slide out of your hand because of the rubber-like grip on the handle .	1
Reasonably priced and high quality with the additional pull lock for easy storage . These make great `` gifts '' too as sets , ie : 9 '' , 12 '' , etc .	1
I 've bought a few years ago for my wife then for my mother-in-law . We 're still using these tongs ( 9-inch , 12-inch ones ) and they are in excellent shape . I bought these as a gift for my sister-in-law . I also bought a 16 inch for my BBQ grill since the one I have for BBQ grill is not good to use .	1
I have had these for a couple years , and I think I use them almost every day . The locking feature is really handy , and easy to activate or deactivate -- even with messy kitchen hands . The rubber is comfortable and gives you a sturdy , cool grip.I have one minor complaint , the tongs do n't work well with delicate things . For example , with chicken parmesan , the breading rips right off . Now , we 'll eat anything , so it is n't a big deal to us . I did notice that OXO makes a set of tongs that have rubber on the ends which may protect delicate foods .	1
Another use for tongs is to remove the giblets pack from a partially roasted frozen turkey.Turkeys set out to thaw in fridge or on counter can leave very dangerous contamination which can be deadly . Google about the problem and warnings from government agencies.The solution is to keep bird frozen and then put directly into oven . After reaching a certain temp you are then able to remove the giblet package with tongs , using a fork can break the bag . If not removed the bag will later break at higher temperatures . The giblet bag is a part more likely contaminated , and emptying the sealed bag in boiling water to cook is the cure if you like giblets . Locking tongs help make removal an easy task.Non locking tongs can be temporarily made to lock with rubber band around the handle grip .	1
The tongs work , no complaints so far . I do n't know if I could rate any tongs as & # 34 ; I love it & # 34 ; haha	1
I have several of this tongs and recommend them if they have the metal center clip ( the plastic ones break ) . These 16 & # 34 ; ones are great for the grill were you do n't want to get you hand in the fire .	1
Stainless Steel , with rubber grips , and a clever locking mechanism built into the end . Good , Heavy-Gauge stainless steel wo n't easily get bent out of shape picking up heavy stuff . Well worth the purchase . I bought the 16 & # 34 ; length .	1
I love OXO products for the quality and durability . These tongs are no exception . Nice soft grip and sturdy locking mechanism . Reasonable price too . I have several sizes of OXO tongs for different uses and they all have performed perfectly for many years .	1
I love OXO products , and this item is no exception . With these tongs at the grill , my husband does n't even need a grill mitt .	1
they are long and to be honest great ! I saw them on a tv show where they were comparing different brands and this one won . I went on and read about it did a little research and got it . Now I own it and use it . hold well .	1
I received these tongs in addition to my Kitchenaid ones and I just love them ! They 're long enough to reach into large pots without scalding your wrists , hands , etc. , and I should know - I 'm the queen of burning myself ! They grab everything with ease and I particulraly like the rubber grips . The Kitchenaid ones do n't have that and have a tendency to get hot . These do n't so they get tons more use . Besides , they 're great to grab things from high shelves too ! And , for ornery little boys to run around the house , beating whatever he wants with them , grabbing the cat 's tail , etc. , and they still look new . Ca n't beat that !	1
These are for my Son in law who is more than I could have wished for my daughter and grand children . As a tip , here is how I use the locking OXO Tongs I have many sizes . you lock them down then use them while they are locked you can turn chicken , hot dogs , steak , and almost anything else without unlocking them thus you do not have to fight with the spring from completely open until just enough to pick up a hotdog . Use the locking tongs while they are locked it is much easier .	1
They lock together so they take up less room in my draw . They are stain less so NO RUST . Love them .	1
As with most OXO kitchen tools these tongs are quality ! They work well , grip tight and provide a long reach for those particularly hot fires !	1
They 're grill tongs . They grip the food quite well and make turning the food on the grill both easy and comfortable . Much better than typical grill tongs which do n't really grip all that well and these are long enough that I can keep my hands away from the heat when in use .	1
These are great ! I used them to flip steaks this evening and they worked wonderfully . I was a little worried about the length ( 12 inches ) but they are not too long and have great balance and weight . I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship .	1
I was n't much of a user of tongs , I just used an old pair of Ecko 's when I needed to get corn or a lobster out of a hot pot of water , or turn over chicken on the grill . But these are the tongs that are changing that pattern . They 're great for almost anything . Theey feel good in your hand , have a good grip , are easy to clean ( dishwasher safe too ) , and they have a neat little tab you pull out to hold them in the closed and locked position so they do n't monopolize your utensil drawer . The 9 inch tongs are long enough that you do n't easily get burnt using them on the grill , and they 're small enough to leave in a salad bowl for serving . And they look nice enough that you can use them at the table and not be embarrassed .	1
Great design , very comfortable , solid quality . Easy locking by simply pulling the little knob at the end of the tongs .	1
my wife and i have bought at least four sets of tongs including two that appeared to have good gripping ability . none of them were worthy of taking up storage space ! we were just about to give it up when i saw the oxy good grip tongs on amazon . i read all the reviews , went for it , and bought it . the reviews were right on target . what a great pair of tongs ! steaks , chicken quarters , even a slab of ribs were no problem . please take my word for it , in the world of tongs they have no equal !	1
The best tongs I 've found . I like the extra length ; makes them great for the barbecue and still they 're not too long for kitchen use . The only thing that bothers me is that they occasionally open in the dishwasher rather than staying locked . That 's not enough , however , that I would n't highly recommend them .	1
I use these to arrange the charcoal after I dump it out of the starter . It locks closed for storage and easily opens for use . 16 inches keeps the hot away from my hands .	1
The right length for grilling and they work well . No complaints . I will update if I have any issues with them .	1
I saw tv celebs using tongs and decided to try them . They had not been part of my kitchen toolkit . Well , how did I get along without them . I was not sure what length to purchase . The 12 & # 34 ; is perfect . Nice and long . Keeps y our hands away from the heat . The locking function is a must . Makes the easier to store and hold in position . The grip is precise and I am not concerned about the mettle tips ruining anything . I find that I use it in new ways , sometime like a spatulas to turn thing , or to grab something . Nice for reaching in the over to adjust foods . Good purchase .	1
Easy to hold , easy to use.Get a shorter set for smaller jobs . I use this one mostly for the grill where distance is an advantage ... especially when I 'm grilling .	1
This was part of a wedding gift set . I have not heard pro nor con about this item from the receiving couple .	1
They work well and are a good size for bagels and pastries ... I like the slide up lock better then the cheap-o metal ring around the last tongs we had for our Thursday morning office breakfast .	1
These are very sturdy and long enough to give you leverage for that big steak on the grill . Easy to clean stainless steel .	1
These Oxo Good Grips tongs are perfect for the kitchen.It is long enough and big enough to be useful for cooking in large quantities yet maneuverable enough for day to day use.The rubber handles are comfortable and make the tongs easy to hold . The locking mechanism is simple and easy to use . The tongs are also sturdy yet light . One other good thing about these is that the rubber grips make them useful even when wet or for hot food.Pros : - Sturdy- Lightweight- Comfortable to hold- Good locking mechanism- Good size- Rubber grips insulate against hot foodOverall : - This pair of tongs are great for everyday use and designed with the user in mind .	1
excellent , just as described . We want to toss it would work with both salad and pasta .	1
These tongs are great for grilling ! I had looked all over for these . I have their smaller ones and love them . I knew OXO made them , but could never find them.Thanks Amazon !	1
These are great tongs , as are the silicone tipped ones . I use these on the grill for some items which my very large grilling tongs ca n't really grab . The silicone tongs are n't appropriate for the grill so I use these . The silicone ones get used on nonstick surfaces . The bottom lines is I have the tongs I need for all by cooking and baking .	1
I 've finally replaced my archaic tongs with this Oxo Good Grips Tongs . I use it for everything . Great product . Do n't hesitate . Just buy a pair .	1
Very useful . purchased on recommendation of America 's test kitchen . Good quality , comfortable and easy to clean . I also purchased the 12 inch locking tongs . Arrived on time and in great condition	1
I love these tongs . The locking mechanism is simple , and exceptionally useful in keeping these things out of the way when they are not picking stuff up .	1
These are the best tongs I 've found . I have them in both sizes & with/without the plastic tips . I use the 9 '' ( smaller ) tongs for tossing salads & other non-heat tasks . I like the long ( 12 '' ) , non-plastic tip tongs for grilling & cooking - the extra length comes in handy when you 're over heat . The plastic tip tongs come in handy for pasta & other `` soft '' food items - I use them less often but they still come in handy.One of the best things about these is that they store in the drawer so easily . No more wrapping a rubber band around the tongs to keep them together . You just pull up on the top lever & they lock shut . It 's also great when cooking to just bump that lever on the counter & they open . The lever is rubber coated so it does n't scratch anything & the rubber grips on the handles keep the tongs from getting slippery in your hand . I throw them in the dishwasher to clean.These are used daily in our house & after 5+ years , they still work great . They are on my short-list of most useful kitchen utensils .	1
I 've been having a pair of these for years . Buying another as a X-Mas gift . The long arms are great for the barbecue pit and very strong . You ca n't go wrong with any OXO product .	1
Good quality tongs , sturdy and easy to grip food with . I call this a good investment for my kitchen . . .	1
Excellent precise gripping surface for turning/ moving hot food with a handle that does n't get hot . Locking mechanism works well . Very happy with this purchase .	1
OXO is famous for its inventive changes on the old standbys in the kitchen , and this set of tongs is no exception . It 's the only tool to use if your trying to fish out turkey bones on the bottom of your soup pot -- no scalded fingers ! I love the locking mechanism , too , so that it does n't crowd the utensil drawer . A great buy .	1
I 've tried several stainless tongs and this is the best yet . My previous favorites had the spring rust out after a year or so of heavy use and many trips through the dishwasher . I think these will hold up better and they have all the features . Rubber inserts in the handles for a good grip . Locking tab in the hinge to keep them folded up for storage . Just the right shape and serrations on the business end for gripping just about anything you would want to use them for . I 'll be getting more of this brand !	1
These are so nice . Was n't sure if they would be too long at first but when I got them I found out quickly that they are perfect . My hands are sensitive to heat and these allow me to turn the meats etc . without having my hands directly over the heat . Grips are strong and sturdy and the strips on each side make it super comfy to hold . Like the little locking feature at the top .	1
great product . just what i wanted ! perfect size ! plus better then plastic ends so they dont melt !	1
These tongs are simply fantastic . The spring tension is just right . They stay closed when you need them closed , yet are easy to open . They clean up well and are durable . Buy one pair with steel tips , and one with nylon tips . Why bother with anything else ?	1
A 12 '' set of tongs like these cover 90 % of your needs , unless you grill a lot , perhaps , or cook regularly with unusually large frying pans , braziers , or stockpots . I like the Oxo tongs quite a bit , which is saying a lot , as I do n't think highly of the brand generally . These have a good feel to them , the rubber grip surface is effective for non-slip purposes as well as heat insulation , and the the locking mechanism makes it particularly easy to accommodate in kitchen drawers , the dishwasher , or a utensil pot . The ends have a useful bend to them that makes picking up food items easy . I wish the stainless were just a bit heavier-gauge , but in practice , I have n't had any bending problems.Again , good for 90 % of normal kitchen needs . A longer set of tongs is probably a better choice for grilling , but even there , these are fine for the odd item or so .	1
*****These tongs are sturdy , and fine for all tong tasks . OXO makes these tongs in the 9-inch , 12-inch , and 16-inch size . Note that these tongs do NOT have nylon tips at the bottom edges , like another version of OXO tongs that I much prefer . These would not be safe for using on non-stick cookware ; however , you could use these tongs for many things you could n't use the nylon head tongs for because there is no nylon to potentially melt , so you would n't have to be as careful with them.These stainless steel tongs are a great alternative to the cheap aluminum tongs that feel flimsy and break easily . OXO products , including this one , are always easier to use and of high quality.They store easily in a smaller space because of the locking mechanism at the top and they have a loop if you want to hang them . They clean easily , too . They should be good to go for any kitchen task . *****	1
The Oxo Good Grips 12 & # 34 ; tongs are great . They provide a secure grip for both your hands and food you & # 8217 ; re picking up . Excellent for flipping steaks or turning a 3-5 pound pork loin . They can be locked in the closed position easily and securely by pulling the tab at the end . The hinge feels sturdy and gives enough resistance to control what you & # 8217 ; re doing .	1
These are a vast improvement in functionality over a cheaper set of tongs I had . I also have a barbecue set with some tongs that are so large as to be nearly useless . These work much better for turning things on the grill . They are sturdy and well made .	1
I have 4 pairs of these and could not cook without them . For grilling , sauteing , tossing pasta and salads , or grabbing a piece of food from between the grates of the range , they are indispensible .	1
I 've had these tongs for two years . I probably use them every day and I love them . They are stainless steel and so far do not have a spec of rust anywhere . The rubberized grip make them easy to use and gives me a good cool place to grab hold of if I accidentally leave them sitting in the skillet . They lock closed for storage , which is also a very nice feature . I actually got them as part of a 10-piece utensil set and this is my favorite piece from the set .	1
Easy to use and extremely useful for grilling ! A great Oxo product that does exactly what you want it to do - they 're easy to open and close and the longer reach is great for extra reach on our large grill and our smoker . I highly recommend these if you 're looking for longer tongs .	1
They are easy to use and are easy to open when you only have one hand . They are accurate to pick up small pieces .	1
These are a bit longer than my old ones which works well on the grill . No more cooked knuckles ! Quality product .	1
Ok people , they are tongs . Not much to say here . The design is simple . They are great for picking up and moving around hot food . I use them all the time for grilling out and they never get too hot to hold . After three years , they still show no signs of wear or rust.Recommended : Yes	1
We have owned these tongs for a while now and I can not find anything to complain about ! The handle ( s ) are very sturdy - allowing you to really get a good squeeze on something if it is heavy or slippery . The stainless steel always emerges from the dishwasher spotlessly clean and the `` locking '' mechanism allows these to be stored in the folded position , saving me a lot of cluttered drawer headaches ! Seriously , these would be good tongs at any price and at this price they are well worth the money spent .	1
I used to be a cook many moons ago , and was looking for some tongs that were of the same quality as commercial quality tongs . These are even better . The soft part on the handles keeps them from burning your hands and is great when you 're standing there holding them for any length of time . I find this size is perfect for all around tong needs . I use them to grill , to take bread or bread sticks off pans in the oven , remove baked potatoes from the oven , turning bacon , you name it . They 're also great for serving and they get a good grip on the food item and are easy to handle.I had one set of these already for years , and though they look like they did when I bought them I use them so much I wanted another pair so I did n't have to be constantly washing them . They go in the dishwasher nicely and lock in a closed position which is great if you 're limited on space.We have a fairly small kitchen , but if I had more space I 'd get a few more pairs of these .	1
I 'm sure everyone else has already reviewed the details of this product so let me instead assure you that these LAST . We use these on a daily basis ( though we do have two of the exact same kind for when we need to use two in a day ) and after 6 years of use they still work perfectly . I even `` misuse '' them by pulling them closed with my teeth if my other hand is occupied and have had no issues . We dishwash them all of the time - so often are these in the dishwasher that they have their own special `` spot '' .We cook and bake a lot in our house and these are undoubtedly the MOST used kitchen utensil we own , and still in perfect condition . What more is there to be said ? Well done Oxo !	1
I love these tongs . OXO makes wonderful products , they are ergonomic so they are n't hard to use . These are heaven sent . The rubber handles keeps you from burning your hands when you accidently leave them in a hot skillet or on a hot stove . They also lock , which is a nice feature for when you want to put them away . I love this tool . You can sautee with these , use them while tossing pasta or salad , or when you need to move a hot lid . I ca n't say enough nice things about these tongs , I use mine every day .	1
We have the 9 inch and 12 inch ; love them both . Accidentally bought the 9 inch originally with silicone at the grasping portion ; it could not pick up much . This work as desired . Used for the grill , oven , and stovetop .	1
OXO makes good gear and this set of tongs is both comfortable and built well . The plastic handle keeps the end from getting too hot when stirring pasta or other work where it 's exposed to heat for a long time.I use this for frying , stirring , turning , tossing , grabbing , and find able to handle it all . I have used these types of tongs for years , and the plastic handle is a nice addition . So is the locking tab that keeps them closed for storage . The smart additions make this gadget even more convenient to use .	1
oxo tongs , good quality for a china product . grip feels good in hand and works smoothly as i expected from a cooks country rating .	1
I 've got several sets of these - a few in each kitchen , camping gear , etc . These are well built and just work .	1
I needed some extra long tongs for working in a soup pot without getting burned . they work very well . I am pleased .	1
I got these cause I already own some OXO stuff . Was not disappointed . It 's stainless . Got that nice rubbery grip . The lock holds . It does n't feel chintzy of cheaply made . I 've grilled with it , scooped veggies out of pots with it , served with it , made nervous clicking noises with it and yes , I pinched the better half 's bottom with it . In case you 're wondering , Better Half prefers the tongs to the salad tongs !	1
Holds well and sticks to metal great value	1
I really love these . They really are all-purpose . You can use them for chip bags , notes on the fridge , or just about anything else you may need a clip for . I like the heavy plastic because cheaper versions tend to break it there is too much tension .	1
We recently ordered and received another batch of these high-performance clips from Oxo . We already had a set from years back . I came to write a review and started scanning reviews and was startled at how many less-than-fair star ratings are accumulating and read them . Well , almost all are of the nature of `` you can buy binder clips for less '' and one is from a consumer who was unhappy that the clips would not support kitchen TOWELS , another unhappy because they roll their snack bags and the clips could n't accommodate the `` girth '' of the roll , if you will . DO N'T be concerned about purchasing these clips , just look forward to receiving them.. they would make a nice small gift or a great little addition to a gift basket , we 've had the first set for more than four years and they still look NEW , their grip is still secure , they brighten up the kitchen , they are easy to use , I 've never had to clean them except for occasional `` wipe-off '' , we already have our second set purchased very recently and they are just as outstanding as the old ones , let me put it this way : The OLD ones are EQUAL to the NEW ones in EVERY way ... how many times can you say that about an additional purchase of a favored item ? ? Buy without remorse , concern or guilt . Especially if you prefer kitchen items that cheer up you and your kitchen rather than binder clips ( which I despise unless forced to use binder clips for an inch or more of paper , I 've been `` snapped '' by them countless times and furthermore they 're not intended for kitchen use where moisture could occur ( i.e. , rust ) , also small children ca n't handle binder clips easily and the smaller ones could pose a problem..esp . for toddlers.I 'm not for binder clips in the kitchen ) . If there were a higher rating than five-stars I would give the highest rating possible to this product . I just do n't like to see product ratings that are low due to unrelated issues of the product .	1
These clips are excellent . They wo n't change your life , but they 're extremely handy . They are quite well-made . They last , and they maintain a tight grip rather than losing their & quot ; spring & quot ; after repeated use . Also , the relatively wide and flat surface on the business end does a better job than most alternatives at holding closed a wide-mouthed bag of pretzels , chips , etc . The bright colors are also attractive , and the fact that they double as refrigerator magnets is a nice twist .	1
I just love these things ! I have had this set for about 4 years and not one has broken . I use them for chips as well as freezer items.Another feature that I enjoy is not having to dig through a kitchen drawer to find them since they stick to the fridge . *******Update 11/07/08After 4 years I still have three of the 4 clips . Only one has broken and since they stick to the fridge I have not even lost one of the clips . This to me is impressive !	1
*****OXO Clips are great . They are sturdy , virtually unbreakable , and have magnets on them so that you can stick them to the refrig , or they 'll stick together in a part of your drawer.I use them for everything . I 've stopped using those chip clips which slide off , and you also have to fiddle with them to get them on . Someone mentioned Binder Clips ... yes , but they are harder to get on and off , ugly , and very tight ; sometimes you want a clip that holds things together well but does n't crush them -- -this is hard to explain , but I 'll just say that I find the amount of tension on the OXO Clips ideal.OXO makes easy-to-use real handy products , and I have never been disappointed in any of them . At this price , you can afford to try the clips out . You 'll probably want to buy more . Then you can use yellow for chips , red for cereal , blue for ... well , you get the picture ... if you want to get really organized and have fun , too ... ( I 'm not that organized ) .Great buy . *****	1
The magnets are handy , and you can fit a bunch in a small space .	1
These are very secure and never bend or get out of shape . I 've bought several packs and have had some of them for years .	1
Since getting my first item from OXO Good Grips ( the potato masher ) , I have become obsessed with this brand . I intend to replace some of my crappy utensils and end up with mostly items by this brand . They are ergonomic and high quality items . This cheese slicer is just perfect .	1
I have bought several OXO products in the past . OXO makes the best products and this slicer is no exception . `` UPDATE '' This cheese cutter wire has pulled out of it 's pinned hole in the handle . I was using it on Mozzarella cheese for pizza . The roller fell out along with the pin that held the wire in place . The design stinks . Since I bought it 2012 I have used it approx . once a month in my home kitchen .	1
I have been searching for a good can opener for years now . It 's amazing how many subpar can openers there are out there . Part of the problem is that I have arthritis . While most everyday tasks do n't give me trouble , using a can opener does . I 've looked and looked for both manual and electric can openers that are easy for me to operate and I 'm happy with this locking can opener.It 's really easy to use and the locking mechanism keeps the pressure on the handles and makes it easy for me to twist the crank around and open the can . I see that others have had the locking mechanism break , I really hope I get lucky with mine . This is a very well designed can opener that makes a big difference in the kitchen for me .	1
This is probably the best can opener I 've ever had - and I 've tried many . ( Ran a slide of a swabbed electric can opener through a microscope in nursing school , and have been grossed out by electric ones ever since ! ) I 've had it for about a year , and it has held up to frequent use , dishwashing , and children . Very easy to use . I like the lock and the turn mechanism on the side . A good , solid product .	1
I 'm at a loss to understand the negative reviews of this product here on Amazon . I 've had one for two or three years now , and I think it 's one of the best kitchen tools I ever bought . It 's lightweight , small enough to store easily , comfortable , easy to use , and I even like the sound it makes when it 's slicing through a can top . And the locking mechanism means I do n't have to keep squeezing while I turn the easily-grasped turning knob.This thing is well-designed and well-constructed . I 'd recommend it to anyone .	1
This can opener has been terrific ! It is easy to place on the can and turns very easily . This is so much better than any electric can opener I have owned and I do n't think it can be compared to other manual can openers I have used . I was a bit skeptical about this can opener , but I am glad I made the investment . It was time to get a new can opener and I bought the right one.This is the first manual can opener I have ever liked . I can just put it on the can , squeeze , turn and unlock when the can is open . Other manual can openers I have used seem to need precision when placing them on the can , but not this one . It turns smoothly and without much effort . I like the fact that it locks and I do n't have to keep squeezing . I would recommend this one especially for anyone who needs a can opener that is easy and simple to use .	1
I love this can opener . I live in a rural area and use A LOT of canned goods . I had bought this same one about 12 years ago and the twisty handle finally broke off . I had to buy the same exact one becasue I love how easy it makes opening a can . I would recomend this can opener to all .	1
I bought this for my daughter 's birthday , because she had been laughing about breaking so many dollar store can openers . She likes it , and says it works about as well as my Pampered Chef clean edge can opener . I prefer this design because you do n't end up with sharp edges on your can lids , thus reducing the chances of cut fingers .	1
We used this can opener at my cousin 's house , and ordered one as soon as we got home . My wife uses it , primarily , to open pet food cans for our dogs and cat . We have tried electric and mechanical can openers , none of which worked very well . This one is great . It opens any can we 've tried it on without missing a beat .	1
Bought mine in 2006 , after I got tired of can openers that did that twist thing where they dent and mangle but do not fully open the can . That was a great choice . This can opener is still going strong in 2011	1
I have gone through many can openers and this one seems to be holding up very well so far ! I like the locking mechanism , it makes can opening easier !	1
Works well and does not require the hand strength of a giant to get the job done -- what more need be said ?	1
This opener is really easy to use and it works very well . I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 since I do n't know how long it will last . ( I 've had really bad luck buying can openers lately -- one refused to work when I brought it home from the store . )	1
The OXO measuring cups impressed me at first sight as they include a 1/3 cup measure which is so often neglected in sets that focus on 1/4 , 1/2 , 3/4 , and the full measure always leaving you to guess at how much you need to put in . I like the plastic construction which does not give my ingredients a metallic taste like conventional aluminum cups can . These clean up easy and the handles are coated allowing for an easy and secure grip even when your hands are wet . XOX makes a quality line of gadgets and if you are arthritic in any manner they are an excellent choice as they are engineered to fit the human hand comfortably and securely .	1
These tools are either a baker or a person who can not bake ... very easy to be used ... .	1
Knowing that you could spend hundreds of dollars on a corkscrew , you should n't expect any miracles from this gadget on the low end of the price scale . What you can expect , though , is a piece of hardware that does the job nicely.This little kitchen toy probably wo n't wow any of your more aesthetically-conscious friends , but it is n't an eyesore either . The unassuming all matte black design is more function than flash , with very subtly-textured wings and a soft-touch rubber handle common to most Oxo products.The base fits stably around the bottle 's mouth and the black screw , with its Teflon-coating , slides into the cork with ease . The handle turns smoothly and the wings effortlessly extract the entire cork in one sweep , requiring no tugging or twisting.If I were looking to improve the device , I would suggest the addition of a foil cutter- but at this price I 'm not complaining . My only real concern was that the handle 's shaft seems to be all plastic and bends just a little , which leaves a little doubt about durability.Overall this corkscrew is cheap , lightweight , and functions flawlessly . It 's ideal for anyone seeking their first corkscrew or a spare , say , for the picnic kit . At roughly $ 9 as of this writing , it will provide all the function you need and perhaps just a little more style and comfort than theubiquitous generic modelat the same price point . ***Note about the product picture : The product I received looks a little different than the picture Amazon provides . The product I received has a cut-out window so you can see the cork coming out . The wings are also slightly smaller and do not wrap all the way around as pictured . I have uploaded an alternate picture for reference .	1
My lady friend got me a couple of these recently as summertime presents because I am such a klutz with corks , and now I am becoming quite a bon vivant . Credit due , as one of John LeCarre 's characters quips in `` The Russia House '' , to the winged corkscrew . Even with friends over , I now actually look like I know what I am doing regardless of the fact that I am not much of a wine drinker or one to stand on ceremony or table manners . Give me some corn on the cob and a steak and I am as likely to rip into them with both hands than to use proper utensils and observe standard table manners.But even I must now admit I am being slowly and surely civilized , at least within tolerable operating limits . And chief among the convenient and effortless gadgets I have been given to speed me on my way is this terrific little winged corkscrew . Buy yourself a couple , though . When your friends ' wives see how well they transform even the most hopeless of confirmed mountain men into well behaved and handy hosts , they may not be able to resist swiping one . Enjoy !	1
Bought this to replace my all metal winged corcksrew , which lasted more than 25 years ( I 've lost track ) and it does n't have the same solid feel . It does work , though , and because of the long tunnel that houses the screw itself , does draw out the cork in a more constant and predictable angle . I like that , but the jury is out as of yet to see how long the plastic parts hold up .	1
I 'm a big fan of most OXO products . This wine opener is not as slick as most OXO products I have . Mainly due to fact it is somewhat bulky and all the bulk is plastic - not sure how long this will survive banging around in my utensils drawer before plastic cracks . My other wine opener has much less plastic and has been very durable ( had for several years ) . In terms of actually opening wine , the OXO works pretty well - fairly easy and straightforward to get cork out of wine bottle though sometimes OXO can guide down slightly crooked with occasional cork breaking off.Overall 3.5 stars for price / value , lower than my usual OXO rating . I prefer my other corkscrew I bought on Amazon for around same price.h	1
Because this is my first cork screw that I have owned that has n't been part of a swiss army knife , I was n't prepared for this little wonder . The OXO makes opening a bottle of wine or oil effortless . The plastic handle feels good in my hand and a few twists the cork easily slides out of the bottle.Just as an additional praise for this corkscrew , I bring this with me when I go over to people 's houses just in case a need might be found . I try not to be `` that guy '' but when your corkscrew looks this good it is hard not to demonstrate .	1
The Oxo Good Grips Winged Corkscrew is , indeed , easy to use . The nonstick coating on the screw makes it easy to slide into the cork and the knob is wide and easy to grasp . The levers on the side make for easy cork removal.We own several corkscrews and exercise them regularly , but the Oxo is easier to use than its more expensive counterparts , so at the moment it 's our choice.I have read the more critical reviews here that say that this particular product breaks easily . I can only suggest that buyers retain their sales receipt in case of breakage , since Oxo does offer replacement or refund . So far we 've had no need of that .	1
I love salads and this salad spinner allows me to dry my greens after a good wash.Its easy push button top allows you yo hug your spinner then jam on the breaks.It is fast becoming my favorite kitchen tool .	1
wow this is a truly amazing salad spinner . it keeps washed leaves fresh & crisp for a long time ( 5 days is the longest ive tried before eating them ) . usually , we would try different ways of washing & storing lettuce but even after 2 days it would get soggy & brownish . this makes eating salad into an easy meal . no more washing and towel-drying the salad . this gets it pretty dry after like 3 cycle-brake sets.my mom has even started using it to store cilantro ( which she always complained about it going bad too fast previously ) . so this has totally increased the salad consumption in our household ( & we are mostly vegetarian ! ) . now its fun to try making new dressings each time.oh yeah , before i forget , slice avocado in your salad !	1
Years , and years ago my Daddy who was a fantastic gardener gave me a fantastic salad spinner , but after many , many spins it gave out . I bought at least three spinners after that -- all went to the dump . Cook 's Ilustrated Test Kitchen recommended the Oxo Salad Spinner and I love Cook 's for their testing -- they really are the Consumer Reports of the cooking world -- and it lived up to their ratings . I expect to have this spinner working for me the rest of my life .	1
If you are a Salad Lover , this device saves you A HEAP OF TIME washing and wicking away remaining moisture in seconds , so that your salad is readied for serving , crisp & dry . There is nothing worse than the drip drip of wet salad , with the run-off diluting the dressing ( and runny dressing running down your chin ) .The inner bowl doubles as a strainer and the outer bowl is useful for soaking/ washing fruits & vegetables . The rubberised palm operated ( press down ) spinner button , is effortlessly activated with a gentle `` palm-down press '' and locks into the bowl with the flick of a switch for easy storage . If desired this can be brought to a picnic and the salad can be served there in as well.A little expensive when I bought it even on special BUT Very Recommended . Will last for years .	1
This is a GREAT salad spinner that does all the work for you - I would highly recommend it ! Not only is it a spinner , but it is a serving bowl as well .	1
I love this salad spinner . It is much sturdier than the ones I 've used in the past . It spins well and really gets the water off . I like that the handle collapses so I can use this as the lid in the refrigerator . I was concerned about the extra cost ( compared to ones I 've purchased in the past ) , but the quality is well worth the price , and I expect this one will last much longer . It definitely does a better job !	1
One of the best things I have noticed about this salad spinner is the way the base clings to the work surface when you spin the basket . The color brightens up our kitchen , and it 's fun to use .	1
Very easy to use with the push vs cranking spinner . I also like that it has a & # 34 ; brake & # 34 ; . Easy to clean .	1
I read several reviews on which one to go with and decided to give this one a try . Buy this one it is excellent and I love it .	1
My ancient salad spinner finally gave out , so I decided it was time to upgrade . So glad I did , the push button is way easier than the crank handle thing I use to have . No complaints .	1
I truly love the functionality of this ! It has worked great for the last few years , though mine has changed from the pretty white to a dingy beige yellow on the top , like so many plastics . So , I 'll try the green and hope the color does n't change noticeably !	1
This item really does the job it dries the salad items so that the dressing sticks and does not become watery . Great price and fast service .	1
does n't get up to super speed , but does the job and has alot of capacity .	1
Cool gadget , but kind of a luxury item for a cook who already has it all . It takes up lots of cabinet space , but you could use the bowl as a mixing bowl too .	1
Wonderful salad spinner . Very easy to use , gets the job done quickly . Does take up a little room to store ( I 'm always short on cabinet space ) but at least it looks great sittin ' on the counter !	1
It is a wonderful salad spinner . I like the large size . I also like the bowl under it , I rinse the veggies in the bowl and then dump them in the basket to spin .	1
Bought this as a birthday present and the recipient said she loves it . Gave it 5 stars because I have not heard anything bad about it from her .	1
At this time , I have not used my new & # 34 ; OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner & # 34 ; . I 'm sure it will be great .	1
This is a perfect size for a few salads . It holds more than I thought it would . It is very efficient at getting the water out of the greens . It is also nice and small to store .	1
Why did I wait so long to get one of these ? It 's one of my favorite pieces of equipment and I use it a lot . Well-designed and easy to use and clean .	1
Great salad spinner . Very easy to use . Although it is plastic , it seems very durable . A big fan of OXO products .	1
This salad spinner is the perfect size for 2 people . It 's easy to use , and the button can stay down to store it in tighter spaces . All the pieces are lightweight and easy to clean .	1
I have been using this spinner for about 6 mos at least once a week . I had a smaller spinner that would not hold a head of romaine lettuce . A spinner any smaller than the OXO would not hold a head of romaine or green leaf lettuce . It does an excellent job of spinning the water out , much better than my old crank style one.As far as peoples reports about the pointy thing on the bottom breaking off ... I am to this day still trying to understand how they could break it off , unless they are stacking glass bowls or something inside it . My son the resident dishwasher that has broken lots of stuff has not broken this yet so I would have to say its pretty durable . I dont stack anything inside it .	1
Great salad spinner . The 4-year old can operate it without it spinning off the counter . It can process a lot of greens at one time .	1
We love salad and have been using our OXO salad spinner for over 4 years . In that time it has stood up to the abuse of having the plunger pushed as fast as humanly possible by both the kids and Dad . We have dropped the bowl several times and the various nicks and scratches have not been fatal to overall performance.It does its job well . We love buying a fresh head of romaine to cut up and spin for our salad . It seems so much more economical and tasty than the pre-packaged lettuce.We also find that the strainer acts as a handy colander in a pinch .	1
I used to wash by hand then swing the greens in a towel to dry them.This is nice to be able to remove the liner , wash the greens in the liner , then place it in the spinner to spin them dry .	1
Does exactly what it is made to do and does it well , spins enough salad for 4 people at a time . Easy to clean and efficient . If you are wondering if this is something you would use ; if you eat salad greens or want fruit dried quickly you will use it often . I did n't buy one for 2 years wondering if its something that would just sit and never be used now its used often . Feels like an essential item . This was also rated by Americas Test Kitchen 2012 as the best salad spinner .	1
This is our second spinner of this type . The first one got in the hand of our 2 yr old and lost the battle , but since it worked great before we made a purchase of another one .	1
I saw this one at my sister 's house . Tried it , loved it . Bought it here and it came right to my door within a couple of days . I saw it at my local Target store for the same price . So , if you do n't want to drive to your local Target store . Buy it here , it costs the same and you save time .	1
I 've had other salad spinners and this one is far better . Very easy to use and effective , the brake is a great feature . I like mine so much I purchased one for my mother as well .	1
In the summer , I grow lots of lettuce in my garden . This spinnermakes it easier to clean and prepare salads everyday.Easy to use and clean .	1
This is good for both washing veggies as well as drying them . Safe , easy and fun for kids to help out with in the kitchen . I find the large size useful for getting the water out of small laundry items too.Does n't have the stupid string to break .	1
Good spinner but like so many of them , once it gets spinning it can move around a bit on a counter . You have to hold it still or put on a dish towel . I like that you can easily take the lid apart in one motion to wash the inside of the lid . I am not a fan of the brake button as I believe it causes the plastic to wear and eventually get into your salad . I just spin it and let it stop on it 's own.Overall , it 's just what I expected . My last one wore out after several years . This one seems to have been improved since the last one so I am mostly happy with it . OXO makes solid products and nothing lasts forever .	1
What can I say that has not already been said . I purchased the Mini because I have limited cabinet space and usually am cooking for 2 or less . This thing is amazing , works like a charm . I only wish that you could by additional strainers so I could use as temporary storage while I am spinning something else . I 'm really glad I opted for the Mini and will likely buy a second one . The size is perfect and holds more than what you 'd probably anticipate from the picture . Amazon offers a great priced compared to other retailers on this ( unless you get a 30 % coupon at Kohls ) .	1
I received this as a gift and was initially tempted to return it based on past poor experiences with salad spinners . Very glad that I kept it -- it works well and is very easy to use . Rather than have to turn a knob or pull a string , all you need to do is push down on the plunger a couple of times and you 're done.I have several other Oxo products and they all share the same attention to the little details that make the product better . With the salad spinner , the plunger can be locked in the down position to make it easier to store . Also there 's a brake ( a simple button ) that stops the spinning so you do n't have to wait for it to stop on its own.This would also be a good choice for someone with limited hand/grip strength . It 's a lot easier to push down on a plunger than grasp a knob or pull a string.Highly recommend !	1
I bought this when it came on a gold box deal shortly after I had had a party and my salad had been diluted with all the water that had remained on the red romaine lettuce I was using . Aggravated for the last time , I was very happy to see this come on a gold box offer . It 's small for a larger leaf lettuce such as romaine , but I tore it up in smaller pieces and away it went . It 's so easy my three-year-old figured it out before I did ! This is a great purchase but I 'm also going to get the larger one to do larger leaf lettuce . I love this thing !	1
I love the mini version of this salad spinner . It holds enough greens for a couple of dinner salads , works very well , and it 's easy to store because of the smaller size . Mine has been going strong for a couple of years . I love it for washing and drying herbs from the garden in the summer .	1
Easy to work and clean . love this spinner . would recommend to anyone . Very easy to assemble and take care of .	1
This thing works and works well . One of my better purchases from Amazon . It gets all the water off after washing it and I found it is very easy to clean after each use .	1
I have always washed my salad greens and shook them out in a dishcloth -- this works fine but the salad spinner is definitely a convenience tool . What I like about it -- I can put a whole container of lettuce in the basket , rinse it , spin it , use what I need and store the rest in the fridge . Depending on the type of lettuce , it generally needs about 3 spins . I empty the water left in the bowl after spinning , but I think leaving the water on the bottom might keep the salad crisper . I do n't think it really makes a difference . It keeps for days and I just re-rinse and re-spin when I need more . The lettuce is kept perfectly crisp and fresh . There really is n't anything I dislike -- it is big , but it fits on the bottom shelf of our fridge and it stores nicely in our pantry when not in use . I thought it might be too big for 2 people , but it is n't . I am sure the smaller one would work just as well and I may get that for herbs or veggies . A very handy tool , and not a gimmick .	1
This is perfect . I grow plants such as lettuce in the back yard and want to be sure they are clean so I soak the leaves first in the large bowl before washing them and draining into the colander . Then into the spinner . I have had a spinner before , but with a crank , but this is so much better . The spin is powerful . If I want to be sure all the water is out , I may toss the lettuce around a bit one more time within the colander and spin again . This sure beats using a towel as I had been doing ! Also , the brake works well , and the top comes apart for a thorough cleaning . The material is sturdy . I think it 's a great buy . And I 'm glad I bought the larger size .	1
GREAT SALAD SPINNER ! I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU DO N'T HAVE TO MANUALLY SPIN IT ... JUST PUSH THE BUTTON AND IT DOES ALL THE WORK . IT ALSO HAS A VERY NICE CLEAN LOOK .	1
I have the mini version of this salad spinner . I would not actually use the term `` mini '' to describe it , since it does hold a lot of lettuce . It will hold a whole small head of leaf lettuce ( chopped , of course ) when packed full , which makes enough for two big plates of salad ( or probably 4 small side salads ) . I like that it is smaller in size ( not clumsy or hard to handle , takes minimal storage space ) , has nonskid bottom , really dries lettuce well , is easy to operate and even has a brake to stop the spinning . I just rinse it off when done ( easy for quick weeknight dinners ) . I like the operation of this product ( push down ) better than the large Zyliss spinner that I own that has a pull-string . The small Oxo spinner is also great for drying blueberries .	1
Works great with salad and larger items such as : fruits and vegetables .	1
In our house , I might do most of the cooking , but my wife is the Salad Queen . She loves salads , and loves making them . She did n't like to buy anything but bagged greens because she said that the cost savings were canceled out by the `` quality '' of bagged products , and the lack of effort . Now that she 's been using this salad spinner for a while , she admits that she was missing out , all along.This thing is easy -- EASY -- to use , and easy to clean . We buy some greens , prep them , spin them , make a salad , and leave the rest in the spinner , in the fridge . My wife agrees that the freshness , crispness , and flavor of non-bagged lettuce or spinach makes it almost impossible to think about going back to her `` bagged days '' . The leftover greens also last much longer than the bagged goods . Leaving flavor out of the equation , this item paid for itself in two weeks ( we eat a lot of salad ) .If you eat a lot of salad : Just buy it .	1
After several years , this was on sale for $ 17.99 so I finally made the leap and this makes cleaning sandy Chinese greens much less stressful and wastes less water . This product should be marketed to the Chinese diaspora . Frankly , everyone in Asia needs to be introduced to this product . I do n't use it as much as I would like because I do n't eat as many vegetables as I ought to do.Another use for this is as a cake dome ! That means I do n't buy the Anchor Hocking Savannah nor the Wilton Cake Dome Pedestal . What a good deal this salad spinner is .	1
You ca n't beat this jewel ! It 's durable , easy to use , easy to clean , and it does a great job . Like any other salad spinner , hold it steady with your free hand while it is spinning . That 's all . . .nothing to it ! To clean it afterward , I usually just rinse out the bowl and strainer and let them air dry . But once every few days or so , I might put them in the sink with soapy water for a real wash. You wo n't regret getting this kitchen staple !	1
I 've only used it a few times so far but it spins well and fast . It 's nice that the pump top collapses down for storage and the brake button is nice too . If you spin it empty it seems to have a slight wobble but that may not mean anything at all because it seems to be perfectly fine for spinning lettuce . Also it works great for leftover salad storage in the fridge because the water at the bottom is kept away from the leaves and they will stay fresher much longer.This is one of our favourite kitchen items because even though it is very bulky and takes up a significant amount of storage space , we think it is well worth having especially since we have a salad at dinner probably every other day .	1
This is the best salad spinner that I have ever owned . It is a little pricier than others , but as the saying goes ... '' You get what you pay for . ''	1
I saw a salad spinner used on America 's Test Kitchen , checked to see what they recommended , and bought this one . I 've used it a lot and recommend it to all my friends and family who help me cook when we get together . Once they use it they are just as impressed as I am .	1
This is without a doubt the one of the best , and I 've actually tried a few . I 've had mine for four years now and it still WORKS as good as the day I bought it . Never mind comments about it being too bulky ( smaller versions are available ) . If you make a lot of salads , this is a must have . It 's sturdy and wrings salad dry within 1-2 spins . Most importantly , no awlful hand cranks that can brake off . For this kind of quality , it 's worth every penny .	1
This is a good product for drying out vegetables . It takes much less time to spin this than to pat lettuce dry . I only use it when I am making large amounts of salad because it is big and takes up a lot of room on my counter.I would buy it again and recomend it for people eating a lot of salads .	1
I really like the way you can use the spinner without having the bear hug it to hold it down . No water on the counter is also nice .	1
No other salad spinner compares . I want the smaller model as well . Both can be used for other things such as spining the seeds out of tomatoes ( yes , you do have to cut them first ) .	1
I wanted this for so long , but did n't want to find a place in my kitchen to store it . I finally purchased it on a carefree whim and then when I bought my first bag of romaine bunches and had to clean them , I could n't wait to try this . I LOVED IT . I always hated washing salad and waiting forever for the leaves to dry enough to put it away . This takes all that misery away . Plus , I then store the salad in it and it is perfect . Still a bit costly , but it should last a long , long time . Now , if only I liked salad more ...	1
Should wash all veggies from the supermarket , even if the bagged salads say they are pre-washed . This spinner does a great job . And , the outer bowl becomes your salad bowl . Very versatile .	1
Even if you just need to dry your socks this works fantasitcally ! It washes , dries and stores well . Get it !	1
This is the second one we 've bought ( the first was disassembled by our kiddo ) and love it just as much . Great product .	1
This one was a gift , but I have an identical one ( although not green ) . I use it all the time , and it works wonderfully . It 's a bit bulky to store , but I especially love it during the summer when I 'm getting lots of fresh greens in my CSA share . I wash them and dry them in this , and then I store them in this in the refrigerator . It works perfectly as a crisper in the fridge , and keeps greens fresh and crisp up to two weeks , which is kind of amazing . I love this thing .	1
My husband and I do lots of cooking and had an OXO salad spinner for years . It finally gave out and we replaced it with a salad spinner from another & # 34 ; trusted brand name & # 34 ; . It broke within a week , the spin was so weak it did n't remove any moisture whatsoever . I found this brand new and slightly restyled OXO and bought it immediately . The OXO spins lettuce , cabbage , spinach quickly and easily . With the new clear bowl you can see how much water is coming off of the freshly leaves .	1
I like it , that 's why I gave it 5 stars . I will not be doing these ratings anymore because you 're required to make comments even when all you want to do is give a star rating . Unless of course I want to make people aware of a bad product.So if you do n't see my name that means I liked it . If I do n't like it you will see me bitch .	1
I 've held off on buying this for a long time because I had a hard time parting with $ 30 for a plastic bowl . I 'm so glad I purchased it finally . As you would expect from OXO , it 's very well made . OXO always has the best products -- definitely the best value . The top handle makes the bowl spin fast so the lettuce dries in no time . It even has a little break to stop the bowl from spinning . The large bowl is the perfect size for a bag of lettuce .	1
I love this salad spinner , it spins really fast and does the best drying job of any others I have tried	1
I am anti-gadgets having discovered in the past I use them once or twice , and then I forget I have them or they do n't work very well , and end up taking up valuable space.After rave reviews , I finally caved and bought the salad spinner . This is a FABULOUS kitchen tool . It really spins the salad leaves well with minimal effort . I now use it every time I have salad . NO MORE WET SALAD ! In addition , there are multiple uses with the bowl . Serve your salad in it , store your salad in it , etc .	1
We used cord pull spinners for years . My wife loves this one . Uses one in one home and bought this one for the winter snowbird place so we have used it for quite a while .	1
Reading over some recent reviews I ca n't believe the belly aches . `` Does n't fit easily in the dishwasher '' . Who puts a salad spinner in the dishwasher ? Just rinse the lettuce bits off and let it air dry . `` Does n't spin very fast '' . How fast do you need a salad spinner to go ? If you ca n't get the Oxo Good Grips salad spinner to spin fast enough to dry lettuce you are either over-filling it or you ca n't pump the easy ergonomic handle for some reason . This unit is well designed and comfortable to use . Why do I give it only 4 stars ? After about 3 years the spinning mechanism on the lid came apart on mine . I was able to snap it together but it periodically comes apart . The act of pushing down hard on the mechanism over and over is just tough on a relatively cheap plastic object . All salad spinners have some variant of this problem , though . Pull cord ones get tangled or rotted cords . Crank ones wear out their gears . Go with the Good Grips - they 're easy on the hands .	1
This thing really does work great . Keeps salad clean and fresh . The plastic will have some staining over time but does n't effect the use of the product . I would buy another any time I needed one . The top pump part does lock down for easier storage .	1
It 's rare that you get a product that exceeds your expectations . This is one of those cases.I make a lot of salads and was really getting tired of waiting for the lettuce to dry . This thing spins so fast and for so long after a few pushes of the button , it 's amazing . I took out my Arugula and spinach , and could n't believe how dry it was . the amount of water I poured out that had been removed was impressive.Honestly , it 's great to see a product do what it 's supposed to do , so well	1
I spent a long time buying bagged lettuce that seemed to go rotten the second I opened it . Finally fed up , I got this salad spinner and have n't looked back . You can fit a lot of lettuce in this and it keeps fresh for a good few days before it needs to be eaten . I 've definitely already saved more by buying lettuce heads and using this than the icky bagged stuff . Oxo makes great products and this is no different .	1
Glad I took the advice of other reviewers , this is a definitely a well made spinner . I am eating more salads now than ever . I am very satisfied and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a good salad spinner . Easy to use and clean . I also store my leftover salad right in the bowl in the fridge and it stays nice and fresh .	1
I purchased my Oxo Good Grips Salad Spinner some time in 2008 and even after 5 years of use , the salad spinner looks and works like it was new . Operation is simple enough - just toss the wet salad in the basket , put the lid on , and let the kids push the large button until the salad is dry . The unit is easy to take apart and clean ( it really only requires a quick rinse ) . Highly recommended !	1
I love having cut fresh lettuce around for salads and things , and soaking it in water makes the lettuce really crisp , so then I use the spinner to dry and store it , and it works perfectly . It 's very sturdy , but I used the bowl as a mixing bowl once and the inside got lots of visible scratches . Also , the top does n't come apart , and a piece of lettuce got stuck in there and I any get it out , or find any way to wash between the two pieces . It comes apart somewhat , but not completely .	1
I bought my spinner from Amazon in 2003 for not too much less than they cost now . It has been well worth it because I 've used it a lot during that time.My greens get much drier with this than they do using a colander and towel . It makes the salads much more pleasant to eat . I 've also used this to store washed salad in the refrigerator .	1
We 've had three different salad spinners in the last 10 years . We gave two of them away - they did n't break , they were just too hard to use.My husband ordered this one and at first I was frustrated that he ordered it without asking me . I know , control freak but it is my kitchen . ; - ) I 'm really glad he did . It is so much easier to use than the other ones we had . There is an enclosed water trapper bowl . Some other models have holes in the bottom for the water to drain out as you spin . The problem is that they leak if you do n't have it over the sink . We like to soak the lettuce in a full bowl of water before spinning.The spinner knob locks down for storage and the entire unit comes apart for quick rinsing . The knob is a comfortable rubber ( like most Oxo products ) .Highly recommended for rinsing and drying lettuce and other vegetables . Not recommended for drying socks .	1
Works great , better than other salad spinners I have had , my only wish is that it had a stainless or glass bowl because the plastic gets etched after a while and just wo n't ever look clean again.update 12/17/2012 - I still use this all the freaking time . Every day almost . It works great . The clear plastic has gotten foggy looking , but I do n't care .	1
Have n't yet used it much but it seems very well built and like it will do the job . Very pleased . The only drawback with this is that I bought the smaller one , not sure in hindsight if it will be big enough , I think if your into more of the faddish greens that are out in the last few years and only want salads for one or two it would be fine . However if your breaking up a head lettuce ( I know , not in fashion now , supposedly not as healthy as others ) , it may be too small to do it all at once . I love my iceberg but am slowly accepting more romaines , leafy others too . Time will tell .	1
I own the larger version of this Salad Spinner and decided I would like the smaller version as well.This little salad spinner works very well for smaller kitchen tasks . I am very pleased with it . Very simple to use and easy to clean.It makes preparing salad greens a simple task	1
I purchased this replacement after considering other brands -- saw that the pullstring types etc had mixed reviews . I have to say that the original which lastedme 8+ years until someone threw the bowl in the dishwasher , was fantastic.The only con was the fact that the dishwasher destroyed the bowl which cracked up.Guess my children might have sat on it and broken it etc also , was considering thestainless steel version , but fell in love with this versions looks , and the handylight weight feel.To describe this version , the outside bowl is clear , the inside colander and alltrim are green . Very pleasant to look at vs the clinical clear , black and white looksof the original . It is beautifully designed with a non- slip base , a lock so that the pop uphandle which you press down to spin can be locked down for storage , and a buttonto stop the spin immediately with a brake . All features identical to the old version .	1
It is absolutely amazing how much water rinses from the lettuce . No more drying lettuce on papertowels or awkward tastes from residual water . This not only provides a bowl for rinsing the lettuce , but also comes with a handy flat lid for storing it as well and everything is plastic so it does not discolor the lettuce between uses . Great clear bowl for also serving the salad too !	1
I bought this to replace a KitchenAid spinner . The models work with the pump , so they seem to & # 34 ; dry & # 34 ; the greens comparably.The pluses to the OXO vs. the Kitchen Aid are that : - Takes up less space , while holding a similar amount of greens- Is SOO much more attractive- It does n't have a center support , so it is easier to clean and use ( the basket is just a slotted bowl , while the spinning mechanism is part of the lid ) - It is more dishwasher friendlyOverall , I really enjoy this spinner and use it all of the time . A spinner is definitely something that you think is weird gadget , until you get one and then you find you use it all of the time .	1
I have several OXO products so when I purchased this , I expected a great product . I was not disappointed . It spins the water out of my salad preparations with minimal effort by me . The pump action is easy to use . It is easy to clean and you can store your lettuce in the container , as well .	1
We had the original Oxo spinner for years but it was lost in the recent Sandy storm in NJ . We reordered our old favorite and were surprised to receive this new model . It 's more stoutly constructed than before and the shape is a little different , making the moisture extraction more efficient . Best of all it 's a lot easier to clean the top . All to often improvements to a successful product are anything but ; this is a happy exception .	1
I eat salads daily for lunch . Salads are easy to pack ... Easy to control calories ... Etc . I noticed no matter how much I left the lettuce in the colander to dry it was always slightly moist and would be slimy when lunch time rolled around . Not any more ! This salad spinner does the trick to remove water from every nook and cranny . It is a decent size when cleaning salad for one or a group . It also works well as a serving bowl .	1
Spins easily , drains well and it doubles for holding the lettuce in over night after spinning . Sturdy made and is actually nice enough to pop on the table for dinner .	1
Again , I am amazed at the versatility of this spinner . I find that I can keep my salad GREEN and unspoiled for about 3 weeks . Still very good taste . Normally , am afraid of these things , because they usually promise more than they give , but believe you will love it . It even has a brake on it ! ! I find gentle pushing of the plunger on top is best . After reading some other ratings that others had trouble with breakage , I was a bit concerned , but all worries aside . You will LOVE it ! !	1
Really awesome product ! Especially with the little break button to stop the spinning almost instantly . Easy to disassemble and clean . My only reason for not giving full stars is because of the motor . It 's so big that it takes up quite a bit of space inside so you ca n't fit as much of whatever you 're spinning . If the design was made with the motor somehow built on the outside , it would be perfect !	1
I had one of the spinners that you had to crank , was tiring and slow . This spinner works very easily by pushing the button on top . My only complaint would be that it does n't completely dry the lettuce but it is dry enough to use .	1
Great product . But if you do not spin salads all the time , think about how much space you have . You kitchen can get full with all these extra products you only use once in a way .	1
I purchased this salad spinner to replace an old one that was falling apart . What an improvement ! I like the way this one does n't slide around on the counter when it 's in use . I love the `` push button '' operation -- much easier to use than cranking a handle on my previous spinner . Another advantage of this product is easy cleaning -- the top separates easily so it can be cleaned well , and it 's all fine for use in the dishwasher.I use it to clean cut-up vegetables in addition to salad greens -- great for soaking them and drying them thoroughly before roasting in the oven . It 's a great little product -- I 'd recommend it to anyone .	1
I like it more than any other brands . This one is my third one . I wish I pound get a bigger size to wash lettuce as well .	1
Love the convenience of putting salad greens in and spinning the water out . No more soggy salads.No more watered down dressings	1
I bought this salad spinner when the one I purchased at Target broke . It had a pull cord that jammed , so I was looking to avoid that feature . This one works great . I normally do two spins to be very thorough . I spin once , open it up , take out the basket , tip out any liquid , shake the lettuce in the basket , reassemble and spin once more . If you 're prepping a lot of greens , I recommendProgressive International LKS-06 Lettuce Keeperto store lettuce for a week+ . Also , this might just be me , but I 'm not totally comfortable using the bowl to serve from as others have described . I mean , are n't you spinning off water that is removing dirt and chemicals from the greens ? And are n't those chemicals and dirt thus being spun onto the sides of the bowl ? It would make a nice serving bowl , but I 'd probably wash it post spin and pre serve .	1
I have never owned or even used a salad spinner before , so I ca n't compare it with other brands . But , the Oxo Good Grips salad spinner was exactly what I wanted . I have eaten salad many times since purchasing it .	1
My wife bought this a while back , and my first thought was that this was a gimmick designed to part a fool from his money . But after using it to make a salad and then using it to preserve lettuce in airtight jars I can definitely speak for the value of a salad spinner . This thing has saved me a lot of time in trying to dry my lettuce before preserving it or using it in my salads . Looks like I was the fool for not believing in the hype , but this is well worth the small amount of money spent .	1
OK , it 's just a salad spinner , but this one has a different design from the type of spinner that you crank around . You push down on a large button and the basket spins rapidly . The button pops back up ; push down again to give the backet a longer ride . The action takes less effort than the crank type , and the rapid spin speed casts off almost all the water on the vegetables . Clever design , seems sturdy , works well .	1
Veggie people will love this . It is sturdy , very easy to use , and more effective at drying lettuce , etc . than any spinner I have owned . The bonus is you can use it to store in the frig and it keeps salad beautifully . Highly recommend .	1
She has used it for ( 3 ) years . No complaints from her lips to my ears . I do not know what else to say about a salad spinner .	1
My old salad spinners were cheap . What a difference a few dollars make ! It does the job extremely well -- it 's fast and effecient . This one is much easier to use . I love the stop feature and the rubberized footing that keeps it stable on the counter . Dishwasher safe and has a storage lid . What more could you want . I 've found that the greens keep well in the spinner when you line the basket with paper towels.I enthusiasticly recommend this product to anyone who needs a salad spinner .	1
I purchased this salad spinner because I moved , and no longer had a roommate to mooch from . It 's solidly constructed , and the brake feature is nice . This lets you stop the spinning with the push of a button , instead of sticking your hand in or waiting it out.I have 2 main concerns about this product though:1 . I wonder if the push down/gearing drive will last longer or shorter than the pull-string variety2 . It was a bit pricey for a plastic salad spinner ( 1/2 an Xbox game pricey ) Beyond that , now that I have it I 'm enjoying it and use it whenever I make salads .	1
I bought this salad spinner from Bed Bath & Beyond because it was cheaper . Got the `` Small '' size . It is big enough for 2 people , but takes relatively less space in the fridge.The quality of the product is super and it does the job well.I also use it when I blanch my greens before freezing . After taking the greens out of the ice water , just spin in the salad spinner for a few minutes to dry them and you 're ready to freeze !	1
I love to eat large dinner salads at least three times a week . But cleaning leaf lettuce and spinach is a bore ! And most greens really taste best when they are washed immediately before eating , not washed and stored in a big batch . I use the inner colander to rinse the leaves free of soil , and then have a blast centrifuging the leaves until they are just moist . It is a time and frustration saver for anyone who frequently prepares salad greens .	1
Never had a salad spinner before . This one is great.Never be without one again .	1
This spinner is the perfect size for either the single person or couple ; it fills my needs and compact kitchen and does a pretty good job with drying my salads and veggie greens . The only downside is that for twenty dollars ( $ 20+tax ! ! ! ) the plastic bowl feels rather flimsy and threatens to crack if not handled with care . I expected better quality from an Oxo product .	1
product is holding up well after tons of use . the spinner is easy to clean and also easy to store .	1
There 's a very good reason why this item has so many reviews and such a high rating - it works .	1
I love salad , especially green salad . These days you can not be too careful with the lettuce you purchase at the store . E-coli or salmonella seem to be a common concern.First of all you wan clean lettuce . You use this bowl , take lettuce leaves apart in bite size pieces , fill with water , insert lettuce , do n't crowd , swish round and then empty . If there is grit in the bottom , wash lettuce again . Then insert into spinner . You need at least three or four complete turns . Empty water , and then spin again to make sure all the waters gone . A good green salad uses only dry lettuce.Use three or four different lettuces for your salad . Clean them all . Make a large bunch , and then save some for the rest of the week . Wrap the greens in paper twel and place in a reveal able plastic bag . The lettuce will stay god for three or four days.Use a nice balsamic homemade dressing or use lemon , salt and pepper . Delicious ! Recommended . prisrob 06-10-13	1
Works well , good quality , I can use the bottom as a serving bowl . A bit too small for our five member family . Wish it came with a lid to take on potlucks .	1
Much bigger than I realized . If you have limited storage space consider a smaller model . I 'd probably have picked a collapsible model if i had another chance . Otherwise it is great .	1
I love this salad spinner . It works great , is low profile and easy to store and it looks fine in the kitchen . I was using a Pampered Chef salad spinner that cost almost 3x the money and it was n't nearly as easy to use . This spinner is wonderful . We eat fresh salad every day and could n't live without a salad spinner .	1
If you want to get a bit fancy with your salad spinning , this is the one to buy . Not only can you spin the lettuce and remove all the water , you can use the bowl to serve a salad or store lettuce in the inner bowl.It is so easy to use . You release the lock mechanism at the top and press down . The inner basket starts to spin , removing most of the water from the lettuce . I love the fact that you can rinse the lettuce in the removable inner basket.You really win with this one . Wash , spin , store ... so much less to wash and it is never boring . It is quite large so you do need a big space to store it in the refrigerator , unless you have a big refrigerator , then it is no problem.If you have memories of trying to swing lettuce around in a kitchen towel , or have tried to use paper towels while they are falling apart all over the lettuce , you must try spinning in this great salad spinner . Once you have spun the lettuce you can remove the inner bowl and dump out the water.~The Rebecca Review	1
I have avoided salad spinners for years because of past disappointments . But when the guys on Americas Test Kitchen made this one their first choice I decided to try again . Not sorry .	1
If you eat any greens , this salad spinner is a must have . It can fit a lot , is durable , good for storing washed lettuce , and easy to clean . I have had this salad spinner for a year now and have had no problems and bought one for my mother to use as well . I used to just wash and dry greens myself , which is time consuming and I could never get my greens dry enough , which kind of ruins the salad . This salad spinner makes preparing a salad so fast and really makes your greens so dry ! This is such a great product and I can not say enough good things about it ! ! Buy it !	1
I have never used a salad spinner before this one and never understood what was so special about them until recently . It just seemed like another lazy persons contraption , but then again I was buying bagged salad . Before using this I would only attempt to make a salad when I wanted to eat it immediately because it would spoil quickly in a regular bowl when kept in the fridge . The spinner not only removes a lot of water ( enough you actually have to pour it out ! ) if you keep the salad in the colander part inside the bowl , the salad doesnt sit in its own moisture and go bad as quickly . So now I 'm not only saving money on buying unprepared salad fixings , but also not creating as much waste in packaging and food . Another lazy persons contraption eh ? ... I think not !	1
I would n't prepare a salad without my salad spinner . Placing a paper towel in with the greens helps dry them faster , too.Recently I found a new use for the basket and bowl . They work great for rinsing and sorting dried peas or beans . Put them in the basket , fill the bowl with water , swish and sort , then lift out the basket to drain , and rinse the 'dirty ' bowl under running water . Do this a few times and your dried veggies are ready to cook or soak . You can let them soak in the bowl if you wish . This beats my old way of washing dried peas or beans in a heavy bowl or pot .	1
We had been buying the bagged greens , but with the e coli scare we decided no more of that . My sister recommended the Oxo salad spinner . It is very easy to use , the spin mechanism works like an old-fashioned children 's top . Just pump it , and away it goes . I pump it a few times , dump out the excess water that drains from the leaves , wipe down the bowl , put on the storage lid , and the lettuce stays fresh and incredibly crisp for a week . Excellent product.Update : February 2010I am still using the salad spinner on a regular basis . Obviously , it 's proven to be very durable , and a good investment .	1
We received this as a gift . It is great . We have had the same one for about five years now , and it is always in use . We run it through the dishwasher and still holds up great . We would recommend it as a great gift . Hopefully the quality is still as good as it was when we got ours .	1
I purchased this a few years back ( not from amazon ) and loved it . It was big enough to wash a whole green leaf lettuce , spinned nicely , and removed most of the water . However , the lid was accidentally dropped on the kitchen tile floor and a part on the bottom cracked . From then on it was trouble . The button would push down but not come back up and start the spinning . I tried unsuccessfully to keep using it but it was more effort than it was worth.So ... yes I would recommend it , but NEVER drop the plastic lid , as it 's the hard type of plastic and will crack on a hard surface . The transparency of the base was really nice to see how much water had been spun out . The rubberized top button was great too . My slippery formica countertop is not so nice when things skate off onto the floor .	1
Do n't wait ! Grab it now ! This is truly the very best spinner on the market !	1
Just the right size for my needs . Does n't take up a lot of space in the refrigerator . Very easy to use , very easy to clean . Have recommended this product to several people .	1
This was a big hit with one of my daughters for Christmas . It was by special request and now she would not be without the spinner .	1
My wife loves it . I was skeptical but i am now a believer . It is gross to see all the crappy water that comes off after spinning !	1
Ever bought lettuce or spinach and , after 3 days in the fridge , find that it 's turning to a slimy mess ? Got concerns about E. coli and other bacteria on your leafy greens ? If you eat salads , you NEED a salad spinner . And after trying several , I 'm here to tell you this is the one you want.1 ) Put your veggies in the bowl . Pour a cup of white vinegar over it , and fill with cold water . Agitate it with your ( clean , recently washed ) hands and let it sit for a few minutes.2 ) Lift the basket out and pour out the vinegar / water . Fill again with cold water and agitate by hand.3 ) Lift the basket and pour out the water , then spin , spin spin.4 ) Pour out the water and wipe the remaining droplets with a paper towel.5 ) Put the basket back in , lock the spinner down , and store in the fridge.Lettuce and spinach lasts twice as long using this method than just storing in the fridge.Cheers !	1
This salad spinner does an awesome job dehulling home grown sprouts . I seems to be well built and is easy to clean .	1
Had mine for several years and it does the job . It is easy to disassemble and clean which is a big plus .	1
They thought of EVERYTHING when they designed this salad spinner . I got the little one and it is just right for spinning lettuce for 2 and then storing the remainder in the spinner . It definitely causes the lettuce to last longer ! : - ) AAAA for this product ! !	1
This spinner is easy to use and compact . I purchased it to replace a larger , bulkier spinner I had . I 'm very pleased with the performance and ease of use . If you need a spinner , this is a good one . But if you 're going to do a large amount of greens , you may want a bigger version .	1
This thing is so awesome ! I thought I would just use it occasionally but I use it to spin basically every fruit and vegetable that I wash in my kitchen . It does n't get them 100 % dry like it does with lettuce and other greens but it does a much better job than a colander for blueberries and grapes and similar items .	1
This salad spinner is very well made . The bowl is large and also doubles as a serving bowl . Very happy with this purchase .	1
The product works great , and looks fun too . It 's exactly what I 've come to expect from the OXO line . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
Used my daughter 's salad spinner when I was visiting at Christmas . They work great to get the water off the Romaine , instead of draining & drying with paper towels . I then used the bowl to make the salad . Very handy thing to have & helps making a salad to not be such a long process .	1
I held out against the salad spinner for a long time . I told myself I did n't need it and would n't use it , but it kept winking at me , and the customer reviews convinced me that I really would love having it . Well , I do love it , and I use it a lot ! It 's not just for salad greens , but for anything you want to dry quickly . It 's sleekly designed with only three easy-to-clean pieces . One quick plunge keeps the bowl spinning for quite a long time , but one touch to the button on the side stops it cold . This week alone I 've drained cabbage for slaw , grape tomatoes and cooked shrimp for a salad . None of the food was damaged , and all of it was well-dried enough that I did n't have to worry about my dressing getting watered down . It does what it promises to do and does it well , with a minimum of fuss . That is , to my way of thinking , the mark of a great piece of equipment .	1
This is my first salad spinner so take this review as such . I really do n't have any previous models to base it on . So I will post the benefits and problems I have noticed but can not gauge for you if another is a better buy.First off is the size of the salad spinner . It is pretty big so make sure you have a place to store it because it will take up a lot of room . I would n't trust storing anything inside the spinner because the basket is plastic and I would think it would become warped and than useless . As long as you have the storage room the size is great . I have used it for drying off salad greens , and drying off fresh cut potato fries , potato pancakes and homemade chips so I have challenged its capacity and it works great . The next part is the button lock . There is a lock for the button to help protect the button and keep it out of your way when storing . That lock works great and is easy to operate . I have no complaints on the lock so we must move on to the button itself . The spin action is achieved by pressing the big green button down a few times in a fast up and down motion . It reaches a top speed and seems to only be able to go so fast before you start interrupting its momentum when pressing it beyond that point . Once the spinner is going there seems to be some movement of the whole unit on my all wood counter . It is nothing extreme but I call for caution when using on a slick surface because while on wood it likes to nudge around like a top ever so slightly . I could see it sliding right off a marble top counter without a towel underneath it . The next function is the break to stop the spinner . And when I say stop I mean slow down slowly . The break does not impress me that much . I under stand you would n't want an instant stop so you can protect the items in the basket and the basket itself , but I have just let it spin itself down because when preparing dinner . I do not want to wait 20 seconds holding a button down when the spinner would only take 40 seconds to stop on its own . The product works fine over all and the only part I truly worry about breaking is the basket . I am going to baby that basket because like I mentioned before any warps could prove bad for the spinner . So far the item has worked like a champ and since december 17th 2012 I have used this product 13 times . The product has yet show signs of age but its only one month in Jan 12 2013 and I will update over time to report and damages that happen with regular use .	1
Salad spinners are one of the most used kitchen utensils that we have . This one is well built with hard plastic top and basin . The spinner 's gearing works well and has a smooth operation	1
this thing is large , so plan on eating alot of lettuce . It 's great , works well , and spins fast . The bottom bowl does n't have holes in it so make sure you do n't rinse the lettuce in both of them and then expect to spin it dry . We used to do that with our last spinner . We also did rinse lettuce one time and filled up bottom bowl with water , minor inconvience that we were n't used to . We have changed the way we spin lettuce rinsing in the green strainer part then shaking that a couple of times in the sink and then on the salad spinner . The kids love to push this handle down . It 's firm and strong . Worth the money to my wife . $ 30 bucks to spin lettuce , not worth it to me . The old one still worked .	1
Pros : - Large capacity- Effective for spinning saladCons : - Big , for obvious reasonsIt 's big ! But then again , it 's big . Still a keeper , though !	1
This salad spinner is a clear winner ! Just a few spins removes the water from your salad greens using centrifugal force . It spins the greens so dry that I do n't even bother blotting them with paper towels . I purchased the large clear model and use it to store my greens after spinning the salad greens and pouring out the water . This is definitely a practical , worthwhile purchase .	1
i like that it has a push button versus the turn crank . works really well . and i also like that it sets into a bowl-like container so that you can do it on the counter and not have it drip out the bottom ( the way my last cheap one was , you had to do it in the sink ) .	1
It is very sturdy and the blades are sharp . I used to have an all-metal one ( not OXO ) , but it would bend when I pushed down on it . The OXO slices through the apple quickly and easily , and the rubber grips are easy on the hands .	1
You may have recalled a previous apple slicer review of mine . I enjoy them so much I ca n't help but review another one . It 's just a lot of fun taking an apple and slicing it into eight handy and adorable little slices . Whether you use green apples , red apples , Granny Smith , whatever . This slicer will deliciously make eating apples exciting . If you 're a child you can even enjoy eating healthy foods by using this product . The apple will taste better , believe me . You wo n't have to mess around with no silly core . Just do n't go around shopping online without your parents permission .	1
This is a nice little tool to have around the kitchen to save you a bit of time in slicing up an apple . When you push down on the handle it cuts the apple up . The only problem is that after you push down , you may have to push the apple slices through from the other side . In other words , it does n't cut all the way through the apple .	1
I love this apple cutter ! I hate biting into apples so this is the only way I will eat them . I keep one apple cutter at the office and one at home and use each of them a couple of times a week ( we go through a lot of apples in season at my house ) . It has a large surface area to fit some of the bigger apples and very sharp blades to cut through any tough spots ( like when you cut the core by accident like I always do ) .My only problem is that the blades are really sharp ! This is great for apple cutting and why this product works so well but I have cut my fingers on it numerous times . I have to always make sure to pick up the cutter by the handles.p.s . My mom has the Progressive version of this apple cutter and it does n't work nearly as well . The blades are not as sharp so I always have to strugle a little when I use hers .	1
I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine , and it works great . He is very pleased , and it has helped him enjoy apples more often than he would otherwise , if he did n't have this great device . A great tool : )	1
But it 's nice to have , especially during apple pie season . And apple snacking season . So yeah , sorry Alton , I like this unitasker .	1
I recently bought this on Amazon . It works great . Pressed down on the apple and bam . The core was gone and the apple was neatly divided . The divided apple looked like a flower blossom . Pushing down on the the corer/divider did not require much pressure . It cut and sliced through the apple as smooth as silk . Be careful when washing this tool as the blades are a bit sharp . Good product . Enjoy your apples .	1
I was n't too sure about this product , but figured I 'd give it chance since there were so many positive reviews . I 'm glad I did ! It works exactly as its suppose to ; It removes the apple core and divides the rest into pieces . It looks flimsy , but is actually quite durable .	1
I love the idea of this device and it worked adequately . The only problems I had were : 1. it was a bit difficult to cut through the apple . I had to use all my strength , and 2. while it 's not the device 's fault , it 's hard to align if the apple 's core is n't directly beneath it 's stem . A little practice and I 'm sure it will get easier to judge . It certainly beats cutting them by hand .	1
This aple divider works great ! The last one I had was made differently and would get apple fiber stuck in the middle of it . It was very hard to clean . This one is very easy to clean .	1
This is a quality apple corer/slicer . We 've had ours for quite some time and it 's still good . It 's strong and I think it 's really gon na last . Worth buying !	1
This saves quite a bit of work . It cuts and cores and apple in seconds . Make sure you get it straight and it works perfectly . SOmewhat hard to clean is my only complain . Its sharp but not too sharp . Good quality , rubbery grip . Dishwasher safe . Its a very handy tool .	1
I liked using this product and the results of getting perfectly cored apple and slices . The only drawback was the amount of force required to get through the apple . Maybe using another type of apple would not be so difficult but the delicious apple took more pressure than I had.All in all , I would recommend it for quickly coring and slicing .	1
This apple corer and slicer is great ! I love it and so does my child . We are both eating more apples and pears now .	1
My daughter loves apples , eats them by the bag full , but being a toddler insists on them being peeled and sliced.Whatever , she wo n't get scurvy as long as she keeps eating apples , and this just made dealing with her particular demands a heck of a lot easier .	1
Works great even on large apples , although on these you will have to do a little additional cutting with a paring knife to get rid of the widest part of the core . Will be watching to see hos long it maintains its sharpness .	1
This is a great tool . I 'll never have to slice an apple with my trusty knife again . I ca n't just bite into an apple ( fragile teeth ) so this does the trick for me . ThanX .	1
works great- still going strong no rust after 2 years . I 'm oxo obsessed so i would highly recommend this . 5 stars	1
Yesterday morning , I cored and sliced over 230 apples . I then dipped them in lemon juice and froze them . Once frozen Ithem , I packaged them with a vacuum sealer . Now I 'll have apples all winter long and not have to buy them again . My husband was amazed at this little inexpensive tool . It saved us a ton of work . It works in less than a second and it 's completely done ! I wish I had the patent on it !	1
This is a great apple slicer/corer . We used it often to slice apples for our little ones and perhaps should not have put it in the dishwasher ? Because it cracked within 3 months of everyday use - but was cheerfully replaced at the store we bought it from . ( we bought it locally , not through Amazon )	1
This product works pretty well . I like the rubber handles , and the fact that they are a bit raised so you can push this all the way down without ramming your knuckles into the plate , counter , etc.However , I did dock a star because no matter how hard I try this wo n't divide the slices all the way - they stay connected at the bottom . It 's also a bit tough to get the core out of the middle after making the cut .	1
This is the first apple corer I 've bought , and honestly I feel stupid for not buying one sooner . It has turned what used to be a 10-15 minute task into a 3-minute one , and the end result is a lot more consistent and attractive than the slices I did by hand.This corer does take a bit of upper body strength to use and the plastic feels a little flimsy ( with one particularly tough apple I was kind of afraid it would snap in half ) , but the grips are solid , the blades are sharp and really for $ 10 I doubt there 's a better deal out there .	1
Daily use for months now without a problem . It works great on apples and pears , cuts them to 8 equal pieces . The blade side on mine is really sharp , best cleaned with a dish brush ( I 've cut myself a couple of times on it . ) Ca n't say I 'd recommend letting the kids use it . The only criticism I have is sometimes it 's hard to remove the core at the center , but otherwise it works really well . In response to one of the other reviews : you should check to see if the stem and the flower end line up to minimize capturing some of the core in your slices . This is especially true if your fruit is somewhat odd shaped -- you may have to line up your stroke .	1
I got this for myself to speed up making the kids ' lunches and I love it . It quickly cuts the apple into slices and removes the core . Perfect for busy moms .	1
This device is great for coring and dividing apples . Works best with small to medium apples . I plan to look into a peeler but this will do fine for now . I love OXO products , since I know what I am getting in terms of quality .	1
I have had this for a year and use it more days than not . No cracking . It works great , but I will say it is harder to use in bigger apples . Perhaps that is why others had cracking problems , but I am only speculating.If you eat apples often this is worth the money , even if it only lasts a year .	1
Since I am partially disabled , this makes it easy to add some fruit to my diet . I do n't only use it on apples .	1
I used this for apples and found that it works well on totally round apples with a flat bottom . If it is an uneven bottom of the apple it cuts it through the core rather than beside the core . I could still use it and it is easier than by hand just know that you will need to clean up some of the apple slices that have the core still on it .	1
This works great , and actually makes cutting up an apple fun ! Sometimes I do have to cut a bit more of the core out , but other than that this little thing is super .	1
Perfectly cores an apple . I was pleasantly surprised . I have grown to like OXO products . I respect their brand ; otherwise I would have not tried this . But it works . The only issue I have is that obviously the blades are sharp . So pressing down on it using the side handles is the only option unless you want to cut your fingers .	1
I cut an apple every day for breakfast and this corer and divider has been working strong for 3 years now . Excellent long lasting product . I ca n't recommend it enough .	1
Since we eat a lot of fruit around my house , this is an item that gets a real workout . It is essentially used on a daily basis.This corer/divider is well designed and comfortable to use with its cushioned grips . The blades are very sharp and slice through fruit almost like a hot knife through butter , just a bit of downward pressure is needed to get the corer going . The central - circular piece for coring - is larger than on comparable items by other manufacturers which makes the entire process of coring and dividing apples or pears so much easier.In general , I have always appreciated the sound ergonomic design of OXO kitchen tools/gadgets and this one will not disappoint.Buy one of these soon and start eating all those apples/pears , etc . that your 're processing on a regular basis for a healthier lifestyle . The life you save may be your own !	1
Nice size veggie brush with a handle that is easy to grip . Oxo is a good brand , so I 'm sure the quality is good .	1
I received this brush several years ago as a gift and it is still going strong . I no longer use it for food cleaning , but for everything else in the home . My son 's puppy left his calling card on my carpet and this little brush came to the rescue . It gets right in that spot between the floor and the porcelain at the bottom on the toilet . You may call it a vegetable brush , but I call it my & # 34 ; everything to clean & # 34 ; brush .	1
It works well and has a good gripping surface . No issues . What more can I say ? : - ) I 'm glad I purchased it and absolutely recommend it .	1
Love it ! Works great on many kinds of fruits and vegetables .	1
I eat a lot of potatoes . I mean a LOT . We probably go through 10-15 lbs a week . We tried all sorts of different scrubbing devices to clean all of those potatoes , and every single one either did n't clean well , had flattened bristles within a month , or was just hugely uncomfortable and sometimes painful . This made cleaning potatoes the biggest dread in the kitchen . So after I stopped being able to make my husband clean every single potato every time , I started looking for a new , fancy potato scrubber that I would n't bloody my knuckles using . Money was no object ( within reason , I was n't going to justify $ 1000 for a brush ) because this was going to be the most important purchase of the year . I shopped vigorously online , read dozens of reviews , and finally decided on the OXO Good Grips Flexible Vegetable Brush.We 've had it now for several months . It is very comfortable to hold ( even for people with giant freak hands like me ) , it does a good job of cleaning the potatoes , and best of all not one single bristle has even begun to flatten . I no longer refuse to scrub my potatoes , so I do n't think its stretching to say that this little brush has helped strengthen my relationship . It really is fantastic , and I have nothing bad to say about it . Totally worth the $ 8 , and I highly recommend it to anyone who has to scrub vegetables . Even if it eventually does flatten out on me , its already lasted at least 3x as long as any other brush I 've tried .	1
This works great ! I use it to clean our vegetables before I cook them and it definitely makes a noticeable difference !	1
This works well . It gets my produce really clean . It is easy to hold and use and does n't take up much room in your kitchen .	1
I bought this to clean potatoes , and I must say it is a great product ! I find it better than the plastic scrubbers you can buy .	1
The brush is well-made and scrubs fine . Now if only it had a hook so I could hang it ...	1
I used this to clean some carrots that I got from an organic farm deliver twice a monh . Before this I just rinsed with cold water using my hands and the results were okay . Then I tried the brush and there was no dirt left and it is good for my hands as I have arthritis .	1
The brush is MUCH better quality than I had expected , what a pleasant surprise ! You really ca n't beat the price for a brush this nice . I have purchased brushes in this price range before and they always ended up being just as cheap as they looked ! The bristles would flatten after 1-2 uses , they would slip from your hand , your hand would cramp up because they were awkwardly small , etc . This brush looks as though it will definitely last for years ! It is larger than I thought it would be which is great ! You can comfortably grip it in your palm and apply the necessary scrubbing pressure without ever having your hand cramp up at all . It is a very solid product too . Just by the feel of it you can tell it will be extremely durable over the years and through many many uses . The bristles are quite coarse so it really will only be great for scrubbing harder vegetables , but , since the the most commonly cleaned vegetables are the tough skinned hard varieties that are grown in the ground you will be able to use it for a huge variety . The no-slip grip handle is wonderful ! I can use this while my hand ( and brush ) are completely submersed in water and it does n't slip a bit , even with vigorous scrubbing . All in all , WONDERFUL PURCHASE ! I would very highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a vegetable scrub brush !	1
It scrubs , it has n't fallen apart , it washes up really nice , it is comfortable in your hand to hold ... what else can you ask for ?	1
Long ago I had a Swedish veg brush that could make veg pristine with a few strokes . This brush does just as well and has the added bonus of a very comfortable handle . Happy to have this cleaning power again .	1
This is the perfect size to hold in the palm of your hand , the material it 's made of does n't slide out of your hand and the bristles are gentle enough for delicate veggies , tough enough to clean fresh from the garden veggies . Good product !	1
This brush is exactly what I was looking for . Cleans my fruits and vegetables well and grip on this thing is great for maintaining control !	1
Just like the name , I can grip it firmly in my hand while I was brushing up apples , green peppers and stuff . High recommend it .	1
I have petite sized hands and this produce scrubber fits perfectly in my palm . It could be better if the brush head was a bit larger .	1
the oxo good grips flexible vegitable brush is a great buy . i ended up buying another i liked the brush so well . it is easy to hold while washing any vegetable . the brushes get right in and get out the dirt off potatoes as well as any vegitable .	1
This review is from : OXO Good Grips Flexible Vegetable Brush ( Kitchen ) This is a good vegetable brush that you can use to scrub dirt off of potatoes and many other vegetables . I ca n't get excited about it though because I think it would be a lot better if it were a little bigger.The quality of the brush and the deal are pretty good . Sure it fits into the center of a palm , but I think it 's marketed to make a weakness sound like strength . I 'd like a bigger brush , ideally , with the same quality .	1
This is a great little brush . It fits the hand easily , scrubs the vegetables nicely and cleans up well . Going to be throwing a number of these little gems into the stockings next Christmas !	1
This fits in your palm nicely and cleans without causing damage to lighter veggies such as mushrooms . It is great for potatoes getting into all the little nooks and crannies .	1
I took to eating the skins on potatoes etc and have meant for a decade to buy a veggie brush . I saw this one . It looked easy to hold and the brush looked firm . It works well , cleans potatoes & sweet potatoes , is comfy to grip , cleans with hot water . I like it ! I 'd buy another .	1
This is a great brush for use on vegetables . The bristles are stiff enough to scrape off dirt , but not as harsh as to damage . The size is just right and fits in the hand well . The rubber makes it comfortable and easy to grip without fatigue .	1
This is a well-made brush that fits comfortably in the palm of your hand . The bristles are strong and firmly embedded . I 'll definitely get more than my moneys worth from this brush .	1
I always used the long handled vegetable brushes . My arthritis prevents me from scrubing the vegetable very hard , then I ran across this little scrubber from Amazon . I LOVE IT ! It fits my hand perfectly and scrubs the vegetables so clean that I usually leave the peal on for the vitamins . Thanks OXO for a wonderful product ! Debra in Texas	1
As with most OXO products this brush is well made and the bristles are a perfect stiffness for scrubbing potatoes , etc .	1
This is an excellent little vegetable brush that fits nicely in your hand , and is very easy to hold.My neighbor has very bad arthritis and I brought her over my brush to use , to see if it might be helpful to her while , cleaning vegetables . Long story shirt , she loved it and bought her own.Great product !	1
Great brush for scrubbing your vegies .	1
I had just about given up on cooking potatoes with the skin left on because I could n't for the life of me seem to get them clean enough to get rid of that nasty dirt flavor.Ahhhhh . This little brush works wonders . I glad I happened across it and got it . When you are cleaning the tater you can see the difference between an uncleaned spot and a clean spot . The brush is large enough to make even big spuds quick work.I 'm 6 foot tall and have about average to large hands and the brush is just the right size . If your hands are bigger the brush should still be perfect . If you are petite and have really small hands you may want to get a brush with a handle .	1
Very happy I bought this little brush for getting the wax covering off apples . Also use it on pears and potatoes and carrots . If fruit has gotten soft like ripe peaches , then it 's a little too stiff , but the soft brushes wo n't really work on the hard stuff . So you really do need both .	1
I bought this for $ 3.99 and the shipping on it was free , by itself . It feels secure in your hand and it has done a good job so far . I would not recommend that you use it as a replacement for a peeler , but it definitely deserves your consideration to scrub the dirt and chemicals from the outside layer of vegetables.The circular grip is something that will probably be hit or miss for some people , as would a long handle for other people . I like the ergonomics of this product and I think others would as well .	1
The Oxo Good Grips Flexible Vegetable Brush does just what it says . It fits in the hand nicely and does a good job cleaning vegetables . I would highly recommend this product .	1
This brush has just the right & # 34 ; stiffness & # 34 ; . The size is right and it is very secure in your hand.Very comfortable to use .	1
It fits very comfortably in my hand and makes scrubbing potatoes and other veggies very easy . I wish I would have seen this a long time ago . Now I plan to buy more for gifts and to have an extra for myself .	1
Perfect for scrubbing potatoes and mushrooms . Comfortable grip and great OXO quality . Not too soft nor too abrasive , just what I needed .	1
Oxo Good Grips Flexible Vegetable BrushA truly indispensable piece that every kitchen should have .

This is the best veggie brush I 've ever owned . It cuts scrubbing time in half , and it 's held up very well ( for 6 months ) .	1
I 've used many vegetable brushes , mostly the horseshoe shaped with a handle , purchased from stores such as Sears , pennies , the ... marts , & kitchen stores . I was skeptical of the positive reviews about this one . I have n't had it a week yetbut so far it is clearly the best I 've ever used ! I 've cleaned large carrots , turnips , & parsnips with it . I am impressed how well it fits in my hand & the ease & superior way it cleans . Not only better cleaning but faster . Strongly recommend .	1
This works great for cleaning vegetables . Easy to hold in your hand . I used it on potatoes and it worked great .	1
Wow ! ! What a Vege brush ! This little brush has a comfortable feel . The bristles conform to the shape of the potato , carrots , mushrooms or whatever vege you are cleaning no matter the shape or size . It really goes to work without damaging the skin . It cleans well and is also very easy to clean . I 'm impressed with this nifty little brush . Worth more than the money spent for it !	1
Nice little vegetable scrubber . Fits in the palm of your hand . Bristles are sturdy and do the job . Very happy with my purchase .	1
OMG this is GREAT . OXO is the best - high quality ! And because it is dishwasher safe - just fabulous ! ! ! ! We use it on potatos and veges . Love it ! ! !	1
As other reviews state , this brush & # 34 ; fits easily in the palm of your hand. & # 8221 ; It & # 8217 ; s especially nice for fragile fruits and veggies as it doesn & # 8217 ; t rip the skin off , yet it also does an excellent job of removing imbedded dirt from potatoes .	1
I like this ! Cleans and does not damage skin . We like the skin on vegetables . Very sturdy brush makes cool water cleaning easy .	1
This works as advertised . I have n't had bristles fall out or anything wrong with it . There is nothing about it that makes be think it is better then any other brush but I do n't expect a lot out of a brush just to do the job it is intended for .	1
This gets the job done . I purchased this after reading a review on a cast iron grill pan that I purchased . This works very well to remove on stuck on food from my grill pan and makes cleaning so much easier . The bristels are tough enough to get food off , but has not scratched the non-stick of my grill pan . I would highly recommend this to anyone .	1
I 've been looking for a really good vegetable brush for awhile now and hip hip hooray I 've found the perfect brush . It has sturdy bristles , not to big , does the best job and fit perfectly in my palm . I 've tried a number of vegetable brushes before only to throw them out because their bristle have gone limp on the job after a short usage . I 've purchased OXO brand items before and have been very happy with the items . I can now say with full confidence that the vegetable brush can be added to the list of very dependable products . It does an especially fine job on potatoes and lemons . I 'm so glad that I chose this particular vegetable brush .	1
Good brush for use in the kitchen . I use this strictly in the washing of my vegetables and in the removal of silk from the ears of corn .	1
I 've just received this today , March 28 , 2009 , and have already put it to good use cleaning potatoes while preparing to roast them . I find this vegetable brush a LOT easier to hold and use than other vegetable brushes I have used in the past ! It fits easily into my hand and does not slip out while cleaning potatoes under running water . I 've also used this to clean celery and it came out great ! I 'm looking forward to testing this product on other root vegetables such as beets and carrots . I am curious as to how it will stand up to corn on the cob still shrouded in silk and what other vegetables to try this on . As soon as I can test it with corn silk , or any other vegetable , I 'll be updating this review .	1
If you want to scrub your fruit or veggies before eating them , this is the perfect brush for that . I know the skin of veggies contain a massive amount of vitamins and I want to keep them while cooking or whatever and do n't want to peel them , so I simply use this brush that gently scrubs the veggies ( with running water ) without damaging the skin and then proceed to cook them and therefore , retaining all the vitamins ! ! I love it and highly recommended .	1
I use this brush to clean all of my fruits and vegetables before I juice them . It gets into all the crevices and cleans very well . It is easy to hold onto and is very useful !	1
This vegetable brush is extremely easy to handle , too . Simple to clean , as well . Do n't know how I lived without it until now .	1
I always look for OXO before purchasing other brushes or kitchen items . This brush is strong enough for a potato but soft enough for a tomato . OXO makes a great product and you ca n't go wrong if you need a cleaning or kitchen product . Amazon usually has free S & H and that 's another plus .	1
I want my garden veggies to take the shortest route possible from garden to stove . This brush helps me make short work of the cleaning part .	1
Works great , really good quality , I use it all the time and it gets my veggies super clean ! I would buy this again .	1
It 's a brush . Its grip is n't terrible comfortable or uncomfortable , but it 's a brush . It 's compact . The bristles are in good shape still .	1
This handy little brush is small and does n't take up a lot of space behind the faucet in my kitchen sink , and its bristles are just the right stiffness to clean most fruit ( I do n't think I 'd use it on a tomato as pictured though ) . I also use it as a nail and hand brush , though it might be too harsh for folks with tender skin on their hands .	1
These brushes a great . I bought two so my partner could help me clean veggies ! I do a big wash once a week after a trip to the store . I liked this brush so much I just ordered my second .	1
Not sure why I have not had one of these before , but it makes things a heck of lot easier when I am cleaning carrots !	1
From reading the description , I was thinking this brush was soft and floppy . Luckily , the `` flexible '' part must refer to the bristles , rather than the brush itself.The top of the brush is made with the standard Oxo soft rubber . It is molded to fit easily and naturally in the palm of a hand , and is very easy to hold , even when wet . The bristles are firm enough to get the dirt off mushrooms or potatoes , but not so firm that they damage the skins.It is a very useful little brush , does n't take up much space in a drawer , and is easy to hold and use . Plus , it feels more expensive than it is , which is always nice !	1
Got this veggie brush to fill out an order . Imagine my surprise when I actually use this thing and its awesome ! I grill a lot of squash and zucchini and never realized what a difference a good scrubbing could make ! No more gritty grilled veggies ! Cleans easily , drys quickly , stores anywhere .	1
I love this little scrub brush as you can see the dirt washing off and I feel like my veggies are much cleaner than they ever were with my old brush . It takes a little muscle though and they way you hold it is fine except if you have arthritis or stiff fingers this one may not be for you as you really need to grip it .	1
This is yet another great Oxo product - I have n't met an oxo gadget I did n't like ... so far ! This scrubber is easy to hold and makes quick work of cleaning potatoes . It definitely takes the dirt off quickly and easily . Highly recommend .	1
Well named , the best attribute of the Oxo Good Grips Vegetable brush is its rubber grip , which is oval shaped with a rounded top , and fits near perfectly in the palm of your hand , allowing you to get a rock solid grip , and effectively apply cleaning force . The bristles are short , ( 0.6 inches ) , and of moderate stiffness , so when you scrub , there is some give , but not a lot , and with a palm sized brush , you know exactly where the bristles are . The rubber grip remains easy to hold , even when wet . The brush is a little pricey , but it is very well designed , and feels great in your hand . It does a very good job of cleaning vegetables , and at other general cleaning tasks.Unless the product has been redesigned , the brush pictured does not appear to be current version of the Good Grips Vegetable brush . The brush in the photo looks more circular rather than oval , and rather than having ridges that circle around the edges , the sides of the Good Grips brush are smooth .	1
I love this little stiff bristle vegetable brush , I purchased this for use in my RV , now I need to buy one for my home and a couple more for use as hand brushes , the black handle fits well into my hand , the handles are made of a course rubber , they do n't get slippery when using for all my vegetables , easy rinse off to clean .	1
I bought this because it was recommended by Cooks Illustrated . It is very thin and can get under anything . It flips very easily . But you have to get used to how it works . Its very flexible . The first time or two , take your time . But I would buy it again	1
Sadly , I needed to replace a very flexible spring steel turner that had age-hardened and cracked . I use cast iron , while others in the family use non-stick , and I needed two different turners . I looked for them at various places , and was very disapointed at the selection : all were too thick and not at all flexible . Amazon to the rescue ! They had the OXO Good Grips listed as a `` large flexible turner '' . I bought the stainless version for the cast iron pans , and a silicone over stainless version for the non stick.The stainless version is fantastic . First , it is large enough to flip large pancakes without tearing them . Second , it is very thin and springy . Third , the blade is very genty curved in a manner that causes it to be stiff when it is needed . Oh , and fourth , the handle , as on all OXO products , is , well , just right . How do they do that ? When I first held it in my hand , I thought the blade would be too large for flipping a fried egg . Not so . It took only a minute or so to get the hang of using it , and I have not broken a yolk since beginning its use.It may be hard to find this model , but I highly recommend holding out for it if you use cast-iron pans or non-treated steel cookie sheets . There simply is n't a better , thinner , or more flexible turner that I have found , and I looked a lot of places.OXO Good Grips Large Silicone Flexible TurnerThe second model , the silicone covered stainless turner , is also great if you have non-stick . It is more `` mid-size '' than the larger model I just described . The entire blade is covered in a smoky-colored silicone sleeve that has nicely tapered edges and is very strongly attached.I find the nylon versions too thick , not flexible enough , and hard enough that they can damage the coating on non-stick pans ( even high qualtiy ones ) if the nylon blade approaches the pan at the wrong `` scraping '' angle.So give yourself or someone you know who cooks a wonderful and inexpensive present they are certain to use and depend upon for years . Buy one of these turners !	1
This is the spatula you 've been looking for ! It is very thin and extremely flexible . I just finished using it for a batch of chocolate chip cookies and it is incredible . It easily slips under each and every cookie for easy removable with no broken cookies ! With holiday baking just around the corner , I would highly recommend this spatula for everyone who enjoys baking .	1
I had picked one of these ones up from TJ maxx one time and gave it away then couldnt find it anywhwere.. It is perfect for flipping fish , over medium or over easy eggs and delicate desserts/ fresh baked cookies . It has a very think steel plate for a head and it is nice and wide , about 4 inches and has just the right flexibility and firmess when you need it . nice longhandle makes it good for grilling fish and not burning your hand . Defintely reccomend to anyone who is a lover of kitchen gadgets and tools or bakes a lot . . I will use this for ever !	1
It is thin , flexible and wide enough for anything . Perfect for making eggs ! Flipping pancakes is great too ! I use this for everything cause of its bendability , it makes it so much easier that a thicker non bendable spatula ! will def buy another when mine wears out !	1
The reason I buy Oxo products is thoughtful design ! The flat metal on this spatula has been warped ever so slightly to create a concave surface that flexes up easily but down poorly . The resulting stiffness gives the blade enough rigidity to pick up hambergers but is flexible enough to slide under cookies and pancakes . BRILLIANT !	1
I wanted a spatula that was very thin ( it is ) that could get under eggs without ripping them ( it does ) and that did n't bend under the weight ( it does n't ) . Although it is lightweight , it is everything I was looking for and everything CI said it was .	1
I had an older version of this spatula that broke after many years of use . I love the thinness of this spatula for easily slipping undera variety of baked goods . The flexibility is perfect for getting that first piece of cake out of the square or rectangular cake pan.Family uses it to flip the fried eggs , and it works so much better than the thicker plastic spatulas . I could not do without one of these in my kitchen .	1
Works like a dream.. Very thin to use for cookies . I really like it . It bends easily against the rivets . I recommend gentle use . Use it for cookies only and you will be thrilled .	1
I had been looking for a flexible spatula , but they are hard to find . This works great on fish and also had good luck turning fried eggs . I like the thinness too , because it 's great for getting under cookies for quick removal from the pan .	1
The flexibility is great for cookies . It 's exactly what I needed . The edge is thin enough to get underneath the cookie .	1
This is even better then my old-beloved-Grandma-gave-it-to-me-spatula . REALLY flexible and thin . It slides under the stickiest of sticky-buns , pies , and eggs are lifted out perfectly without breaking the yolks under the & # 34 ; sunny-side & # 34 ; . I 'm going to order more of these as gifts .	1
This is a very flexible spatula so is n't suited to general use but when you need one like this it is wonderful . The only reason I do n't give it 5stars is that this is my 3rd one . Because it is flexible it pulls on the solder points on the handle if you are moving something a bit heavy so eventually it pulls out at the joints . I have never seen one this thin anywhere else so ca n't compare it but OXO generally makes good , affordable equipment and I am happy with their quality .	1
This flexible turner is exactly what I needed ! I wanted something that would slide under hot cookies easily . It does NOT garble up the bottom of my cookies . I rarely use it for anything else . One reviewer said the weight of her cookies bent the spatula down - I have never had that problem , but I tend to make smaller cookies rather than larger ones.It goes through the dishwasher on a regular basis . It recently got jammed in the drawer as I was closing it and it sprang back to its original condition with only a very slight crease in the spatula part . I was pleasantly surprised .	1
This review is basically a copy from the review I wrote for the smaller version of this spatula . They are essentially the same product with slightly different blade sizes . I hope this is OK.This spatula ( and it 's slightly smaller brother ) replaces my Oxo SteeL spatula for pancakes and eggs . I 'm pretty new in the kitchen so I 'm just learning what works for me and what doesn't.The SteeL product line is nice . I do n't have a bad thing to say about them . In particular the SteeL spatula is pretty heavy duty and well built . The problem is the blade is pretty thick which means I bulldoze pancakes and eggs and make a bit of a mess with the SteeL spatula.I ca n't remember how I found this one - ATK maybe ? But after reading the reviews here I purchased it and this morning gave it a try . The blade feels kind of flimsy and is very thin . It bends easily and if you are too rough with it I believe it would permanently crease without much effort . However , for flipping pancakes and eggs it is perfect ! It slides under the pancakes with no bulldozing and after the flip the pancake looks perfect.If I 'm flipping hamburgers I 'll use the SteeL spatula but for delicate breakfast foods like eggs and pancakes the Good Grips Flexible Spatula the right tool for the job .	1
This is a super tool for getting under and lifting food , especially if it 's stuck . I looked a long time for this style .	1
I came across this item somewhere and have since purchased one for each of my children and my daughter 's mother-in-law . Not good for turning heavier foods , but absolutely the best for cookies or pancakes . I think this is a must-have product !	1
This product is wonderful for scrambled eggs and other light and soft items . Trying to use it to lift and flip heavier items is a challenge because the material of the spatula is so thin and flexible . For grilled sandwiches I have to use one of my sturdy plastic spatulas or else spill the contents of my sandwich . If this is going to be your only spatula , I would recommend looking at something else . If you intend it to round out your kitchen utensil collection , then it is great !	1
This turner is very good for turning food in a skillet . I used it turn some sticky carmelized onions and it handled the batch very well . It also cleaned up the edge of the plastic turner I was using . I am going to try it on some more items in the near future .	1
Got this to replace my thin spatula that is slowly disintegrating . It 's not as good as my beloved utensil , but it works . The blade is very thin and slips under eggs perfectly . The only complaint I have is that the blade is uniformly thin . My old spatula has a thin edge then the blade slowly widens , providing support . This OXO spatula is not as stable , flexes easily and can snap , sending food flying unexpectedly . It takes some getting used to , but I have found it to be a suitable replacement for a utensil no longer available .	1
Solidly constructed of heavy stainless steel with rivets connecting the masher to the handle . Its size and heft make it sitable for other purposed too . When deep frying and a piece wo n't stay turned over for uniform cooking , this masher will keep your meat submerged for uniform browning .	1
Does what the product was designed for . The longer handle also allows you to avoid getting potatoes all over your hands while mashing . The handle is also great quality and I 'm able to maintain a constant , firm grip . Would highly recommend .	1
The design staff at OXO really have it together . One after the other they create winners . This is no exeption . It 's sturdily built , has a beautiful finish , and seems to have the perfect size and shape to mash the most potatoes with the least effort . My kind of tool . Besides , it looks great , and that does n't hurt when it 's off duty .	1
Thank goodness for a good heavy duty masher that does n't bend or mash properly . I will be mashing more than just spuds .	1
Far superior to a vertical masher , I love this masher ! Its short handle helps you to avoid slipping around the potatoes when you 're mashing and you can throw your weight into it , so to speak . The grip is easy on your hand , and clean-up is a snap.I could n't be more pleased . Highly recommended .	1
This is an excellent masher . If you 're doing skin on potatoes it clogs up slightly - but still made short work of a few batches of mashed potatoes ( with and without skin ) & mashing up sweet potatoes for another dish.The one flaw of the design ? It 's short handle . However , it 's not a deal breaker . In fact - the plus-es of this more than made up for it 's sole shortcoming . My old masher ( vertical handle ) was about the same height and had the same issue.There 's only one masher I 've used that I liked as much as this one - but it was literally twice the price ( it 's a Cuisinart model ) . However , I would still choose this one over that other model because there was no hand fatigue with the Oxo . My family loves mashed potatoes and when I make them I make a lot . This was definitely put through some trials for Thanksgiving . I 'm looking forward to using it for Christmas , and for meals in between .	1
Yep , it mashes potatoes . Yep , it 's much better than the useless curved style that I used to have . Yep , I 'm glad I bought it .	1
Could n't find anything wrong with this product . This was a gift requested by college student . Looked like a good sturdy product .	1
I needed some sort of ice cube tray that would be usable in a travel trailer and be easy to remove ice cubes . So far , these seem to work well . The cover minimizes spills while freezing and it also enables loosening the cubes without them going everywhere .	1
I have n't had any problems with this ice cube tray . I like the design and tray cover . I do tend to only fill mine about 3/4 of the way full so as the water freezes , there is somewhere for it to go .	1
I 've always trusted OXO and even used to work in Kitchen appliances so I know they 've got a great reputation . This tray is good for anyone who may have a super frosty freezer , or , like me , freezes pumpkin ice cubes for my dog and therefore wanted a tray that was n't exposed all the time .	1
I had none of the issues with not being able to slide the lid and can only assume those who did must have really overfilled . The ice tray is easy to use , opens easily , and the cube size allows for quick freezing . I have listed what I consider pros and cons below . The cons will only apply to some users.Pros : Freezes water quickly due to shape of cubesEasy to remove cubes with slightest twist to tray or pushing one end of cubeSliding cover closes and opens easily and protects against spills and freezer odorsCover allows me to stack other items on topCons : The cube shape allows for quicker meltingThe tray is larger than other trays and for me that is an issue as my fridge top freezer is smallOverall , this is a very good product and if I had more space the size would not be an issue . As it is I will continue to use the Martha Stewart small square silicone cube trays I purchased at Macy 's because they use so little space - even though they require wrestling with to remove the cubes .	1
I love the size of the cubes but it is inconvenient to have to stop and slide the tops back . Wish I had ordered a differend kind .	1
this is one of the smartest ice cube trays everthe only thing that could have made this better is if it had a spill proof design	1
This ice tray is easily released and easy to handle because of the cover . Only draw back is the cube is a bit smaller . Not a problem really but just know that is the case . I am glad I bought but a bit pricey for sure . have n't used long enough to know how soon the plastic will crack..hope not soon .	1
After seeing dust in our ice cubes ... gross ! ... we decided we needed a covered ice cube tray and this OXO one was just the ticket ! OXO is a solid brand in the kitchen goods world , and this product did not disappoint . The lid is easy to get on and off , and definitely keeps the dust out of our ice . Yay !	1
So far so good with these ice trays ... the cover is great , the cubes come out easy ... I stack these five high in my freezer ... works great with my Berkey water !	1
Got this tray because it slid in a case . So if I wanted to take it with me , the cubes would not get messy or I had to put it in a baggy . Another feature is the water did not spill on my floor after filling it . Getting the tray out was a bit of a challenge , but I ran it under hot water and it came right out .	1
I like the ice cube tray because of its cover . But do n't be deceived , it 's not an airtight seal . If you tip it , water will leak out.Either way , the tray is great because I prefer to have covered ice cubes , especially if I 'm making ice cube doggy treats or specialty ice cubes for drinks . Keeps them fresher for sure .	1
I bought these trays to use when I have too much spinach or kale . You can grind it up with a little water in a ninja and then put in trays and freeze . You can then throw the frozen kale into your Ninja when making a breakfast drink . They are very well made and the lid slides back and forth so you can just take out a few without dumping the whole tray . Love the way they are made . Would recommend .	1
Love them - love that I can stack then in the freezer and that easy to break before taking off lid to dump into bin . Great .	1
I use these to freeze a special supplement , I make up for my cats ... I 've bought 4 because they keep the meat fresh and clean for 2+ weeks . I puree 12 oz . canned cat food with 10 tsp . L-Lysine and 16 Tbsp . Camelina Oil , then pour into - 2 Oxo Good Grips Ice Cube Trays ... Makes 2 weeks worth for 2 cats . Great for controlling feline herpes and their coats are amazing !	1
We have an ice maker for our regular ice . I use this to make coffee ice cubes with coffee that is left over when I make a full pot . It keeps the coffee from spilling in our very packed freezer .	1
The blade is wide enough to open the shells . The grip is very good , does n't slip at all even when wet . Wish the tip was a bit thinner so it 's easier to get it inside the oyster . Not a huge problem though . Would still recommend it . You should definitely also get a pair of protective gloves with this .	1
So , my friends decided to have a oyster party , which means shucking oyster after oyster without getting shells in the delicious delicacy . Perfect tool . Okay price . Could n't have asked for more .	1
This knife has successfully shucked 48 oysters on two separate occasions . The beefier grip is nice . It could be a little sharper for dislodging the oyster from the shell after you 've opened it . I do n't think this is the perfect oyster knife , but I do think that it does a very good job and is at the right price point . No issues with washing in the dishwasher .	1
I have solo shucked many dozen 's of holiday oysters in my day and know my way around a shucking knife . Of the several I own , this is my second favorite . Oxo is generally a reliable kitchen accessory manufacturer and for occasional use , it 's not too shabby . I do prefer a heftier blade , the Oxo is pretty bent up , but it does work . For a perfect oyster shucking knife , take a gander at the one sold by Island Creek Oysters in Mass ... also a great source of the little salty delights too .	1
I believe that this works just as well as the far more expensive oyster knives . I am pleased with this purchase .	1
I have two houses and needed a spare for peel and eat shrimp . I have a metal peeler , but OXO glides thru the back and make quick work of several dozen shrimp . Get this one ! It 's really for foodies and cooks . -David Allen	1
just stab the shrimp where it 's head used to be and pull up , out comes the intestinal tract , really easy .	1
Great product . I used to work at Red Lobster and peeled and deveined LOTS of shrimp and this style is the best I & # 8217 ; ve used . After using a lot of other deveiners , this is the only one I found that cuts through the shell , cleans out the vein , works quickly and doesn & # 8217 ; t create any waste . I had one of these for years and somehow lost it . I had to look hard to find this style of peeler/deveiner but wouldn & # 8217 ; t settle for any other kind . Highly recommend .	1
If you 're preparing shrimp and hate deveining them , this is the tool to get . Not really & quot ; veins , & quot ; the dark line on the outside of a shrimp is actually its digestive tract - so if you eat it , you 're basically eating shrimp excrement . Put that in your cocktail sauce ! Still , this is a delicate little cord that you do n't want breaking up into pieces , but just yank out quickly and get on to the next shrimp . This tool does just that , and ergonomically fits your hand .	1
This OXO product is easy to use and because of the large soft handle , easy to hold . It seems sturdy enough to me , I do n't really understand why some reviewers think that it 's flimsy.Just hold a de-headed shrimp under a slow drizzle of running cold water insert the tip into the `` vein '' and follow the curve around to the back of the tail . Slip off the shell with legs attached from the bottom and voila ... shelled shrimp .	1
We had crab tonight , and these seafood picks work really well . The crabs have all the chambers at the connection between leg and body and the picks easily scooped out the meat . These picks are heavy and well made , with a soft grip that comes in handy because our hands tend to get messy from the seafood , so we can get a grip on the picks.I was worried the picks would be dangerous because one end is very sharp and two pronged and I worried that while I scooped with one end I might poke myself with the other , but that did n't happen . The sharp two prong end is perfect for grabbing hard to reach bits of seafood .	1
I ordered two of these brushes based on previous good experience with OXO products . They came in today packaged in nothing more than soft plastic sleeves . Sadly this provided no protection during shipping and one of them arrived in pieces ; fortunately I had one that was intact and was able to examine it to see how the broken one was supposed to fit together.A problem had developed in that one of the two springs on either side that press against the clam shell portion had been bent out of position so trying to fit the clam shell portions into position with the springs in the right place became something of a challenge.I was finally able to work them into place so the appearance of the broken one was the same as the one that had arrived fully assembled . As of this point both of the clam shells are working as advertised although the one that arrived broken is slightly sluggish ; it may be that spring strength was compromised by the bending they received during shipment.Having read the review that refers to the packaging I suppose the packaging had been changed to make removal of the assembly easier . Now it appears the problem is inadequate protection during shipment . I suspect some buyers would simply return the brush and holder rather than see it as an assembly challenge.I will rate the packaging and tell Amazon about the problem . In the meantime they are both in place so we 'll give them a test and see if they too live up to the OXO name . I gave it four stars just because of the OXO name and will update if anything notable occurs .	1
Exactly as described and and fast shipping . Comes direct from Amazon and quality seems to be good . Only thing I do not understand for being a Oxo good grips product is why does this not have a nice handle to grip like the kitchen tools I have	1
This brush is well designed and constructed . I 've used it for over a year , so I know for sure that it 's pretty durable . And it has an attractive look about it.So I can recommend this , but it 's with one reservation . Oxo has a compact version that sells for $ 7 less . When I decide to get another brush for a second bathroom , that 's the model I expect to get . So , a careful consideration of the size that you actually need might allow you to save some money.And in this economy , that 's not such a bad idea .	1
I use this scrubber daily for everything from plates , to pans , to glasses . It easily dispenses soap and scrubs tough-to-clean substances . The one frustrating thing about this scrubber ( and the only reason I 'd take off a star ) is that if you use it on a pan with egg-residue , it 's nearly impossible to get the egg pieces out of the scrubber . They get stuck in there for days which is pretty gross .	1
This is the best dish brush I have ever used . It is effective at cleaning and easy to keep clean . Replacing the brush itself is easy . The soap dispensing portion of the brush has lasted me over 5 years and it it used many times a day . The top finally broke and I will gladly purchase another ... it ca n't be beat ! I 'm very happy it is still available .	1
I 'll preface by saying I did n't by this oxo palm brush on Amazon , but at Target . It is an amazing , solidly designed little gem that does n't leak soap like some other brands and shoots a little squirt of soap on command . It actually makes washing dishes a little fun . This is much better and faster than grabbing a bottle of soap and putting it on a brush repeatedly during a dish washing session.The fact that the brush itself is replaceable is a nice touch too .	1
This little brush is addictive ... .load up the soap and OH , NO , I really ca n't quit cleaning ! It perfectly cleans the stovetop which is a difficult job with all of the corners and grills and crevices . In fact , most jobs that were once difficult are now fun because of this little brush .	1
Must have in the kitchen . I have used this for years but previously got it at Williams Sonoma . Found it on Amazon for cheaper ! Better than a sponge because it does n't hold germs . And just squirt out the soap .	1
I bought this hoping it would save my nails when washing certain items that needed harder scrubbing than a dishcloth can do . It fits in my hand easily and does the exact job I need it to do . I saw some staining on the bristles from tomato sauce left in pan but luckily it washed/rinsed out by the time I was finished with those dishes . It is easy to fill with soap but unless I am really mindful how hard I squeeze the top - I feel like too much soap can be dispensed . All in all , I am happy with this item .	1
I have gained a respect for OXO products . They usually offer a quality , well designed product and this brush is no exception ... works great ! It does n't leak and does a wonderful job of removing fried residue from my stainless steel frying pans . You may want to order a couple replement brushes . It 's not a design fault , they just wear out over time . Great product .	1
The integrated soap dispenser makes this small , inexpensive brush a very helpful addition to kitchen sink gear . Instant access to additional dish soap lets you get the job done in one effort.Particularly good on frying pans , cutting boards , plates , soup bowls or other shallow cookware -- the small size and chunky handle give you a lot of scrubbing power for caked-on or burnt food.I have not needed to replace it yet , but the removable bristles mean I will not need to replace the entire unit when it begins to show wear !	1
Used one of these at a beach house and just had to have it . It works great and I run the brush through the dishwasher about once a week to keep it clean .	1
This is our second one , and it appears that it will last much longer . Not only that , but the brushes are replaceable . I like OXO 's product innovation ! The soap reservoir on this one is larger also . Go easy on the push dispenser , soap comes out faster with this one .	1
I love this brush . I had one , ordered another plus replacement bristles . The product arrived fast , just as ordered , I would recommend this anyone and would definitely order again .	1
It will do a decent job or stuck surfaces . The brushes used are reasonably aggressive . It is n't a scouring pad but it takes care of normal pans with panache.It is FAR easier to keep hygienic . I first got the plastic scouring pad version of this dispenser/tool . That was a bear to keep clean . It also wo n't wear nearly as well as this unit . The pads are softer and wear and lack this ones aggression.I am very happy with this unit . It is better working than the normal tools we use on pans or dried dinnerware .	1
This product works well on plates and other flat type surfaces . However , I have a hard time using it in glasses . The bristles do not bend well to clean the sides . I do like the push to dispense detergent feature .	1
the bristles on this do-dad are tough and sturdy . easy to fill and leak-proof , no matter how you lay the thing , it never leaks . however , when I press the black button at the top to dispense some soap - even when it 's a short soft press - a burst of soap comes gushing out . Hard to adjust the amount of soap to dispense .	1
This well built , well engineered squirting palm brush replaced a nasty , leaky sponge-type soap dispenser and a soap pump bottle that took about 50 pumps to get a dab of soap . The nylon bristles can be cleaned easily after each use , so it does n't get disgusting . The dispenser valve does n't leak , so you can fill it up with soap and set it on the sink rim or counter , then when you need some soap for washing dishes , a couple of squirts is all you need since the squirt volume is very adequate . My wife also loves it !	1
This is perfect for removing crusted food of a pan . I use it daily . Excellent product . I would definitely recommend this .	1
Used similar oxo products in the past , this paired with a standard plastic scrubber gets the majority of food off a plate first time , and removes the need for three hands to handle soap as well.An excellent addition to any kitchen sink , and a good excuse to toss that nasty bacteria-laden sponge which has sat a little too long .	1
I use this to clean my spiralizer ( Paderno ) . It works great to get into the crack and blades . Happy I bought it .	1
I really like these brushes . They do not leak the soap all over as I had happen with other types of soap dispensing brushes . I have been using these for years .	1
So far , so good . The lid is very tightly screwed on . The bristles , so far , are holding their own . I 've only owned it a week , but with available replacements , I 'm not too worried about them bending/breaking super early on.The button to release the soap is very sensitive . It 's very hard to release just the tiniest of soap . I ordered this to not actually clean dishes , but clean out my pedestal sink as the bowl is rounded and oval and very hard to clean with a traditional brush . I 'm two washings in and very happy .	1
FUNCTION : Great for scrubbing pots , plates , pans , and bowls . This scrubs oily dishes without getting super oily itself . Its easy to use and comes with a screw off top so you can easily fill it with soap . You obviously ca n't really use this affectively on cups .	1
I love this little cleaning tool and do n't know what I did before I bought it ! I love how neat it is , how easy to use it is and how fast it makes clean up ! !	1
I bought this for the office break room and it works great . It is easy to refill and super quick to clean dishes .	1
This is a very sturdy and nice palm brush . So handy to use for my husband and myself . We love it	1
Sturdy device , and have used with confidence ever since receipt . Nice bowl drains pasta and the handle holds up well . Pops into dishwasher and cleaned nicely . Was able to toss my rusty standby with confidence !	1
I was making jelly for the first time , and bought this ( since the recipe recommended a fine mesh sieve ) . I should have probably bought a much larger one , since it did n't hold very much . I was straining apples and peppers for the jelly , and it worked very well .	1
I love this strainer because : it 's sturdy , rugged , holds its shape , has a tab to rest it on a bowl , cleans easily , has a great handle ... . Really , what 's not to love about this strainer . I 've even thrown this in the dishwasher . There are cheaper strainers , but I doubt they 're as well built as this strainer .	1
I own many Oxo kitchen tools and the 6-inch strainer is another example of the company 's dedication to producing quality products . It is very sturdy with a fine mesh basket and is long enough to prop across the smaller side of my double sink . This is not a large strainer , so if you want a more versatile size , the 8-inch strainer would be a better choice .	1
A passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years , concentrating on Italian food for the last 10 years , writes this review . My favorite cookbooks are `` The Professional Chef '' by the Culinary Institute and `` Culinary Artistry . Cooking is my form of therapy . I purchased this product when I began using citrus juice in many of my meals . This product is very useful and has many more applications than just straining juice.Pros:1 . Excellent for straining citrus juice to keep the seeds out of your foods2 . Fits well over the top of a blender jar3 . Hooks easily to the side of pans to keep if from slipping4 . Great for straining spent vegetables from sauces5 . Excellent for removing small pasta from boiling water6 . Handle stays cool so that you do n't need a potholder7 . Nice flour sifter8 . Makes a nice yogurt strainer for making a healthy non-fat yogurt cheese ( line the inside with a paper towel or a couple of layers of cheese cloth ) Cons:1 . Cleaning is a little tedious ( I find it works best if you soak it in another vessel that is filled with hot soapy water and use a brush to remove the residual `` gunk '' ) Overall , the concept is good and the product is useful and well made . I recommend this product to anyone that loves to cook .	1
Bought both the 6 '' and 8 '' Oxo sieves . Useful every day for cooking tasks ; for boiling little bits of things to go along what 's in the pot , or for straining what comes out of it . Great size and sturdy construction . ( Although I think they are too expensive . After all , they are only strainers to remove water from food . )	1
It fits inside my pot to steam broccoli . I use it to scoop shrimp or other things out of larger pots . Easy to clean .	1
The mesh on this strainer really sets it apart from other , cheaper versions . It does n't indent or bend out of shape like others do . The handle has a nice grip , and the hook on the opposite end is great for leaving something straining over a bowl.The best feature is how well it cleans . Sauces , fruits , vegetables , soft cheeses , flour , and everything else I 've thrown at it do not get stuck in the mesh , and it looks as good as new . Ask a cheaply made strainer to do those things , and some bits get stuck . You ca n't go wrong with this one !	1
This is a great little strainer , its serves many purposes . Its especially great for rinsing berries and quinua ( sp )	1
I have recently started to do alot more baking and also using a deep fryer for cooking turkeys , onion rings , etc . and also frying doughnuts.I am hoping to open a B & B ; next year and need to try out many different receipes to see the cost involved and also the time required to make them . After all , as in any job , time is money . Another important consideration is how well things pass the taste test . Believe me , my friends are loving it . lolIt came to my attention after needing to strain oil and also flour and 10X sugar that I did not have a versitale strainer . I remember my Grandmother had several and used them often but her 's either were to old or `` missing '' .After alot or contemplation over the various strainers available I decided on this oneOXO Good Grips 8-Inch Double Rod Strainer . So far it has actually exceeded my expectations.I have used it to strain the oil from the deep fryer and also to sift flour and also confectionary sugar ontoEbelskivers : Danish-Style Filled Pancakes And Other Sweet And Savory Treatsfor a finishing touch . I can not recommend the Ebelskivers high enough either . They are so light and airy and you can make them for any time of day meal . Do yourself a favor and check them out . Also , if you think you may like them , try theNorpro 3113 Cast-Aluminum Nonstick Aebleskiver Stuffed-Pancake Pan , works great and no mess clean up.Anyways , back to the strainer.It is a double mesh strainer which allows it to be so versitale . Cleaning is a snap by just rinising it in water after use.So , in conclusion , if you are looking for a strainer I recommend this one . Granted it may be a bit pricey but it will definitely replace any need to buy different mesh strainers or for that matter a flour sifter . The size is also ideal because you can do so many things with it without it being way to large or way to small .	1
I 'm not even sure what prompted me to buy this but I use it all the time so now I 'm wondering how I got along without it . I use it to wash rice and beans or anything else I want to strain the liquid from to make sauces . Under the heading of too much information my garbage disposal recently died and my sink has always been slow draining so I 've been using it to strain out the dredges from soaking pans . It 's disgusting but it helps keep the drain running . Fairly easy clean up .	1
I 've been using this strainer about every other day for a couple months now and it still looks brand new . It 's stayed very stiff and it 's the right length for setting across a standard double sink so you can pour your food into it without it falling over .	1
She loves it . Says it 's the best one she 's ever seen or used in her 84 years of life . Perfect size for straining all kinds of things . Lightweight , but sturdy .	1
I love this finer mesh for the sprouting that I do . The handle is good to sit in my sink and easy to clean .	1
I broke two strainers trying to make seedless blackberry jam , and everything else in the house had holes that were too large . I put the berries and the juice in the freezer and waited for this strainer to arrive . It 's perfect -- for everything you need a strainer for . It 's sturdy , has two layers of mesh and is the right size .	1
I had a collection of terrible strainers , all of which were either flimsy ( either in the rim or the strainer material ) , had holes that were too big or had cheap handles that became loose . This is the exact opposite of everything I hated about all those other strainers , so I tossed them all after trying this one a few times , and I 'll probably end up buying a second one .	1
It might seem expensive , but the quality is excellent , and I can tell it will last for years and years . The sieve is very fine and holds a lot -- great for my making yogurt cheese and baking needs . Really love this , and the handle is very comfortable , too ( as are most OXO tools ) . The little tip on the opposite side is terrific for supporting it in a bowl , something I consider essential but many sieves do n't have . This was worth every penny !	1
You always know you 're going to get a quality product with oxo good grips- nothing too fancy , but sturdy and well-built . This product is no exception . I use it for quinoa since it has mesh fine enough to not let any through .	1
I have owned any number of strainers over the years , but never one like this . It is thoughtfully designed and made of quality materials . I am looking forward to many years of service from this strainer .	1
Very fine strainer . Great job with straining quinoa , which can not be done in most sieves . Looks nice hanging on my pot rack .	1
I bought this today to strain my homemade yogurt . While it holds about 4 cups ultimately ( waited a bit for some of the whey to drain , then added more ) , it allowed more `` white '' to wash into the `` clear yellow '' whey than I would have preferred ... I think . I 'm planning to start making ricotta cheese from the leftover whey and I suppose that would capture the white milky yogurt that washed thru and convert it to ricotta . My yogurt usually is n't really runny before straining , either . However , after I strained the yogurt to the desired consistency , I took the remaining whey and sent it thru the gold mesh coffee filter and that captured most of what had escaped this OXO strainer . It IS a good quality . It IS large ... so large in fact , I 'm not sure how I 'd put it in the fridge overnight to make yogurt cheese . It would be helpful in the kitchen in other ways but where do I keep it in my very small kitchen ? It 's probably going back for a more compact model of yogurt strainer that 'll fit in the fridge.Update : OK , not going back . All the other yogurt strainers on the market are n't big enough or are too delicate . This holds enough that I can strain 2 qts . of yogurt at a time in about 20 min . It allows some white thru but like I said above , I 'm straining that thru the gold coffee filter into `` cream cheese . '' As far as storing it , I have n't had a chance to ! I keep on using it on other things - I love quinoa so ... Its temporary resting place is the dish drainer ; )	1
I bought this to replace an old strainer I had used for years that had belonged to my Mother . This OXO strainer was the closest I could find to what I had been using . It seems very well made and the mesh is secure in the handle and does not push out on the sides which will keep food from catching up under the rim.This is actually nicer than I expected it to be , I like it . It will be used for straining seeds out of fresh squeezed lemon/lime juices , pulp from making almond milk , and for any of the smaller jobs that do n't require a larger strainer . The little loop on the end helps this balance on bowls making it easy to pour your food without spilling . The handle has a nice grip that does n't get hot and is easy to hold . I have no doubt that this will last for years .	1
If you need a Strainer you ca n't go wrong with this one . It 's verysturdy and has an excellent rubber handle for easy gripping .	1
This is a great strainer . When I wrapped it up for my fianc & eacute ; and put it under the tree he knew what it was immediately . He was excited to get it and I love when he cooks for me so WIN WIN ! the quality of this product is good . Buy it , or regret it .	1
I use this to strain jars of fruit , boiled potatoes , etc . It 's a good size , not flimsy and has n't rusted.or had the mesh pull away from the rim . I 've had it for a long time and am just reviewing it now . Would definitely buy this again if it were lost ... meaning if my son or husband took it .	1
Somehow I 've managed to cook for 40 years without owning a strainer , yet now that I have this I find I 'm using it all the time . So much so that I hung it on the tool rack with the other everyday essentials . Great size , well made , sturdy , and even looks nice .	1
Excellent product ! Would make a wonderful wedding shower gift . If you have any cooks in your family or friends without this strainer , it would make a wonderful gift ! I 'm 64 and ca n't believe I was willing to pay this much for a strainer , but I 'd definitely do it again !	1
I bought this to strain quinoa that would 've slipped through the larger slits in my pasta colander . Gets the job done .	1
I went to a big chain store that sold several varieties of look-alike strainers . I tested them all by pushing down firmly on the mesh , approximating the amount of pressure I would use if I was trying to get the last juices out of meats and veggies from a homemade stock . The OXO was the only one that held together . On every other strainer , the screen came off the rim.I 've been using this strainer regularly for a year . I am quite impressed by it . It is still in perfect shape . There is no rust nor discoloration . The wire mesh is still perfectly intact , smooth and round ( unlike other strainers I 've owned that are riddled with dimples ) . The handle has not bent one bit . The mesh has also been fine enough for all of my needs , without having to also use a cheesecloth as I did with other strainers .	1
I find that all the items I get for my kitchen form the OXO brand are just perfect . It 's reliable and not expensive and the rubber handles that they always use are awesome , nothing slips and falls out of my hands . This is meant for sauces , to make them smooth and silky but I really use it for just about anything . The 6 '' diameter is large enough to strain potatoes and pasta , I usually do n't cook for an army so if I was feeding more than 2 -3 people I would get the large size as well , but so far this has worked out perfectly . I still want to get a nice colander but when I 'm draining something quickly this is easy to hold with one hand and pot or pan in other over the sink for a quick drain . The rubber handle takes the pressure of the hand and makes any job easier ; I can really hold everything in one hand without bending my wrist in unnatural angles.The mesh basket is very well made and tightly woven , it lets all the liquid through without a problem and I never loose any food since the spaces are very small . After months of use and washing the shape does n't have any dents in it and it 's a cinch to wash , overall I use this anytime I wash fruits or drain pasta , potatoes and any veggies , its great for soaking anything that I want to remove quickly and all at once , like dried mushrooms or beans and so far no rust . Heck , you can even put powder sugar in this or flour for baking and sieve it to perfection . I love buying kitchen tools and gadgets , problems is washing it all and running out of space , but its fun and it makes cooking and eating that much more pleasant.- Kasia S .	1
I got this for my chef in training daughter . She loves it and uses it all of the time . Well worth the money .	1
I love this bad boy , good handle , good size drainage , and it sits across bowls or pots really well . Glad I purchased it and would recommend it again , in a minute .	1
I have been strainerless for a few years . I have somehow muddled through , but now that I have this awesome strainer , I do n't see how I made it . Like most OXO products , this has a great grippy handle . The mesh is tight enough to catch even small chunks , and the strainer is large enough so I can balance it across my sink . Love it .	1
The size of this makes it perfect for what I use it for ; incorporating flour , baking soda , salt , baking powder , etc when baking . It 's large size make it a suitable substitution for a more expensive French tami . Unlike a tami this has the ability to be suspended over a bowl hands free . It 's also handy as a cooling sieve for freshly roasted coffee beans .	1
I love this strainer . It has everything I want , including : -wide enough span to sit across the sink ( very important in my book ! ) -fine enough mesh to strain something as fine as rice or even seeds from strawberry puree-sturdy construction-large enough to strain pasta for 6 peopleLove love love it .	1
I find I use this a lot to strain my plain whole milk yogurt overnight to make Greek yogurt , clean rice , rinse beans , etc . It 's the perfect size for so many things and fits my pots perfectly .	1
This strainer is pretty small . I bought this to replace my large strainer that 's many years old . The pictures of this one make it seem bigger than it is . First of all it 's pretty shallow , it maybe holds 2 pounds of hamburger to be strained , but likely it would tip on its own ( if you had it resting on the sink like I do . ) I would n't use this for pasta as it would overflow easily . It does have a great handle , and the opposing loop helps it sit in a sink . But I was hoping for something larger . Our old strainer easily holds double what this one does and had two prongs on the other side so that it would n't tip when rested on a bowl or the sink .	1
perfect . It strains quinoa which is a devil to get thru anything else . before I had this I would sorta smush it till the water came out..this solved the problem and also helped me w/boiling pastina .	1
I cook a lot , so needed to replace my existing strainer . This one is very sturdy and well made . It 's large , but I 'd rather have the large one ( that would still handle smaller quantities ) , than a smaller one that would n't handle bigger tasks .	1
The build is quality and a decent strainer . I just wish the mesh was a little finer to filter more out . Does do a good job though overall .	1
The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is its limited use and capacity ! Handy to have around for small tasks where only one hand is required . Easily cleans . Nice grip that does n't slide .	1
High quality fine mesh strainer . Works great for anything you need to double strain like soups . Has a nice loop that rests against the pot and a comfortable handle .	1
I have two of these sized strainers . They 're perfect for berries or straining soup or rinsing rice . I use them for everything !	1
Another excellent kitchen utensil from OXO , this strainer is great in many ways . In additional to use when sifting , it is useful as a colander . Sturdy , good quality finish . I expect many years of use from this utensil .	1
This is a nice size to take care of just about every need I would use it for in my cooking . I 'm glad I chose this one versus a smaller one since I usually cook larger batches of items for storing later . Ca n't wait to use it to make homemade ice creams !	1
I wanted a strainer that would serve to rinse tiny grains of quinoa.My own strainer would n't work and I could n't find a better one in any local store . This strainer is large enough and filters well enough to do this task .	1
This is an absolutely perfect size . It is not so big that you wo n't find a place to store it , but large enough to hold a bunch of angel hair pasta that would slip right out of the little holes in a traditional colander . It also fits over the sink so that I can pour the pasta ( or whatever I 'm draining ) right into it , water and all , and have the water drain into the sink.It does n't say in the description , but this is a double weave strainer . In other words , there are two layers of thin metal mesh to ensure even the smallest seeds and particles are caught in the net.It has a traditional soft black rubber Oxo handle , too . This is important when using it over the sink as it keeps it from slipping around when the water hits it.Nice !	1
I 'm an OXO girl so I have never had a problem with any product or item I have purchased . Love my oxo 's !	1
If you 're straining stock or broth , this is a real time saver . You do n't need to bother with cheesecloth -- this double rod strainer gives you a very clear product . It 's nicely made , and will probably last a long time .	1
I love this strainer , it is top notch and high quality ! Spend the money for quality items and no regrets !	1
This thing strains it all ! Seriously . I had grounds in my coffee last weekend and instead of what I normally do ( put a filter over my cup and wait ) I grabbed this and boom ! No ants in my coffee !	1
Did n't realize how sad my old strainer was until I bought this as a gift for my future son in law . Went back and bought another for myself.It is sturdy , has nice fine mesh , and actually reaches across my sink to balance completely .	1
What rapture . What joy . A gizmo that works like it should . OXO products are the best . Merry Christmas to all .	1
I purchased this to replace my antiquaited bent melon baller that I have had for over 20 years . This new new has a great hand/weight feel , soft handle for marathon balling and clean edges for even balling with ease . I have many OXO tools on my baking/cooking apron . Very happy with my purchase .	1
It works so well and easily . Very easy to use . It has a tiny , tiny hole in at the most apex portion of the curved metal which it brilliant so that after you wash it , water does n't hold . I 'm assuming the hole may be for other purposes as well , such as ease released of the fruit . I mainly use it to core my apples and wow , how convenient ! !	1
This product is amazing . I can use it to cut watermelon into serving size pieces with no trouble ! Also , OXO makes durable products .	1
The two different sizes are why I use this one . I use the small to remove seeds . The larger end I use to make perfect melon balls for a pretty fruit salad .	1
This does what is supposed to- it takes some practice to get the technique of making nice fruit balls but works well .	1
Not that I can use it very well , but it makes balls out of melons . Sturdy , good grip , I actually use it for baking purposes more than making melon balls . Many uses for this fine tool.EDIT : It also cores apples ! ! ! Just cut the apple in half and use the baller to scoop out the core .	1
I love Good Grips products since they 're well-made and built to last . This melon baller has been working well for us so far , and I love how it has two sizes on it.In addition to using this for melons , I 've also been using it to make protein balls . It 's the perfect size for them !	1
My purpose in ordering it was to pit Cherry Tomatoes but , as has been mentioned by others , one keeps discovering uses for it that you had n't thought off . The rim on both ends is sharp enough to easily cut through the flesh of both vegetables and fruit which is a plus . It has a firm grip , heavy enough to allow one to feel they 're in control but not so heavy as to make it cumbersome to use . I 'd order one even if on the moment I had no particular use for it . Eventually you will and you 'll be glad you had it on hand .	1
This is great for making melon balls or scooping out an apple core . My mom destroyed or swiped my melon baller and left me with her old and rusty one . I love it so much I had to buy another one . I keep it at work to core apples . I think I 'll need to buy another for at home and maybe a 4th for a present for my mom : )	1
I 've used it for cookies and I have used it to core apples to make apple tarts . I 've also used it for watermelon and honey dew . I 've used it to scoop ice cream.I even use it as a spoon . possibilities are limitless . I think i paid almost $ 10 for it which is alot for a metal spoon with plastic handle but so far , it 's worth the every penny .	1
That 's not technically true , but I do like it.I read some other reviews about how the double sided thing digs into wrists or something ? I 've never once had that problem . Maybe if you are trying to ball set concrete or some other extremely hard substance that could be an issue , but since melon is generally the softest substance known to man I can not imagine a situation in which you would need to exert enough pressure that even if you decided to hold the baller with the unused end pressed against your writs arteries that there would be discomfort . Maybe I 'm just good at holding things.Really , though , my wife uses it more than I do and she ' never had a complaint . It 's a melon baller . If you are unimpressed , maybe you should examine your melon balling expectations and see if you might be setting the bar a bit too high .	1
Works like a charm , and I love the easy grip- very comfortable to hold and use . My fruit salads look so fancy now . Got ta love it .	1
This tool will make you eat more melons ! Beware ! The handle 's material provides the perfect grip during use because your hands will get unavoidably wet and slippery with melon juices . Great product	1
It scoops them out fine . I do n't have a technique when doing it so the balls do n't look like the way caterers get them to look . I have seen other people use melon ballers and this was my first time using one so not sure if all melon ballers are like this but I found the balls did n't slide out , I had to push them out with my finger . Again , I 'm a newbie baller and not sure if that is standard for melon ballers . I subtracted a star because I had to push them out with my finger but I can add it back if that is standard when it comes to balling .	1
My daughter loves to entertain and didnt have a mellon baller so I ordered this for her . Its sturdy and has both sizes .	1
Great melon baller . I used it for watermelons for our bbq . Great handle and grip and it 's dish wash safe .	1
I have had several OXO peelers , and this is the best so far . It looks great , cuts great and is very easy to hold . It is very sharp out of the box , and after 6 months of use it is still going strong .	1
I 've reviewed all my SteeL products 5-stars . Well built , comfortable in the hand and does the job they were made for . This peeler is no exception .	1
These OXO kitchen tools have proven to be amazing ! I have yet to find anything that compares . I have always dreaded using peelers , they always catch , get blocked by debris or just feel cheap and dangerous . At least until I used this one . We have a few different peelers for when working together in the kitchen , and we always `` fight '' over who gets to use this one . As for quality , it has n't rusted or shown any defects in almost two years of use . This includes throwing it in the dishwasher ! The handle is large , comfortable and easy to grip . The blade cuts smoothly across the fruits and vegetables , flowing with the shape of whatever you 're peeling.I was so impressed , I have a cart full of their products ready to buy when I move into my new house . Not only has this piece performed flawlessly , but the entire set I received has too . I can only imagine how well the rest of their products will serve me.Whether for yourself or a gift ( or both ) , OXO wo n't disappoint !	1
I 've had this peeler for over a year now , and use it frequently . Being from Maine , and living in a beautiful area of small farms , I always felt a bit guilty that I rarely made mashed potatoes , potato salad etc. , as I HATED to peel potatoes , even local ones.This peeler changed that ! I find the large , yet comfortably curved handle is very comfortable to grip , much more so than Y shaped peelers or even Oxo 's other `` Good Grips '' line . The rubber grip on the sides makes it less likely to slide from your hand than plastic or solid metal handled peelers.The blade is VERY sharp . Yes , this can be dangerous if you are not careful ; however , I 've learned first hand a sharp blade is less dangerous than a dull blade ( ouch ) . And it is , after all , a kind of knife designed to cut the skins from vegetables.The blade swivels freely , closely following the shape of the vegetable , and the gap in the blade is wide enough that the skins do n't get jammed in , requiring frequent removal.All in all I think this is a great peeler , and I include it with my standard wedding/housewarming gift of kitchen gadgets . I highly recommend it .	1
My father worked as a `` soda jerk '' when he was in high school and he taught me the trick of dipping the scooper in a glass of water so that the ice scoops fall out more easily.I find this one works well but after the first scoop , the other ones tend to stick and the the little push from the lever is n't enough to get the ice cream free.It 's comfortable , easy to use , and makes nicely shaped scoops . If you were looking to buy it just because of the lever you might be able to get do with a glass of water when you scoop .	1
Excellent buy will last awhile if your looking for a scoop that last awhile here it is NO DOUBT . So enjoy makes life easier on your wrist and arms .	1
Our last Ice Cream Scooper was from the $ store and it was adequate at best - hard ice cream would always bend the scooper out of place . I wanted a more rugged scoop for those harder ice creams and this does the trick . The lever in the scoop was an added bonus , and usually pops it out .	1
The OXO brand is easy to trust with kitchen gadgets . The serrated edge of this pie server helps cut the crust if you do n't get it with the knife on the first go-round .	1
I have a drawer full of OXO kitchen tools so I definitely am impressed by OXO 's product line . Good quality , comfort , effectiveness , and smart design are the hallmarks of OXO and this tool is no exception.Ideally this is the size of a perfect wedge of pie . It has a comfortable handle and is made of a sturdy grade of stainless steel . It is flexible enough to make a non-messy first cut and it can slide under to pick up the last piece of pie . It has a serrated edge that produces a nice cut and it washes up nicely by hand or dishwasher without staining.It also has a hole in the handle which is perfect for hanging on a rack.Overall , a great pie cutter which can handle a hefty wedge of pie .	1
Good value for the money . Does exactly what it is supposed to do . Serrated edge OK to cut most pies . Easy to clean .	1
You might think it strange that someone could get excited and stay excited over an item as mundane as a pie server . Well , I have to admit that while not `` jumping up and down '' excited , I do happen to be moderately stimulated over this server , very fond of it , and do appreciate the fact that I own one.Now my wife and I do a lot of cooking ; we each have our particular specialties . As it should happen , pies are hers and I never tread on her turf when it comes to preparing or baking one . ( This would include cobblers and the like also ) ; but , that being said , I do serve them , both to family and guest.We do have quite a number of servers about our place ; stuck in drawers and in our baking center . I always seem to reach for this one first though.To begin with , I like the feel of the chunky handle . I feel it gives me more control over what I am doing . It is simply the most comfortable server we own . I like the double serrated blades , which are actually quite handy , especially when you are dealing with large cobbler type dishes of serving consistency . ( By that I mean that some of these dishes are much better served with a large spoon ) . One of the best features of this kitchen tool though is the strength . As advertised , it is flexible , but it must be noted that the blade is extremely strong ... probably the strongest of all our servers , even the high-end ones . To serve a pie correctly , you do not want something that bends around under slight pressure like a chunk of thin plastic ... .no , you need a blade with a bit of substance to it , a blade that means business . This one delivers . It is of stainless steel and cleans up very nicely in the dishwasher . As I am the primary dishwasher in our family , this last fact is extremely important to me . We have a number of old wooden handled servers , which I would not trade for anything , but they are a real pain to wash.This is a very attractive pie server . It looks very sleek without looking snobby , but at the same time has a very `` professional '' look to it . It looks and feels like a kitchen tool should ... attractive , yet extremely utilitarian.I will not lie to you ; I am a big fan of Oxo products . I have very seldom ever been disappointed in any of them and as a matter of fact , they have usually been much , much better than the makers claim they are ... a rare thing these days . This server is not different . It is an excellent product.Note : The server we presently are using is our third . The two previous ones ( Sigh , they were like members of our family , I tell you . ) , both `` disappeared '' at church suppers . Now I am not saying ... ... ..Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
I thought the small serrated edge looked wimpy but it cut through a very dense crust with no problems . It 's a sturdy piece .	1
Love this pie server . So far so good . I gave it a five star because the price is just fair , the grip is good and does its job perfectly .	1
As with all oxo products , this item is quality made , and attractive being part of their new steel line . It is the perfect size for a slice of pie , and the rather sharp serrated edges on both sides make for easy digging into . If you 're a fan of oxo products , you 'll love this one . Now you can have your pie and eat it too !	1
I know of no finer pie slicer . It works and looks very good and I would heartily recommend it to all .	1
Most oxo products are awesome ; this one is no exception . It cuts very well and looks nice , too . Very high quality . Comfortable to use . I have oxo 's good grips nylon pie server for my non-stick and cast-iron pans , but it 's nice to have two to choose from depending on the job . As great as the nylon one is , it 's just not as strong and ca n't cut quite as clear of a line . So I recommend both .	1
Love this - just what I was looking for . It cuts well ( the edges are serrated ) , and it has the weight & rigidity you want when dishing out a slice of pie . Very happy with it.November 2012 Update : This server is still going strong , 5 years later ( and many times through the dishwasher ) , and it was just top-rated AGAIN by the folks at Cook 's Illustrated ! Ca n't go wrong with this server , and at such a good price , too .	1
The item does what it 's supposed to . It seems very well constructed and is a more sturdy piece than many others . Highly recommended !	1
If I 'm looking for a new little kitchen tool , I always turn to OXO . They 're affordable and high quality . Sure , there are higher quality products out there , but again , I need affordable . This little pie server is perfect . It has nice sharp edges for cutting slices , the server is thin , sturdy and broad enough to pull out a chunk of pie , it washes easily , and the handle is sturdy . Love it !	1
Sturdy , nice feel to the handle . Stays cool even when left in a boiling pot . Does n't flex when stirring hearty items . Stylish look . Comes out of the dishwasher nice and clean . Intended to use it as a serving spoon , but use it for lots of purposes.Update May09Still love it . I focus on value shopping - does n't have to be cheap , but must deliver value that justifies the price . This delivers .	1
I 've been rating all the SteeL utensils 5 stars as they work nice , feel substantial and comfortable and give me the impression they 'll be around my kitchen for a long time . This spoon fits in with the rest of the tools I picked up .	1
I like this brand . The handle is a good weight and it 's sturdy . The only glitch is that the spoon is a little smaller than expected .	1
When you 're using something like this , what can you say ? It 's a nice design ? Hey , it 's a slotted spoon and designed to be a spoon with holes in it . OK , it scoops food ; so what ? Well , this just has a darn good feel to it when I 'm scooping food . Best I 've had . It 's as simple as that . Ai n't this all that counts ? Well , sure , it 's durable . You can see that .	1
I am very happy with this quality and construction of this product . And I love that it is dishwasher safe .	1
This masher is outstanding . When I first saw this unique design I was doubtful that the masher would work . But it does ! The masher is very sturdy ; the handle comfortable to grip . It is also easy to clean . This tool will easily mash potatoes , other vegetables and fruits easily and quickly . An excellent tool for any kitchen .	1
You can always rely on OXO to deliver a practical , long-lasting kitchen tool for a very reasonable price . The OXO Steel Potato Masher is a attractive and quite sturdy . I 've only owned it for a few weeks , but I can tell it will last for years and years . It 's dishwasher safe and very comfortable to use thanks to the rubber molding on the sides of the handle.I actually bought it to mash things other than potatoes though . I find a potato ricer ( OXO makes an excellent one ) is the better tool for mashed potatoes . If you use this masher for potatoes , it will work well for chunky mashed potatoes ; but if you try to keep mashing them down to a more creamy conistency , you will end up with very dense and gluey potatoes . A potato ricer will leave you with the lightest and fluffiest mashed potatoes with no chunks . Still , I 'd recommend buying this or one day 'll you end up trying to make applesauce with a bent spatula , like me .	1
How can you go wrong with a potatoe masher LOL ... ... ... ... ..it works great nice and sturdy very happy with my purchase	1
This is great ! I have n't had a masher in years and this one is just perfect - the right size , not too big - works in a small or large bowl , is sturdy , comfortable to grip , and will easily mash your potatoes or squash or whatever you fancy in a few simple strokes . Fits in a regular kitchen drawer for storage .	1
I have always had cheap potato mashers that either bent or broke . But , like most things , you get what you pay for . This is why I decided to go with this one . It does n't bend or flex when you are mashing , and I use it for potatoes as well as other things like bananas and beans . I wash it in the dishwasher and have had no problems . A little pricey , but you might as well get something quality that will last a long time .	1
I chose 5 stars because this product is very sturdy , great design . It mashed potatoes extremely well and it does the work not the person mashing . I would recommend this for anyone who does n't have an electric beater or who sometimes wants the texture from the old fashioned way of mashing .	1
This is my first masher and it did n't disappoint . This is a great potato masher that is easy to use , ergonomic , and best of all for me , easy to clean . It rinses off easily with the kitchen sink sprayer and also cleans nicely in the dishwasher . I have found that this masher is definitely worth the money ! It will last forever , it seems ! Happy mashing !	1
After struggling with my old Zyliss ( emphasis on the Old ) , this OXO works effortlessly . Now I actually enjoy opening cans .	1
After sucking it up and paying more than $ 3 for a can opener , I can honestly say I 'm glad I did . Have been using it for daily for a year and it works so well . If it ever breaks , I am buying a copy .	1
Does it 's job effortlesly . Would have gotten 5 stars but the handles are somewhat flimsy and for the price they should have been more rigid , I think.It is good enough that I put my electric opener away however .	1
For a hand can opener , this is easily the best that I have ever operated . There are no worries about electricity with a hand opener and this one works like a dream and , hopefully , will be the last one that I buy.l	1
Got tired of an electric can opener that was a pain to keep clean & took up counter space . Bought other battery & hand openers that we ended up throwing away . This opener is almost easier than an electric . It does n't get the very last piece of the lid , but just twisting it gets it off .	1
Great product ! Easy to use , have only used it a few times but seems very sturdy , is very easy to turn .	1
Hands down , this is the best can opener I 've used in my entire life . The large handle makes opening any can so easy . The quality is top-notch ... I think this will last many , many years . I used to buy cheap $ 1 can openers at the dollar store . After I broke the 10th one I realized the stupidity of those cheap products . The Oxo can opener is a superior product that will outlive cheap can openers by 20 times the product life . Buy it !	1
Have had a fees different can openers over the years , see this one and decided to try it , had it for several months now and am very happy with it , easy to turn and opens the cans well ! !	1
I almost did n't get this because I thought it was a tad spendy for a can opener , but I 'm so glad I decided to just get it . We have been using the same rusted out-hard to open up can opener forever . Always saying we need a new can opener but never getting one . The first time using this we said to ourselves how dumb we were to wait so long to get a new one . This one works fantastically . So smooth and quick and effortless to open a can . It 's the perfect weight and looks sharp too . This is definitely one of those you get what you pay for lesson learned situations .	1
I am 71 and have carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndromes of the right hand/arm . This can opener is a joy to use and requires not much strength to open a can . Did n't want an electric can opener sitting out all the time and they wind up not working after a while anyway . The manual cheapies are hard to work and I 've gone through about 5 . So stupid since I would have saved money just paying up front for a good one . Ca n't tell you how pleased I am with this OXO can opener . It 's worth the money .	1
I bought this to replace a new electric hand held opener that had been stashed away for years ( it operated so slow I figured a manual one would be faster ) . The OXO opener is absolutely so easy for my arthritic hands to use . A little pricey compared to the model under it but I keep mine on the counter top so this one really looks nice . VERY satisfied .	1
I bought this to replace the can opener that I have had for around seven years maybe ? It had finally gotten to where it would not grab at all no matter how you held it . It had seen extensive use though.Looked at most things available and settled on the OXO mainly because of customer reviews and the fact that I own several other OXO products and they have yet to be disappointed . I look forward to years of use out of this set and plus it looks cool too .	1
I do n't know what took me so long to replace my crappy old can opener ! ! ! This one is beautiful , well made and works like a dream . Excellent product ... you wo n't be sorry .	1
If you are tired of electric openers that do n't , and flimsy hand units that strip out their gears after only a few cans o ' tuna , you need this product . It is a finely crafted , well balanced solid unit . It makes me think of teutonic surgical instruments , or picking up a 7-10 split . Cans quake in fear at its mere appearance . It slices through can tops like some metallic surfer carving the galaxy . It is truly a samurai katana of a can opener . Do n't balk , just buy it , you 'll find yourself grinning like a winner every time you reach for it . I built a special velvet-lined walnut case for mine , with a digital music chip that plays `` Running With The Devil '' by Van Halen every time I open it .	1
I got this and my first impression was how sturdy it felt . It has a nice hefty feel to . When I started using I was not disappointed in the least . The mechanisms that cut the can are nice and snug to the can making it a breeze to open . Electric openers might be easier to use but when you consider space requirements this is the way to go .	1
I just got this can opener and it works so well ! I hardly buy anything in a can , just tuna fish for my cat . So I just need something handy about once a week . The last one I had just got so dull , this one is fantastic . so easy ! ! !	1
I originally purchased an oxo 20362 which , being plastic , was too flimsy.This OXO is definitely the best can opener I 've had and should last a very long time.Very comfortable . Very durable . Very stylish . Does the job .	1
I purchased a new can opener on a whim a few years ago at a local grocery store , and it worked well for the most part ; however , I put it in the dishwasher a few too many times and it was shot . I searched online for a can opener that would last me longer , having learned my lesson and knowing to only hand wash moving forward , and I stumbled upon this one . I have to say , I 'm impressed . I 've only just begun to use it , but it 's the nicest one i 've ever used . The ease of use is impressive , and it 's very comfortable in my small hands too ! All in all , i 'm a fan . I will have to see how well it stands the test of time , but for now , i 'm happy .	1
I purchased this can opener as our old one started lose grip on the cans while opening . I checked out Amazon website to see what 's available and came across this one.Very pleased with the purchase . Light weight , works very well and quite affordable for its performance.As others mentioned , it sure beats electric can openers , which are hard to clean and often starts to malperform after a year or two .	1
I ran across this opener at a friend 's house and could n't believe how easy it made can opening . I 've had many different can openers over the last 35 years ( electric , battery , & manual ) and this one is the absolute best I 've ever used compared to them all . It turns can opening into child 's play . Everything is relative , but I actually enjoy using it . : - )	1
It always seemed like I needed a new can opener every year . They would get nasty , dull , harder to use , the crank would break , etc . Not so with the OXO . Originally purchased 4yrs ago , and it still looks and works the same as it always did . A very good investment , having easily outlasted every other one I 've bought and will continue to do so for a good long time to come .	1
It is easier for us to open cans . Both of us have arthritis in our hands . No problems with the quality after 6 weeks .	1
It 's a can opener ... How difficult is this ... I really like the feel of the knob it seems cushioned and fits a mans hand .	1
I 've always been a Swing-A-Way guy myself , but when my mom asked for a `` good can opener '' I did a bit of investigating and this one seemed to get the highest marks all around.She found it perfect from the first can . Apparently , all the excitement generated over this unit in the can opener category is earned.A great purchase , and I 'll be sure to get another for her summer home and for myself .	1
I 've had this opener for a couple I years now and it is amazingly easy . I bought one for my 80+ year old family members and they use it with ease ! It 's a high quality product that will last !	1
I went from an electric to this product and I have no regrets . It fits great in the utensil drawer and looks great with everything else that is stainless steel in my kitchen . Also a very good price .	1
OXO has so many great products and this is one of them . Easy to use , quick and efficient . Getting another one for backup !	1
Remember , in a power outage , the manual can opener still works , heh . And they are quieter . This one is so much better than the cheap types I 've subjected myself to in the past . This one opens cans when I squeeze and turn the finger-friendly handle - that 's all I wanted , and that 's what I got . Stainless and easy to clean . It looks nice enough to hang up . Very satisfied .	1
several uses and no problems at all , no rust ... . the big soft handle makes opening cans a breeze . would highly recommend .	1
Smooth function , little rust in the 2 years we 've had it . Still looks nice . does the job well . OK then	1
Sturdy , well made . Easy to use ( Ihave carpal tunnel syndrome , so I need kitchen gadgets that are easy to use . )	1
These OXO kitchen tools have proven to be amazing ! I have yet to find anything that compares . This can opener is so smooth to operate and just wo n't fail . As for quality , it has n't rusted or shown any defects in almost two years of use . This includes throwing it in the dishwasher ! The handle is large , easy to grip and turns without effort.I was so impressed , I have a cart full of their products ready to buy when I move into my new house . Not only has this piece performed flawlessly , but the entire set I received has too . I can only imagine how well the rest of their products will serve me.Whether for yourself or a gift ( or both ) , OXO wo n't disappoint !	1
This can opener consistently and easily does the job . The large handle is soft and gives great leverage , and it holds tight while cutting through the lid.A can opener is a basic kitchen tool , it 's amazing how many I 've used that fail at their only intended task.This one has been going strong since 2011 and works as well as the day I got it . Highly recommended .	1
This can opener has been with us for about two years now and I ca n't say I have any complaints about it . The handles with rubber grips are substantial and sturdy . The can opening device ( teeth ? ) has ( have ) not bent or given way to any cans . And , the knob has been made of durable plastic , so it has n't chipped or flaked . We typically do n't put this in the dishwasher , and I would n't really see the need to -- hot soapy water works just fine . Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to replace their can opener .	1
This is an absolutely superb can opener . It 's so easy to use a four-year old child could operate it and makes opening cans about as much work as eating a bowl of ice cream . We had another OXO can opener previously , but this one is by far the downright best can opener we 've ever owned . I would highly recommend it if you want to make opening cans as easy as taking a breath of air .	1
This is the best can opener I have ever used . Works well on both small and very large cans . Handle turns easily . I like the stainless steel cutter .	1
This is the BEST manual can opener I 've ever used ! Pierces cans so easily I had to make sure it really did ! Great on those small and rectangular ( sardine , oyster , anchovie etc . ) cans too . The the large handles make it easy to use and easy on your hands and fingers . Built solidly and it looks like it should last forever . Cleaned up great in the dishwasher .	1
This thing is solid , well constructed with no looseness and makes opening a can an almost enjoyable experience . I 've had a lot of can openers that start getting to be more of a battle with continued use . One of them , with a very recognizable brand name , started jumping off the track a few times around the top of the can and it became very hard to turn the knob . The OXO feels fabulous , smooth , very easy to turn , it 's just a great can opener ! Bring on the cans ! ! ! ! ! Highly recommended and worth the extra money . The Mercedes-Benz of can openers ! ! I also bought one as a gift . I like to make homemade chili and with the tomato sauces , canned tomatoes , three kinds of canned beans , canned paste , it was becoming a real chore opening all of those cans ... .now ... .it 's a breeze . Get this ! It 's the best .	1
We love this can opener . We have been married 32 years and this by far is the best can opener we have ever owned !	1
What can you say , it opens my cans effortlessly . It has a nice large handle that is easy to use . My wife is taking chemo therapy and she has some necropathy in her finger tips and she can use this opener easily .	1
When it came time to buy , it was a choice between this one or an electric one . I chose this one simply because in thinking this would be easier to keep clean than a electric can opener . Plus really , , , , how often do ya open cans ? ? ? For me , not much . So buying a manual can opener made more since . Anyways , , , , , , effortless to use and being solidly built makes it a good buy ... . : )	1
This manual can opener works like a charm . I have had it for about a month , so I ca n't comment on its longevity ( but there are reviews on amazon from several years ago , so that 's a good sign ) . I did n't want to deal with an electric or a rechargeable , since they are more likely to fail.It is easy to grip . It sets on the lid of the can easily . And turning the knob to open the can is effortless . It has some weight to it , which makes it feel well made and solid . I 'm hoping that it will last a long time.I have had the following can openers recently : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Black & Decker KEC600 Cordless Can Opener* It failed after 2 years due to rechargeable battery going dead.Good Cook Orbi SafeCut Can Opener* It failed after 2 years ; the teeth no longer gripped the can.Amco Swing-A-Way* Had 2 of these ; old ones . The teeth no longer gripped the can.I bought the `` Oxo SteeL Can Opener '' because of all the good reviews on amazon . So far , I am very pleased with my purchase . Amazon was the seller . `` Seek ye the LORD while he may be found , call ye upon him while he is near : '' ( Isaiah 55:6 )	1
This is an easy to use can opener that opens cans flawlessly . There is not much to say as it does what it is supposed to do .	1
This opener deserves all the praise it has received from other reviewersI have arthritis in my hands and although I rarely use canned items , I do need one to open dog food and this opener is so very easy to use that I wish I had more cans to open .	1
This critter opens 8 cat food cans a day , day-in and day-out along with an assortment of pantry products for the family . Looks like I need a second one because we all wait at the dishwasher for the dry cycle.So far , it has held out over a year with no rust or fading.Only drawback is that the opener has cut off more cat whiskers than my p-38.G.I . P-38 Can Openers ( 15 Pack )	1
All my previous purchases were the lower end of the OXO Can Opener . I decided to buy this more expensive model because the rubber handle portion is only towards the end of the handle . My other OXO can Opener broke at the joint of the rubber and the stainless steel although I used it for several years . I believe this model be the best choice . I would recommend it to my friends and other relatives	1
I grew up with electric can openers that inevitably broke or had a hard time attaching to the can , then the contents often spilled as I removed it from the magnetic holder . Back then the alternative was a hand-held manual one that was actually painful to use.After marrying we bought an electric can opener which broke soon thereafter . While waiting for the day when it was to be repaired ( which ended up being never ) , I bought this OXO manual can opener thinking it would be a temporary and inexpensive solution . It is awesome . We have been using ours for about 5 years and it is still going strong . It is fast , easy to use , and comfortable . There is no pain or discomfort when holding it . It cuts the can cleanly and is just plain easier to use than electric can openers . We are sticking with the OXO can opener and not going back to electric openers.I highly recommend this can opener , ditch your electric can opener and make things easier on yourself !	1
I thouhgt about buying the one touch can opener till I read the reviews . This had good reviews and I still liked a manual can opener . This one is great . It turns very easily and thats what I was looking for . The only upgrade it could have had would have been a magnet to hold the lid of the can , instead it leaves a tiny bit of the lid attached so it does n't fall into the food . So I guess it 's 4 ++ and to me that equals a 5 .	1
We have used manual can openers for years with great success . We decided to replace our last one as the cutter wheel was getting dull with age . Because of the reviews we decided to try this one and it was delivered a couple of weeks ago.Having lived with it for awhile we have found it to be easy to use and comfortable to hold . It is small enough to fit in a drawer out of sight but substantial enough to tackle any can we 've tried it on.The larger handle does make opening the can somewhat easier as it spreads the pressure over a wider area of the hand.I recommend it for all .	1
I 've never quite gotten `` the hang '' of electric can openers -- if I get the can open , it 's truly LUCK -- not SKILL . Decided to return to a good old-fashioned can opener , but since they can be hard to turn at times , I decided to splurge on this one . It is soooo well worth the extra money . I just love Oxo 's squirting dish brush ( the only one I 've ever used that does n't leak ! ) , & I will definitely try more of their products . Truly impressive .	1
I purchased this for my mom who has issues with her hands . The large handles are comfortable and it consistently opens can without having to go around multiple times . Would purchase again !	1
The large knob on this can opener makes it easier to use than the other can openers that we have . Price and delivery were good . Highly recommended .	1
After going through about a dozen cheap can openers , I finally broke down and decided to invest in a good one . This thing is AMAZING . I mean - it actually opens the cans , and you do n't need to be Hercules to use it . I 've had it for several years and it was worth every single penny .	1
This can opener is freaking ridiculously awesome ! I never thought that I 'd be amped up to write a review for a can opener , but after using it , I felt obligated to share with my Amazon brethren just how great this little gadget is . First of all , before buying this particular can opener , I scoured Amazon for several other can openers with good reviews in the hope that I would end up buying one that worked great . In fact , I had initially began my search for an electric can opener as my old one bit the dust . However , after about an hour of searching and comparing electric can openers , I came to the conclusion that they all had their flaws and that none were a guaranteed good purchase . Fortunately , at the end of my search , I wound up viewing the Oxo Steel Can Opener . After reading the description , viewing the picture , and subsequently reading the reviews , I came to the conclusion that a manual can opener is a better choice and that the Oxo CO was the best on the market.Thankfully , the customer reviews did not let me down . Once the can opener arrived I broke out a large can of soup and put it in action . Whoa ! I was shocked . The can opener was so smooth that I was n't sure if it was even opening the can , but sure enough , at the end of the slice the can was opened perfectly . The ability to slice through the can is due to an attached hard plastic knob protruding from the side of the can opener which acts as a wrench . The wrench-esque knob enables you to slice through the can by effortlessly twisting it.Potential buyers should know a few things about this can opener . 1 . ) It fits your hand perfectly and comfortably . 2 . ) There is no extra strength required as the can opener slices through the tin top like a warm knife cutting through butter . 3 . ) The ease of opening cans can not be overstated as many disabled or elderly people have a weak grip . Making things easy for these people is the fact that the Oxo CO does not require you to put a death grip on the can with one hand and then strain to crank on the knob with the other hand like many other manual CO 's do.In summation : If you are thinking about buying this item , do yourself a favor and get it .	1
This OXO can opener seems to be well made and most of all makes can opening a breeze . I 've gone through a lot of can openers and hope this one stays sharp and lasts . It 's not dishwasher safe , but is easy to wash by hand with a little soap and water and dry thoroughly . It does not have the made in China stamp on it .	1
I have owned this can opener for a couple years now . It is the best one I have ever used considering both handheld and electric units . It is very easy to use and cleans up nicely in the dishwasher . Looks like it should last longer than I will .	1
I have gone through so many can openers over the years . I keep them clean , I keep them dry , I do n't use them as weapons . However , after a few months , they get cranky , and in less then a year , they stop working all together , and I have to get a new one . I 've tried cheap ones , and even some pricey ones , and they 're all the same . So far , this OXO can opener has lasted the longest . It 's outlasted all of them , and has not even started getting difficult yet . I 'm very excited . Time will ultimately tell , but I can say this is the best one I 've owned so far .	1
Okay , my old rusty can opener died after many years of use . It was rusty , the teeth were wearing off , and it slipped and skipped when opening a can , resulting in frustration , scuffed knuckles , and a few cuss words . Being a cheapskate , I was trying to stretch the life as long as possible , but finally it gave up the ghost . While I was looking for a replacement I found this thing and read its many rave reviews . I 'm thinking `` it 's just a damn can opener , not a ginzu knife , why all the fuss ? `` I bought this , based on all the rave reviews , thinking `` What I sucker I am , I could get a can opener like my old one for ten bucks , I 'm paying double that for this thing '' but I went ahead and got it.I have been using this for six months now , and can attest that it is worth every penny . It is very easy to `` start '' , getting a good grip and `` bite '' into the can lid . It has a smooth action , is easy to turn , and there is no slipping or skipping . The handle is shaped so that it is easy to grip , and is does not dig into your hand or stress your fingers as my old one did . My wife and teenage daughter find it easy to use and easy on the hands.It washes up easily by hand or dishwasher , and is well made so there is no rust or other deterioration.On top of all that it looks great ! I highly recommend it .	1
We 've been using an electric can opener for years now , and it 's all of a sudden decided to stop going around the can rim . I contemplated getting another electric opener , but saw all the great reviews for this one and figured I 'd give it a try . I was definitely not disappointed . It works much easier and quicker than an electric opener does ! Very smooth can opening , no jagged edges to mess with , and , like I stated , much quicker than an electric . It 's a tad expensive but well worth the money . I would highly recommend this product -- good for kids and adults with hand difficulties too !	1
it does a great job of opening cans . why am i even commenting on that ? well ... i have owned a few can openers over the years and was quite surprised at just how difficult it was to find one that worked liked it was supposed to . this one is easy to crank and it stays on the lid and does n't track off or skip places . it does what it is supposed to do and now days , any item that actually works as advertised is a rare thing !	1
We had an old can opener that well , did n't open the cans as one would like . I have been trying more and more OXO products , and was pleased to find the can opener . It turns so easlly and the cans open so smoothly . I have been careful not to put it in the dishwaster . Just rinse and set out to dry .	1
Oxo does it again . Easy on the hands , just make sure to hold it closed or it will slip off the can .	1
After using cheaper can openers this was a breath of fresh air ! It 's so comfortable and effortless to opens cans now .	1
Let me just say that I love this so much that I want to marry it . WAY easier to use than even electric can openers which sometimes fail to attach properly and the can falls off . But please do n't tell my blender . I once pledged my love to it as well .	1
Are n't can openers such a pain ? You have to have one around , but they always fall short of expectations because they 're either too hard to use , too hard to clean , or in the case of the electric ones , they just stop working . Until now ! This can opener is easy to use , does n't hurt my hand to crank , and wo n't break down like my electric . In fact , since my electric one gets so messy after each use , I just pull this one out of the drawer instead . No sense wasting electricity , even miniscule amounts , when this can opener is so convenient and takes little or no muscle to use . It was a bit spendy for a can opener , but it should last a long time . It is easy to clean but it does n't even seem to get food on the blade like my electric one does . The handles are nice and grippy , typical Oxo , and it has a nice weight to it . It appears to be well built and pretty sharp . I will never waste my money on electric can openers again . You can even use this one when the power goes out !	1
A perfect can opener ... ..I am hoping it lasts and lasts because of the ease of use . A little pricey compared to others , but they do n't last AT ALL . This appears sturdier , less apt to rust and be inoperable in a short time..	1
Best can opener ever . I have owned so many crappy ones . This one gets the job done right the first time . OXO products are the best . Great heavy duty quality !	1
Has replaced my electronic can opener . Attaches easily to cans , requires minimal effort to turn - which is especially helpful if you have weak hands or wrists . It 's a great can opener .	1
I 've been using an ancient swing away for 25 years and it just did n't work anymore . OK , so it did n't owe me anything and worked great for the price but after trying this one by Oxo I did n't know how good a can opener could be . I know , how excited can you be over a can opener after all , it just opens cans right ? Well yes thats all it does but it does it so easily and so cleanly it is truly a pleasure to use . It cuts clean and does n't twist the can dumping liquid all over the counter . I love the handle which protrudes out just enough so you can get a good easy grip and it turns effortlessly . I think this is very well thought out , great product .	1
This is sturdy , and ergonomically-friendly ( got it for my elderly mother ) . I checked it out and this is by far my favorite handheld can opener . Even if you 're used to the electric kind , this opens cans easily without much strain , has padded handles and is sturdy . And well-priced .	1
I 'm very happy with this can opener . It has extremely smooth action and is effortless to use ... very easy on the wrist ! I also like the fact that it 's stainless steel so I do n't expect it to rust as others have in the past . I read the reviews on this product before I purchased it and do disagree with a few of them . Although the can opener works great I have yet to have it completely detach the lid from the can . When the opener has gone completely around the lid there is always a tiny piece of lid attached to the can that I have to twist off . No problem as far as I 'm concerned but I 'm noting it because other reviews claim the lid is completely removed .	1
I love this can opener , it opens cans with ease and dose not hurt my hands like a lot of the other ones I have bought .	1
Solid , sturdy , smooth and effortless operation , feels like it will last a long time . Very happy I got this one and not an electric opener . A little pricey , but if it lasts it will be worth it .	1
I do n't like electric can openers so I am always looking for a nice manual one . I 've purchased a couple of really expensive European models from specialty cooking stores ( I love those places but I tend to spend a LOT of money on impulse and then I do n't always use the things that I buy ) . The expensive pairs are nice but I have to say that they are not as comfortable as this one . I hate looking for a can opener when I need one so I keep several around . For the price this is a great value and even though I have large hands it 's really comfortable .	1
I had another Oxon can opener but I found it hard to grip tightly enough to use . This became an issue as carpel tunnel syndrome made my hands into hooks . This can opener is much easier to grip . It has a sharp blade that opens everything smoothly . Now I no longer have to ask my son for help opening my cans .	1
Hopefully this will be the last can opener that I 'll ever need . Has heavier weight and feel that comparable openers at the big box store . For those cans without a pull tab , this product makes opening a snap .	1
VERY PLEASED , THIS STRAINER FITS MOST BOWLS OR POTS AND DOES EXACTLY AS AMERICA 'S TEST KITCHEN SAID -- THANKS GUYS -- -BUY IT YOU 'LL LOVE IT TOO	1
Strainers are kitchen utensils that one needs at inopportune times . At the last minute , when I am hurrying to get all my dishes finished at the same time , I might put forget to add hot liquid to flour or cornstarch , for thickening , and instead add the dry ingredient directly to the gravy or sauce . Then I end up with a lumpy mess unless I have a strainer ( or cheesecloth ) on hand . This OXO strainer is 6 inches across , so it is large enough to strain a pan of gravy without overflowing . The mesh is a fine gauge , so the gravy will end up smooth . This strainer also works well for removing seeds and lumps from fruit sauces , even after pureeing them in a food mill , or electric mini-prep or blender .	1
Generally , I like this : it looks nice , it feels nice , and it wo n't rust . The last of the qualities is the most important to me.I bought this because I needed to replace an 20-year-old , cheap , rusty , slightly torn wire mesh strainer that was about eight inches or so in diameter . This one is only slightly smaller in diameter , but it holds about half as much . When they measure it , they 're counting the entire width of the fat metal rim as part of the strainer . It 's also noticeably shallower . As a result , it 's not useful for bulky jobs , like draining a pound of rigatoni . They do n't seem to make one as big as what I 'd like , but perhaps that 's a good thing , given the complaints about the handle snapping off unexpectedly.My other minor complaint really applies to the entire `` SteeL '' line : the small holes they provide in those thick handles are n't big enough for me to hang anything . I 've got two different hanging racks , and neither type of hook works . ( One does n't fit , and one gets stuck , so you have to pry it off the hook when you want to use it . ) So we 're hanging this upside down , on the little loop .	1
In this particular style of OXO , I own just about every utensil . I have to say that I have yet to be disappointed ! ! The handles are very comfortable , they are sturdy and dishwasher safe . If you ever get those great 20 % off coupons from Bed Bath & Beyond , you can apply them to these and save even more , not that the prices here are n't good but ever bit helps ! Buy them while they are still available .	1
Nothing to complain on this one . It is a nice spatula . I am using it to cut and lift pizza and it does a great job . Easy to clean . I have two different ones from XOX - wanted to see if there was a difference in quality from the same brand , but a different model . They are exactly the same just a different grip as you hold them . I do think that it is the kind of spatula that you can have for years with only a little common sense maintenance .	1
I was in love with this item at first site . . . Although I have to admit , the item is a bit pricey comparatively to other turners but the ergonomics and the design makes it all well worth it ! A recommendation to all designer cooks !	1
I just love OXO . They do nice things with silicone . This spatula , unlike the spoons , is just the right length .	1
I recently purchased a new set of all clad stainless steel pots and pans , therefore I needed a metal spatula . It works great and is easy to clean as well .	1
I had a plastic spoon for years until I was trying to remove some gelatinized soup from a Pyrex storage container and the plastic handle snapped . Got this one and very pleased . The rubber grip is smooth and comfortable to the touch and does n't get too hot even when left in the pot/pan . The spoon is sturdy and feels like it can take some abuse . I also love Oxo brand items !	1
I 'm trying to replace all the plastic in my house with glass or stainless steel to avoid the poison in plastics . This spoon does a great job of holding a pile of food . It 's great for stirring or serving . It 's not heavy but sturdy . There is no rust !	1
Purchased along with 8 inch Oxo slicing knife as a carving set . Works well , comfortable to hold and serve with .	1
Good build . Does not easily bend .	1
Good quality from OXO that you 've come to expect . The slight curve on the tongs helps grip the food and avoid running into the blade .	1
Oxo Steel ForkI was looking for a quality fork for lifting heavier meat cuts without having the meat item falling off the fork and I 've found the best solution for my needs . With curved prongs and tips notched like fishing hooks , this 13-1/2-inch fork gets a solid grip on roasts , poultry , and big vegetables like baked potatoes . It easily lifts a corned beef , for instance , from pot to carving surface and holds it down firmly for careful slicing . Rather than being straight-sided , this tool 's handle is tapered from heel to finger grip and has satin-finish , stainless-steel panels top and bottom . The handle 's sides feature the same design as those in the Good Grips line , which are made of soft processed rubber for comfort , with `` fins , '' or grooves , that flex under pressure , conforming to individual finger grips and providing control when the handles are wet or slippery.Some of the product features are : * Use to skewer and lift roasts , poultry , and vegetables* Use also with knife as carving tool* Tapered handle with soft , nonslip sides* Safe to use in dishwasher* Comes with a lifetime warranty against defects* The steel construction will not bend easily when in use.The tapered handle with the soft non-slip sides is great feature if you have a smaller hands , as you can control the fork much easier . The barbed tips prevent slipping of the meat or vegetables . Use the OXO Steel Fork to retrieve and secure hot foods , or for hands-free serving . Both elegant and comfortable , the OXO Steel line of kitchen and household tools feature brushed stainless steel handles for strength and durability and trademark flexible fins for ultimate comfort . I use the OXO Steel Fork for piercing potatoes , transferring a pot roast from pan to platter , and securing meat during slicing , great for transferring a turkey on Thanksgiving Day or that Christmas ham for carving . Also , those sweet potatoes can be handled far easier with this fork than any other that I 've used in the past due to the barbed fish hook tips . Once you have your sweet potato where you want it then with a simple pressure from a pot holder or your knife , your potato is removed from the forkIt seems that the uses for this fork are as many as your imagination can come up with and it does n't fail . It is very well-constructed not too heavy , but very versitile and handy in your hand . I enjoy the dishwasher safe as there are times that I generate many different pots and pans and items that I can get a head start on by popping them into the dishwasher.I loved this fork so much I bought a second one just to help out with the holiday cooking and not only I , but whomever is cooking with me , can enjoy the same convenience , stability , and gripping power . Also , I use both forks for the bigger , bulkier meat cuts with confidence . The fork is long enough that when you fry chicken in the skillet you do n't get the oil splatter on your hands and forearm.This is an item that you 'll want in your kitchen for the reason I 've described . The fork is a bit more expensive , but the quality of this fork makes up the difference . I use it to get items off of the BBQ grill surface without fail . This is a very useful item.An epicurean Bon Appetite	1
I like the whole SteeL series of utensils and this pork fits nicely with the bunch . It 's comfortable to hold , easy to clean in the dish washer and does its job quietly and without fuss just like the rest of the tools in the series . Ca n't go wrong .	1
The fork does what it should ; firmly holds the item being sliced . It looks good , handles nicely and I 'm very pleased with the solid feel . I 've only one warning for multitaskers - do n't leave the fork standing in the roast you were slicing and walk away to do something else . The fork and roast will be on the floor in a jiffy . Though nicely balanced , the handle is long and weighty . This is reasonably priced and a good choice for secure slicing .	1
I was surprised to find that these carving forks are impossible to find for sale on their own . I have a carving knife I love but wanted the fork , but the only ones for sale locally were sold as a set with a carving knife.This is a good carving fork , and holds roasts securely . As everyone has mentioned , dishwasher safe is a big plus .	1
You can use this thing to turn any type of meat ! It works on roasts , steaks , chicken , anything ! It 's sturdy enough to turn a 5lb roast in crockpot or dutch oven if you want ! Next up , see how it does roasting marshmallows !	1
This may well be the perfect fork . I like the OXO series of cutlery , and this is no exception . This fork is very well balanced and has a wonderful handle that is secure and resists slippage.The fork itself is made of stainless steel , and is dishwasher safe ; a huge benefit not found on some high end cutlery today . The handle is in line with the other contemporary OXO utensils , with a stainless handle for superior durability and strength , but with rubberized fins on the sides to provide you with excellent grip , which is especially important on a fork of this size that can be counted upon to lift things like heavy roasts , etc . Another excellent feature is the barbed tines , which help prevent heavy items from falling from the fork during lifting.There may be a greater fork somewhere , but I have n't found it yet . For all your forking needs , this gets a big thumbs up !	1
Very strong one piece fork . Another top quality kitchen utensil from OXO . Very attractive Stainless Steel design . Great cooking aid .	1
I would highly recommend this large skewer fork for anyone who is in the market for one . I love the barbed ends and the comfortable handle . Do n't hesitate you will not be disappointed .	1
I 've been rating all the SteeL utensils 5 stars as they work nice , feel substantial and comfortable and give me the impression they 'll be around my kitchen for a long time . This ladle fits in with the rest of the tools I picked up .	1
Nice and heavy	1
For the most part , I am very happy with this ladle -- construction and quality are very good . I was surprised , however , by how large the bowl of the ladle is . Because it is so large , it is difficult to store in a drawer and it takes up a bit of space in the dish washer . I do n't have room on my counter top to have a utensil bin ; therefore , it has to be stored in a drawer .	1
I have several Oxo SteeL implements and love them all . They are very sturdy , wash well , and do their job . They are the right size for the job and have comfortable handles . I love this one and all of my Oxo SteeL implements .	1
I typically like OXO products , and I needed a steel spaghetti server , so I thought I 'd give this one a try . However , I was a little disappointed with this particular utensil when I first received it in the mail , as it 's fairly light weight . At any rate , I 've already utilized it a few times now , and it seems rugged enough to do the job , plus it cleans up well in the dishwasher . The jury is still out on this product though , as I want to see how it holds up over time .	1
This is a good product and OXO has done well by me over the years . This spaghetti strainer is solidly built and feels good in hand . It will likely provide years of good service .	1
I love this utensil ! It 's perfect for the times when I 'm lazy and not wanting to drain pasta . This is a great handheld , impromptu strainer ; it 's a great server overall . Works well with salads too .	1
I always had plastic ones of these before . They would either accidentally get laid down on a hot surface and melt , or just bend and break from trying to scoop thick heavy stuff . I decided to splurge and just get this , and boy am I glad I did ! Scooped out cold spaghetti the other night onto a plate to heat up , and this thing did not even struggle or bend at all , and I was n't being gentle . The grip is nice too . It 's just a high quality kitchen utensil and I highly recommend it for someone who is fed up with the cheap ones . I will never need to buy another one of these again .	1
I lived without one for a few months . My life has improved with this spaghetti server . Design is nice , works fine . Just a little too big for my taste	1
This is a pretty big Spaghetti Server . A little too big for my tastes , but I really like it . It is beautifully crafted out of stainless steel and is nice and solid without feeling too heavy or too light . A plus ... if you are using stainless steel you are also keeping the chemicals from plastics from leaching into your food and you can also not be scared to death to leave the utensil unattended in a pot if you forget .	1
My daughter asked for a metal pasta server . I had not heard of one but I went on the search and found that were in fact quite a few different kinds of them . I decided on this one as I liked the look of it and I picked the right one . My daughter was thrilled with it . She said the handle was one of the better featured on it as it offered insulation from the heat . I am just glad I found the spoon that she wanted and she is very happy with it . I might even be getting one for myself .	1
This is a very sturdy and well balanced turner that is substantial enough to handle a heavy lasagna and still compact enough to be easy to handle .	1
I have loved this product ! It has a comfortable handle and has sturdy construction so there is no fear of thefood being served falling off accidently . Highly recommend for any kitchen ! Also handy for scooping choppedherbs into the pot !	1
I love using it just not on non stick pots .seems to be of good quality product IF you looking for a spatula - then get this one . you will love . I saw mine at a store and then ordered on amazon : )	1
Really nice . Durable . Built strongly . Pleasant to use . I 'm very glad that I purchased this . I use it for a whole host of things including when I need a small spatula .	1
This has become my favorite flipper . It is small enough to lift out bars and cake from a regular cake pan . It flips eggs well too if you 've got stainless steel pans .	1
Has all sorts of uses and good quality typical of OXO . I initally cringed at some of the prices for their equipment but I 've never had a piece break yet so felt justified in purchasing what seems to be another great kitchen utensil .	1
I have been looking to replace a 40-year-old spatula for quite some time . I wanted a flexible , thin , yet sturdy surface . This is just what I was looking for . The blade is thin and flexible , yet holds up under weighty foods . I am very happy to have found it !	1
I needed a tool for cutting into a tray of lasagna & found this one . I bought two - one for my daughter , one for me . This is one of my favorite kitchen tools . It has a nice thin edge that is plenty sharp for cutting into a tray of lasagna , but not sharp enough to cut your fingers . It is well made & very sturdy . I highly recommend this tool to anyone who needs to cut into a tray of food .	1
I just love it.It works the way I wanted it to and picks up all that needs to be picked up . Thanks so much .	1
I was using a knive and a cake turner ( those triangle shaped ones ) and upgrading to this was a great decision . Now serving lasagna is easy from the very first piece	1
I have no idea why this is called a lasagna turner . It is the best dishwasher-safe ( no wood ) spatula I have found , and I have searched high and low for something not too & # 34 ; bendy & # 34 ; I like to be able to scrape burned stuff from my cast iron pans . I like it that this is really strong . ( Actually one of these did break off after a couple of years ' use , but now I see that they have a lifetime guarantee . )	1
I like the shape , the way it handles , the size , and even the cost . I use it for lasagna and cake and anything I can use it to scoop out things . I do n't use it for cooking but that 's not what I bought it for . I bought it for serving , so thumbs up for that and its pretty too	1
I put together a waffle making set for my grandson , who loves waffles and wanted to be able to make them . This was part of the set . He loved the gift and his family loves being the recipient of homemade waffles !	1
This has it all , the rubberized bottom the spout and easy to clean -- - wonderful . This was not imagined by me ahead of time to be that big . Just a bit too much .	1
I bought two of these bowls to replace two other bowls that were left behind during a military move . We have no regret for buying these ... they are very strong and the feel of the bowls makes you wan na mix the heck out of whatever you are mixing . I use the to make mashed potatoes in ... my wife for whatever else needs mixing.And the rubber grip on the bottom helps to prevent sliding on our granite countertops .	1
i have steel bowls , ceramic bowls , glass bowls , copper bowls , melamine bowls , pinch bowls , finger bowls ... lots of bowls . i got these OXOs and now i kept the copper , the ceramic , and my OXOs : 2 5-qt , 1 3-qt , 2 1.5-qt , and 8 1-cup prep bowls ( with lids ! ) . these OXO bowls are workhorses easy to hold and clean . they are light and quiet ( they do n't bang on your counter ) .notes : *not for dishwashers . *clean with soft cloth or sponge if you are trying to keep the surface scratch-free . *like any plastic bowls , metal spoons , beaters , or knives will abraid the surface.if you are in production mode in your kitchen having a few of each of these bowls will make the job easier . buy them buy the bag.1 cuppers are here : OXO Good Grips 4-Piece Prep Bowl Set with Lids1.5 qt . : Oxo Good Grips 1-1/2-Quart Mixing Bowl3 qt . : ( not available on amazon . boo . ) five stars .	1
My old glass bowl was heavy to pull out for everyday use & the smaller one did n't have a lip to pour from . This one seems to have replaced them both as it is light weight & even for smaller quantities gives lots of room to incorporate ingredients without losing small amounts over the edges due to vigorous mixing .	1
I do n't have any complaints about this product yet , but I 've only been using it for the past couple months . It is great for mixing anything . I love the rubber bottom to keep it from sliding . Sometimes I mix things while I walk around the kitchen , or since I 'm short , I often put it on my lap to get better leverage , so it 's great that this bowl does n't add much weight . It is great that this is made out of plastic to keep it light-weight and relatively shatter-resistant ( vs. glass/ceramic ) .	1
This is a very comfortable bowl to use . Made of sturdy plastic , it is much lighter than glass mixing bowls , which makes it convenient and easy to use . The handle is very ergonomic and comfortable to grip ( really good when pouring batter into a pan , for instance ) , and the shape of the bowl itself is perfect for wrapping an arm around for those heavy duty mixing sessions . The rubber on the bottom keeps the bowl right where you put it - no sliding . I use this bowl the most of all my mixing bowls and am looking forward to getting a bigger one just like it . Oh , by the way - it 's dishwasher safe , too . I 've washed mine over and over and it still looks new .	1
If you are going to get just one mixing bowl for your kitchen , just get the OXO . This company really puts a lot of thought into all it 's kitchen tools.This one has a none skid bottom , so it is like having an extra hand . The bowl is easy to wash , and is a real winner .	1
The non-stick bottom and handle to this bowl make mixing so much easier . On my countertop , and water makes the bowl slip . But the gripping bottom on this bowl resists slipping , making mixing easier.Unlike some other bowls , this one also has a non-stick handle . Frankly , my hands get wet more often than my countertop , so the non-stick handle may turn out to be more helpful than the base.The 4 quart size is just about perfect for most simple cake , muffin or biscuit recipes.You will love this bowl .	1
Perefect mixing bowl and great size . It came in handy for Thanksgiving preparations . You can clean this within seconds . I have previously bought a steel mixing bowl from Oxo in the past but did not like using a metal whisk on steel . This one also has a lip to poor the mixture which I did n't even realize when I purchased it .	1
I think very good for using a hand mixer . They have the rubber side that you grip , and the substantial rubber-like base that really holds the bowl firmly against the table . IT does not appear to me that the rubber base will separate from the bowl ( a good thing ) . Bowl itself is solid , substantial plastic that appears to be durable quality material . And the grip is nice , a nice way to hold the bowl while mixing . I expect that you will want all three sizes after purchasing one size .	1
This bowl is great for cooking . It is stable when mixing and easy to clean .	1
I received one years ago for a wedding present and we loved it so much we bought a second one . I think we may purchase at least 2 more , since my hubby cooks so much and we are always washing the two we have . I love these bowls ! !	1
This bowl has been with me through pastries , salads , guacamole , and mashed potatoes , and everything between . There 's nothing really special about it other than the non-slip lining on the bottom of the bowl that does come in handy on slick surfaces . Lip is convenient , too.My only real qualm is that it does n't repel oils very well . Sometimes I 'll toss something in olive oil or use a butter-heavy receipt in baking and the oil just sticks to the walls of the bowl . With most of my other bowls , some metallic some plastic , I simply rinse and it 's ready for a new food .	1
Nice size and easy to hold on to . OXO is a very brand . Good quality . I will order more bowls .	1
This bowl is well made , easy to clean , and stays put while you mix with one hand . It has multiple uses , and a must have in any kitchen . I ordered another set to keep on hand .	1
I have the big one at home and I am buying another one to use up here in the `` country '' . It is n't just a mixing bowl either-I rise dough in it ( yes , I use it for my sourdough too , plastic , if cared for properly , will not annoy your sourdough sponge . ) and I mix in it as well.It does n't make escape attempts during preps , it does n't hang on to smells , it is n't a temperamental , angry bowl with preferences and druthers . Now , about plastic bowls ; you should n't put them in the dishwasher or you 'll spoil the surface , you should n't chop nuts in them or you 'll leave places for germs to grow , and keep tomato sauce away from them or they will take on a color you wo n't like.To conclude I am ordering another one right now and I think this is a great product at a more than fair price . Just take decent care of it and you 'll have it forever . OXO is a winner with me !	1
These are the best mixing bowls I have ever had . They do n't slide around . Nice to handle . I have made tomato base products in mine and they have never stained . They wash up like a dream.Forget stainless and glass bowls , these are the absolute best in mixing bowls .	1
What is there to say about a huge mixing bowl with a rubber bottom ( to prevent sliding ) and a rubber handle ( to prevent slippage ) and being durable enough to ride in the dishwasher ? Nothing.Buy this bowl . It is inexpensively indispensable .	1
I have this bowl and the smaller one . They are perfect bowls for mixing . The rubber base really helps the bowl stay put . I was them in the dishwasher without any problems .	1
The bowl does just what they claim - it stays put while I am using it . Good product .	1

This mixing bowl has a good grip on the side perfect for whipping ingredients and is extremely sturdy . It also cleans very well and is durable .	1
The rubberized bottom and well designed handle and pouring spout , make mixing a breeze !	1
OXO makes really nice equipment and I find myself wishing more of my kitchen of my gear was made by them . I was in need of some new mixing bowls , having a leftover plastic bowl from my mom since college and a very heavy porcelain one.I found this bowl very light to hold in the arm for whisking or stirring . The no-skid bottom is absolutely fantastic and keeps the bowl put for heavy stirring or using a hand mixer . The plastic itself is very sturdy and I have n't had any issues in the dishwasher with it . Top all of that off with the easy pour spout and horizontal handle for pouring ( making stacking a cinch ) and you have a near perfect bowl.I ca n't imagine too much making this bowl better . Get it , it 's worth the price for sure .	1
This is a deep bowl that is lightweight , yet sturdy . And , the black rubber base prevents it from slipping while one is mixing . The handle is a nice touch , too , when emptying the bowl . It 's a wonderful addition to my kitchen .	1
I suffer from a weakness in my hands , which makes gripping and holding most bowls steady very difficult for me - usually I have to use both hands , which makes mixing ingredients a real problem . This product is perfect for me . The rubber bottom holds the bowl nicely in place for me ( so I can hold it steady with one hand and mix with the other ) and it 's wonderfully large so that even if I do tip it a little , the contents do not spill all over the place .	1
The non-stick bottom and handle to this bowl make mixing so much easier . On my countertop , and water makes the bowl slip . But the gripping bottom on this bowl resists slipping , making mixing easier.Unlike some other bowls , this one also has a non-stick handle . Frankly , my hands get wet more often than my countertop , so the non-stick handle may turn out to be more helpful than the base.The 2 quart size is just about perfect for mixing simple sauces or marinades.Remember , this bowl is just about unbreakable too ! You will love this bowl .	1
Easy to use , stores nicely , cleans easily , pours reliably ... what more could you ask ? Best I 've ever owned .	1
I have been married over 38 years and I have NEVER had a bowl like this one . I use it and the 4 qt for EVERYTHING . I just love them both.The rubber sides and bottom are a wonderful idea . And the handle is the best idea ever . If you have not tried one of these bowls , you must !	1
I have this bowl and the larger one . They are perfect bowls for mixing . The rubber base really helps the bowl stay put . I was them in the dishwasher without any problems .	1
The rubberized bottom and comfortable handle on this bowl make it a pleasure to use . It is light in weight and easy to clean .	1
Old Review , gave it a 1 Star : Not sure how old the one I bought since it was from a garage sale , but it is in very good condition . Either way , the handle gets extremely hot and I could n't use without an oven glove . I should have asked the owners why they were selling , it did n't occur to me.New Review : I contacted OXO and told them of my issue . They got back to me the next morning stating the following : '' As long as the kettle is being heated on a medium heat or flame only , then the handle should not be getting that hot . Also , for a gas stove , you will want to make sure the kettle is centered over the flame , and that the flames are not licking up the sides of the kettle . `` I did what they say and the handle does get warm but that 's about it , it is easily manageable.On a side note , there was some rust on the water spout opening closure , but that came off by scrubbing it , so no prob there.As of now this kettle gets a 5 stars .	1
Lifting this teakettle by the handle opens the pour spout . No button to press or gadget to fiddle with to open the spout . Actually the angle you hold the pot at determines whethere the spout will open or not . It will always be open when in the & quot ; pour & quot ; position . In the more & quot ; level & quot ; carrying position just a tilt of the angle will change it from closed to open . It may sound kind of strange or uncontrollable , but it is very easy to manage.It 's made of sturdy stainless steel . It looks nice , though very sleek and modern compared to all those & quot ; cute & quot ; teakettles out there . Plus it has an additional larger opening for cleaning ! ( You cant get inside most other teakettles . ) One thing that you may not like about this teakettle : The & quot ; whistle & quot ; is a lower tone than traditional kettles , actually , it 's more of a hum . Some people find it annoying . I personally think the sound is more & quot ; musical & quot ; than the older whistling types . ( I find that old-style whistle far more annoying than the pleasant hum of my OXO ) .If you are the type of person that wants everything as fast as possible , then there is one other negative . You cant put this kettle on high heat due to the rubber handle . I find it only takes a minute or two longer to bring it to heat , but if you are the harried sort who wants things pronto , this might annoy you.I am disabled and have very limited use of my hands , but I have no problem using this product . Actually I use it with great ease . Until now , I have been able to use NO other teakettle . All the other teakettles I have seen ( and tried ) require more dexterity than I have . ( I am a C5/6 incomplete quadriplegic , if you need to know ) . Also , my mother has arthritis in her hands and this product is much easier for her to use than her old standby.For me it 's a practically perfect product .	1
OXO products provide long lasting quality and fine styling . Individuals can be confident when purchasing OXO products concerning the fine grade and value .	1
This inexpensive set is generally useful around the stove . Holds up to heat and is easy to clean . Ca n't comment re . durability .	1
We love this spatula , does exactly what it should and cleans up beautifully . Seems to be very well made , as well .	1
Silicone and heat get along great . I like these colorful tools for cooking with higher temps than most plastic utensils can take .	1
These are great for a wide variety of cooking and baking needs . They are easy to clean with the detachable heads and they can stand up to the head of my cast iron pots as well . I love these , they are a great investment !	1
This spoon spatula is the first utensil I reach for when I 'm cooking -- no matter what I 'm cooking . I have this in red and white . I actually think the white has become a little stained , the red has n't . I have had no problem with the handle bending or breaking , and I like the fact that it does n't move around in my hand . I can get around the entire bowl in one stroke . It really stays with the form of the bowl or pan .	1
Contrary to a few other poster comments , I think the flexibility of these spatulas is perfect and the contour is perfect for scraping the sides of my pan . Not sure what what kind of food other reviewers are trying to flip or stir , but I have flipped 12oz steaks with these no problem .	1
GOOD TO HAVE DIFFERENT SIZES IN YOU KITCHEN . LIKE THE LONG HANDLE AND DIFFERENT SIZES & # 8230 ; WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHERS.GREAT SPATULAS..	1
This is a very versital spatula . I bought the spatula for the handle . The flexible rubber fins on the steel handle create a very comfortable feel and will NOT transport heat up the handle . The oversized grips create a very & quot ; ergonomic & quot ; feel and fits my hands without having to tightly grip the handle.The spoon head is very flexible and yet sturdy . It can be used to stir the stiffist pancake mix and yet still clean the side of the bowl smooth . It can also go from normal room temperatures to stirring the soup , sauce or chili without fear of the blade melting or leaving & quot ; that plastic taste & quot ; in the pot.A great product with flexible uses and a staple in my kitchen .	1
I bought this set because they are heat resistant and I have some new EVAco/Cast pans I will be using them with .	1
These are solid , nicely made spatulas . Have gone through the dishwasher multiple times and are used for anything from cake batter to tomato sauce to stir fry -- still looking like new .	1
This is much sturdier than the chefn dual end spatula that broke on me.Is this frugal ? yes because this is my only spatula and it wo n't scratch my food processor bowlWould I have purchased this used at a cheaper price off of craigslist ? noDid I shop around for the best total price including the manufacturer 's website ? yes and so should you	1
Love the handles and the sizes . We have multiple sizes from OXO including this one and they all clean well and I especially like that the ends come off to clean . Would highly recommend ! !	1
I have used this spatula for over a month now and like the fact I can take the blade off and wash it ; once dry put back together . I feel confident I am working with a sanitary tool .	1
Highly heat resistant , flexible enough without being too flexible , overall a great spatula , and my go-to utensil for a lot of jobs .	1
This is a great little spatula . I like to use it for scrambled eggs . It is sturdy and handles high heat very well . I have left it in the pan for a minute or so before and the material does n't melt .	1
I am very happy with this spatula set . And for an OXO item - I feel they are very reasonably priced ( at $ 12 ) . I do wish the green spatula were a little bit smaller for getting into nooks and crannies , but I can find one elsewhere .	1
The ultimate spatula . I have ordered several in this series , but this is the first that I have used . It is great . Even for non coated pots/pans , this utensil can get down to the fire and come out like new . A very impressive tool . It follows the contour of your pan without trying to scrape through to the burner , and makes it to the dishwasher unscathed . There are a few things that a steel spatula are needed for , but this gem will handle the rest of the tasks , while keeping all of your cookware looking like new .	1
Oxo Good Grips 3-piece Silicone Spatula SetOh how I love this set of spatulas . I use them for all kinds of cooking situations , from meatloaf , cake batter , pancakes and waffles , to different dough recipes . They work well and they fit into your hand like they were made for it , without slipping , even when your hands are wet . Ergonomically designed to fit the palm comfortably and softly , the pressure-absorbing soft grip handles put less tension on the hands , while providing an outstanding grip.The features are : * Spatula heads heat resistant up to 600 degrees* Will not discolor , warp or melt* Non-slip handles* Safe for coated or non-stick cookware* Dishwasher safeThey are great when you want to get the last of the macaroni and cheese from the dish or stubborn lasagna from the edges of the pan , even while it is still hot . The spoon spatula makes a great tool for stirring and scraping , even tasting . The heads do NOT melt when exposed to the hot food . Most of the newer pots and pans come with a non-stick coating and these spatulas work extremely well as they do NOT scratch the coatings . Cake batters do n't stand a chance of sticking to the sides of the batter bowl , as you can pretty much clean them out with the spatula before washing . Washing this set of spatulas is a breeze , they come clean with a gentle washing or you can pop them into the dishwasher.You should be well pleased with this set of spatulas as they are superior in design and work as intended.An epicurean Bon Appetite	1
I ca n't complain about this product . Everything that I have ever gotten from oxo is great quality and design . One great feature is that the spatula head is removable for east cleaning .	1
My husband is the cook in our house and he tells me what he needs in the kitchen . I like the old fashion wooden spoons when I make him cookies , etc . but these are exactly what he needs for everyday cooking . So glad they are heat resistant up to 500 degrees , do n't have to worry about throwing them in the dishwasher . I could get used to these real fast ! Good Value ! thanks	1
This spatula is the first I ever owned made of silicone . It is marvelous for stirring hot food that tends to stick to the bottom of a pan . You do n't have to worry about it melting . The tomato-red color is lovely , too , and the black handle very attractive.This makes a great Christmas , housewarming , or wedding shower gift !	1
I was looking for a very small spatula - more in the 6 - 8 inch long size - and could n't find anything , so decided to try this one with it 's smaller size head and it works fine . You can scoop out the last bit of yougurt in the container , get the last of the soup from the can or clean out the saucepan . Wish this company would make one about half the length with a smaller head as that is a very useful size for so many things . However , this will do until then . Cleans just fine and the color choices are good , got the Vanilla and the Red one .	1
These are much better spatulas than what I 'm used to and work very well on the stovetop with non-stick cookware . They seem to fare better when hand washed though as the dishwashing soap seems to leave a film . I like the sizes in this set . I still prefer a flat edged wooden spoon for some stovetop applications like scraping cooked bits from the bottom of a pan .	1
I like the OXO Good Grips products . This spatula set gives you three useful tools at a reasonable price . Easy to clean , and the colored heads make them easy to find .	1
As always , Oxo makes great kitchen tools . This smaller spatula works well for smaller batches . Also great as a jar scraper for smaller jars like peanut butter , jelly , etc .	1
Nice . Fits all different needs . My favorite is the raspberry scoop type . Treat yourself a little . Life is too short for shabby spatulas ! LOL ; )	1
Another great OXO product , the are very well made and super functional . The can take a high heat no problem and are easy to clean .	1
You know how most spatulas are , even the expensive ones . They eventually chip , peel , discolor or are too stiff or too soft . I did n't think I 'd find anything better than my Rubbermaid but I did . I love this spatula . The size is perfect too . It takes the heat !	1
I needed a new spatula to use in the kitchen . I found that this size is very good and it works well .	1
These wash very well in the dishwasher and look brand new after cleanings - no stains left on the silicon . The wider end of the handle makes for better griping , too.OXO is the best around . I have all their products ; some , I do n't even know what they 're used for , really - but I 'm addicted because the products last for decades .	1
I had been using an iSi slim spatula to get everything out of the cat food cans but the sharp edges around the rim of the cans was badly damaging the iSi spatula head . The iSi spatula heads are a lot longer than the head on these OXO small spatulas . These are working out better for removing the food . I am finding the small head useful for a lot of other kitchen tasks . The raspberry and black color is quite beautiful .	1
I really like these tools . They are sized well and I like the colours . The tops are removable to clean well . OXO tools are pretty all I buy now .	1
Purchased these as part of my wife 's Christmas . She loves them ... they work very well for the things she uses them for .	1
great spatulas so far ; they have n't melted & go through the dishwasher fine . I love all the widths & are good quality	1
I 've been using these for nearly 2 months now . I bought them because even though I had some that I loved from Williams Sonoma , they had wood handles that could not go into the dishwasher and that warped . My sister even caught one on fire by leaving it too close to the flame on the gas stove . After years of being the only one who will hand wash them , I finally sought out dishwasher safe silicone spatulas . These work great , I really have no big complaints . I just have my old williams sonoma spatulas to compare them too , and those were more flexible and overall a better silicone for cooking . These are flexible ( the white and green ones , not the scoop pink/red one ) , just not as much as I 'd like . The handles are comfortable , but a bit fat for storing in an upright container on the counter and because of the rubber , they all come flying out when you want just one . The pink/red one is always spotty when it comes out of the dishwasher , but again , it does n't hurt anything . I was just hoping to be wowed by these due to the brand and reviews , and to me they 're just fine .	1
I wish I had made this purchase long ago . All the other spatulas in the house are now in the trash . ( even the Pampered Chef one )	1
I use these for cooking . Great for scrambles eggs and gravy . My daughter stole the red one and is holding it ransom for a whole set of her own . Christmas I think .	1
This size spatula is great for getting the last bit out of jars or out of a yogurt cup or something like that . This particular spatula has a solid handle and the white part is not too stiff or too soft to do its job . I 've only had it a few days , but so far , so good . It made it through the dishwasher on the sanitary cycle okay , too .	1
These spatulas are well designed , comfortable to hold and are great tools to have in the kitchen . Another great product from OXO .	1
Reasonably priced , arrived on time and in one piece . I was concerned that these or any others would be flimsy and cheaply built . Boy , was I wrong . Very Nice , Very Well Built and Very Sturdy . Oh yeah , they work great too !	1
I like this spatula I do , but if you are working with dough it is useless . The spatula end is detachable -- which I recommend when washing because bits of food can get stuck in the seam and inside the spatula tip . I use it all the time.However with doughy mixes it is useless and I go back to the old wooden one . The spatula tip just comes off and gets stuck in dough . If it was one solid mold with no chance of detaching I would give it five stars .	1
These are sturdy and does the job . Good Price , Fast shipping . I would buy these again for gifts . The sizes are perfect for all types of cooking .	1
The heads of the spatulae ( plural for spatula ? ) are very & # 34 ; grippy & # 34 ; - and they do n't come off the handles , which is important to me . Once grime gets down inside there , it does n't come out - which is gross.As is the case with pretty much all of OXO 's kitchen products , these are n't the cheapest spatulae available , but they 're probably among the best for everyday use . I will buy more .	1
I have several Oxo spatulas - they do n't warp , bend , peel , discolor or melt - even if used to stir things in a hot pan . So far , none of them have broken , and I have had several of them for a few years . Great quality .	1
I love my little bright blue spatula . It has n't hardened from being put in the dish washer . I find it really rather comfortable to hold . It 's also the perfect size to stick in a small jar or can to get the last of the contents out.Update : After six years of use , I had to bid my spatula goodbye , because the handle starting slowly disintegrating , leaving black behind on my hands .	1
I would definitely recommend these spatulas - they work quite well ! I tried a few other brands of spatulas , and then found these , and I 'm quite pleased .	1
I sent these to my daughter - seems she had n't a single spatula ( shock ! ) . Anyway ... ..I checked reviews and for the price this was a well received set . My daughter loves them.Recommended .	1
I use these with almost all my pan cooking ! I did n't realize they could withstand that kind of heat ! love these ! ! Silicon DOES come off of the handle .	1
Spatulas are good . I seem to use a lot when I bake so will order another set . I have put these in dishwaser by accident and seemed okay . But do n't think I would keep that up .	1
Another great purchase from OXO . This set had the 3 types/sizes I was looking for . I like how the handle can be pulled off for cleaning but does n't come off when using it . I have also used this in pots and pans ( to scrape sauces out , not while cooking ) and have n't had a problem with melting .	1
I love OXO , and have a number of their spatulas and spoonulas . I 'd never seen this small one in stores - maybe I was n't looking very hard . It occurred to me that I needed one at this size - to get into smaller jars . It works great , and I realize how much I was missing something like it in my kitchen arsenal . It 's size makes it easier to maneuver on spreading tasks , where its bigger brother is n't as nimble . I wish it were cheaper , but the quality and utility make up for it .	1
I really have n't found many OXO brand items that I do n't like . This is no exception . These are good quality . They 're very functional . They wash up beautifully in the dishwasher , and the various sizes make one of them good to use for Every situation I 've encountered .	1
These work very well . I read somewhere that the silicone was very stiff , but when I received them they were n't at all ! If anything , the white one is n't as stiff as I 'd like it to be.Overall , good buy ! I use them all the time !	1
I have n't used these yet but they a good quality . I never put my spatula 's in the dishwasher and always hand wash so I am sure they will hold up well . The sizes are good and close to comparison in photo . I would recommend them .	1
This scraper/slicer for pastry items is ideal with a very rigid blade and comfortable grip . But I wonder how long the stainless steel blade will remain so since it is another Chinese attempt at making a quality item . For some reason they just can not seem to get it right .	1
Ok , well that is exaggerating a bit but I loving having this board scraper around . I used to scrape up veggies on my chefs knife to transfer to the skillet but the blade is never wide enough to just make it with one trip and then there is the sharp edge to worry about . This board scraper is great because the edge is slightly sharp , but not really enough to worry about and the blade is wide enough to get nearly all of the veggies to the pan in one pass . The handle is made of a rubberized type material and is still easy to grip even if your hands are wet . One minor complaint is that the handle is on both sides so you ca n't smash a garlic clove anywhere on your cutting board , but it really is n't much of a problem since I 've gotten used to just smashing the clove near the front edge where I can just have the handle hanging off the edge of the cutting board .	1
I 've never used one of these before , always just a knife , but it is wondrous , making pie crust making simpler and easier . Quality made to last and easy cleaning .	1
First and only item of its kind I ever owned/bought , ca n't compare to anything else . It is realy useful portioning the dough , scraping the dough from the counter , a lot better than the knife I previously used . I had to take one star away only because I wish it was longer sized - I make bread in large batches in a Bosch mixer , 5-6 loaves at a time - for smaller amounts of dough however it should work just fine . Hope this helps .	1
I had wanted one of these for a long time . It makes work easiere when picking up a lot of chopped onions as well as other things . I like it a lot . rthank you .	1
Nice to use when making fondant for cakes on granite counter tops . Have n't used it as a chopper but it divides fondant nicely and scraped up the dried on fondant from my counter tops . That is what I use it for and I LOVE it !	1
I use this product every day to scoop up my diced vegetables . I do n't know how I managed without it . I know I lost a lot of tiny pieces of food to the floor . Recommend highly !	1
This pastry scraper is very comfortable to hold . I have n't used it for chopping , but it seems to be sharp and I think it would chop herbs well . I 'm not sure it would be sharp enough to handle anything too crunchy . I mainly use it for cutting dough into sections and then moving the dough to other work surfaces .	1
I really like this chopper-slash-scraper but I have n't gotten in the habit of using yet . I also have n't acquired the right technique .	1
I have a King Arthur Flour scraper and I prefer the OXO over it . It has a somewhat sharp edge . It is not sharpened at the angle of a regular knife blade ; it is somewhat blunt-about a 70 degree , inclusive angle . This still makes it a snap to pinch off dough . It is also usefull for cleaning my wooden cutting boards or any flat surface you might want to scrape or collect bits off of . The scale is a `` bit of fancy '' that some might find useful . The handle is somewhat soft , and very well ergonomically designed . It fits the hand and palm comfortably , unlike the KAF 's wood handle ( not to mention its totally blunt edge ) .	1
Yet another excellent product from OXO .	1
Works very well , great build quality . Easy to clean . There is a ruler etched into the edge for measurements . Cuts through doughs really well . Does exactly what it should do . A little pricey for the OXO brand but you wo n't need another one .	1
I 've never used anything like this before , but I 've been using it more and more . It 's very durable and has multiple uses . Would recommend .	1
I use this to cut and pick up dough when I 'm making bread . It is well made and very ergonomic . The edge does a good job of scraping dough and flour off my board . Highly recommended .	1
This is a handy gadget ! For example , it 's great for shoveling up a pile of diced anything from the cutting board and sliding it off into the pot . Quality is excellent , has ergonomic handle . Imo the scraping edge could be just a little sharper ( but not enough to cut fingers ! ) .One of the best uses I 've found : sliding chopped onion off onto a pizza , makes it easy to get even distribution . Have n't tried this yet , but I think it will be quite good for `` crumbling '' hamburger as it cooks ( a vexing chore ) .Added Dec 25 : I have since used it to `` crumble '' hamburger and it works much better than a turner or spatula . More efficient , easier grip , less tiring to the hand . Perhaps not the thing to do if using a coated ( non-stick ) pan .	1
I 've even used it to cut pizza when I could n't find my pizza cutter ( the wheelie thing ) . Just very handy in the kitchen , cut , scoop , scrape , separate , etc ... You all need one of these.. really 8 )	1
Like most OXO products , it is really comfortable to hold . Well made , dishwasher safe . Good product , and I like the ruler that is marked on the edge .	1
Sometimes a pizza wheel just does n't cut , no matter how good it is . I do n't normally make pastries , but this is fairly versatile . Hooray !	1
I do n't bake much anymore , I live alone and am diabetic so making a batch of brownies ( mmm brownies ) would not be a good thing , since I could easily eat an entire batch myself in a few days . I do chop a lot of veggies , though and this thing works great for transferring them to the pot/pan without losing them to the floor in the process . It is a sturdy little thing , I 've had it around 8 years and it 's had many many trips through the dishwasher in that time and held up nicely . Highly recommended !	1
This scraper is nice ! It 's heavy gauge , great quality , and sturdy . I use it mostly for scraping up onions , and veggies off my cutting board , and it does the job perfectly .	1
I do n't know how I ever managed without this handy devise . When I chop vegetables , I use it as the scoop to transfer them to the pot . It has a small ruler along the cutting edge to make pastry layout easier . It stores standing up along the edge of my drawer .	1
I used this to cut the rolls on my homemade cinnamon buns . It cut nice and smooth on the first try without smashing my rolls . They came out perfectly cut , and the end result was amazing . I also used to cut them after I finished baking so my husband could bring them to work and share with his coworkers . It is a very sharp blade and I have no complaints . Just be careful when using because it is VERY sharp .	1
I made a 5lb . soap mold and use this contraption to cut the soap once it becomes in a solid state . Deep enough to do the job and very sturdy and sharp enough to do the job easily . Well made product . Feels good in my hand and had a little weight to it .	1
Bought this for my wife , who loves to play with dough of various kinds . It has a great rubbery handle that does n't have any crevices for dirt to accumulate , it 's sturdy and well-made , and the edge is sharp without being dangerously so . Just right , according to my darling .	1
This is a good . I had one but it just did n't quite meet my expectations.Any baker will be very please with this OXO Multi purpose scapper .	1
It feels great in your hand . I cut 15lbs of dough a day and it has been perfect and stayed sharp .	1
wanted one off these for years got one ... ... this works great ... .. would buy another without question ... .very sharp ...	1
This has been such a handy tool . It 's sturdy , not flimsy . The handle is solid and easy to grip I really like that the measurement numbers are engraved/etched permanently and NOT just painted on . The blade itself , does n't flex or bend at all , but is thick and sturdy . I love to use it for clearing the counter of flour and whatnot after rolling or kneading baking items , scooping up mounds of chopped things to toss them into pans or bowls , cut brownies evenly sized , unstick dried bits off the counter or steel pans , and much more . It pretty much does it all ! ! Be sure to purchase a few to add to bridal shower gifts , too !	1
The & # 8220 ; OXO Good Grips Multi-Purpose Pastry Scraper Chopper & # 8221 ; is very sturdy , cleans up easily , and is excellent for cutting yeast dough without tearing the gluten strands . The 1/4 & # 34 ; markings on the 6 & # 8221 ; blade are extremely useful since , when directions call for specific sized pieces , the markings save having to estimate size . Further , because they are & # 8220 ; engraved & # 8221 ; into the blade & # 8217 ; s surface , there is little danger of scrubbing off the markings . The cushioned grip is comfortable to hold . If you bake frequently , the & # 8220 ; OXO Good Grips Multi-Purpose Pastry Scraper Chopper & # 8221 ; will be a valuable addition to your baking tool collection .	1
Love this shovel , it is awesome it has the measurings right on it and wo n't fade away , nice grip handle and makes chopping and scooping much easier to do . A must have for the kitchen . I need a new kitchen .	1
Nice quality . bought for a gift and it is better than mine . Like the measuring rule on the edge .	1
It 's comfortable and the edge is actually straight . You would be surprised how many dough knives in this price range have really crappy edges because of a lack of quality-control . It does what it 's supposed to do .	1
OXO is known for making high quality , useful products at affordable prices . As far as this product goes , it meets all three of those expectations ! ! ! I bought mine to use on my cutting block . I find myself dicing fruits and veggies and reaching for my OXO to slide them off the side of the board and onto a plate , etc . Sure , this may be for pastry use , but I find it to be quite good for everyday use . The edge is slightly sharpened at the bottom which makes chopping through smaller items a breeze . Overall , I am very satisfied with this product .	1
I bought this utensil primarily as a scraper for prep cleanup.Had seen it used a few times on cooking shows as a dough cutter , which I plan on using it for also . Was surprised to see that the cutting edge has an etched measuring line . Takes the place of a ruler when measuring dough cuts . Very good idea .	1
A very handy kitchen tool . Great for cutting pastries-chopping veggies cutting pie-cake-lasagna . Buy an extra at this price-makes a great scrapper for hard cleanups and makes a great little gift . Most folks do not have one .	1
Works great . Durable . Easy to clean.I would buy it again.I use this for baking bread , even cutting soaps !	1
I have granite counter tops . I am not a tidy cook . This scrapes all my untidiness off the granite and into the oubliette.It gets up under dough while kneading , freeing from any sticking . When ready to partition the dough it cuts neatly.When chopping or mincing tons of veg , this little thing slides nicely under the pile and carries it handily to the cooking pot.Every kitchen should have one . Sometimes I think two would be even better .	1
Needed a good pastry scraper and chopper for when I make home made hamburger rolls , and this fit the bill . Nice and solid , good quality and does the trick.Although I caught my husband chopping watermelon with it the other night , so I suppose it will live its life as a multipurpose tool in our home .	1
Perfect for cutting vegetables and it is made of solid stainless steal . It is solid assembled and has no lose parts . Seems to be very durable .	1
We 've used other brands and styles of scrapers , over the years . This has turned out to be the most sturdy and easy to clean . We 've found that the ones with wood handles tended to absorb stains and flavors , over the years . This one does not .	1
I 've also come to use it to clean up the dough and such from my work surface . I love this thing . One of my favorite Amazon purchases ever . : )	1
I 'm impressed with the sturdiness of this product . It feels like it can really take a beating in the kitchen . It 's another OXO well-designed product ( most of them are ) and it 's nice that the measurements are etched on and not painted/stamped . It worked wonders to slice brownies too .	1
This kitchen tool I use almost every day . Great for cutting , chopping and scraping , I wonder what I used to use before I got one of these . Now I give them as gifts , to my kids as they have left the house , and for wedding gifts . ( Goes nicely with a brownie pan or cookie sheet . ) I use mine for making scones , cutting brownies , scraping dough , cutting butter , so many different uses . It 's very sturdy and will last my lifetime I 'm sure !	1
Strong , durable and functional . Comfortable fit for my hands . What more could one ask ? Well actually , there are times that you may want to scrape a rounded surface , or use a thinner and more flexible blade . On those occasions this wonderfully made OXO tool wo n't do . But there is no such tool for all your scraping and chopping kitchen needs.The OXO Scraper/Chopper does what it does well , but get another more appropriate tool for your other scraping or chopping needs .	1
This is particularly good for transferring chopped items to a waiting pan . In the past , I 've used a knife blade but I worried about cutting myself . No such worries here !	1
This works so well for making pita bread and cutting your big loaf into smaller loaves and ultimately the individual pizzas . Also good for rounding up scraps on your butcher block . Very glad I got this , makes me feel like a pro !	1
& # 34 ; Pish posh , another gadget , & # 34 ; I sniffed when I saw this scraper/chopper . For years I struggled with metal spatulas and butter knives cutting all sorts of foods thinking that was just the way things had to be . How very wrong I was . I purchased this scraper/chopper on a whim and when it arrived I immediately noticed that it 's a really nice size . The molded handle fits comfortably in the hand and gives me the leverage I need to cut things in pans . The blade is heavier than I was expecting , it does n't flex at all and has a slight tapered edge to bite through the toughest baked goods . Best of all , it works like a charm . I was able to cut things up in a fraction of the time and I did n't end up with tons of food gunking up the blade messing up subsequent cuts . This is a very handy tool and I would recommend it to anyone who cooks .	1
A pastry scraper seems like a kitchen gadget you could do without but I 'm finding this to be very handy . So far I have n't used it for pastry ( I plan to , though ) and I have n't used it as a chopper . What it has been useful for is scooping up vegetables I 've chopped on the cutting board . It has a comfortable , solid feel to it . I have n't put it in the dishwasher . I wash it by hand .	1
I purchased this for working with bread dough , for cutting and dividing dough for pastries . I 'm happy with my purchase .	1
A neat little gadget to have in the kitchen . It 's helpful when making biscuits or measuring dough ... easy to clean ... good purchase .	1
Now I know why ... . Scrapped counter clean from sticky fondant , picked up everything for easy disposal , the best multi tasker ever !	1
I purchased as a gift for my daughter because she did n't have one . She is very happy with it and she uses it all the time now that she is the happy owner .	1
The pastry scraper works for pastry as well as working for breads also , multifunction . It does what it says and does it well and it did n't cut me like some have . Enough said .	1
one of my favorite purchases , i mainly use this for separating dough . easy grip handle , dishwasher safe , sturdy . you can also use it to do a rough chop of veggies , like celery or carrots , or to mix chopped produce with herbs on the cutting board by blending it all together . it 's a good quality yet inexpensive little tool . ive used it far more than i thought i would .	1
Oxo is fond of rubberized grips , which do make for comfortable usage . I honestly do n't think there is much to a Pastry tool such as this to help convince you whether you want to purchase it or not.It 's a simple multi-purpose tool and made well , comfortable , has convenient measurements etched into the sides and priced reasonably well.The only disadvantage to having a nice comfortable grip is that it is bulky and takes up an uneven amount of drawer space since it does n't sit flush on its side . Your mileage may vary depending on your drawer space and orientation .	1
My husband and I love this wonderful tool and use it frequently . This is one product we have gotten our money 's worth out of . Use it to handle those soft sticky doughs and for clean up anytime . I used it just the other day handling sticky dough for homemade crescent rolls . The rolls were yummy by the way !	1
In the past I would tear apart dough with my hands or use a knife , making a mess . This simple tool cuts clean and exact . I use it all the time now .	1
I do a lot of baking , especially bread and this handy little thing is just what you need to lift the loaves or cut the dough . I have two of these because they are super for cut up meat . I do n't like to use the same one for meat and dough . The other one is from another site and I paid almost double what this one cost and it is n't as nice as this one . This one has a nice rubber handle which makes it solid to hold . When I cut up meat for stir frying these are perfect for picking the meat up and carrying it to the pan . I use them both a lot.I ca n't imagine not having one for so long and I 've been cooking for over 50 years .	1
This is what a dough scraper should be , metal , stainless steel , with a comfortable plastic handle . Made to fit your hand comfortably and can be used to scrape dough from , well , pretty much anything.Buy one you 'll like it .	1
It 's so useful . I use it for shoveling off the cutting board into the pan mostly , but it 's super nice for baking pastries . The sharpened edge is handy for easy chopping if you notice something that slipped through the process . Would buy it again . I 'd only hand wash this though , keep it out of the dishwasher ( as with all other knives and anything you want to last for awhile ) . I 've had mine for awhile and it looks brand new . It 's one of those things that you ca n't imagine yourself using , but once you have it you realize how much time it saves . Get it , you 'll be glad you did .	1
This is great for cutting up bread dough . Did n't need to scrape or measure but I do n't see why it would n't work . Nice weight to it and it feels quite sturdy . Nice for the price	1
Very comfortable to hold ... I have arthritis , and it does a great job of helping with daily cutting and scraping chores . After chopping mirepoix with my chef 's knife , it `` evens '' out the veggie dice sizes quite nicely and scoops everything into the pot beautifully . I 'm very happy with my purchase .	1
OXO makes the best gadgets ever ! ! ! This scraper is easy to handle and gets the job done . No sharp edges and very high quality as all their items are . A must kitchen item .	1
A very simple tool but effective . I love that it has a ruler - I never thought I 'd use that but I do all the time .	1
I just knew I would like this and I love it . Working with hydrated dough , it is a must and makes handling the dough so much easier.Yes , I would highly recomment it to anyone and furthermore , I do n't know how I got along without it .	1
I have had this scraper for over ten years and I could n't bake without it . Great for cutting dough and the ruler on the blade is a real convienence . I love that I can easily scrape dough and flour off my counter with ease . Easy to clean , easy to store ... you 'll wonder how you ever got along without it .	1
I bought this after a trip to Italy where we used it in a cooking class to make gnocchi . I 've used it several times since then in chopping ground beef during cooking and to scrape dough off a cutting board . I 'm glad I bought it . It 's a good tool for the kitchen .	1
This item was purchased by me to cut up my bread dough , but I am finding more uses for it like scraping chopped items from my cutting board into a pot/pan . This is another necessary kitchen item that I do n't know why I went so long without having one . It is also made of good quality materials and even has a ruler etched into the cutting edge .	1
I bought this along with the Snow River Pastry Board reviewed elsewhere to use in making bread , a hobby I just took up . It is very helpful in the early stages of kneading ( I prefer kneading by hand ) when the dough is frequently sticky and difficult to handle . I have used it a couple of times to chop parsley or cilantro but found my chef 's knife easier , probably because I already had the technique down .	1
I got tired of using various spatulas and knives for scraping the work surface when making doughs and other messy things . Finally did it ... broke down and purchased the proper implement . The Oxo has a good , simple design and it just works . The handle is easy to grip and there 's even a measuring scale along the edge for quick size references . This tool is simple and effective and the price is n't bad either .	1
I got this to help me with pastries . I just have n't used it as much as I thought I would . Either I am not being inventive , or I have other tools that better solve problems that this one would . I like the measurement markings.I will be using it next to make a gingerbread house for Christmas .	1
The OCO pastry scraper works well . The edge makes it easy to cut and the measurements on the scraper are helpful .	1
This scraper feels very sturdy and well-made . The grip is rubberized and fits my smaller hands well . The blade is substantial , not flimsy , but it still works well for cleaning up dough . The etched numbers are nice as well . I do n't expect that I will have to replace this any time soon .	1
I bought this just to have it and it 's been very useful when I made bread or rolls . And a King Cake . It has a nice sharp edge on it for scraping and a ruler on the edge which was useful for a new recipe I did for Christmas that required using it : ) Very happy with it .	1
This gets so much use that I do n't know how I managed before without this handy tool . I mainly use it for transferring chopped veggies from the cutting board to a bowl or pan . What I did n't expect was how often I would use it for chopping . It 's a sturdy weight , does n't bend , and has a nice sharp edge . I love using it for cutting even , straight , brownies and bars -- works much better than a knife .	1
I was hoping for a larger bench scraper , but I ca n't seem to find one that easily . That being said , I really like this scraper . For household use , it 's great . I like the nonslip handle , so if my hands are wet , I do n't lose my grip on the scraper . It seems sturdy enough for tough jobs , and there are measurements along the edge . I 've been using it more than I thought I would .	1
I bought this on a whim , and now find that I ca n't do without it when making bread and pastry . As an engineer , I 'm very careful ( my kids say loony ) about wanting everything a uniform size . I make large batches of pie crust dough , and weigh it , and then use this to cut it into exactly even pieces.Likewise , when I 'm making yeast rolls , I use a scale to divide my batch of dough in half , and then use this cutter to cut off pieces which are exactly 2 ounces . It 's much easier than wrestling with your dough.The handle at the top of this chopper is very large and feels soft , although it 's really hard plastic . It feels good in the hand , and works well either left- or right-handed.Finally , when cleaning up the counter after making pie crust , yeast bread or anything which involves slinging lots of flour around , this is wonderful for scraping it up without marring the counter , and it 's large enough to hold a lot of flour and remove it from the counter . OXO makes good quality items , and this one is quite useful .	1
I had been using a plastic piece of crap scrapper I bought a WalMart and wanted something sturdier with markings so I know how thick to cut sweet roll dough . This cost a tiny bit of money and has a nice substantial fit in my hand , cuts dough to size thatfast , and plus cleans the counter in no time . Something you never think you need until you get one . Recommend .	1
Very high quality steel , nice and thick , not flimsy at all . Nice , sturdy handle too . Good investment . Definitely will hold up to my use .	1
I use it mostly for scooping up things I have diced and chopped . It is great for that . I have also used it a few times for cutting dough . The measures on it made it easy to cut things up into equal parts .	1
My dad always says you need the right tools to get the job done . How true ! This has been my go to for cutting cinnamon rolls , baked brownies , dough . Precise cut and a joy to use .	1
Although this is described as a pastry scraper , we have found it has many uses . It is an all-purpose scraper/cutter . Oxo is known for ergonomically designed tools , combining form & function . This is perfectly balanced & weighted & fits the hand of many people ( from kids to big men ) .A well designed piece of equipment like this makes cooking even more pleasurable & helps to broaden the scope of your culinary talents ! This tool is very helpful in the creation of the perfect pizza , breads , doughs , and yes-even meatloaf !	1
This was a great buy ! It is very solid and makes cutting through dough/pastry so easy . Also feels good in my hand .	1
Update 8/25/07 : I love this so much that I bought a second one ! Now I have one for baking and another for everything else . When I cook big meals , I tire of having to rewash it.This is my second bench scraper . The first was a single sheet of metal that curved to form a handle . The measurements were painted on it . I probably paid $ 3 for it . After repeated use and trips to the diswasher , the measurements began to wear off and the bottom started to get uneven.I am so thankful for this version by OXO ! There 's the obvious sturdy handle , but what I love the most is that the measurements are etched instead of painted . I have to have the measurements because I use bench scrapers to measure the thicknes of dough in addition to cutting product ( you 'll never cut brownies or bars again with a knife ) and cleaning the board . This product is a lot heavier than my previous version and I like the weighty feel.Dishwasher safe .	1
I wish the measurements were printed on both sides instead of only one side . I also wish the handle was not wider than the metal part - it makes it difficult to measure thickness on a flat surface ( for example , measuring how thick dough is on a baker 's board ) . Other than that , this is my favorite tool in the drawer . Excellent workmanship .	1
I now make naan , flour tortillas , and gyro bread . I LOVE being able to so easily cut the dough into portions ( 12 , 16 , 12 ) . What I like , too , is using the scraper to pat the tortilla dough into a more uniform shape before I cut it so the portions are equal . The key to fluffy flour tortillas is to work the dough as little as possible . At least it is on the recipe I use ( flour , olive oil , milk , salt , and baking powder ) . So , this awesome cutter does double duty for me ! !	1
I 've had this a couple weeks now , and it works just like I thought it would ... easily transferring food like diced onions off my cutting board and into my frying pan . For years I would use a spatula for this chore ... but this does it a little better with less spills , worth the cheap expenditure if you chop a lot on a cutting board.This is n't rocket science ... a simple device for a simple task . I 'm glad I bought it .	1
I purchased this OXO Pastry tool because I 've taken on the task of baking more and more of my families bread . ( ( This has been made easier , by the way , because of the techniques in this book : Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day : The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking . It really does provide some easy options . ) ) What I found with the technique in the book I mentioned was that I need to not 'disturb ' the dough , but rather I needed to cut it cleanly . And none of my regular knives were working out at all.This OXO chopper works great . It 's very sharp and cuts through the dough cleanly.I would give it Five-Stars except for one thing and that is the black handle . It 's well designed as far as shape , but it 's made from that junky black plastic that Oxo started using sometime back , and I 've found that after a number of dishwashings that the black stuff begins to deteriorate so that it leaves gooky-greasy smudges on other items.Consequently , since I want it to last , I hand wash.Definitely recommend . Excellent price ( currently under 10 ) and works well .	1
I actually do n't use this too much as a scraper and never as a chopper but I do use it to collect cut vegetables and deliver them to the fry pan . I have a thick wooden cutting board so delivering the veges to the stove and pushing them into the skillet does n't work . This item is well made ; nice non-slip ergonomic handle .	1
I am torn sometimes , because OXO stuff is well designed for the most part , but it is all made in China . This scraper is sturdy and sharp and I expect years of use , though .	1
I do a lot of vegetable chopping , and this scraper really speeds things up . Much faster and easier than using the knife or your hands to transfer chopped food . Dishwasher safe and inexpensive . Should have bought one years ago .	1
Easy Grip for stability , allowed cutting harder vegetables more easily and alsokept up the speed of chopping , I recommend this item for your everyday chopping .	1
This pastry scraper - like most everything Oxo makes is comfortable to use , well made and not bad to look at . It fits comfortably in your hand , has measurements on the blade which come in handy , and is very sturdy . Ca n't go wrong for the price .	1
Makes scraping down batter easy and clean . Small enough and good-looking enough too , and good value for the price . Have been using for many months now , and no problem faced . Highly recommend !	1
Cant speak to use as pastry cutting tool I have n't tried it as such yet . But it 's great for veggies and fits in my smaller hands nicely , if you have very large hands this might not be best size tool for you . It 's smaller than what the photo looks but the measurements are correct in the listing .	1
Works very well , blade is sharp and cuts dough easily . Also use it to scrape up any dough stuck to my counter ... Recommend this item for anyone who bakes routinely .	1
I got mine on time and as advertised . I will buy this product again . I think this is the best one I have come across because it is sharp and very sturdy quality to get the job done the right way and easy .	1
very useful tool : i use it when i make pie doughs . Anyone who is serious about pastry should get this !	1
How did I live without this ? I use this almost daily and love it . Good for chopping , scooping , and scraping !	1
I have never found an OXO item that I did not love , and this bench scrape is no exception . It is made from a fine grade of stainless steel with a perfect edge . It is not sharp enough to cut a klutz like me , but it picks up every morsel perfectly well.The handle is the standard OXO Good Grips material and is very comfortable in the hand . It is sealed very well to the stainless steel so there is no worry of water getting in between . I like having this rubbery handle , as opposed to the ones I 've seen with the rolled stainless steel handle , because it is easier to grip .	1
This was highly recommended by the folks at America 's Test Kitchen . They were so right ... it works like a real charm !	1
Was pleased at the quality of this item when received . It is heavy duty , the handle provides for a solid grip with a supple , silicone type feel .	1
I make a lot of artisan bread , this is very useful for scraping the counter free of excess dough . It has a measure which helps in keeping bread sizes in check , I also use it for cutting .	1
This is a handy little kitchen tool . I use it for pasta , bread , pie and cooky dough . Blade is not knife sharp but it cuts clean . Useful and a good to have-on-hand gadget .	1
Works as expected from OXO . Comfortable handle . Stainless blade . Etched measurements . Dishwasher safe . This is an excellent scraper at a great price . I love it .	1
Great pastry scraper . I think I will have to get some as gifts for people for Christmas . My mom visited and she fell in love with it . It scrapes great , it cuts cinnamon rolls and dough perfectly .	1
Works great to cut my pie and cookie dough in half and to scrape it up off of the counter after it is rolled .	1
I love the weight of the handle , feels very substantial in hand , hopefully it 'll last . The ruler is a nice touch , but really there 's not much else to say , its a sturdy dough scraper with a nice handle and a ruler .	1
This is pretty straight forward , but I wonder how I ever managed before . This is great working with my dough and great cleaning my toaster oven ( scraping the crumb tray which often has carbonized spillage crusted on it ) . Be warned -- the edge is SHARP ! I continue to place it back in the cardboard holder it arrived in . I 'd like to see a storage case created for this .	1
i am so happy i bought this , it is great , now i can cut my bars into equal sizes and not have to wash my knife everytime ! !	1
I like this scraper for picking up chopped/diced items to add to a dish or pot . Using it is so much easier and quicker than using a knife or my fingers . I would definitely purchase again . It is really nice to have good kitchen tools to use and not improvise with whatever knife one has .	1
I had been looking for a decent pastry cutter for a little bit , they are many options out there . This seemed to fit right into the pocket of quality constructions and value . I am happy to say that I use this item regularly , from cutting dough , to cleaning flat surfaces to even scrapping pans . The etched in ruler on the blade is also useful especially when looking to make uniform cuts for strips of pastry of even fresh pasta noodle .	1
I like having this tool at my disposal . I had always had one ( different brand ) and needed to replace it when the old handle cracked . This is made well .	1
I use this a lot . It is very nice . This item arrived on time and is an excellent purchase . I like it very much and am VERY glad I ordered it . Thank you so much Amazon.com for the great price , good value and prompt delivery . I use this item frequently .	1
This oxo grips multi-purpose pastry scraper and chopper is all-in-one tool . Cut you butter into the flour , scrap the flour on the counter and chop it all together and easy to clean , thank you	1
I do n't do any baking & I do n't do much cooking either . I wanted a product like this for scraping up chopped vegetables ( especially sliced onions ) off a cutting board when making salads . It 's easier & safer than using the chef 's knife . It works very well & the grip is designed just right .	1
I 've had cheap dough blenders before , and the blades always ended out pushed out of line from the butter or from the dough itself ... and they were impossible to clean ! But the OXO Good Grips is fabulous ... the blades do n't move , so your cutting is always right on and even , and because it 's so sturdy , the blending is done in no time ! It cleans easily -- just toss it in the dishwasher . And the famous OXO grip makes it easy to hold and does n't hurt your hand . Much better than cheapo dough cutters , and you 'll never use the two-knife system again .	1
I 've used this several time now for making crumb-toppings and simple shortbread-type doughs , and it works quite well as long as the recipe calls for soft butter ; it seemed a little lightweight when using cold butter , so I 'll continue doing that by hand .	1
I bake many types of scones and pastries that demand perfect blending . That means the fat and flour must be blended well , but not overblended . This tool has taken a lot of the hard work and time out of the old way of using two knives in scissors action . The overall balance to weight ratio is excellent ; the handle is a good diameter and width , and the tines are spaced apart nicely . The design of the tines makes reaching all parts of the bowl to pick up flour a breeze . Cleanup is easy since you can toss it into the diswasher without fear of rust . I highly recommend this product from novice to pro .	1
It 's very hard to find a nice dough blender and this one is really nice . The grip is wonderful and it cuts down that pie crust making time in half . This is a real Godsend during the holidays when you 're making all those cookies and cutting in the butter , as well as all your pies . My only complaint is that one of the tines bent a little but other than that , I have no problems with it and use it quite frequently . I became quite weary of using a fork to cut in my dough and actually got lazy and tossed it all into my Kitchenaid mixer before I bought this blender . It washes up beautifully in the dishwasher and is basically something EVERYONE needs to have in their kitchen .	1
The OXO pastry blender is , in basic shape , much like any other pastry blender : it consists of a handle with several rounded `` blades '' that you use to blend butter or shortening into dry ingredients such as flour.There are a couple of differences . One is OXO 's spiffy traditional `` Good Grips '' handle , a soft , thick rubber handle that 's easy on arthritic ( or otherwise painful ) hands . The other is that the `` blades '' are more like the thick wire that you 'll find in a whisk.The handle is a great thing ; certainly I find it easier on my tendonitis than an ordinary pastry blender . The wire-like blades have one good aspect : they do n't have flat sides for butter and shortening to stick to , so it 's a little easier to scrape chunks of butter and shortening out of them , and it 's a lot easier to clean them.There are a couple of down-sides , however . First , the wire blades are flexible enough that sometimes large chunks of butter push them aside instead of getting sliced up by them . Second , the handle on ours actually cracked through , and the wire blades have gotten deformed slightly so they 're no longer evenly-spaced.This is a common theme among the OXO items we buy . They have great design elements that make it worth it for us to continue buying some of their things , but they also lack a certain durability under heavy kitchen use . A number of OXO items have broken under our care . And while we unabashedly admit that we make heavy use of our kitchen items , we do not abuse them . We 're careful to take care of them , and have few cases of things gratuitously getting damaged .	1
This sifter is extremely simple to use . No mess ; it 's easy to manage any size sifting job : just control the side-to-side motion and there is no trouble using virtually any mixing bowl . You can really shake it like crazy , or use the opposite hand to support and softly & quot ; roll & quot ; it . Shake more vigorously for speed and large quantity , short shaking strokes for smaller bowls and less ingredients ... so simple , and could n't be more versatile ! The covers are used when measuring and sifting , not primarily for storage ; the top is not air-tight . Why in the world would you ever store a sifter with any flour in it anyway ? ! Just tap it out completely into the trash or sink to remove excess flour.The top cover is specifically designed to stay on during sifting , keeping flour/cocoa etc from wafting out while you shake-shake-shake . The bottom cap keeps contents from falling through the mesh screen while you measure flour , cocoa , baking soda , salt , etc into the top . That way , you can move it around your workspace if you need to . Oops ! Forgot that pinch of nutmeg that 's supposed to sift-in with the baking powder and flour ? Just walk the sifter over to the pantry and shake-in the spice ! Easy to clean , all stainless steel construction which wo n't rust , and it 's even dishwasher safe ! I put mine through a hand-wash or even the dishwasher every so often , especially after sifting cocoa or lots of aromatic spices , to remove residue that can transfer to other ingredients , and keep it sparkling new ! Just remember to let all the parts thoroughly air-dry before you snap the lids back on to put it away.I only wish OXO made an even larger & quot ; commercial & quot ; -sized Good Grips sifter for my bigger baking projects !	1
Works well for a sifter of flour and such . However , do n't try to sift something like Bisquick ( which I think you really should n't do anyway ) -- - your efforts will be futile ! I like the fact that it has a lid on both ends so that when you 're filling it , you do n't spill flour all over the counter pouring it in ( leaking from the bottom ) . Very durable and sturdy ; much better than those that are much less expensive AND cheaply made .	1
I do n't know why people are saying this product works slowly ? I find that you can dispense a cup of flour in about 10 seconds . Maybe they can design this sifter so that the covers can use a hinge to open and close , so the covers stay with the unit , but other than that , it does its job .	1
A lot of thought was obviously put into this product . It is well designed and manufactured from high quality materials . I expect it will last me many years.Unlike some other reviewers I had no problem with speed . I sifted 3 cups of flour in under a minute . I did notice that the mesh screen at the bottom of the sifter can be removed for cleaning . I also noticed that it can become dislodged and not flush with the agitator at the bottom of the sifter . This may be why some folks are experiencing slow sifting . They may simply need to realign the mesh screen properly.The plastic lids that come with this sifter are a brilliant addition . Put the bottom lid on when scooping the flour into the sifter then put the top lid on while shaking to keep the flour from shaking out the top . Then use both lids when storing the unit.The metal is a very sturdy but I was disappointed by the plastic handle . I would have preferred the rubberized grip OXO uses for most of their other products . ( -1 star )	1
Handle is comfortable , sifter design works very well and I love the cover for top and bottom-no powder messes in my cuboards-OXO never fails to impress me .	1
Another awesome product from OXO ! Very ergonomic . Heavier gage mesh than pictured . Should last for the rest of MY life ! Thanks Grandma , but the mesh wore out on your old one ! ! ! Wish it had a handle on the side like Grandma 's old one . The shaking can be a bit cumbersome for those that have a problem with repeatative motion difficulty .	1
I usually keep a few rice grains in the bottom of any sifters for that extra help , but this thing barely needs it . I 've had a couple trigger sifters flat out break on me and by far prefer this design-nothing mechanical to break down . The caps on the sifter are my favorite part , though I did forget to take off the bottom one at first ( whoops ) -but they 're handy to have . Hand wash and return to cabinet . Lasts sifter you 'll ever need .	1
This does the job - much neater than any other sifter . I 've owned battery operated ones , used a sifter while tapping it against my hand ( messy ! ) and this new one is so much easier to use . Definitely recommend .	1
I love the fact there are two covers both top and bottom . Makes it is a much cleaner ordeal . The sifter is a shake sifter which is great for those of us with arthritis . Price is worth it . Over all , well made and a must for all bakers .	1
Oxo wins again with this handy gadget ! ( Excuse the pun ) It is easy to use and can be operated one-handed using a side-to-side motion . It has tight-sealing lids for both the top and bottom , so you can leave flour in it all of the time . It holds two cups , which is perfect for most applications , yet it remains small enough for easy storage . I had been using a strainer , which can be pretty messy , so this was a big step up from that.One thing to note regarding the tag for arthritis on this ... I have psoriatic arthritis , which effects my hand & wrist joints . After typical use with this sifter , my wrist joint is pretty sore . I do not think this is a better option than traditional sifters , in that regard , but I thought I would mention it . Perhaps the tag is there because the handle is more ergonomic ...	1
I wish I would have replaced my old squeeze type sifter long ago , I just did n't figure this shake type would do anything but make a mess . I was wrong . I would n't use a tiny bowl to sift into , but it does n't have to be huge to keep from making a mess . This works very well and my hand does n't get cramped up when I 'm sifting a bunch of flour for cookies or bread .	1
Lots of reviewers have commented about how it took them minutes to sift a single cup of flour . I sifted 3 cups worth in about 15 seconds , and I was n't shaking it excessively either . The sifting action works well , and I did not have any problems with flour going all over or needing to use a super large bowl to catch it all . Honestly , I do n't know if the other reviewers got a bad item , or if they were trying to sift a coarsely ground material , but it works fine .	1
This utensil will slide under cookies stuck on a baking pan without cracking or crumbling them . It will allow you to remove a small square of brownie or cake from a pan without breaking up the pieces alongside it . It transfers several appetizers or treats at a time . And if you do use it to ice a cake , the offset handle provides excellent control and keeps your fingers out of the frosting . It smoothes any topping to absolute perfection -- you will look like a pro .	1
I have been meaning to buy an off-set spatula and finally did order this one . It 's great for spreading cream filling into a blind-baked pie crust . It 's a great addition to my kitchen .	1
Thank you OXO ! ! ! I have n't used this great tool for icing a cake yet . I used it to loosen some brownies from a cake pan and loosening some cookies before I used the plastic spatula I have ( it has a thicker edge ) . Nice very flat edge works perfectly . Another great OXO product easy on the hands . Love the ergonomic handle ! ! !	1
I back quite a bit , and this knife has significantly reduced the time that it takes to frost a cake , it 's that good . Between this and my Wilton Trim-and-Turn Ultra cake turntable , I can get a cake frosted in minutes . The weight is perfect , the width and length of the blade perfect , and I like the feel of the rubberized plastic of the handle much better than the wooden cake knife I had been using . It has also survived multiple trips through the dish washer and still looks new . Very pleased with this purchase .	1
I love to bake cakes , so I 'm not sure why I waited so long to buy one of these . Works wonderfully , very easy to use and flexible . Highly recommend it !	1
spread batter , frosting and a lot of other things around on a sheet pan or frost a cake . Nicely made s/s blade and silicon handle with a nice grip . Has gone through the dishwasher many times w/o any mishaps or rust problems . There is some flex to the blade therefore it might not be the best to spread really thick cookie doughs or batters around with but it does a nice job with lighter batters and frostings . I 'm happy , works for me .	1
I use this offset ( Oxo calls it `` bent '' ) icing knife ( really a spatula ) on a regular basis . I mostly use it with cheesecakes : the flexibility is perfect for getting around inside the pan to separate the cheesecake from the sides without cutting into it or scratching the pan ( be sure to spray it with Pam first ) . I also slide it under the cheesecake to separate it from the springform base , and then use it to start lifting it off the pan . It 's nice and thin so I can get under the cake easily , but I 'd recommend using parchment under your crusts/cakes : because it 's thin and lightweight I would accidentally cut into the cake sometimes , before using parchment . This Oxo knife is not strong enough to bear the weight of the cheesecake alone , so I use my hands or a wide cake blade for that.It 's also great for lightweight icings and frostings , as others have said . I 've used it numerous times for whipped cream and even Wilton 's canned frosting , thinned a bit . It 's not sturdy enough for fondant . I do have a smaller one that has a sturdier blade , and it 's great on smaller cakes.If you are an active baker you will find many uses for this offset spatula , but if you are like most active bakers , you will likely need more than just one type to meet your various needs .	1
This size whisk is perfect for small jobs . Feels great in the hand and is well made . I have had a whisk from the Dollar Store , worked OK for a while , but then fell apart . Cooking is much easier with good equipment .	1
I have an awesome huge whisk , but sometimes you just do n't want to bother with the weight of a heavy whisk when you 're whisking something lighter . I reach for my OXO Good Grips 11-inch whisk 90 % of the time . It does a great job , the handle is comfortable , it 's not too heavy but can whisk just fine . Unless you 're whisking egg whites by hand , this is an AWESOME go-to whisk . Also , OXO has really good customer service . I had an issue with another product that was my fault , and they replaced it kindly . I really appreciated that . I have many of their kitchen products and have liked them all .	1
I have another Good Grip whisk ... And i have to say i love them both ... The handle is what really helps . It fits my ( older ) hand and makes whisking / mixing easy ... The stainless steel wires that make up the Whisk are strong and do the job well ... I recommend both the 9 & # 34 ; and 11 & # 34 ; Whisks	1
This is my only whisk , and it is the perfect size to do just about any whisking job . Sometimes it 's a little small , but overall I would definitely suggest this to someone that does n't want to buy 3 different sizes .	1
I own two of these just in case I ever need to scramble eggs and mix pancake batter at the same time . I love it a great deal . Not much to say . It 's small , but it 's also sturdy and well balanced . You 're not going to mix a ten gallon vat of pancake batter with it . But it 's perfect for a family size mixing bowl or a three egg omelet .	1
I bought this whisk because my old one finally broke ( 2 of the wires popped out ) . When I was browsing for a new one , I did n't really know how the whisk was measured . This one is the `` 11-inch '' model , but I did n't know from what to what was included in that measurement . Now I know ! The measurement is from one end to the other tip , and not just the metal part , for anybody else who might be in the dark about this . I am thrilled with this whisk . I also have a silicon-covered whisk , which is not so great , especially when stirring pudding that you have to stir forever . ( I am not a fan of the instant/no stir type . ) That silicon-covered whisk leaves a thick coat of pudding sludge on the bottom of my pan , because it is n't actually scraping the pan like a metal one . I like that these wires are shaped in an elongated manner instead of a more puffed-out shape , it seems to get the job done very well . I guess my old whisk was really junky , but this one is great . Also the rubber handle is comfortable to hold . I do n't find the length too long either , something that is actually an issue , as I am a petite person ( `` short '' ) and long cooking tools are too difficult to deal with .	1
I am a quadriplegic/tetraplegic ( C5-6 if you care ) . I have about 1/3 use of my hands and 1/2 use of my arms . I can use most whisks with some effort , however , this Oxo one is almost effort-free for me . I even whip small amounts of cream ( 1/2 pint or less ) because this whisk works so well for me.My mother , who has mild arthritis , loves this whisk as well.This whisk is a nice size for whipping up a small amount of eggs ( 2-8 ) , cream , crepes , etc . You 'll need a full size whisk for more substantial recipes.As with most Oxo tools it is very ergonomically designed : it fits the hand and does the job it is supposed to do .	1
I 've been downsizing and cooking for one of late and as I was thinning the drawers and crocks of kitchen gadgets it struck me - out of the many and some not so mighty , this is the *last* whisk left.So how is this whisk special ? It handles a single egg or a box of cake mix . The handle is comfortable to hold and weighted just enough that it does n't tire my hand or wrist - even with severe arthritis . It 's large enough not to get totally lost in a bigger bowl but small enough to work efficiently in a tighter bowl too . The tines are n't flimsy - they keep their shape while you are whipping away . Easy cleanup in the dishwasher . Ca n't think of a single thing I 'd change.Last whisk standing.Highly recommended .	1
This is almost a hybrid of the flat whisks and the balloon type . I use this several times per week and love the small size . It 's great for mixing dry ingredients instead of sifting for baking , for mixing batter , egg replacers , and for dissolving green superfood powders into juices and water . Oxo is a staple in my kitchen -- I love their stuff . Do measure because it 's small -- a feature I really like .	1
As with mos of the good grips products , very comfortable handle . Works good and appears to be drable .	1
Nice handle , good nine inch size , dishwasher safe and easy to store . This whisk is the first one out of the drawer for the task .	1
I love the handles on these guys . I got two sizes and they are just the ticket for making sauces , pudding and such . Your hands wo n't cramp while using them , nor will the whisks slip out of your hand .	1
Nice little whisk , this is . I wanted one that was n't 12 '' long and this fits the bill . Nice and small and lots of wiring ~ sometimes I think too many , but it seems to work well for whisking dry ingredients while baking .	1
5 stars . BUT where 's the hook or whatever from which to hang the whisk ? And , no , obviously one does n't hang the whisk from the beater whisk wires ! Overall , however , I love this little whisk . Very handy . Efficient . And a joy to use .	1
I bought the larger size first and loved it so I went ahead and bought this 9 inch and also love it . Highly recommend .	1
A little larger would have been nice and there is no give to this whisk . Good for scraping the bowl tho..	1
Good quality , OXO is a good brand that I frequently buy however be sure to pay attention to the dimensions . I thought I was getting a bigger wisk length wise than I actually received . It was my fault for not looking closer to the size . I kept it anyway , I will use it . It is just not the full length I wish I had purchased .	1
When I got this whisk I also got an 11 inch one because I have always used bigger ones . I figured a small one would come in handy from time to time.Well , I was wrong . THIS is the one I use all the time . Great for eggs , baking , sauces ... If you just want to get one whisk , I recommend this OXO and this size .	1
After one month of use , I hightly recommend it so far . It 's easy to handle , the size is perfect for small mixtures and it seems to have good quality , both the whisk and the grip .	1
The OXO 9-inch whisk is a very good product . However , I should have been more mindful when I ordered this because I already own this exact size . I was looking for one that was slightly longer - about 11 inches , but still as slender to replace one that broke . I use the whisk often , always with great results .	1
Good rubber handle with excellent weight . A good whisk has a good handle weight to allow it to pivot close to the hand/wrist allowing for a whipping motion to aerate whatever you are whisking . Cheap whisks have hollow metal handles that lack this heaviness.Rubber on the handle also gives great grip when whisking heavier things such as eggs or heavy cream . Have n't been disappointed with OXO yet .	1
This is a great whisk to add to your kitchen tools . As always , the handle is quite ergonomic , an Oxo trademark . I purchased this one because it is an in between size . It 's great for use with smaller bowls as the head of the whisk is narrower . I actually use it more often than my large whisk . A great addition to my kitchen !	1
Not much else to say about it . It 's smaller than the whisks I grew up with , so if you use big bowls , buy the next size up . Otherwise it 's great .	1
Ok , cmon now . It 's a whisk and works well . I own MANY oxo products and am pleased with almost all their products . They all perform their function well and with style . And they are also very comfortable to use thanks to the famous oxo nonslip rubber handle . Seems very sturdily made and have had absolutley no problems . I would hihgly reccommend .	1
Exactly what I needed , I had one before but lost it in the move to a new house . Thank you .	1
Not only is this my favorite whisk , it is truly well made . While making a custard filling for caramel eclairs ( you know those magical eclairs in the Simply Irresistible movie ) I found that the balloon shape and the way the wires adapt themselves to the shape of a saucepan was highly desirable.For one thing , you do n't want any clumping in a sauce or custard and things do tend to get clumpy if you ca n't get into the inner edge of a saucepan . With a bit of pressure , you can whisk into every inch of a saucepan . This is not always possible with a plastic whisk which is definitely not as flexible.The handle on this whisk makes it easy to keep a grip and OXO is known for their ergonomic considerations . I think of it as an almost suede rubber that is not only comfortable to hold , it allows your hand to grip the handle more firmly.Now the reason the 10 stainless-steel wires are so sturdy is because they are sealed into the base with a clear resin material . This also prevents food from building up and I throw this whisk in the dishwasher without fear.If you bang the wires against your hand you can see how sturdy this whisk is and I can almost imagine that somewhere in the world someone is using this whisk as a musical instrument.When the cookbook says `` whisk '' this is the one I 'd highlyrecommend.~The Rebecca Review	1
This whisk is so nice to use & does n't rust in the dishwasher ! I have both sizes now & wo n't ever buy another brand .	1
I have kept this whisk regardless of its being much shorter than I expected because it 's very nice for small batches.I am a big fan of the ergonomic handle thanks to which I can almost effortlessly whip up cream , egg whites and stir pudding just by moving my wrist ... .it makes me feel like a & # 34 ; pro & # 34 ; .	1
I use my Oxo 9 '' whisk for many different recipes ( whipping air into eggs , mixing liquid ingredients , etc . ) , and it always performs like a pro and goes straight into the dishwasher for easy cleanup . My only recommendation would be to invest in a silicone-coated whisk as well ; this will scratch up your nonstick cookware , but it works great for mixing and other general kitchen duties .	1
Assuming the quality of this item is just as good as it was 5 years ago..then this little whisk is essentially perfect . It 's been through 5 years of pretty heavy use ( at least a couple of times a week , sometimes much more ) and plenty of trips through the dishwasher . As far as I can tell it 's still in perfect condition and of course it 's quite comfortable to use . What more could you ask for from a cheap little whisk in this day and age ?	1
So much easier than trying to use a fork to make omelets and such . Has a good feeling grip too .	1
I love this whisk ! The handle is a comfy rubber that does n't tire your wrist . It more tines than any other whisk I 've owned which is a good thing because eggs and cream whip faster .	1
I use this for small jobs that I do n't want to get a hand mixer our for . I love the fact that it is metal and not nylon , but I wish the very end had a bit of a pointed tip . It would make it much more useful when making gravy on a saucepan on the stove . Other than that , it is great and makes awesome pancakes and scrambled eggs .	1
This whisk is really well-made and so far I am really pleased with its usage in my kitchen . It is very sturdy and does a good job !	1
I am a fan of OXO products and this whisk is no exception . Very well made and the handle has nice feel . This whisk is kept in a jar with my other frequently used kitchen tools so it can be quickly accessed .	1
I 've used used this several times ( mostly scrambled eggs ) and love it . I like the fact I do n't have to worry about it rusting if it stays in the water a few days . Ok , so I 'm a guy , old , divorced and not into cooking but I found if I spray it with 'Pam ' is is very easy to clean but y'all probably already knew that.I have learned , 'Do n't skimp on quality ' of kitchen utensils , you 'll pay more in the end . Not gon na tell you about my cheap 'melted ' spatula ! Good product . Hope my comments were a help .	1
This whisk is great ! It is much better than I expected and better than any other whisk I have owned . It is good quality and easy to hold . I just bought a second one and am throwing out my 2 old bent out of shape rusty bottomed ones .	1
This is great and covers all needs and I use it for everything from eggs to whatever- beautifully made and cleans well	1
I love this OXO Grip whisk .The handle is perfect for my older hands . And the whisk itself is strong . Both are a plus in making the job quick and easy . I 'm so glad I took a chance on this one and bought others to go with it ...	1
I initially saw this 11-inch balloon whisk in a big box store and loved how the contour handle felt in my hand , but before buying it , I decided to check with Amazon.com and see if I could get it for a better price . I 'm glad I did because I saved about 25 % . I have used it a number of times and , in my view , it out performs all of my other wire whisks . I highly recommend this terrific kitchen tool .	1
handle easy to hold . sturdy whisk that does the job nicely and w/ ease . I bought the smaller version as well and like that one too .	1
OXO never disappoints with their products and this is no exception . This whisk works great , it feels comfortable in the hand and has just enough give . I made two batches of caramel sauce with this and after the first batch seized up on me it was not hard to wash the hardened crystals off the rungs . That makes this whisk a winner !	1
This is a very nicely built whisk , especially considering the price . The wires are bonded well to the handle , which is easy to grip and feels sturdy . The whisk performs well and is easy to clean . Nicely sized -- not too big , not too small . While you can spend a lot more for a more elegant or fancy looking tool , this gets the job done just as well , and appears built to last.I have a few other OXO kitchen tools and they have never let me down . This is no exception -- a great value , and highly recommended .	1
This balloon whisk , purchased from Amazon , is what I needed for larger and more weighty ingredients . I already had a small and medium size which I use frequently but knew that because I have severe arthritis in my hands I would need an ergonomic handle . It 's very comfortable , does the job and I recommend it for those with or without arthritis .	1
I have a rather small whisk for eggs and a slightly larger one that I use a lot , but the handle broke off my larger one recently , so was time for a new one . I always check America 's Test Kitchen to see what they recommend and they said this one , so got it . It is really nice and easy to use . Comfortable handle .	1
Great product for under $ 10.00 . Not much to say about this . It gets the job done ! 10 out of 10 for me	1
This is a good quality whisk . I love OXO products as they are so comfortable . I use this all the timeand am very happy with the quality . I would recommend this product .	1
I bought this almost two years ago , and have used it almost daily since then . It does a fine job and is holding up very well . It still looks new , in fact . I have a blender , food processor , and heavy duty stand mixer , and I use them also , but for small jobs , like beating a couple of eggs or whipping up some homemade mayonnaise , I prefer this handy easy-to-clean gadget .	1
I had been wanting to get a whisk and saw this one recommended by CI . It gets the job done . The handle is comfortable in my hand . Price was right . Happy with my purchase .	1
I love this wisk . Great quality and I love the gripper handle . Fast shipping and excellent packaging . Item as described and shown . Highly recommend . Plan on buying another size .	1
This is a fantastic whisk . It has a great handle and is dishwasher safe . It is well balanced and has worked well with everything I have thrown at it - including some fairly thick cookie batters . I will probably buy a few others of this same style .	1
This risk makes whipping cream a breeze . We ate 'real whipped cream ' throughout the holiday . Everyone enjoyed taking a turn with the whisk	1
High quality , dishwasher . It seems really durable and I think I 'll be able to use it for years . Not much more you can ask for from a whisk .	1
Nice handle , does the job well . Cleans well in dishwasher . Very happy with purchase . I have no complaints about this product .	1
I 'm not going to lie to you and say that this is something which i use everyday.. If I use it once a year , consider that enough . I bought it however because I needed one and got it in the mail today . It is fantastic ! It wreeks quality and I know I 'll have it for a long time . I love the rubber handle . It is easy on my hands ...	1
Good rubber handle with excellent weight . A good whisk has a good handle weight to allow it to pivot close to the hand/wrist allowing for a whipping motion to aerate whatever you are whisking . Cheap whisks have hollow metal handles that lack this heaviness.Rubber on the handle also gives great grip when whisking heavier things such as eggs or heavy cream . Have n't been disappointed with OXO yet .	1
Awesome grip on the handle . I am pleased .	1
Love it . Like all Oxo products this whisk is high quality and easy to hang on to with a nice non slip grip . I have the little one too .	1
Comfortable handle that seems pretty solid , and it 's a good size . Not so large it takes up the whole drawer , not so small that bigger whipping jobs ca n't be done . I wind up grabbing this one for just about everything and it seems to be holding up well .	1
Love this whisk ! ! ! ! ! Made well and does it 's job properly . I would gladly recommend this to anyone I know . You can get this at BBB for a bit cheaper with 20 % coupon .	1
Perfect , all purpose whisk . We use it quite regularly . The grip is nice and is comfortable in any position held .	1
We saw it being favorably reviewed on a PBS cooking show , so we ordered one here . It only cost about $ 10 . It is comfortable to use , and does a nice job in the mixing bowl .	1
This OXO is my versatile , go-to whisk ; the first tool for which I reach in a variety of food prep applications . It is the perfect size , weight and design to move rapidly in incorporating more air into scrambled egg preparation , for example . I own a variety of whisks , but the OXO Good Grips is the only one I keep handy on my counter top . Highly recommended .	1
Makes whisking easy and clean . Small enough and good-looking enough to , and good value for the price . Have been using for many months now , and no problem faced . Highly recommend !	1
This is the perfect whisk -- the tines stay true and strong , it cuts through heavy batter with ease but whips cream into air , the handle never slips out of my hand ... I could go on . After 14+ years and approximately 1,000,000 trips through the dishwasher , the rubber base DOES eventually separate from the business end , and allow liquids to seep into the handle . No matter . It 's such a reasonably-priced item in comparison I hardly consider that a negative .	1
This whisk is your typical size . It works well for larger pots of sauces , etc . Not good for needing to get close to the edge on a pot . There are smaller whisks that get closer to the edges . Overall , another great OXO product .	1
This is a really nice balloon whisk , it will be perfect for making eggs or batters . Really sturdy and not to difficult to clean .	1
I bought this OXO Good Grips whisk in the 11 '' size thinking it would be good for many uses . I did n't want to get too dinky of one and this one definitely is n't dinky ! Good big size , nice grip ( like all the good grips line ) . I highly recommend .	1
At 50-something , my hands are beginning to ache , but I still cook , though sometimes I get my son to open jars for me . This whisk is great because it is soft on the hand and does n't require much pressure to control it . It also happens to be a great whisk , doing what a whisk should do and doing it well . Then , when you are done , you can pop it on the top rack to clean . What more could you ask for ?	1
Easy to grip , easy to clean , and makes my omelettes fluffy . This is a great whisk , and that 's about all you need to know .	1
Easy to clean , makes me some super fluffy eggs . Has held up well so far , and the construction is tip top .	1
This is a great tool to have if you frequently whisk wet and dry ingredients together . With a normal balloon-type whisk , thick batters can get stuck in the middle , but that ca n't happen with this . I use it a lot for pancake and waffle batters .	1
Just the right size for whipping up some eggs . The flat whisk fits the utensils drawer well . The handle is great and comfortable to use in any position .	1
This is super for 1 reasons:1 - It is a flat whisk and the flat whisks have always worked great for me . Much better than the round ones.2 - It has a great grip which is great for someone like me who has trouble using their hands very long.I highly recommend it and I would buy it again .	1
It has a nice length with balanced handle and nice tongs to reach all the surfaces of a pan or bowl . I hand wash it and do not put it in the dish washer .	1
Should have bought one of these years ago ! Very handy , well made , works great . What more needs to be said ?	1
I purchased this for my niece who is living on her own for the first time and is exploring her cooking talents . This wisk is a good fit because it is safe for all types of pans and machine washable . I recommend this wisk for making gravies and rues .	1
I got this because I just bought a new bulb wisk that broke the first time I used it so I thought this would be a better option . It works great this morning when I used it to wisk pancake batter and scramble eggs .	1
Needed a mid-sized whisk as I 'm doing more cooking and food prep . This fits the bill nicely . Seems like it will last a long time . Always best to have the right tool for the right job .	1
Sturdy and comfortable , love the flat style . The price is right and it works extremely well , what is not to love ?	1
Item was described as compatible with non-stick coated pans , but it was stainless and not coated , so not the best item for use with most non-stick coatings . Many buyers mentioned this in reviews , which I did n't see until looking at the item again to make sure I 'd read the description correctly when buying . The description no longer said anything about use with non-stick pans , but a BUNCH of reviews said they had the same problem I had : the description made it seem as though the whisk was fine for use with coated pans.Otherwise , though , OXO has another fine product in this whisk . It would be great for use with cast iron or any metal pan without non-stick coating , but I would n't want to use it even on new pans that state metal utensils are okay . It just wears the coating faster .	1
this stores and cleans much much easier than a conventional whisk . works great . thanks again oxo for a nice product	1
I did not realize how much difference a flat whisk would make when making gravy . I had been using a balloon whisk and thought it was fine . The flat whisk is more effective and quicker . Try it .	1
It does the job I need it for but the size is silly small . I guess it permits you to beat one egg in a cup or something . I paid seven bucks - a little pricey but most of the OXOs are priced a little higher than I think is fair , however it IS a good item but should be bigger .	1
Great for custards , because you need to be scraping the entire surface of the pan to prevent curdling the eggs !	1
I never thought I had a use for a flat whisk ... . until I ordered this and used it once . It is now my favorite whisk ~ I even use it in my non-stick pans and I have not found it to hurt them at all , though I am pretty consistent at being a little more gentle when I do use it in those pans . Great whisk , I would definitely buy again .	1
Works great , especially for gravy . I only wish the handle was a bit bigger . My hands are big , so it is hard to hold on to when you are whisking fast . Would buy again though .	1
I have never owned a & # 34 ; Flat & # 34 ; Whisk before . Holy ( Beep ) . How did I ever live without one ? These whisks are so wonderful for gravy and so many other things . The OXO Good Grips brand seems to be of high quality . It has a great feel in your hand and does n't feel too heavy or too light and the wires seem to have just the right amount of flexibility without feeling too weak or too rigid . I love this whisk and use it all of the time . A must have for serious cooks .	1
Flat whisks are much easier to clean than standard whisks . Prefer this type to mix pancake batter , cake mixes , and cookies . Since they are flat , makes them easier to clean and batter does not clump at the bottom like a standard whisk .	1
This type of whisk was recommended for making pan gravy.With Thanksgiving upcoming , last year , I purchased this with home-made turkey gravy in mind : ) Made easy work of scraping up the meat drippings from the roasting pan and mixing in the flour etc.Although I 've used it to whisk eggs , make puddings and for what one would normally use a whisk for , I 'm looking forward to gravy making this Thanksgiving again : ) ~Enjoy~	1
Very handy tool I reach for often when cooking , it doubles as a whisk or even for turning salmon on the griddle .	1
Firstly , I love all OXO products . They are sturdy , the handles are made from slip-resistant rubber and they are fairly easy to clean . I purchased this balloon whisk so that I could finally whisk items while they are in my good non-stick cooking pans , without damaging them . While they nylon whisk part is n't as stiff as most metal whisks , this does the job very well and I 'm happy with it .	1
I love these utensils . We got some nice nonstick cookware and these nylon turners and spoons work great and do not scratch the cook surface	1
Great whisk and the price is unbeatable . I went with this one since it 's heat resistant and with it being non-metal , I can use it in my non-stick pots without worrying . Thanks OXO for making such a great product with such a low price .	1
works well	1
The OXO Good Grips Nylon Balloon Whisk Is another great product . The handle is soft , thick and does not slip out of your hand . Great to whip a sauce or mashed potatoes in a non stick pan .	1
I love my wire whisks , but every now and then , I found myself at a loss not having a synthetic whisk I was willing to use on my non-stick pans . Now I have my solution .	1
This is a great whisk . It can be used in my non-stick cookware without damaging it . I find the handle easier to control than the sort of whisk I had before with a smaller , thinner handle.One of my favorite gadgets .	1
Wow , I thought this was going to be too heavy to handle but not so , it is so light and easy to whisk anything you might want to whip up quick fast and in a hurry . I love this one as well and I got Rachael Rays as well and a viewer said that hers fell apart , so I went and got this one just in case it does and I have a back up . ( Hers has not given away yet too soon to tell ) Do get this one first . Hint : Shop around first before you purchase save money ! ! !	1
I love this thing , its sturdy yet made of silicone so it wont scratch your pots and pans when making sauces , gravy and eggs . Love it ! ! !	1
This works great and is really easy to clean . It 's great that you can use them for non-stick pans . Highly recommend .	1
This whisk has a comfortable handle , is lightweight , and seems to be strong built . Works just as good as my metal one with the plus of not scratching . I 'm happy with the purchase .	1
I was looking for a whisk that wo n't scratch all my plastic bowls and coated cookware . This was a great value and it works well . It 's just as rigid , if not moreso , than a metal one .	1
I would have liked it a bit more if the tines were a bit stiffer , but otherwise does a good job . I 'll still reach for the metal whisk if I 'm not working in a non-stick pan .	1
I was looking for a nylon whisk to use in non-stick pans so as not to scratch them . This fits the bill . My only complaint is that it is fairly large to use in smaller pots .	1
This balloon whisk seems flimsy . I use it in my nonstick cookware when I have to which something like a sauce or pudding . I like the handle and it is easy to clean .	1
This works great in my stainless steel pans and helps me in the kitchen because I have arthritics in my hands . Takes less effort and take the pressure out of my wrists to use this .	1
I purchased this because I noticed that my wire whisk was marking up the enamel on the inside of my Le Creuset pans . This does the job and leaves no scars !	1
Whisk works well to whisk in pans with heat , has n't melted , Holds up well in the dishwasher , ca n't rust , all plastic . Love it !	1
I have used this whisk on eggs , gravy and pudding ; it does a very nice job mixing all of them completely and smoothly . It does not scratch my non stick pots and pans like a metal whisk would . I really like how it fits in my hand the handle is soft and easy to hold . Because of it 's non stick coating cleaning it is also very easy , I like to clean most of my kitchen tools by hand so I ca n't comment if it 's dishwasher safe . This tool has made my life just a little bit easier and that 's what it 's all about when it comes to any tool .	1
I use a metal balloon whisk in general , but always hesitated when using it in teflon coated non stick pots and pans . This nylon whisk solves that problem , and although not quite as good of a whisk as a sturdy metal whisk with more tines , still very effective . Also the handle is very comfortable.If you 're looking for a good whisk that can be safely used in any type of cookware , here 's your whisk .	1
Simple and effective whisk to use with my non-stick cookware purchased through Amazon . I had another plastic-clad one but eventually the plastic wore off the tines and the bare metal was hitting the nonstick coating so I had to toss it . This is is solid nylon so that wo n't be an issue here . The typical quality OXO .	1
The whisk was a little bigger than what I really wanted , but I still like it and use it often . I love the quality .	1
Finally , a non-metallic whisk that does its job . Mixes things beautifully , whips quickly , cleans easily . I would recommend it to any good cook . Oxo wins again .	1
I am so glad to own this whisk , my biggest worry is scratching nonstick pans , and my stainless steel pots and pans . I no longer have this worry . The handle is also very comfortable to use for consistent stirring . OXO Nylon products are a great replacement to my metal utensils .	1
Non scratch on coated pans and durable . Helps make great Hollandaise sauce . It is a useful item in your kitchen drawer .	1
I ordered this because my son got me non-stick cookware and I did n't want to scratch it using a regular whisk . It works great ! It 's easy to clean , and does n't scratch my Calphalon Comtemporary Non-Stick Cookware .	1
It 's not good for heavy duty applications , but it is great for a nylon whisk . Wo n't scratch your nonstick , and does a great job with whipping .	1
These are absolutely the best I have ever used . First , they are accurate . I tested them for both dry ingredients and liquids with a digital scale and a known to be accurate liquid measure . This is important to me when baking , especially breads . The set includes a half-tablespoon and a 1/8 teaspoon , both handy sizes and often not included in sets . The sizes are in easy to see colors . They feel good , at least in my hands by having a non-slip surface , good length and substance that should last many years . I wear a 7-1/2 glove if that gives an idea of scale . They move freely on the keeper loop , as well as remove and reattach easily . It does n't seem like they are going to come apart in the drawer , so this may need an update later . The black color did not hurt being able to see dark spices , or clear liquids too badly . I 'd like a second set so I have one set for liquids and one for dry ingredients . I realize that black is an OXO `` thing '' but I hope they consider offering this product in a lighter color .	1
I cook/bake all the time and love these measuring spoons . The `` good grips '' on them makes them easy to handle . I love the sizes , too , as I have such a hard time finding the in between sizes , so these were absolutely perfect for each cooking job that I do .	1
OXO makes great kitchen tools and this is no exception . These are well made and dishwasher safe . There are plenty of sizes to get the right amount of what you need for your baking . I highly recommend this , but if you want a measuring set with less sizes on it , the stainless steel one by OXO is nice too .	1
These measuring spoons are accurate , and include 1/8 tsp measure , as well as 1/2 TB measure . Very handy to have around . The handles are thick and chunky . The loop that holds them together will easily snap on or off . The loop is also LARGE , which means that if you have pot hooks above you , they will quite happily hang from said hooks.As with the measuring cups of the same variety , I do n't think that the numbers will stay brightly coloured , as they 're on a raised surface , but since the surface is raised , you can still tell what size you 're working with.Bonus feature : since these are plastic , a tiny drop of oil will work to keep them clean if you 're measuring something sticky , like peanut butter , maple syrup , or corn syrup . The ovular shape makes it so that they will most likely fit into the mouths of most spice jars . I have another set of measuring spoons that are made of metal , and are perfectly round . The perfectly round shape will not fit into my smaller spice jars . Boo . These , however , with the oval shape , sneak right in .	1
A little clunky but serviceable . I 'm hoping that the marking survive the dishwasher . I 'll try to get back and add another updated review after I 've used them for a while .	1
( Pros ) + They function well as spoons and / or scoops.+ Easy to maintain and clean+ Inexpensive+ They all match one another ( Cons ) + ( this is the big `` Duh '' by looking @ other reviews ) the paint wears offI cook a lot and I actually purchased these from a grocery store one night when I finally grew tired of having to wash out my metal measuring spoons with every new ingredient I used . These spoons work as advertised - there has never been a time where the material I was scooping or measuring completely passed through the spoon without picking up . It 's a plus that they 're all pretty standard sizes so that when the `` permanently bonded brightly colored dots '' wear off , I can just compare them to the other spoons I have.If your biggest concern is whether or not you 'll be able to read the lettering on these spoon in 3 years , do n't buy the set.If you 're looking for a good value for a set of measuring spoons to compliment what you might already own or if you 're pretty solid with recognizing and remembering spoon sizes , then this is a quality buy.I 'd give it a five , but , you know ... the numbers wear off . Otherwise , these spoons are more fully functional than the second death star ( and you wo n't have to worry about space ships flying through and blasting holes through your spoon ) .	1
We do a lot of baking in our household so we were eager to get our hands on this OXO measuring spoon set . We own other OXO products and find they are high-quality products.These spoons are another solid product . I like the in-between sizes , as our previous measuring spoon set did not contain all these sizes . The plastic ring is nice because you can just pull off whatever size you need , instead of taking all of the spoons off the ring.The only negative is that the size lettering is not easily visible on the black color .	1
Contrary to what that little hog Rach Ray claims all cooks need to have a good set of measuring spoons . That is because it 's absolutely impossible to `` eye-ball '' small amounts of measurements , especially when you 're using leavening ingredients . These OXO Good Grips are probably the very best set of measuring spoons that I have ever used . I like the fact that they include the color-coded measurements on each . They 're also all interconnected so I can always find them and they never clutter up my kitchen cabinet ( I hate disorganization almost as much as I hate a messy kitchen . ) I have probably used these every single day that I have cooked since I purchased them because they are so practical and useful and helpful . They 're even dishwasher safe . They also have rubberized handles which make them easy to grip , and even easier if you get water or something on it as you 're cooking/prepping ; it 's not made out of that cheap plastic material that most cooking spoons are made from . I did take off 1 star only because the color-coded measurements are starting to wash off . These are made by OXO , a really great kitchen utensil company . OXO offers a lifetime `` 100 % satisfaction guarantee '' on all of their merchandise . I have had to implement their warranty on more than one occasion and it was always easy and very simple . A good set of measuring spoons are just as useful and needed as a good set of kitchen knives . Remember , you are what you cook .	1
Account holders wife here : This is a great set of measuring spoons . They are easy to read and very durable !	1
After reading a bunch of reviews here on Amazon I was a bit skeptical about these measuring spoons because of the fact a lot of reviewers said the measurements wear off after a limited amount of use.I then read that OXO updated this design to fix this issue , citing customer complaints . So , I ordered these spoons and I 'm happy I did . They are great.Here 's what I like : -The measurements are now a part of the plastic of the spoon and not just painted on . ( Also color coordinated . ) -This set includes the 1/8 teaspoon size . When shopping for a set of measuring spoons , many sets did not include this size.-It is very easy to detach and reattach the spoons to their ring.-The rubberized handles are easy to hold.These are an overall good set to have in the kitchen . I will check back if we have any issues with them in the future .	1
I have the larger measuring cup set as well and I 'm very pleased with both . They clip securely to the ring and stack nicely within each other . The classic Oxo rubber grip is a nice touch and I have n't experienced any wearing of the lettering . I do use these in the dishwasher but I do n't use the heat dry function .	1
This are so nice and heavy you can just tell they will last.. For the price you cant beat the quality	1
I am a fan of Oxo good grips products , and these are no exception . I have a very nice set of stainless measuring spoons that I adore , but had gotten to the point where I wanted a second set . These are perfect.Pros:1 . Spoons easily detach from the ring.2 . I do actually like the `` good grip '' on these . Who would think you 'd care for measuring spoons ! But they 're flexible in a pleasant way , and I do appreciate this about them.3 . Dishwasher safe ! 4 . Six sizes , not just four : 1 T , 1/2 T , 1 tsp , 1/2 tsp , 1/4 tsp , and 1/8 tsp.Indifferents:1 . `` Color-coded markings '' ... it would take some time to learn the colors ( I do n't believe orange is the universal color for 1/8 tsp , for example : - ) , and hey , I can read the markings.Cons:1 . I got nothin ' . I really love love love my stainless , but these are quite good .	1
Oxo usually makes quality products , but these measuring spoons are even a cut above expectations . The handle is open so the spoons can be detached and reattached to an oval ring , for use of use and storage . The measurements are clearly marked on the handle in a contrasting color , too . These could not be improved .	1
These rubbery-no-slip measuring spoons are better designed than several other plastic sets I own , and more ergonomic as well.As other reviews have stated , the printed size on each spoon seems likely to wear off with repeated washings ( perhaps handwash only to forestall this issue ? ) , but I think the slightly raised lettering would remain discernible even without coloring.You get more spoons than `` usual '' in this set of 6 , but the 1/2 Tablespoon is of questionable value since few recipes call for that odd measure . The 1/8 teaspoon is more useful since baking recipes I make do use that measure for salt and leaveners . The spoons bend easily , even alarmingly much -- no using them to scoop equal measures of cookie dough.For sturdiness and longevity , I actually prefer Oxo'smetal spoonswhich feel solid and durable , but cost more per-spoon.Recommended , for plastic spoons , but metal ones preferred .	1
i pick a size , massage the handle ever so gently . i dip it in the jar lightly shaking off any excess . oooohhhhhh i love spices ! they 're soooo goood . mmmmmm . ( now that 's what you get Amazon . quit sending me requests for reviews of benign products lol )	1
I have had my set for probably a few years now , and they look as good as the day I bought them . That being said , I honestly have n't used them very much , and when I did , I did n't wash them in the dishwasher . Considering all of the other reviews , if you are thinking about purchasing these , I would be sure to take VERY good care of them ; hand wash and try not to scrub the labels .	1
I see a lot of complaints that the labels wear off , but I have had these spoons for about 5 years with no trouble ( I do n't usually put them in the dishwasher though ... but sometimes I do ) . I think this is a good set and the ring is easy to open if you just want to use one spoon .	1
I like these spoons for they are easy to read , light and easy to hang up . I would buy them for a friend .	1
I love these spoons . They have easy grip handles made out of rubber . The numbers , although I have washed them numerous times in the dishwasher since I bought them , still have not rubbed off . I also like that they include 6 different sizes as opposed to the steel ones that only have four sizes . Those extra ones are useful for baking !	1
Use these spoons daily . Work better than ant I have had . Like the way they detach from the ring . The labels seem to be imprinted well . The 1/8 is great ! The shape is very handy for going into containers .	1
The measuring spoons are not something new by any means , but OXO has made them better by adding neat features like ; rubber on the handle of each spoon , brightly colored markings , and easy removing of a single measuring spoon by snapping one off . This means no more opening a ring to remove a cup , or washing all the cups because you need to use one and got another dirty ; and you wo n't loose them because they fasten securely back to the ring . These are also dishwasher safe . The price of these are a little more than the plastic ones you get in the store , but you are getting a lifetime warranty on the product .	1
I chose to review this for Amazon because I needed a new set of measuring spoons . Since I love the OXO product line , in general , I knew I would love these.Basically I do , but there is only one very minor thing I would change . The ring is not round , if the ring that holds the spoons together were round instead of oval it would be a lot easier for the spoons to glide around.Aside from the one minor flaw I find these spoons to be excellent . There are 6 spoons , 1/8 , 1/4 . 1/2 . and 1 tsp . also 1/2 and 1 tbsp.. the most convenient sizes.the arms of the spoons are very hefty but mildly flexible and thick for easy griping . The spoons bowl is stiff to make sure your measurement is true and it is slick so the food being measured slides out easily . The best feature for me , and makes this set stand out , is the ability to easily remove the spoons from its ring to be able to take the spoon to the recipe and not have to lug around the hole set.All in all it find that these deliver what the company set out to do.Now I can use set of measuring cups to match this set of spoons .	1
I love OXO products . We have a ton of them , but our original OXO spoons had lost all the size labels over the years and I had to guess which is which ... so we were due for some new ones . I was hesitant to go with OXO again , since I figured the paint would all just rub off again , but I saw that they changed the design so I took a chance . These are great . The sizes are inbedded in the rubber handles . I think these will last for a long time with no issues . I like that they all come off the ring easily too . You do n't have to unclip anything . 5 stars !	1
These are very nice for folks who have trouble gripping slick surfaces . The rubber grip on them helps but is not clumsy . Easy to read sizes but wish the size was more prominent in each spoon .	1
I love using my new measuring cups . The way they are shaped make it easy for me to pour as well as scoop up . The fact that they sort of clip onto a ring makes them extremely convenient and easy to remove and use . Helps me keep them together and I 'm glad I do n't have to open up the ring they came in in order to remove one of the cups . I also purchased the measuring spoons .	1
I have only had these for a little while but I love them . I have had no problems getting ingredients out and I have been hand washing and have had no problems with the numbers . They are sturdy and they include the extra sizes which is very helpful !	1
I liked these OXO measuring cups a lot , but there were some features that I did n't care for . The pluses : I liked the fact that there was a 2/3 cup measurement . I also thought that the non-slip grip on the handle was a real improvement over other measuring cups . However , I disliked and later removed the plastic band that held all the cups together . When I am reaching for a specific cup , I do n't want to take the time to pull it from its `` holder . '' I also did n't particularly like the shape of the cups since they took up more room than my round cups in the drawer .	1
Scooping ingredients out is so much easier with the angled design , and they clean easily as well . The hook on ring makes for convenient storage by keeping the cups together and allowing them to hang from a wall hook .	1
I can always rely on innovative products from this company ! Perfectly balanced and shaped measuring cups -- it even includes a 2/3 measure which I 've never seen before . Durable enough , I can even throw them in the dishwasher without fear of fading colors or melting . A beautiful set .	1
We bought these to have extra measuring cups at home . They are very nice and I love the grips that are on them . They do their job and we have n't had any issues with them breaking . Highly recommend .	1
I love these . Even though they are plastic , they do not hold grease and oil like some other plastics can . The shape is perfect and they are well-balanced . I like having a measure for 3/4 cup , too . It 's better than having to measure 1/4 cup three times , or having to use the half and the quarter measure.Get rid of the ring . It 's just a nuisance .	1
They are easy to fill . I like the narrow bowl . I would of like the handles just a little shorter but they are the best measuring cupsI found and I have been searching for at least 3 months .	1
I bought these as a gift for my in-laws to replace a miss-matched set of measuring cups . I was surprised by the weight of the plastic after opening them . They are much heftier than I was expecting for such inexpensive cups.The handles are covered with a rubber-like coating that makes them easy to hold even after spilling a little olive oil on your hands.Overall they seem high quality and should be durable over the long-term . I 'm happy with the purchase .	1
Since we wanted a set with 3/4 and 2/3 in it , and we were a fan of the OXO brand we purchased the previous version of these measuring cups . Even knowing the major complaint of the numbers washing off.Well , they 've been good measuring cups , and the numbers have indeed worn off . It 's not a huge deal , but before you grab one , you end up having to go through the stack to make sure it 's exactly what you think it is.What is new and improved - 3 things from what I can tell.- Sizes are now raised ! They are still colored , but instead of round screen printed dots , they are raised fractions ( still painted..which may wear off ) - Scoop like shape . Makes for easier pouring , and easier scooping out of containers.- Now clip onto ring . Before there was a ring that you had to pull apart , which means you had to thread them on . These cups have cut outs allowing you to easily snap them on/off the ring . Before we just threw the ring out since it was a huge pain . This one should allow us to keep them organized better.What 's worse.- Egg separator no longer included ( we did n't personally use it , but still is a loss not getting it ) What 's the same ( and still good ) - Still have a raised line indicating the halfway mark on each cup.- rubberized outsides ( easy to grip and hold on to , even with wet hands ) - smooth insides ( most ingredients slip right off ) I believe the limitations ( that we were willing to live with ) have now been removed , so these should now meet the same high expectations I have of other OXO products .	1
I am a guy but I make the World 's best chocolate chip cookies . It is hard to find a 3/4 cup though . I even went to the specialty shops and they wanted to charge me $ 25 for their set with that size cup in it while the other sets were 1/2 the price . They only had one and had to go to the back to find it . People who pay that much are stupid , crazy , or desperate ! ! You can pull the desired cup from the ring as well so you do n't have to wash them all each time even if you just used one like other sets I have seen . Well , maybe that is just the spoons but you get my point .	1
I 'm a scientist , so the first thing I did was to test the accuracy of these cups . I placed them on a scale and weighed how much water each one held ( 1 gram of water = 1 milliliter ) . I 'm happy to report that all of the cups held pretty close to what is stated . Since accuracy is the most important part of a measurement tool , I give it 4 stars for coming through.However , I 'm not a fan of plastic , so I 'm still going to reach for my metal cups by choice . Unless I 'm baking , in which case , a gram scale is really the only way to go .	1
I love these measuring cups . They are slighted slanted to allow easy access to dipping out of sugar and flour bowls . They are the exact measurement allowing for taking a butter knife and leveling off the top of cup . I say this because my other measuring cups had about a 1/4 inch over and above the actual measurement.They actually have the 1/3 cup and the 2/3 cup and 3/4 cup included with this set . That certainly makes measuring even easier . They have the measurement printed for life in red on each measuring cup . They are just perfect and can easily be taken off the ring for separation.I highly recommend these quality well made measuring cups .	1
By request I received this set of `` Oxo Good Grips Soft Measuring Cups , Set of 7 , Black '' as a recent gift . The point is to replace three sets of measuring cups already on hand with one cup missing from each set . What I love about this set is the inclusion of other fractional measures . The set of seven includes one cup , 1/2 cup , 3/4 cup , 2/3 cup , 1/3 cup , 1/4 cup , and an egg whites separator.Each of the seven cups has a dot on top of the handle indicating cup size -- the egg separator is SO obvious but it is also identified . Someone asked if I would use the separator and I replied , Yes , sure ( although I am a good yolk separator ) .My only regret is not getting the white . In fact , I did n't know there were white Oxo cups until I was looking for the product to write a review . All my appliance and kitchen do-dads are white . However , I 'll make do -- the black measuring cups are quite handsome .	1
I first purchased a set of $ 20 Stainless measuring cups but they did n't agree with the dishwasher so I instead bought these , saved money and they do n't mind the dishwasher one bit . They are hard to place however as they wo n't stay in place very well.They do clip securely to the ring and stack nicely within themselves but finding a slot in my growing drawer of utensils is hard because of their bulky size . Scooping dry ingredients is pretty easy with the angled front lip and overall I 'm satisfied .	1
I have been looking for measuring cups that would fit into the mouth of my flour canisters and allow me to level the measurement without flinging flour everywhere . These are a nice graduated oval shape , perfect for my use , sturdy handles ( a definite plus ) as well as the cup size designation appears to be one that will not wear off . They even have a 2/3 and a 3/4 cup ( never heard of that before ) .	1
Although a kitchen veteran , I 'm relatively new to baking . For baking , a measuring cup that can easily scoop flour , sugar , etc. , and that can be leveled with the back of a knife flush to the top of the scoop for precise measure - that 's the ideal . And that 's what Oxo has created here.Before , I 've had scoop sets but they were round or cylindrical . You 've got to use and compare that kind to this set to really appreciate how an oval scoop shape can get into those corners of a flour/ingredient container . It seems like a small thing , but between that and the ergonomic handles , this set will have you throwing out older , cheaper scoops in a heartbeat.I do n't know how the colored numbering on the handles will wear . I have a similar measuring spoon set from Oxo that is a few years old , also black , and on those the size numbers have started to wear off . However , on the new scoops , the numbers are not just painted but raised , so you could still make out the measure size , under decent light , even if the paint were to come completely off.Another reviewer complaint I 've noticed is stuff sticking to the inside of the scoops . Yes , even flour tends to leave a bit of a residue on the spoon after measuring , moreso than with some other plastic and glass measures I 've used . But it 's an insignificant and residual quantity , irksome only insofar as you ca n't always fudge and scoop from one container , then another , without rinsing between those uses , if you do n't want to cross-contaminate the flour with cocoa or whatever.L-O-V-E these scoops . For style and precision , they 're a Porsche 911 to the dollar store 's Yugos .	1
We really like these measuring cups because they include a 3/4 cup measure . Most sets do not so you must use the 1/4 and 1/2 cups to get 3/4 . This set has it all .	1
I like the highly visible outside markings the best . There are lines for lesser measurements inside each cup also , adding even more flexibility of use to EACH piece of this set . All of the cups sit in a neat stack and snap snugly onto the ring to keep them together more securely if needed . I do think the set is bulkier compared to the old Tupperware design , but this set really & # 34 ; measures up & # 34 ; LOL !	1
I have had this set for a number of years now and they are my `` go to '' measuring cups everytime I cook . What I love about them is the addition of the 2/3 and 3/4 cup measures . You 'd be surprised how often that is what a recipe calls for ! For dry measurements like flour , I often only need to rinse them clean . Otherwise , I dishwash them and the labels are as readable and clear as the first time I used them.The egg separator , on the other hand , is not something I use , as I have lost the yolk throuh the gap more than once , and really rather prefer doing the separating with the shell , the old fashioned way.Great product !	1
This set of measuring cups is a cut above most collections , because it includes 1/3 and 2/3 measures , too . The amounts are clearly marked in a contrasting color on the handle . The cups are attached to an oval ring by open hooks that are easy to detach and reattach after use . These are just a top-notch product .	1
This set is well designed . Each cup hooks onto a central ring that keeps them together , but each can be easily detached -- much , much better than sets that force you to pick up ALL the cups to use one of them , or that make it difficult to take one cup off the central ring.The marks are prominent , and the cups are shaped such that scooping flour or rice out of a bag is easy.My one problem with the set is that it 's ever-so-slightly too big to fit in my top kitchen drawer . This drawer appears to be a pretty standard pre-fab cabinet depth , so I suspect many people would discover the same . Having to keep it one drawer below is no huge deal , but ideally , they 'd be right there with my other primary kitchen tools .	1
Love the oval shape , and love all the sizes ! I was looking for a 2/3 cup measure , so my husband could make a consistent pot of coffee on the weekends . I use the 3/4 measure for my cereal portions . Got ta watch those carbs . Buy these . You 'll be glad you did .	1
Oxo is a safe choice for good products at reasonable prices and that 's true of these cups . There are six in the set so pretty much all of the sizes you might need are covered . The shape is elongated instead of round , so they may be an easier fit into some canisters than round measures . The sizes are marked in different colors on raised lettering , so even if the paint wears off , you should still be able to read the sizes.Because these measures are plastic and not metal , some powdered ingredients seem to slightly stick to them , and oil is a bit harder to clean off . They are also a little bit bulky compared to metal measuring cups . That 's why I am only giving them four stars .	1
I finally had to capitulate and buy new measuring cups and these are great . Their shape is nice ; they 're easy to & # 34 ; level & # 34 ; ... there are six of them rather than the 4 I bought over 30 years ago and they come on a ring that you can keep or discard , depending on how they are storedl	1
This item fits nicely in a drawer & can be stored together with the binding ring . Very durable & accurate.These really do make things a bit easier when you need to measure something . Oxo does make pretty well made products & this item fits in with the other products that they offer .	1
Like the way this is made so they seem to pour out better . The older ones did n't have that and were a mess when using with liquid . These are much much easier to work with .	1
I love these cups . I 'm glad they included several sizes in the set , since they are very useful for baking . I have n't had any problems with the numbers rubbing off from washing them in the dishwasher , but I 'll update if that does happen .	1
As plastic measuring cups go , these are attractive and easy to use . The Oxo is more sturdy than most others . The edge is angled , allowing for better compaction when scooping the ingredients . The scoop is oval , making it a little more narrow , and therefore easier to dip into smaller jars.It 's difficult to compare a tool as straightforward as a measuring cup . Most others will perform the same function with different price points based on the materials used and the manufacturer.Overall , I would recommend these measuring cups . A less expensive set would also work fine , but Oxo does deliver additional functionality and style .	1
Boy oh boy , can I get excited about a measuring cup , or what ? I am so very pleased with this Oxo Good Grips 6-piece measuring cup set . I have have had several sets of measuring cups , both metal and plastic , including those famous home party brands . They all do the job , I guess , but they all pale next to Oxo ... First of all , these are made of a substantial heavy plastic , that has a great `` no flex '' feel , with of course the classic Oxo non slip handle grip . All of the sizes are very clearly marked , so as not to confuse a 1/3 cup with a 1/2 cup measure , and they include a couple non standard measures , like 3/4 and 2/3 cup , which is very handy . The shape of the cups is rather unique , with an oval , shallower bowl , that will more easily fit inside many containers to `` scoop '' out the contents , which is where those heavier firmer handles come in handy . All of the cups sit firmly , without being the least bit `` tippy '' both when empty , or when filled with dry ingredients . And best of all , these measures actually nest compactly , in a shallow stack that is not likely to tip over and scatter , even if you do not snap them back on the handy ring that they come on . These cups are the best designed measures that I have ever used , and they are taking front and center in my baking cabinet . Way to go , Oxo !	1
We have used these for several months now and are completely satisfied . Each cup easily detaches from the ring that holds the set together for individual use ( and also easily reattaches after use and washing ) . The handles are soft , and easy to maintain a good grip . They are also sturdy , and do not flex or sag when filled with ingredients . They are more oval than round , and this makes it easier to scoop into dry ingredients . All the cup measurements appear to be accurate , though we have not tested this . We have not had any problem with the measurement markings wearing off , even in the dishwasher , unlike apparently some others have .	1
just what we were looking for ! they 're not pampered chef or pottery barn showy , but they 're heavy and durable . a good buy .	1
So great , I had to make sure to use the measuring cups , too ! It 's really handy to be able to easily take off and use only the one you need !	1
These spoons are easy to hold and use . The measurements printed on them are easy to read and hold up in the dishwasher on the top rack . They look pretty nice too .	1
I bought these because they are made of metal - I was tired of my plastic measuring spoons flying around in the dishwasher . But since they are metal , when I 'm measuring oil or anything else light in color , it 's hard to see the amount of liquid in the spoon .	1
Metal measuring spoons are nice to have because you can use them in situations that ca n't be done with plastic . For example , I make a rice and noodle dish that uses refrigerated chicken stock paste . The paste sticks to the measuring spoon and does n't want to come off , but because it 's metal I can just dunk it in the boiling water and stir until it 's dissolved off the spoon.They stand up well to the dishwasher , and you do n't have to worry about them cracking or discoloring like plastic ones . OXO does nice kitchen tools , I also have their Y peeler , swivel peeler , apple corer , and so on .	1
Normally , I HATE measuring utensils on key rings . It 's usually such a pain to get them off so I can use the one I want , and I end up throwing the keyring away . This ring design is PERFECT ! It 's tight enough that they do n't come off when I do n't want them to , but they 're still quite easy to get off even with one hand.You can feel the quality in these . The handles are easy to hang on to , and do n't get knocked around the countertop if you accidentally bump them since the handle is grippy . I 've read another user 's review about how the lettering came off . He/she must have had a different model or something , as it 's impossible for the lettering to wear off on these ; they 're literally made of a different plastic with it 's own coloring , instead of just painted on . The stainless steel cups are easy to clean and dry , and have stood up to all of my scrubbing , scraping , and stirring ( sometimes I use them as a spoon to mix ingredients after measuring so I do n't have to get an actual spoon dirty ) .Yes , they 're a bit expensive , but I believe that a quality tool is always worth the price .	1
There are lots of measuring tools out there , but the way that these are Brightly labeled , and attached to the ring make them very superior	1
Decent set of measuring spoons . I read how they bent and were n't very strong but figured I do n't use these things for scooping ice cream or some other abuse . I do use the table spoon to measure out drops of cookie dough and there was no bending involved . Much better than my old ones of another maker that did bend .	1
Oxo quality has created another welcome addition to our cooking and baking equipment collection . Works well and is well made .	1
These are wonderful ! I use them all the time . My only complaint is that they fall off the ring too easily . it would be better if the ring opened and closed that way I would not have to look for them in the drawer .	1
These measuring spoons are very well made and appear as though they will last . I detest plastic measuring spoons and stainless always ensures that they will clean well with no residue or dullness . The handles feel good and seem to be holding up well in cleaning.Beyond that , what else can you say about measuring spoons ?	1
These are top notch measuring spoons . Stylish looking , easy to store - they hang ; plus they FEEL good in your hand . Rubber grips make them super easy to use . And they 're certainly not expensive . Go ahead ... . buy them !	1
Have had many sets over the years . This set is the best .	1
This is one of the best purchases I 've made through amazon . I have several Oxo Good Grips products ; this is my favorite by far . The construction is solid and feels good in my hands , unlike the flimsy measuring spoons I 've been using for years . The labelling is superb and colorful and the ring holding them together allows for maximum movement when measuring contents for recipes . My old , cheap set of spoons that I 'd used for over 20 years were tossed in the trash as soon as I opened the package ... no more bent spoons , no more fighting with the small ring that impeded ease of use . Spend the bucks and get an excellent set of measuring spoons ; you 'll be glad you did .	1
Oxo remains one of just a few brands to which I 'm still loyal . According to Amazon 's `` Instant Order Update , '' I last purchased this item September 30,2004 . Almost six years of daily use ! The only issue is the rubber has become loose and/or split on the handle ( s ) which could have been avoided by hand-washing ( versus using the dishwasher ) , so I 'm willing to reorder every five years because I 'm too lazy for hand-washing . When you order , put four Oxo items in your cart to take advantage of the 4 for 3 promo and save even more money : )	1
For years I have used plastic measuring spoon , but I have been attempting to eliminate plastic from my kitchen altogether . Plastic measuring spoons can stain , but the stainless steel measuring spoons by OXO are easy to clean , comfortable , and durable . I love the metal ring that hold the spoons neatly on the inside of my storage cabinet . Yes , an extra measuring spoon would be nice for the in between size , but overall I am very pleased with the purchase .	1
The handle is great , they come of the clip easily and oil does not stick to them like the plastic spoons	1
Love these things ! They look very nice and are easy to read ! Not much more to say . Very nice product	1
Great little product . They are heavy duty looking , have a great fit and finish , nice rubber handle so you dont drop them , and a clip to keep them all together .	1
A very good quality set of spoons . the rubber grips are a nice touch , as is the slotted handles for removing and replacing the spoons on the storage clip . It would be nice to have a few more sizes included other than the 1 tablespoon , 1 teaspoon , 1/2 teaspoon , and 1/4 teaspoon .	1
This is a really nice set of measuring spoons . They are aesthetically pleasing , well-made , and ergonomically sound . They have been through my dishwasher about ten times already , and there are no signs of wear as of yet . I could see how the writing might eventually wear off , so it would be nice to have raised lettering ( even though with only four sizes , they are easily distinguishable ) . Also , it would be nice if they expanded the set to at least include 1/8 teaspoon and 1/2 tablespoon . Overall , a very good set of spoons , and another quality OXO product .	1
I like metal products in my kitchen , so these measuring spoons are a very sanitary way of measuring your ingredients .	1
These are the nicest measuring spoons I 've ever had , highly recommend , excellent quality , I am going to purchase the measuring cups next .	1
I love these spoons . They have easy grip handles made out of rubber . The numbers , although I have washed them numerous times in the dishwasher since I bought them , still have not rubbed off . The only downfall for these is there are only four included .	1
I bought these to replace my stainless steel spoons that were mangled by the garbage disposal . I would have given these 5 stars but I do n't like the ring that holds the spoons since the spoons keep falling off and it does n't include the 1/8 teaspoon . Other than that , I like them . They are not as sturdy as my previous set but are a nice addition to my kitchen essentials .	1
I 'd give these little things an extra star if they were a bit thicker and more sturdy . As it is , they 've survived through sink disposal trips , dishwashers , being dropped , bent , and otherwise abused . But the thing is , I do n't think they SHOULD bend . I found a really nice , heavy set of metal measuring spoons at Sur La Table that I like a little bit better . Though those do n't have the nice grips that these ones do . Just do n't put too much pressure on them or drop them in the sink and turn the disposal on like I did , or you 'll end up with the grips all slashed up . However , the nicks in the metal can be cleaned up pretty easily with a scouring pad !	1
I really like these measuring spoons . The ergonomic grips are really nice and I appreciate them much more than I thought I would , especially when pouring into the spoon from a large jug , etc.They are OXO quality , so you can beat them up pretty hard and they 'll stand up to the torture from scouring to the dishwasher . I actually found the keyring to be perfect , it keeps them together without making it really hard to detach if you need to . I suppose a caribiner-style clip would make it better , but I had no issues . They are well balanced and I think the only drawback is that the metal is a bit thin , so they can bend . If it were maybe half-again as thick or of a harder steel , it probably would n't be an issue . They could also just forge them with a spine to make bending much more difficult.I really like them and they are way beyond those cheap plastic ones that cost a buck at the mega-marts . 4 Stars because I do n't think they should bend at all at this price .	1
My wife and I cook a lot and use these constantly . I like that they are stainless and being metal , I have melted a few things in them like butter and lard ! I recommend this and other OXO products	1
After getting the matching measuring spoons , I fell in love with this set ! ! It 's great to only have to clean the one you pull off the ring . Sturdy design , easy to use and clean !	1
Saw there was a lot of negative reviews for these things . Not sure if they changed the model or what , but I think they 're just fine . Bending seems to be the biggest issue , but mine have n't bent yet and seem sturdy enough to last for quite some time . OXO has never disappointed me , and these measuring cups are no exception !	1
I was hoping to carry these in my knife bag ... unfortunately the 1 cup is too large . I keep them at home , they are rather durable and the rubber handles are a bit more comfy than straight stainless .	1
Living up to the brand name of OXO these are one nice set of measuring cups . I really do n't know how they will not last forever . They are so attractive and well made . They are stainless steel with an attaching ring where the cups could be removed if so desired . If not , that ring serves to keep all of the cups in one place and together . There is a hard rubber edging to each of the cups so that they will stay nice and not bend . Wish you all could see for yourself how truly nice these are . I am one happy consumer . This is a strong recommend to buy . Treat yourself well and indulge in these .	1
PROS : Not having experienced the older version of these measuring cups , I 'm not quite sure where they 've improved , but it seems like this set has very strong handles which would not bend unless someone is purposely trying to bend them with a lot of force . I try to bend them and can barely do so , which leads me to believe they 've made that portion much stronger and thicker . The grips do not come off at all , so any past complaints about that feature have been resolved in this new design as well . I like how these are bent at the tip and form a nice spout to pour from . The brushed stainless is nice looking and easy to clean.CONS : The clip which keeps these together has a small opening to remove cups separately . The opening is a bit too small to remove these cups easily and even though I 'm sure it will get a bit easier with the product 's age , at this point , it 's extremely difficult.In closing , I 'm pretty happy with these cups and as an avid cook , I 'm sure I 'll be using these quite often instead of my measuring cup which requires me to view the lines and take away or add as I 'm pouring . Now I can just dip the cup in or fill it and I 'm good to go ! Great product with one minor caveat .	1
Yes , as pointed out by previous reviewer , this item has been revised . Now a very thicksubstantial stainless steel , I use one to heat butter on the stove . You could almostuse this as a tiny cooking pot . 5 stars all the way !	1
After reading many of the reviews about these cups I was unsure about ordering them , but decided to give them a try . They are perfect in every way . The ring they are on keeps them in place , and it is easy to snap off individual cups as needed . They are also heavy duty , and when they re-designed these they did an excellent job . I do not think it would be possible to bend the handles with normal use , they stack well , and are great for scooping from the bins . I am very pleased with this purchase .	1
I do a lot of baking and decided to finally buy some decent measuring cups . These are not only gorgeous to look at , but they are easy to keep track of with the snap on/off feature of the ring . They was in the dishwasher and come out looking like they did before they were used . I also LOVE the fact that the measurement markings on them are large enough to see easily . I see these being a part of my kitchen for many years . I bought these with the measuring spoons and love them both .	1
The stainless is good quality , the cups for the most part balance well . Liquids in the 1/4 and 1/3 could easily spill , but most small sizes do . The handles are comfortable as you would expect from Oxo , but there is a space between the plastic handle and the metal for dirt to get trapped . The lettering will fade in time , but it 's pretty easy to tell which size is which . The handles clip onto a ring which I found to be awkward.They do n't snap on and off easily , so I just removed them all and tossed the ring . Overall a very nice product , a little more tinkering and they would be perfect .	1
This set of four measuring cups is constructed to last a lifetime , in my opinion . It would be very difficult to break one.Made of stainless steel , these cups are very convenient to scoop and measure flour , sugar and ingredients both dry and liquid.Like all OXO products , they have good , sturdy handles.Because they are stainless steel as opposed to plastic , they should not absorb much in the way of germs or discoloration.The measurements are very clearly seen . They are really a great kitchen utensil.I love OXO products and especially these measuring spoons.You can also hang them for easy access.Highly recommended !	1
I am very pleased with these stainless steel measuring cups . Tapered , they feature rubber handles with color coded measurement markings stamped in . The brightly colored markings are easy to read and are permanent . The handles are short but sturdy and I have experienced none of the bending complained about in the earlier version . The rubber does provide a good grip , especially when your hands are wet or greasy . The set contains four cups in the standard 1/4 cup , 1/3 , 1/2 and 1 cup sizes . Diswasher safe , they easily snap on and off the plastic ring which makes them convenient to hang . I like the look and feel of these cups and so far they have not faded , pitted or discolored . OXO does have an unconditional guarantee . I wish the set included more sizes but for an attractive starter set , they measure up .	1
I did not find any negatives for this product . Please check the review date on some of the less favorable reviews . - as the 2-and-1/4 inch rubber handles do not bend on the 2013 model . I even checked the volume of the individual cups and they are right on . The material is sturdy , dishwasher safe .	1
My first impression when lifting these out of the box was how heavy they are ! They are really solid , thick and well made and I am happy to add them to my kitchen . The handle has a comfortable grip and the way they slip on and off the ring makes it very easy to detach , use , wash , and reattach , keeping the set together . Moreover , they are attractive enough that I do n't mind hanging them from a hook under a cabinet , where they are easily accessible at all times . Great product !	1
I really like the shape of these measuring cups . You can scoop ingredients perfectly with this particular shape . I like OXO products because of the rubber grips . I did take them off the ring because it kind of makes they cumbersome to use . A real nice surprise about the one cup measure . I was having a dinner party the day after these arrived and the one cup measure scoops ice from the ice keeper I use . Perfectly . It will scoop exactly what you need for a glass . I was so happy about this since using tongs takes about 5 tries to get ice into a glass.I am very pleased with the heavy quality of these measuring cups too , they should last for years and years over the plastic ones .	1
I have very poor vision so compared with my other set of stainless measuring cups , that are identified by an etched number that I have to use a lighted magnifier to see , these are a breeze to identify . They are nice to use , balanced I suppose , and the rubber grip helps too . The short rubberry handles are way more comfy in my hand than the longer , narrow , steel handles of my old stainless cups ( which are now in the donation box ) . The cups attach to a ring by way of a notch in the cup handles . I do n't keep the cups on the ring because to me it 's a hassle wrenching them off to use them . but I can see where having them on the ring would be handy for hanging if that is the method of storing .	1
So what is important when reviewing measuring cups . Here are my thoughts . Ease of handling . These are very easy to handle with a grippy holding section . Always felt secure no matter what I was pouring into them , even when using some liquids . Quality construction . These are solid little measuring cups and seem like they should last years . Ease of cleaning . These are very easy to clean due to their design . Storage . They stack into each other which is a no brainer for measuring cups . Overall these measuring cups tick all the right boxes and are very reasonable priced . Recommended .	1
I am always a fan of OXO products -- in fact , I already own a 6-piece set of their measuring cups in the old black design . However , my set is about 10 years old , and the numbers are wearing off , so I was interested in trying this newer set , especialy since the stainless/black matches my new kitchen.First , I love the design of these new measuring cups . The stainless is ideal , yet the black rubberized handle not only looks good , but also is practical as well . I also like the raised numbers -- hopefully , the numbers will not wear off this time ! I thought I would like the fact that each of these cups could be removed from the ring holder individually ; this was a great idea , but in reality , it was still a pain to execute , and ( as I usually do with measuring cups/spoons ) I wound up removing the ring completely . So instead , I have these cups nestled in my drawer . ( One note about this : the design of these cups makes them stack rather high ; I had to stack the 1-cup measure separately from the other three . ) Overall , these measuring cups are a nice update from my prior set . I will keep my old set , as I do like to have extra measuring cups on hand if needed , and for one other reason : my old set includes a 2/3 c. and 3/4 c. measure , which I LOVED -- I wish this set did as well ! For that reason , I rate this set 4 1/2 rather than a full 5 stars .	1
f you want measuring cups that are going to last for a very long time , these OXO measuring cups are for you . These 4 cups ( 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 , and 1 cup ) are heavy with a black rubber handle and measurement markings stamped in color ( different colors for each size , though the blue and green of the 1/3 and 1/2 cup are very similar - they 're not as bright as shown in the image of the product ) . The stamped measurements will last and wo n't disappear after numerous washings . The 4 cups are on a ring to keep them together which I removed - I found that inconvenient when using them ( I 'd rather just dig in my drawer and find the cup I want ) .The cups are easy to use and easy to clean . Looking over past reviews , it appears that there was a problem with bendable handles which OXO has since fixed . These redesigned measuring cups do n't have that problem . I found the rubber handles easy to use - the cups are easy to grab and hold onto - even with wet hands .	1
This product is AMAZING . These things are absolutely aesthetically beautiful and made out of wonderful material . They do not scratch easily and do not get dirty easily , either . When they do get dirty , they are a total breeze to clean.Very easy to store , too . Designed beautifully -- inner curved sides make pouring/measuring much easier . A great addition to my kitchen !	1
I bought these for my sister for Christmas as she loves to bake . She complained that they tip over because of the weight and length of the handle , so she returned them for some others . She loves the matching measuring spoons though .	1
In most every kitchen , a few basic essentials can be found and measuring devices are almost always among them . Even the most inexperienced cook still needs measuring spoons and cups and , with the latter , an individual glass cup will usually do the trick , but it is often handy and more convenient to have individual cups pre- sized for greater convenience . And Oxo 4- Piece Stainless Steel Measuring Cups are a good choice of cups for this purpose.This set of cups includes four sizes : One cup , one- half cup , one- third cup , and one- fourth cup . The cups are made from steel so they are more durable than plastic and are made to last . The handles are made with a rubberized coating so they do not slip out of the hands . And to help make the cups easier to identify , each cup shows the measurement in a different- colored inlay , indicating the size.These measuring cups are very nice , attractive , and useful for any kitchen and they have been put to good use since making their way into my kitchen a short time ago . Previously , all we had was a glass measuring cup and while it certainly took care of the task , it is much more convenient to have a set of individual cups- particularly for dry measure . You do n't need to eyeball things , like you do with a glass cup . You just stick the cup into the dry mix , such as flour , then scrape the cup on the side of the bag to level it off , and there you have it- the exact measurement you need.This set of Oxo measuring cups is more durable than plastic cups and more attractive for most kitchens . My kitchen is overloaded with stainless steel appliances , large and small , so these cups blend in nicely . I also like the imprint , showing the individual sizes , because it is more likely to last longer than the markings on other cups . It could still wear off with continuous usage , but it should be fine for those who use their measuring cups on a less frequent basis.Measuring cups are a must and a single , glass cup with markings for different measurements should be fine for most needs . But a set of individually- sized cups is still useful for it makes dry measurements faster and more convenient . This set from Oxo is very nice , attractive , and useful and I recommend adding a set to your kitchen .	1
OXO has again designed a superior product . These cups are sturdy and dishwasher safe . I ca n't imagine the handle bending as others have mentioned . I tried to bend the handle intentionally and it would n't budge . The ring keeps them together in a cabinet or drawer , but the design allows you to easily snap off each cup to use separately . Good thinking , OXO ! I 'm still partial to my circa 1980 Tupperware set because it has 2/3 and 3/4 cup measures , which are very handy . I deducted a star from these because the set includes only 4 measuring cups .	1
We 've always liked OXO kitchen tools and will usually pay the extra freight for them if we are going to be using the utensils on a regular basis . We do n't own many stainless steel tools , but I am hoping these are good for the long haul . The grips are always an appreciated feature of OXO utensils and these cups fit and stay in the hand well . We have n't had any of the bending problems , or some of the other complaints some reviewers have had - time will tell for us . I suspect we will be happy with these as we are happy with our other OXO kitchen items.Recommended .	1
I always bake but never had one . she wanted to make a bread pudding and ask me for these cups i told her never had them.After she left I bought them , that was the best spent money .	1
OXO Good Grips Measuring cups are a nice quality , sturdy set of stainless steel cups . The rubber handles make sense when you 're dealing with sticky fingers . The connecting loop is basically useless and only meant to keep the cups together during storage , I discarded mine and leave them nested in a drawer.They 're a very nice set of measuring cups and for the money , ca n't be beat .	1
I love the soft-grip comfort and design of these OXO Good Grips Measuring cups . I also like that they are stainless steel and have a unique lip design ( see image ) . While the slim , stylized design looks good , it feels strange measuring with an oblong cup . The shape lends itself to pouring out of the top lip vs. the traditional side dump , but it works . I think it 's just getting use to something new in the kitchen . Now , the first thing I did was take the cups off the plastic oval clip-thing . Its just to hold them together , so I tossed it . I never put my measuring cups back together on the holders , I just stack them in the drawer . Speaking of which , I have standard , contractor-grade drawers and these cups stack just to the edge of the drawer . This means I have to be careful they are exactly stacked or they would n't fit . The comfortable handles make for a bulky stack . Overall , they are usable and a nice design for the modern kitchen . The grip handles are also good for those with arthritis , grip issues , or someone who just likes a comfortable handle while cooking .	1
These look nice and function well . Not sure how they would fail functionally , unless they had holes in them . Rubber grip is nice .	1
Every Oxo product I have ever owned has been at least very good , and for the most part , excellent . These measuring cups are definitely in the `` excellent '' range ! They 're stainless steel , very well-made , sturdy handles which are NOT going to bend or break like my last el cheapo SS cups , and the measurements are raised AND in colors on the coated handles so even if the color eventually wears off , the raised measurements will still be able to be seen.I love that they are heavy , flat-bottomed , and also not just round - they 're kind of egg-shaped at the top , so it 's easier to pour things from them once they 've been measured . I like the brushed stainless look of them.They came attached by a plastic ring , which was very easy to get the cups attached or detached - but I ended up just leaving the ring off , for my purposes it 's easier to just have the cups stacked and not attached to each other.Another Oxo home run !	1
I already had similar measuring cups but I figured I could always use more . These are my favorites , my `` go to '' measuring cups . They are very sturdy and well-marked . They actually look larger than my other sets - but I checked and the measurements are correct . I expect they will last a long time ! They are a pleasure to use and come through the dishwasher well .	1
I say initial because I can possibly foresee the handles loosening and not staying clipped onto the ring . I 'll explain : These measuring cups have a kind of hook on the handle that is open . The hook has rubberized sides . This hook slips onto the included plastic ring . The cups get wedged on and do n't come off . To pull one off , you just give it a nice tug or twist . But if the rubberized part wears out , or if the ring gets worn , then I can foresee these not staying on the ring.But since I am replacing a terrible plastic set , these are like Ferraris comparatively . They are hefty and good quality construction . The stainless steel is welcome . I have since replaced all of my measuring utensils with stainless steel or glass . No more plastic.I will update the quality as I use them , but my initial impression is that they are very good and worth the price .	1
I love having stainless steel kitchen gadgets since they tend to last longer than plastic . These cups are heavy duty and I have n't had any problem with them tipping over . These are dishwasher safe but I wonder how long they will last due to the rubber handles . If you want these to last a really long time , they ca n't go into the dishwasher . Some reviewers complained about the flexibility of the handles but mine are stiffer . Not sure why the discrepancy . These have since replaced my pamper chef sliding measuring cup and the old plastic ones my husband has been holding onto for years .	1
First , let me say that I HATE flimsy lightweight measuring cups ! These cups are very heavy , very stable . and I can fill them or set them on the counter without worry about them flipping over if bumped . I bake a lot and this is very important to me . Also , the slant at the front makes them very easy to use and to empty with either dry or wet ingredients . I love these measuring cups ! They have excellent balance in the hands and the feel like they will last a lifetime ! I highly recommend these measuring cups . If I could give them 6 stars , I would ! ! ! !	1
I 'm not sure if OXO has changed the design or not since all the negative reviews about the handles , but I love these measuring cups . The handles are FIRM , not flimsy , and I like the shape as they are easy to pour . I too found that you can melt butter in them on the stove ( which solved my microwave issue ) I 've been changing all my `` plastic ware '' out lately but this can be an expensive endeavor . I was replacing my plastic measuring cups every year for one reason or another ... but I 'm looking forward to having these OXO ones around for awhile . Worth the price . I 'm very happy with the stainless steel . Going to be looking for other OXO measuring products in the future .	1
I 'm surprised how sturdy these cups are . They 're made of almost unbendable stainless steel . They come with a strong oval ring that all four cups attach to by a notch in their handles . If you keep them on the ring there 's no more searching through your drawers to find the right cup ! This also aids in taking up less cabinet/drawer space . The handles are covered in dense plaster to prevent the conduction of heat or cold and to help grip . The measures are accurate . Each cup is clearly labeled with its measurement and is color coded in green , blue , red , or yellow to further distinguish them . There are no nooks or crannies so clean up is easy . The best thing about these cups is their indestructibility .	1
I got these to sort of replace another set of OXO Good Grips measuring cups , because they are plastic . There 's nothing wrong with that , but stainless steel is usually better than plastic for anything . The only thing with these stainless steel cups is that they only have four cups . I specifically bought my plastic set because it had six cups - 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 , 2/3 , 3/4 , 1 cup . These are hard to find , as you may already know . Sometimes I have to use the same cup for different kinds of ingredients , which might be sticky , and that 's where the extra cups come in handy . With my plastic set the cups have a raised line in the middle so you could use that same cup for a half-measurement . These four cups do n't have that or any other marking besides the measurements - 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 , and 1 cup.These are nice because they are less bulky than the plastic but I would still like to have more cups in the set . Functionally , they are easy to use because the silicone handle cover does not interfere with using a straight edge to level off your ingredients .	1
I have a plastic set of measuring cups , Progressive GT-3520 International 19-Piece Measuring Cup and Spoon Set , and I love them because they come in so many different measurements ( from 1/16th all the way up to 2 cups ) . However , I am always plastic-conscious and looking for alternatives . These OXO measuring cups are nice , especially since they are dishwasher safe ( so are the plastic ones , but I do n't like putting them in the dishwasher ) . They are very sturdy and the handles are easy to grip . However , they have two flaws . First , you only get four sizes of measuring cups , and it 's always nice to buy a full set all at once instead of in parts . Second , they do n't nest very well . The plastic set that I have stacks MUCH better and saves a lot more space . I keep my measuring cups in a drawer and can not stack all four of these OXO measuring cups- my drawer wo n't shut . I CAN do that with 4+ of my plastic ones . If you do n't mind their poor stackability and the lack of many sizes of measuring cups , I would definitely recommend these . OXO consistently makes high-quality products at an affordable price .	1
I really like these measuring cups in that they are made of sturdy stainless steel and are quite thick , handles included . I have used largest cup on the stove to melt butter and chocolate , and the thickness of the metal ( along with the covering on the handles ) is appreciated . I am not sure what the problems have been with the handles - you could bend these ( just as you can bend a spoon with some effort ) but it would n't be that easy to do.I ca n't imagine measuring cups being much better than these - highly recommended !	1
I have no problems with these measuring cups . I have seen complaints about the handle bending when scooping brown sugar and other firm products but since I spoon and level that is not an issue with me . I find the grip very comfortable and easy to grip . They nest very nicely and the weight is not an issue .	1
If you like a good solid measuring cup then look no further ! I was looking for a set of measuring cups to use as a scoop for my dog , cat and bird foods . These are stainless steel and strong . I 've used plastic ones and the handles generally snap . The handles on these are nice in that they feature non-slip handles . When scooping the pet food you do n't lose your grip and spill kibble or seed all over the place . They do come with a plastic ring that you can use to keep the cups together and then when you need one you can easily slip it off . I do n't really need this feature , but it is a nice way to keep them together .	1
These measuring cups are nice and sturdy and shaped well for scooping.We have used them at least a couple of times a week without issue.I ca n't speak to dishwasher use , as we do not use a dishwasher in our home.I am not sure what else to say . They perform their job well and they feel sturdy , what else is there to say about a measuring cup ? If you are in the market , then these should suit your purposes fine .	1
I really appreciate the fact that OXO took the time to read what people were saying about their product , and then took action to change it . That says a lot about their company and their customer service . I really do like these stainless steel measuring cups , they have very sturdy handles , and are heavy enough to know they are good quality . The rubber covered handles are great , because they do n't slip out of your hand , and they do n't bend either . However , I just wish they were a little longer , because when I have to reach into my flour canister when there is not a lot of flour left , I end up getting flour on my hands and knuckles , from the handles being short . However , that is not a big deal for me , the fact that they do n't bend is a much appreciated feature then anything else . So I applaud the OXO company for making these better then any other ones on the market and taking the time to listen to what their customers are saying .	1
I already own a set of stainless steel measuring cups , but I did n't realize how flimsy and cheap they are until I got these.The cups are made from a heavy stainless steel . They have thick , black rubber grips , and the numbers ( 1/3 , 1/2 , etc . ) are inset in the plastic in different colors . This is actually a pretty clever way of ensuring that the numbers never `` rub off '' or fade with use and washing.All four cups can be clipped onto a black ring if you like to keep your cups together . Easy to remove one cup at a time.Recommended !	1
Note - they apparently have been `` updated '' so the handles no longer bend . I have ZERO issues with handle bending.These measuring cups are very well built . There are 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 , and 1 cup measurements . Pity they did n't include a 3/4 measurement , but it 's manageable.These are the sturdiest measuring cups I 've ever used . You literally could roll over them with a car and they would n't bend . They are so nice that I instantly threw out all my other sets of measuring cups - you do n't need them . They are made of a thick gauge stainless steel and are well balanced - they will sit on their own on the counter without tipping.The rubber is sealed on the handle , so you never have to worry about it coming off . It also has the measurements engraved on the handle in a color , so you never have to worry about it wearing off and then wondering what size cup it is ( like all my other old measuring cups ) .They are dishwasher safe . They are secured together with a plastic ring . Highly recommended !	1
Like most people who use their kitchens a lot , I have been through many sets of measuring cups over the years . Some have been plastic and cracked easily while other have been what I refer to as `` thin tin '' with handles that bend from the simplest use and cups that dent quickly . Finally , a reasonable and functional alternative . $ 20 . seems , at first , to be a high price for a set of measuring cups ; But , as is so often the case , you sometimes actually DO get what you pay for.I have no criticism after using them for a couple of weeks for all manner of food preparation . I find them to be solidly made ; The plastic/rubberized grips make them slipping out of the hand nearly impossible ; The clear and large labeling of the size in the handle is welcome for weak and/or aging eyes ; AND they are heavy and solid enough to handle most imaginable uses . I have read reviews that talk about the handles being too flimsy and bending easily . I suppose that bending them is possible - if that is what one is trying to do . Using one of them to try to scoop hardened brown sugar out of the box , for example , is not an appropriate use for a measuring cup - it is a misuse.The ring upon which they arrive and to where they are intended to be returned is not an especially useful feature to me . I prefer them stacked in a drawer so I can simply reach in and grab the one I want . Having to unhook them is something that simply does not appeal to my style in the kitchen . I imagine , though , that this particular feature would be a boon to a cook or chef who is prone to misplacing things.The old sets and surviving pieces of old sets ( there were more of these than I really like to admit ) have all been deleted from the utensil drawer and replaced with these OXO Good Grips measuring cups . They do a nice job for me and I expect they will do a more-than-satisfactory job for most other people in the kitchen . I recommend them highly .	1
Overall these are nice cups -- not as heavy as some , but sturdy enough for use in my kitchen . The handles are comfortable to grasp , though this is something I do n't usually consider . ( I like a comfortable chair and a comfortable pillow , but not once have I ever thought , gee , I wish I had comfortable measuring cups . ) These are my two reservations : the metal edge on these is turned slightly outward all the way around . This is not problem when working with solids , but I 've noticed my liquids seem to spill much more easily with this edge . Second , though comfortable to grasp , the handles would be more practical if they were slightly longer and narrower . So these are n't bad , but for the money , I think you can find something designed a little better .	1
I did n't think I would get excited about measuring cups , but these are high on the measuring cup scale . Why ? ~ They are solid . Many sets of measuring cups end up with dents from being dropped , dinged in the dishwasher , crushed in the dish pan . These seem quite solid and I do n't think that will happen . This also means that they will sit steadily on your counter-top and not skitter away , ~They look like futuristic space ships . They have a jaunty angle to them.~A ring that wo n't fall apart ! Many sets of measuring cups come on rings . Most of those rings are flimsy and in no time at all , all your cups are wandering off on their own . This is a solid ring . You can keep the cups on it , take them off , put them back on ... and the ring remains intact.~Color coded . At first I thought that was something that was pretty useless , but , if you left your glasses in the mixing bowl and ca n't read the fractions , the colors will help you out . It also makes it easier to distinguish between the 1/4 cup and the 1/3 cup.~Good grips on the handles . These wo n't shimmy out of your hand . You can get a good grip here.~They are accurate ! This should not even need to be said , but I went through a period of time where none of my recipes were quite right . It turns out the measuring cup I was using was inaccurate . Shocking , I know . These are accurate.~There 's enough of a handle on them that you can use them as scoops for your flour or sugar.~Many complained about the flimsy handles , but those were reviews from several years back . Apparently these are the new improved measuring cups and I 'm not experiencing and bendy problems.~Some also complained that you ca n't use them in the microwave for melting butter ... but that 's what Pyrex is for . These are dry measuring cups that do nice butter melting over the pilot light . Liquid measuring is usually done in a more pour-able kind of cup.~And ... they fit right in my drawer.I hope they fit in yours , too .	1
These measuring cups are well made they are sturdy and I like the design , the rubberized grips are very comfortable to use , the snap on and off ring is a very good idea and very easy to use I love these measuring cups and I recommended .	1
I like to buy things once and be done with it . This is one of those products that will last the years . I have had a few plastic measuring cups snap at the handle until I found this one . It 's easy to skim the top with a pastry cutter and get a perfect measurement . The cups look great and have a comfortable , non-slip handle .	1
The OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups are a great addition to my kitchen for measuring dry ingredients . These work great , are study , are nicely stackable , and have a clip that holds them together that is also easily removable . Not much you can say about measuring cups . They do the job . I would recommend . Some reviewers complain that they ca n't be used to melt/heat items in the microwave , but I use my glass liquid measuring cups for that .	1
This is a set of 4 stainless steel measuring cups with a plastic binding ring . The sizes are 1 cup , 1/2 cup , 1/3 cup , and 1/4 cup . The handle of each cup is coated with thick , solid rubber , with a notch for hanging or attaching to the binding ring . The size of each cup is noted on the handle in large colored numbers , with a different color for each size . The steel is heavy duty -- the 4 cups together weigh in at a full 12 oz . The top of each cup is completely flat , allowing for exact measurements with a knife . It should be noted that these are American cups , made for the American market , so they do not show ml or other international equivalents . The set was manufactured in China for OXO.I 've never understood binding rings on measuring cups . When you go to measure something , why would want to always have all your other measuring cups in the way ? And why should you have to wash all of them when you only used one ? So I 'll just take each of these cups off the binding ring and throw the ring away . But , if you really think you need that ring , it 's there on this set . And you can also pull each cup off the ring individually , in any order . The notched hole in each handle will also allow you to hang the cups on hooks for organized storage.I am quite pleased with this set of measuring cups . They are very sturdy , and will last a lifetime , even with heavy use . I 've gone through several sets of plastic measuring cups in my day -- eventually , the handles all seem to break or tear off . And some of my metal measuring cups have developed dents from drops on the floor . No fears about loose handles or dents with these cups -- they are built to last , and they give a solid feel of quality . This set would make a great housewarming or shower gift , as well as a good addition to any kitchen .	1
Plastic just does n't cut it . The numbers , the proportions get erased . But not with these really good quality measuring cups . I already had a set , and I got another one .	1
What can you say about measuring cups ? Well , this set is well built and seems sturdy . The rubber grip makes it unlikely that one will slip from your hand and spill a cup of flour on your floor . Good cups .	1
I had some cheep metal measuring cups at one time but they quickly became warped and dingy looking so I went back to using the Pyrex measuring cups in which I learned to cook . However these stainless steel cups with a streamlined design and very comfortable handles are a new favorite kitchen tool . I still rely on the pyrex cups when I need to accurately measure something other than the 1 cup , 1/2 cup , 1/3 cup and 1/4 cup sizes that are all that come with this set . But other then when I need those less common measures this is my new `` go to '' measuring set .	1
These sleek stainless measuring cups put my motley assortment of plastic and aluminum measuring cups with their broken handles and heat-damaged profiles that they are about to be banished to the sand pile . Each cup of this set from OXO is nice heavyweight stainless steel , and each stands without tipping . The handles are shorter than some measuring cups , but that means that the user holds it closer to the actual cup , making the handles less likely to bend . These handles are pretty stout anyway ; it would take a lot of effort to bend them . I used a couple this morning to scoop whole wheat flour with no hint of strain on the handles . The handles are clad with either rubber or silicone with the size printed in large numbers . Very nice !	1
Normally measuring cups do not tend to be well thought out , especially in regards to ergonomics or use . These OXO brand ones have become my go-to set for all my dry measuring needs in the kitchen.Pros : - great balance which lets me scoop with ease and also fill them while resting . Some of my cheaper cups tend to tip over.- soft handle which allows for a good grip and some comfort- easy to read measurements so I know which cup to grab at a glance and do n't have to be reading the engraving like it was braille- easy to cleanThis will probably replace any other set that you have currently in use and will last you a long time .	1
As a long-time OXO Good Grips aficionado , these stainless steel measuring cups are a wonderful addition to my culinary collection . The cups nest perfectly and are easily detached or reattached to their holding handle . The size of the cups makes them easy to dunk into my flour & sugar containers . The handles are clearly color coded with each cup 's capacity and the handles themselves are easy to grip and will not slip from your fingers . The measuring cups have a good heft to them , are well-made , dishwasher safe and come with OXO 's satisfaction guarantee , `` If for any reason you are not satisfied with this product return it for repair , replacement , or refund . '' Not many companies offer this type of customer servive . I can attest to the fact that I had another OXO product meant to hold sponges and detergent in my kitchen sink area that showed some rusting after almost a year of use . I contacted the company , emailed a picture of the rust spot , and voila , a replacement product was sent to me promptly .	1
The OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups , Stainless Steel , Updated Design deliver all of the things you expect from OXO products - ergonomic design , sturdy construction , form and function.Pros : - The measuring cups have rubber handles that are easy to grip , especially when your hands are wet or sticky from baking mishaps . The rubber handles also make it easier to hold the cups when washing them.- The cups are held together by a plastic ring that keeps them from getting separated and lost in the drawer . You can detach the measuring cups from the ring when you need to use them , but it 's a nice feature to be able to reconnect them for storage purposes.- The measuring cups are stainless steel , so they 're durable . I have my share of cutesy , porcelain , decorative measuring cups that look great on the shelf , but do n't exactly hold up to the frantic , last-minute baking that I so often do . These will hold up to a little heating if necessary , you can bang them against a stainless steel mixing bowl to tap out ingredients in a rush , and they 'll survive being thrown in the sink with all of your other baking gadgets and spatulas . Perhaps I should be a bit gentler with my baking equipment , but these measuring cups can handle the punishment.Cons : - The shape of the measuring cups allows them to fit into almost all of my containers and canisters for flour , sugar , etc . However , I have a few glass jars that are a bit too narrow for these measuring cups , so it was somewhat of a struggle to measure the ingredients . I have some other measuring cups in my baking arsenal that will fit into these jars , so it was disappointing that these did n't fit . It 's not enough of a problem to subtract a star from the rating , since it 's probably more my fault for buying glass jars with narrow openings , but I thought it was worth pointing out.In the end , I give these measuring cups a 5 out of 5 . They are durable and should last a long time . They 're easy to use , easy to clean , and easy to locate in a cluttered drawer of baking supplies . OXO does not disappoint .	1
I love OXO products , there is not one that did not work or was not beautifully made . These measuring cups are no exception . They are made from reinforced steel and have a great rubber handle . I 've had zero problems with bending and have used them extensively on wet and dry ingredients since owning . They wash up great in the dishwasher and are a substantial weight - not too heavy , but they do n't feel cheap . The only drawback I can see is the price ; however , with everything , you get what you pay for . I highly recommend these measuring cups !	1
One of the better things about getting things from Vine is when manufacturers improve a flawed product and need reviews of the perfected version . Such is the case here with these thoughtfully designed measuring cups.As it happens , I had the older version of this cup in my kitchen cabinet ( see photo ) , and while I did n't have quite the strong negative reaction those early reviewers had , the deficiencies of having a handle a 3 year old could curl out of shape were pretty obvious . Other improvements are a move from a cylindrical shape to one better aimed at digging , and a unibody design in favor of a separate handle spot welded to the cup.In general , a nice set of cups and a good improvement .	1
These Oxo measuring cups are another high quality product in the Oxo Good Grips line . They are built to last with strong durable materials . These will probably last your whole life and you 'll be able to pass them on to your kids . So many kitchen products just wear down and need to be replaced after a few years . THESE WILL LAST ! This company really strives to make long-lasting quality products . It seems like they take the time to research and test the comfort of a tool as well as its usefulness and often have clever new ideas to bring to the table.GREAT BUY : )	1
OXO makes terrific kitchen gadgets and tools . They are very comfortable in the hand ( especially for those with big hands like I have ) . These measuring cups are well constructed , nicely and clearly identified by size , nest nicely , and have terrific grips . Specific Devanagari : the flat bottom let 's one place them down on the counter with ingredients in them , unlike so many others with rounded bottoms . And I am sure they will last virtually forever . ( Dishwasher safe too ) .	1
The Oxo Good Grips Stainless Steel Measuring Cups are a great basic kitchen staple . These replace an older Oxo measuring cup set . So far , I ca n't complain - they 're well designed , sturdy , and do the job . My only complaint is they are a little bulkier compared to my old measuring cups and do n't fit in my kitchen drawer easily .	1
It looked like there was some difference in the size of these cups from the cups from my old set . So I compared . Sure enough , the 1 cup from this set holds a little bit more than my old 1 cup . All the others , 1/4 , 1/2 , 1/3 , were the same . The only difference was in the 1 cup size . Trouble is , I have no idea which one is the right size ... or even if it matters ! The difference is perhaps a tablespoon or so . The set is attractive and it would be nice hung up in a handy spot ( I have n't discovered a handy spot not already taken . ) I do like the built-in nock so they could be hung on a thin bar or on individual hooks , but I find the handles a bit too short for convenience in measuring . They 're nice cups , so I gave it a 4-star rating .	1
This is a review of the new design Oxo Good grips measuring cups . I also have the old design , the '' tippy '' one with the bendy handle.I read through some of the old reviews , and got out my old cups to compare.The cup markings all wore off the old ones . 1 cup and 1/2 cup are easy to tell which is which but I sometimes have to measure 1/3 an 1/4 with another cup to tell for sure which is which.In the description of the updated design , the markings are specified as `` permanent '' . I 'm guessing that is a response to complaints of the markings wearing off so we 'll see . I kind of picked at the markings with my fingernail but nothing came off at least easily.I set all the cups out and bounced on the handle and did n't find any of the cups from either set `` tippy '' There is a clear difference in the handle design and I could n't bend the new one at all . I agree that the old one is a little `` bendy '' if you try , but why would you ? All our old ones are intact after several years . ( I do n't know how long , enough time and use for all the markings to be completely gone . ) The one thing I do n't really like is the thick rubbery handle . They are so thick that when you stack them up the handles `` fan '' up and have a much higher profile for sitting in a drawer - less clearance . Of course if it did n't have the rubbery handle , it would n't be Oxo Good Grips.The only brand we have that stacks neatly is `` Rubbermaid '' and it is made completely of plastic . It does have the size embossed in the bottom of the cup so it will not wear off . None of our all-metal sets stack neatly , but they do n't stick up as much and they have the size engraved so it wo n't go anywhere . They have the more `` bendy '' handles , but none of them have broken.I 'm not sure why we need so many measuring cups but we keep looking for the perfect set .	1
These are functionally and aesthetically perfect . They are a very nice heavy weight , very strong handles , gorgeous and easy to clean finish , and comfortable to hold due to the great grips ... and yet I find myself reaching for my old acrylic pyrex set over them almost every time . Why you ask ... two of the silliest reasons , but maybe something that would drive you crazy too . The main reason is that to save space I keep them nested , but the metal on metal sound when I pick them up or move them makes me cringe . It 's a nails on the chalk board , fork across your teeth sound that I just hate . I think I 'm going to toss them separately into my kitchen utensil drawer in hopes that I grab them more often . The only other silly small gripe is that I wish there were more of them ( yes I realize this defeats the whole , keep them apart from eachother to avoid that awful sound reason ) but my other set also came with 1/8 , 2/3 , 3/4 and it 's just easier and faster to grab one of those . If OXO would coat the bottom of these with their great rubbery material and provide a few extra measurements I 'd gladly pay double ! If you 're not a lazy sound affected weirdo like I am I bet you 'll love them !	1
This measurements come on a ring with rubber soft handles . I have another set from different brand but these are my favorites . They are nice and deep allows for easy pouring.Nice set makes a good gift also .	1
I already have some stainless measuring cups . The problem is that when scooping rice and other things out of containers the handles on those measuring cups bend.Which is why I got these Oxo good grips and they are really nice . They are made of much thicker gauge stainless steel so the handles do n't bend . They are quite curvy and flare out at the top instead of the sides being 90 degrees . This makes them easier to fill by pouring since the sloping sides draw whatever you are filling the cup with into a wider opening . It 's also easier to pour the contents out of them.The rounded shape also makes for easy cleaning , nothing gets lodged into the creases around the edges at the bottom.They have nice comfortable rubber grips in a bright colors . The numbers are n't printed but actually embedded plastic so they wo n't rub off after frequent use . The set comes with a rubber coated ring that the cup handles clip into with moderate pressure which enables them to stay together much like a key ring.Overall these seem good . Much better than my previous set . Strong , sturdy and they seem to be a quality product that should last a long time .	1
I have a litany of problems with dry measuring cups that 's almost as big a the sets with missing pieces in my drawers . The sets do n't stay together , the handles come off , the flimsy plastic breaks , the sizes are hard to read , they are lightweight , they do n't fit in my ingredient containers , they do n't sit flat , the ceramic chips or cracks , and they are n't beautiful.Heavy stainless steel with molded rubber-coted handles , these cups are n't coming apart any time soon . They have a beautiful shape , circular but with a flared front that makes it easy to pour out measured ingredients . The very top edge flares to make a lip . They look cooly beautiful and elegant.The bottoms sit flat on the work surface and the handles are wide and well-padded.Along with being beautiful , they have great features to make them practical . The handles all have the size on them , each marked with a different color . Not only is this much easier to see than labels in the same color as the handle , but it 's another visual clue you have the right size ( if it 's green it must be 1/2 cup ) .All to often I 've gotten dry measures that have a ring to hold them together . With every other set you face a dilemma . You can keep the ring on so the set stays together , but then you ca n't use them . You can take off the ring but then you lose it before the cup is washed and you have no way to hold together the set.OXO 's ring is a solid oval of plastic . It wo n't come apart . The cup handles all have keyhole-shaped openings . The ring runs through the top of these holes , but the cups wo n't come off on their own . You take the cup you need , slip it off the ring , and then easily replace it after washing . Unless you remove all four cups from the ring , this ring wo n't get lost.This set has the standard 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 and 1-cup measures . It would be even better if it had a 1/8-cup measure , but even so it 's the best set of dry measures I 've ever seen . And like all OXO products , the price is great !	1
First up , you want a measuring cup to be accurate . So I put the 1 cup on myOXO Scaleand filled it with water until it looked even with the top ( yes , this is a bit hard to do because of the meniscus that forms with water , but I did my best to get it even ) . Then looked at the display : 240 grams . And amazingly that 's the exact definition of a cup of water : 240 ml ( for water , 1ml weighs 1 gram ) But while doing that I noticed my first minor issue with these : the top of the 1 cup is not level with the bottom . So when the cup is sitting on a flat surface the top is at a slight angle . It 's subtle and unlikely to be a problem in most cases , but it seems less than ideal.Quality wise these are great , made from a single , hefty piece of metal with a nice handle.My other minor gripe is that the hook on the end of each and the ring that they all clip to is ugly and annoying . Why do your measuring cups need to clip together ? The first thing I did was throw the ring in the back of the bottom drawer , never to be seen again.So , nearly perfect but they lose a star for a few minor issues .	1
These measuring cups are heavy-duty and super sturdy . They are so much better than the cheap-o plastic ones I usually use . I love the grippy handles , and the fact that the measurements are textured ( so they wo n't rub off like my plastic cups with printed-on measurements ) . They have a nice slanted front for scooping.Great product !	1
A set of 4 stainless steel measuring cups with the accustomed OXO attention to design and manufacturing quality . The stubby handles are coated with a silicone-like material that allows a firm grip on the unusually short handles while taking up minimal room in a drawer . By heft , they do seem to be somewhat bottom weighted to reduce risk of tippage . Other measuring cups we own are generally cylinder or modified cone shaped . These are slanted or opened on the side away from the handle , which make scooping flour or sugar or ground coffee easier , as well as making the gradual pouring of liquids into delicate sauces easier . They also have a nice flare around the lip which reduces dripping of liquids.All in all , the only reason I took I took a star away is they lack an internal or external mark at one-half the measure , which I find convenient.Although probably a bit better suited to persons with small hands and strong fingers because of the stubbiness of the handles , this also makes for compactness in the kitchen drawer . While they are oven ( 500 degrees match ) and dishwasher safe , I would not use them on stovetop to melt chocolate or butter . Sizes are labeled with different colors on the handles -- the four sizes make it unlikely an experienced cook will confuse them at any rate , and they come on an easily-unlocked ring for storage.RECOMMENDED	1
Well my last set of measuring cups bit the dust when they somewhat melted in the dishwasher . I 've been looking for a new set , taking my time for that perfect set.These OXO 's seemed pretty sturdy . WOW , they are indeed robust . They are NOT for use in a microwave nor on a low burner . However they could be set on that warm stove for gentle melting of the measured ingredient . The rubber handles allow for a very easy grip . These came in 1/4 cup , 1/3 cup , 1/2 cup and 1 cup sizes . They are a very high quality stainless steel that should be free of rust for many many years . Happy measuring !	1
This set of stainless steel measuring cups with easy to grip handles is accurate , or at least its measurements match my other measuring cup sets . The handles on the current incarnation do n't bend ( far from it ) . The oval shapes are attractive and modern-looking.So what 's not to like ? The thickness of the rubber grips means that the cups do n't fit into each other compactly . If you 're going to hang them that 's not an issue . But if you want to fit them into a low-depth drawer you may have problems . Also , the price is on the high end for what you get.To sum up : if you want stainless steel measuring cups and do n't need to nest them in a shallow drawer these are fine . If your drawer is shallow you may want to look elsewhere . Also , only you can decide if the price/value ratio is right as compared to the alternatives .	1
I previously used metal and plastic measuring cups and was looking for a new set . This set is the best of both worlds . You get a brushed metal body with rubber covered handles . Each cup has a brightly colored measurement indicator . The cups all stack inside each other and attach to a large hook . The hook is a little cumbersome , making it likely you 'll knock off other cups while removing the intended cup . I just keep them stacked on a counter . Quality is decent compared to some of my other cups , including my previous metal cups which were prone to bent handles . I tried bending these handles intentionally to test durability and they appear to stand up to all but the toughest abuse . Measurements are 1/4 cup , 1/3 cup , 1/2 cup and 1 cup .	1
Please note that these cups have an `` updated design , '' which I assume refers to them having stronger , less flexible handles than cups made in accord with a previous design . Some customers complained about handles bending.These replace a Trudeau 5-Piece Measuring-Cup Set that I bought from Amazon in 2008 . They are said to be made of `` strong , shock-resistant ABS plastic , '' but the handle on the 1 cup size snapped off when I was digging flour from a bag . Also , pouring just boiled water into the Trudeau cups caused the bottoms of the cups to form hairline spider-web type cracks - cosmetic only , no leaks , but not something I appreciated.I own several OXO Good Grips kitchen products and they 've yet to disappoint . These cups are indeed quite sturdy , they can accommodate boiling water if necessary , and though I now avoid using any measuring cup to scoop flour out of tightly packed bags of flour , I trust that if I was n't overly rough the handles would not bend in the process . The handle on the 1 cup size cup is the one that is most likely to bend , but it seems quite sturdy and strong . ( After breaking the handle of the Trudeau measuring cup I decided to fill measuring cups with flour by using a spoon instead of using the cup as a scoop , and I plan to continue that practice with the OXO cups even though it may not be necessary . ) There are no markings on the cups other than on each rubberized handle , so it is not clear when you have exactly one cup of , say , water . So I compared these cups against a well-marked heavy clear glass Anchor-Hocking 2-cup size measuring cup to see . Basically , if the OXO cups are full but not so full that they are brimming , they equal the measurement markings on the Anchor-Hocking . If they are brimming and I transfer the liquid to the Anchor-Hocking without spilling , they are just a tiny bit over the Anchor-Hocking marking.The cups clip onto an oblong ring , which I do not use as I keep measuring cups in a drawer and use them often enough that I would find it a hassle to have to deal with the ring.Before I bought the Trudeau cups ( which as I say above , was in 2008 ) , I read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere for many different kinds of measuring cups . I passed on these OXO cups back then because of reviews that mentioned the `` bendy handles . '' Had it not been for that , these would 've been my choice back then . OXO has since fixed the problem and unless I should lose one of these cups I imagine they will last a lifetime . As I say above , I own several OXO kitchen products and they 've yet to disappoint ( e.g. , meat pounder , pastry brush , spoons , kitchen brush , etc. ) . I 've even bought some OXO kitchen products for my amateur gourmet cook daughter and she loves them . They 're ergonomic , well-built and practical . I will probably buy her a set of these cups.Highly recommended .	1
I love the OXO Good Grips line . I like the way the products look . I like the way they feel . I like the way they function . I like the way they last.These measuring cups are no exception , AND I will add one additional piece of information . Unlike some measuring cup sets like this , it is easy to get the individual cups in and out of the little loop that holds the set altogether . As a result , less clutter.Nice ! See , now you can justify paying a little more for OXO .	1
These are the best measuring cups I have EVER owned . They are super high quality . Made of brushed stainless steel ( much like my kitchen sink ! ) they are ultra durable and will probably last 100 years . The rubbery like handles are easy to hold and will never slip out of your hand . The cups are each very clearly marked for size , right on the inner end of the handle for easy reference . Liquids pour out of them easily , solids and powders measure easily and come out easily . And best of all , they are dishwasher safe ! They are perfect all around , in my opinion ! I very strongly recommend them ! : )	1
Sturdy , stylish , comfortable handles , and a good value . Nice touch making the size markings so they ca n't rub off . The smaller sizes are a little tippy because their handle is the same size/ weight as the larger measurements . While it 's conceivable the handles could bend under heavy stress , for the most part , they seem solid and resisted to my attempts to bend them at moderate exertion . For normal use , they should be fine . Overall , a good product and a good price .	1
I 'm not a huge cook , my wife is , though I make an awesome grilled cheese sandwich and/or hot dogs -- and I should n't discount the fact that I have worked doing food prep in several professional kitchens , though my wife is clearly the master.In my opinion , these measuring cups are really ideal for men . Easy to handle for people who might have trouble with dexterity or coordination , and I could probably run them over with my SUV without damaging them.My wife says they 're a little heavy , hense my personal perspective . If you 're a hard working cook or chef , I think these are a better choice than some dainty set from William & Sonoma.They get five stars from me .	1
I own a number of OXO grip items already , including a brush , carving knife , and whisk . All are fine quality and well worth the money . This measuring cup set is no different . The stainless steel is of excellent quality and the OXO grip stays easy to handle even if your hands or the utensil is wet . The size of the serving is embedded above the cup and wo n't fade or be rubbed off . They all fit onto a plastic ring , and can be easily pulled off for separate use . Although some reviewers here have talked about the handles on them bending at times , it still in my opinion takes a lot to do that , and they can easily can be straightened in the event they do . Overall a really well made and handsome set of measuring cups.The only thing I noticed about these cups is no matter which one you 're using , you have to fill them to the very brim to get it exact . And I mean to the VERY brim . There is no line at the top , or lip of any kind . And when I filled a measuring cup with water and poured it into the the sets full cup size it came to the very , very top . It does n't matter with a dry measurement that much , but with liquid it 's so full you would easily slosh and spill some . It would have been nice if they had left even a 1/8th clearance at the top but they did n't . Just remember that when using them , for if you measure several times with them and do n't fill them to the very top , you will be off some for sure by recipes end . Despite that minor annoyance , I really like these measuring cups for their looks , quality , and price , and I recommend them ... : )	1
These are great measuring cups . They 're made of solid metal with plastic handles , each of which is marked with the cup size.I like that these have angled sides , which makes them easier to use to scoop up flour or other dry goods , and they 're great for baking , because you can scoop up your ingredients , slide a knife over the top and be good to go.For wet measurements and things that do n't require a knife slide ( like rice ) , I prefer Oxo'sAngled Measuring Cups , which let you view from the top down and measure in smaller increments , but for baking , these are terrific .	1
First and foremost , Amazon shipped fast , arrived on time undamaged . The OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups ( updated design ) are a nice set of measuring cups for your everyday kitchen and baking needs . Coming with 4 sizes , they are easy to read and engraved to match . Oxo makes some nice kitchen gear , and these will definitely fit in with the other awesome Oxo gear in your house . I own a few other Oxo products that have lasted for years . With this quality , I expect these to last forever ! I mean it , these will last forever ! They are heavy duty and will match your stainless gear to boot . Overall , I highly recommend these measuring cups . I knocked a star for price . If they come down 5 bucks or so , then I will update to 5 star .	1
These are the best measuring cups that I 've ever owned . They are nice and heavy . I can be a bit clumsy and have knocked my plastic measuring cups over . Talk about a mess ! I do n't worry about it with these . Very well made and nice looking , too . I have them hanging on a hook in the kitchen instead of tucked away in the cabinet .	1
These perform well . They are weighty and solid . They clean up well in the dishwasher . They are quite handsome and would make an impressive gift . The only negative is that the smaller cups ' handles are just as heavy as the bigger ones , so they can tip over if you are n't careful .	1
I 'm a big fan of OXO kitchen utensils and tools . I have many OXO kitchen utensils in my kitchen that are nearly 13 years old and are still looking new after years of frequent use . I was excited when I got the opportunity to review these stainless steel Good Grips measuring cups . They 're great quality and I 'm sure they 're bound to last through years of repeated use.The handles on these measuring cups are rubberized giving you a nice comfortable grip . I did notice with my set that the handles do seem to attract dust and small particles of baking ingredients . I 'm not thrilled about that , but it 's better than having stainless steel handles that are n't as comfortable to hold.This set only has four measuring cups . You 'll get cups in the following measurements with this set : 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 and 1 cup . If this set had 1/8 and 3/4 cups I would have given this product five stars . Many of the recipes I use call for ingredients of either 3/4 or 1/8 of a cup . I 'd much prefer to have to clean one cup to measure out 3/4 vs. using two or having to scoop out the ingredients three times . It 's a pain to have to pack brown sugar into a 1/4 cup three times when a 3/4 cup could have taken care of the job in one shot . Because the set is missing those two cups that I use on a regular basis , my cheap plastic measuring cups that are 13 years old wo n't be going anywhere.I do like that you do n't have to take all of the measuring cups off the ring to get to the size that you need to use . My plastic measuring cups are like that and I find it to be a pain in the rear to have to pull half of the cups off to get the one that I need . The OXO cups eliminate that problem . You simply pop the cup off the ring and you 're good to go.Overall , I think these measuring cups are decent . For the price I wish they had 3/4 and 1/8 cups , too . It is a decent quality product that will see you through years of use .	1
I 'm pleased with these measuring cups , especially as they 're heat resilient . I love the stainless steel and sleek design , and they have worked well for my baking purposes . I 'm not a hardcore baker so I did n't have the bending issue that other reviewers mentioned .	1

'nuf said . : ) a few things I liked about the OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups , Stainless Steel : *4 basic cup sizes : 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 , 1 -- note : there is no 2/3 or 3/4 cup in this set . *modern looking cups can be easily removed one cup at a time from a sturdy , solid , plastic ring ... and placed back on ring , and nested or hung , for easy storage . *sturdy stainless steel construction ( sort of a brushed/satin texture , not glossy ) -- unlike a flimsy plastic , these cups are weighty , sit on the counter without wobbling and feel very solid -- like they will last a very long time . Also , I believe the stainless steel cups will be easier to clean than plastic , especially after measuring oily products . *soft , non slip , black , handles that feel nice between finger tips and add a bit of confidence when emptying contents . Handles have easy to read , color coded , permanent measurement markings -- unlike some measuring cups I own that one has to tilt toward a good light to see what the heck it is , if ya know what I mean . *OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups , Stainless Steel , are dishwasher safe , but I wash them by hand -- cuz ' that 's the way I roll . : ) Do the OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups , Stainless Steel , sound like what you may be looking for ? : ) Would make a Fantastic gift ! Highly Recommended ! -- Katharena Eiermann , 2013	1
So far I have found nothing negative about my new OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups . They are easy for me to use , the covered handles are great for my clumsy fingers . The markings on the handles are easy for me to read . They scoop and pour well , I have had no issues with the cups tipping over . They 're easy for me to clean , and although they do n't nest as well as my older measuring cups ( because they are thicker ) they still fit fine in my drawer . I am very happy with the quality of the OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups . The price may be higher than what I 've paid for other measuring cups , however , the quality definitely makes it worth it . You wo n't need to replace them for a very long time .	1
There is something wrong with the Amazon review process when the `` Most Helpful '' review - from 13 years ago - remains on top of the page - even when the product has been totally redesigned AFTER the review.OXO answered all the complaints , and the resulting NEW design has no flaws that I can detect.The stainless steel construction is very solid this time . The handles are comfortable ( as with all OXO products ) and are clearly marked with the capacity in permanent clear colored embossing.The carrying ring works well , and the cups click on and off securely.This new design should last you decades .	1
Formerly there seems to have been an issue with `` bendy '' handles but that is definitely not the case with these measuring cups now . They are very solidly built , including handles which have a non-slip texture to them.They do have an open notch on the handle so that you can take them off and return them onto the ring they come on but I opt not to keep them on the ring personally . The handles also have an easy to read and durable-looking label as to each cup 's capacity , better than the printed on variety that you find with plastic cups . Let 's face it though , these are stainless steel and are going to be better than plastic cups in every way ! That 's what I like about them most , the material they are made with and the solid build . They are odor-resistant , easy to clean and will probably outlive me ! I 'm a fan of the oxo brand and have yet to be disappointed by one of their products . The only reason this is four stars instead of five is there is nothing particularly over-the-top impressive/innovative about them but I do like them .	1
I have several sets of cheap measuring cups , and wondered if I would like these . When they came , I got my baking book and got to work . First they are cearly labeled in large pink letters ! easy to find the correct one at a glance , heavy and they are very easy to clean . shortening came right out . I never feel like the plastic ones are clean until they go through the dishwasher . The hook , unhook is easy to use and will keep them togther in the baking department . I only wish they had the rare 3/4cup size included .	1
I ca n't tell you how many glass measuring cups or plastic spoons I 've gone through that have lost their measurement markings over time . Some even lost them after one or two washings . It was time to invest in better quality.Oxo Good Grips stainless steel measuring cups are certainly heavy duty and I love them . This set includes the standard measurements making up one cup : 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 and 1 cup . There 's nothing chintzy about them . They look attractive , the non-slip handles with indelible markings are easy to grip , and the stainless steel provides a nice hefty weight to each scoop . They stack and store very easily in my cupboard.I am replacing more and more kitchen utensils with Oxo Good Grips products . So far all have been smart and long-lasting purchases . My next buy will be the matching Good Grips measuring spoons .	1
I really love OXO products . OXO is noted for easy grip products which are gentle on the hands and make many tasks more enjoyable . These Good Grips measuring cups are no exception . Made of stainless steel the cups come in the traditional 1 cup , 1/2 cup , 1/3 and 1/4 size . The shape is a little unusual with a wider top and slimmer base but this actually makes scooping easier . In addition , it gives a modern look to the cups.Though other reviews have knocked the measuring cups down for being `` bendy '' , those reviews were written long ago and OXO has since corrected the issue . They are sturdy to use . The cups are held together on a ring which can easily be removed . Since the cups stack nicely it may be easier to just stack the cups instead of using the ring.One super nice feature on the cups is the clearly marked measurement on the handle . This makes it easy to find at a glance the cup size you are looking for . The cups are dishwasher safe and could even be used on a stove top to heat tiny quantities.Overall the OXO measuring cups are attractive , functional and a good value !	1
I can not believe that I 've spent the last ten years using a hodge-podge of measuring cups no two from the same manufacturer . I never believed that there could be a technical advance made in the design and manufacture of measuring cups , but OXO really nailed this one . Highly recomended .	1
These measuring cups are well made , with sturdy , rubber handles . As soon as you pick these up you notice the weight . The handles clip onto a ring so if you want to toss them into a drawer or hang them up , they 'll stay together.Currently at 19.99 , these sets are more than most but they are made to last so no need to buy another set to replace these . I much prefer these to my plastic sets which are now tossed in the back of the kitchen drawer .	1
This is a nice set of measuring cups . The cups are sturdy , and they have a nice brushed silver finish . I like that they can handle various temperatures . If I need a cup of boiling water I can pour it right from the kettle into the measuring cup . These look nice , and I can stick them in the dishwasher for easy cleanup . I 'm pleased .	1
Like other OXO Good Grips products I have , these measuring cups are mde to last.These stainless steel cups are . a solid weight and should stand up well to everyday kitchen use . They wo n't melt if left a bit too near a heat source . The handles have a coating with a rubbery feel that makes them easier to grip for people who have trouble with their hands . In addition the measurements are color-coded so you do n't have to hunt for your glasses to find the right cup . And OXO says the measurements will not wear off over time which is a major fault with many measuring sets . The cups angle down -- they 're wide at the top than the bottom . This may make it a bit harder to eyeball half of a measurement but easier to pour the contents . The handles could be just a bit longer but that is a personal preference ; I 'm not sure others would care.All-in-all these are worth having in any kitchen . You do n't have to have problems with you hands to appreciate Good Grips products .	1
I love everything oxo makes , really . These feel great , look nice , easy to clean and the measurements are easy to read .	1
These measuring cups are very sturdy and heavy duty . I was thrilled to receive these to finally replace my old , battered plastic measuring cups.These measuring cups are stainless steel so they are quite heavy in your hand ( a good thing ) , they lie completely flat on the counter which should decrease liquid spills and all have a nice padded handle . They also have the amount the cup holds in nice bold pastel measurements that are large and makes it easier to read when you are grabbing one.For the price , I dont know why anyone would buy anything else . As a daily cook and baker I love them .	1
I love these sturdy , stainless steel measuring cups . They are definitely not flimsy , and the rubber grips on the handle make them easy to hold on to . The measures for each are brightly colored and easy to read . They have lipped edges , rather than sharp edges , so accurate measuring is easy . They also hold up well to being washed in the dishwasher ( I washed them on the top rack ) . My favorite feature : they come attached to a ring ; however , unlike many nested cup sets I 've tried , you do n't need to remove them all from the ring to get to one cup . With a quick turn to the side , they will slide easily off the ring , and they easily pop back on via an opening in the handle of the cup . Oxo paid good attention to detail here , and it paid off in a functional and high-quality product .	1
My other sets of measuring cups are plastic and while they certainly have their uses , I prefer the clean good looks and integrity of stainless steel . This is a particularly nice set -- solid and heavy gauge . The handles , which had been an issue in an earlier release due to their tendency to bend under weight , have been markedly improved . They 're now strong and reliable and they boast easy-to-read , color-coded permanent measurement markers for ease of use . The four cups fit on a ring which keeps them all together . It 's simple to remove them , one at a time or all at once and to return them to the fold once they 're washed and dried.I do quite a bit of cooking and baking and since I 've had them , I find myself reaching for these OXO cups pretty much all the time . The exception , and this is my only gripe , is when I need a size that is n't represented in this set . Much as I love it , it would be so much more useful if only OXO had included a few other sizes beyond the 1 cup , 1/2 cup , 1/3 cup and 1/4 cup . But if those sizes meet your needs , I highly recommend these handsome , high quality measuring cups .	1
Having used plastic measuring cups for a long time , I had forgotten how nice metal measuring cups feel . These stainless steel measuring cups are brushed rather than smooth , and feature a non-slip plastic grip with colorful numbers to depict the size of the measuring spoon . My impression is that these measuring cups are high quality and will last for years.Perhaps the biggest difference between these measuring cups and plastic measuring cups is scooping heavier substances , such as sugar or water . The handles on plastic measuring cups tend to deflect , and I have had the handles fatigue to the point of damage . The handles on these measuring cups seem to remain rigid when scooping water , milk , sugar , and flour.These measuring cups are highly attractive . The brushed appearance should reduce the effect of inevitable dings and scratches that tend to mar the surface of polished stainless steel measuring cups . The non-slip handles are functional as well as decorative , and provide a nice location for color-coded cup sizes . I am tempted to hang the measuring cups as a kitchen decoration.Cleaning these stainless steel measuring cups is a breeze . A soft scrubbing pad and dishwashing detergent and the cups are clean . Indeed , grease , margarine and other similar substances that can be a challenge to remove from plastic come off with ease . Additionally , these measuring cups are dishwasher safe.My only issue with these measuring cups is that they are round rather than pointed , which makes scooping some materials , for example brown sugar , a bit more challenging . Some materials ( brown sugar comes to mind ) may need to be loosened with a knife , fork , or other implement before a measuring cup is effective as a scoop.I love dishware that is attractive and functional , and these measuring cups are both . These measuring cups are also a significant improvement over our plastic measuring cups , at least one set of which are being consigned to the trash in favor of these.Enjoy !	1
My current measuring cups are not nearly as sturdy as these which come with a rubberized handle . The handles on mine bend with very little stress while the ones on this Oxo Good Grips set are very solid although a tad short . The latter probably reflects a tradeoff in terms of storage space -so I can live with that . Given the choices - even with Williams Sonoma 's selection - I 'd recommend these highly .	1
These sleek brushed stainless measuring cups are functionally styled to go beautifully with a stainless steel kitchen . They sit flat , with no tendency to tip , have silicone handles so there is no slickness or heat transfer , and are clearly color-marked on the handles with size . The set includes 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 , and full cup . The handles are notched so the cups can be attached/detached from the ring , so the nested set stays concisely together when stored . I can not fathom any improvements .	1
These are good sturdy measuring cups with solid handles . I have had the weight of flour break the welding on some measuring cps , but these have handles that are part of the cup rather than soldered on . The short , wide handles make them easy to dip into the flour or whatever and the shape helps scoop it up . It is easy to shake off excess and have a level cupful . They clip together on a sturdy ring and are easy to keep track of.You ca n't go wrong with these .	1
I would call this the Cadillac set of measuring cups . I 've owned a lot of measuring cups over the years : plastic , metal , stainless , glass , but none quite as fancy as these . The only thing they went cheap on was the ring that hooks them all together , it 's plastic . ( C'mon now , if you 're going to make it all fancy , add a stainless steel ring , too . ) The stainless finish on these is a nice brushed look , giving it a high end finish and the curved design adds to the visual appeal . The metal is quite thick . They function very well for measuring baking goods . Dishwasher safe and no rust spots , so it 's higher quality stainless . The rubber coated handles are very comfortable . I agree with another reviewer that the smaller cups would be a bit tipsy if set on the counter as their base is small relative to the top , but I never set them down while working . The other thing is these cups do not `` nest '' as neatly as pictured unless they are hooked on the plastic ring . If unhooked the little cups just fall down into the largest cup , looking kind of messy , so you 'd want to keep them on the hook.These would make a great wedding gift . I 'd have loved to have received such a nice set of measuring cups . I suspect these will last a long time since they 're so well made .	1
Love these measuring cups . They are heavy/substantial which I like . The wide flat bases are great and the rubber handles nice . The contract of the black rubber handles and the brushes stainless steal looks great as well .	1
Does Oxo make anything for the kitchen that is n't first rate ? I have an Oxo can opener , Oxo vegetable peeler , mixing bowls , salad spinner , paring knife , offset serrated knife , strainer , and now these cups . They 're made of heavy stainless steel that 's not going to dent or rust . The molded on silicone handle coating is thick enough to insulate against heat , and after fruitlessly trying to pry it away from the metal , I 'm pretty sure that it 's on there for the life of the cups- which is to say a very , very long time.The cups snap on and off a plastic covered oval ring that makes them easy to store and use . I spent some time snapping them on and off to see if they 'd loosen ; they did n't . Unlike my Pyrex measuring cup set , these ca n't be microwaved , and they tend to tip over when placed empty on the counter . But they 're ideal for measuring out dry goods , like flour and sugar . I used the 1 , 1/2 and 1/4 cup to measure out flour for today 's bread batch , and I found they were perfect for measuring out a cup and striking the top level with a small spatula.They 're not as good as Pyrex cups for measuring liquid ; a glass cup with divisions marked on the side makes it much easier to precisely measure quantities . Hot liquids will cool much faster in a heavy metal cup than in a glass measure , too . Some reviewers have complained that the handles are bendy and the cups are tippy , but my set have very stiff handles , and only the 1/4cup size is at all tippy . Perhaps they upgraded the design somewhere along the way.So : High quality , nearly indestructible , and ideal for dry measures . A bit more expensive than most measuring cup sets , but they should outlast a lot of cheaper sets .	1
I have the old set of these cups and these new ones are definitely much better . The handle is very sturdy compared to the old set . The grips ... like all OXO grips ... are great . They are extremely solid and very heavy stainless steel . They have a bit of a sharp edge to them . My husband did n't like this , but I love it because it makes scraping off knives , spatulas , etc very easy . I had to scrape out peanut butter the other day and was very grateful for the sharp edge . There are two things I have found that I do n't like about them , which is why I reduced my review to 4 stars . I do n't like the little plastic ring these are attached to . I decided just to remove it and get rid of it . It was awkward to twist them off and on and I just did n't see the need for it . They sit nested nicely in my drawer , so without the ring worked better for me . The other thing I did n't like is that it only comes as a four piece set ( 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 , and 1 cup ) . I wish it was a six piece set that included a 2/3 cup and a 3/4 cup . It was frustrating the other day when I had to use two separate cups ( 1/4 and 1/2 to get 3/4 ) to measure peanut butter , then I had to wash and dry them in between so I could use the 1/4 cup again for another ingredient . This was frustrating to have to measure peanut butter out twice when I could have done it with just a 3/4 in the first place . Maybe not that big of deal to someone else , but it annoyed me enough that I decided next time I will use my 3/4 cup from my other set of measuring cups .	1
The stainless steel wall on the measuring cups is sturdy.The clean up easily . They set comes with the standard 4 sizes . 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 , and 1 cups , which allows cover most measurementsThe handles have a nice grip but I did remove the ring that holds the set together.I have used them for a couple weeks now , I would recommend them based on my initial impression.If they fail for any reason , I will update my review and adjust the rating accordingly .	1
These metal measuring cups are well made , having a smooth finish and size-marked rubber handles . I like the wider openings on the top for keeping the overspill of flour and/or sugar off my counters . My only peeve with these is that I like cups that nest well , and these are a little tricky . If you want them to fit in a normal shallow island drawer , you ca n't pile the handles on top of eachother . You almost can , but the top handle rubs a little as you close the drawer . The fix is to fan the handles out while the cups are still nested.They 've made several trips through the dishwasher and with no problems at all . Recommend !	1
The Oxo Good Grips Measuring cups have a snap-on-or-off measuring cups with comfort grips handles . The measuring cups are made of heavy-duty stainless steel . The cups are somewhat rounded leaning towards an oval shape making scooping out and measuring dry ingredients relatively easy.The cups come with a satisfaction warranty guaranteeing replacement or repair.The measuring cups are dishwasher-safe making clean-up easy.Recommend .	1
I 've had this product for about 2 weeks now . Here are a couple observations : ( 1 ) The handles are somewhat short for my liking but i like the non-slip material its padded with . ( 2 ) The handles also bend very slightly with heavier ingredients but its nothing major and doesnt seem like it will break at all . ( 3 ) I like the large sizing numbers on the handles , easy to see and helpful . Overall they do a good job and i dont think you would be disappointed if you bought them	1
To measure or not to measure that is the question ... Whether it is nobler in the kitchen to use stainless or suffer the slings and arrows of neighbors who know you secretly use plastic when they are n't around.To sift , to measure , no more ! ( plastic ) and by this recycle bin we say to end - bye bye plastic . The heartache and the shock of discovering that you have just used 1/3 instead of 1/4 , the numbers on the plastic worn . This is a consummation , devoutly to be wished , when ere the stainless dips into the flour yay that first time . Verily . I say unto you . ( in the words of my Uncle , Allez Cuisine ) Take no pause ! Grip the good of the Grip of Good . My fair stainless - Nymph of kitchen tools . Be all my measuring remembered .	1
Heavy-duty metal cups , it seems likely I 'm going to be handing these off to my heirs . The rolled edge makes scooping clean and easy , and the workmanship seems excellent- the materials feel like good quality . The rubberized handles are nicely non-slip.But that very sturdiness turns into a ding against these cups . At twice the weight of our plastic Kitchenaid cups ( about 4.4oz for the 1-cup Oxo ) , they 're a little too heavy for the GF 's taste , and I found myself wishing they had slightly longer handles for better leverage . The Oxo 's handles are the same length as my plastic measuring cups . The short handle on the heavier cup feels unbalanced in the hand ( and that 's made worse by the rubberized `` gripping area '' being shorter than the handle ) .I like these cups for their solidity , for being durable products in a throw-away age , and for the aesthetic of the stainless steel construction . But they really need better handles ...	1
This is a set of basic , sturdy measuring cups . The best part for me was that they really were easy to remove to use and clean separately . They stood up to the dishwasher and to the five-year-old dropping them on a very hard tile floor - no dents , no damage.I find them easy to use - the measurement markings were clear and easy to see - and I find them easy to clean . They also stored easily in my kitchen drawer . A win all around !	1
Now that I have them , there are several reasons these measuring cups have become an absolute essential part of my kitchen . Despite the fact that I bake mostly by weight , these cups are getting used nearly everyday for a wide variety of tasks . I use them not only when I 'm cooking and measuring ingredients and liquids , but also when I 'm serving to help regulate portions.One of the major points I like about the cups is their weight . They are a bit heftier than standard measuring cups I 've used and I like that . They do n't knock around quite so easy on the counter or in the drawers when stored , which I like . The weight also feels substantial in hand , like a good knife should.The sloped edge of the measuring cups lends well to scooping dry goods from jars or bags and also helps when pouring liquids from them . I did n't think I would like this or find it useful at first , but it seems to have it 's purpose.The rubberized grip is nice , like many of the items in OXO 's brand . The handle could be a little longer to help provide better leverage , but overall the measuring cups are very well made.I 've been using these constantly and I 've really enjoyed having them in my kitchen . Measuring cups get used and abused and having something sturdy to do the job is perfect . I love these .	1
These OXO measuring cups look a little strange but work well , and do not tip over easily . Each cup does contain the the amount marked on the handle . The handles are comfortable but a little short . The slightly strange shape probably makes them better at preventing spills than the traditional cylindrical shaped kind of measuring cups . The shape is stable but looks a bit unstable . These are fine though I 'll probably stick with my older cups which have longer handles and do n't look like they are melting . I am revising my review to say that we are now using these all the time and they are fantastic for dealing with dry goods .	1
These are really well made measuring cups that , true to the branding , have good grips . However , they are missing two things we would like to see in a measuring cup . These are personal preference , and may not matter to many people . The details are below : Pros:1 . Stylish looking but still functional in use.2 . The handles are sturdy , have nice rubber grips and clear labeling.3 . The cups all pour well , even though there is not a discrete spout on the rim.Cons:1 . The one cup and half cup measures do not have intermediate markings for partial measures ( e.g . 1/2 and 2/3 on the one cup measure ) . Also , they are missing any metric references . Many of our previous measuring sets have this handy feature that helps prevent using more measuring cups ( and therefore cleaning more cups ) than necessary.2 . The brushed stainless steel finish is just rough enough that flour will leave a thin film of dust on it and sugar will also partially coat the inside even though it is thoroughly cleaned and dried . This is n't enough that it is messing up the measurement , but it just bugs us because our other cups do n't do this.Conclusion : Not a bad set of cups . If the issues above do n't bother you , they are great .	1
These cups are everything they claim to be and more . Easy to use , uniquely shaped , and easy to read . I love the clip for attachment or removal from the ring . Highly recommended .	1
I have been baking for a long time and have used the same measuring cups for years . I have the one cup and the 1/3 cup left , so it was time for a new set . These OXO cups attracted me because of the shape , they look new and modern.What I found were cups that feature permanent , bright , color-coded numbers so that measurement markings are easily recognizable . I removed the cups from the ring because I like them separarte when I use them , and really do n't find I need them all together . They all go in the same drawer as my measuring spoons , so I know where to find them . The color code makes it easy to identify each cup . I usually dip the cup in the flour or sugar and use a knife to scrape off excess . They are very easy to wash and I wash them by hand by habit , but if busy can put them in the dishwasher.The measuring cups have a heft to them , do n't fall over and are easy to use . No complaints and no problems from me . I expect to use these measuring cups for years of good baking ! Recommended . prisrob 04-24-13	1
I have always been impressed with OXO 's kitchen gadgets . They are well built and function nicely . The soft grips do prevent slipping . The measuring cups are sleek looking with an angled lip for easy ingredient pouring . Easily detachable from the ring for single use . They clean nicely . The price might turn some customers off , but these are built to last for years so they are a good investment .	1
The OXO Good Grips Stainless Steal Measuring Cups are surprisingly heavy and well made . The stainless steel cups I have used in the past have been thin , cheep steel and these are definitely not . But I found my self preferring the plastic measurement cups over these because that are so heavy and over built . I literally toss the cups into the sink after I am done with them but if I did that with these I would likely damage something . So unless you have a specific need for stainless steel you may be better off with plastic if that is what you are use to using . However if you want stainless this will not disappoint.I did not have the handles bend so that issue may have been addressed with the an updated version .	1
I received these measuring cups through the Amazon Vine program and am very happy to have had a chance to test them out.Obviously , they measure things , and I can only assume the measurements are accurate . They are very sturdy however and they clean out very easily . If you need a set of measuring cups , especially if you want to throw them in the dishwasher without worrying if they 'll melt this is the set .	1
Very nice quality , have enough grip area for anyone to use comfortably . Dishwasher safe . The stainless steel handle and cup is a one piece design , NO more broken welded handles ! ! These should last a lifetime ! ! They nest together well in the drawer and are easy to pick up and work with . ( My wife 's hands do n't work well due to a past neurological illness , she loves to cook , these cups are light and comfortable for her to use . ) They are accurate measuring cups , and the tops of the cups are flat so one can scrape flat with a knife for accurate measures . The matching measuring spoons work well too .	1
We have come to expect quality construction from Oxo , and these measuring cups are no disappointment . They are solidly constructed and have the comfortable grips that are part of all Oxo gadgets . The quality construction means that the measuring cups are noticeably heavier than my other measuring cups . This is n't really issue for me , but I could see them being a bit unwieldy for people with arthritis or other hand issues , particularly when full .	1
If I have my druthers ( and why did I remember that old timely word ? ) , I 'll usually pick OXO over an unknown brand . OXO rarely strikes out . Is there a military grade for kitchenware ? Because these strong , sturdy cups would qualify.These cups are more squat than most other measuring cups , so it felt like I needed a slightly wider opening in my flour canister . I thought I had discovered a very minor flaw , but realized it made the cups feel very solid resting on the counter . I was very satisfied with my 20 year old plastic measuring cups , but now they feel cheap , flimsy and prone to tipping . OXO has done it again .	1
These stainless steel cups are prettier than my plastic ones . And they are heavy and substantial enough that I expect them to be very long lasting . I saw something about the handles mentioned but that must have been fixed . The handles look just right and these should give years of use while matching stainless steel appliances in your kitchen .	1
I love these measuring cups ! The shape is excellent for scooping dry ingredients and pouring liquids . I find the clip feature with the nesting design great because I have been known to keep things scattered all over my kitchen drawers and then they just take up more space . The rubber grips are perfect because they do n't irritate your hands no matter what you are using them for . They are excellent for sticky substances and they clean up easily . The only flaw that I have found in the design is that the handles are a bit flimsy and can bend a bit . You just have to be careful with them and that 's something that I never had to think about with my old plastic ones . If they make the handles harder then the product would be perfect . I still love them .	1
I love the stainless steel cups , the rubber handles , and the construction of the set . I see some reviewers have had issues with handles bending - maybe they 've fixed that ? I 'm guessing so , because I 'm hard on the cups and never had even a slight bend . They 're holding up well , with both powders and liquids .	1
These are great cups for baking , measuring , etc ... I 've used them non-stop for the past few months with no signs of wear or tear , even the numbers are still etched into the rubber handles like new .	1
This is a set of four cups - the standard 1-cup , 1/2-cup , 1/3-cup and 1/4-cup assortment . If you want the 2/3 and 3/4 cups in a set , you 'll need to get theOXO Good Grips 6-Piece Measuring Cup Set , Updated Design , which is plastic.I will have to say that I was not expecting these measuring cups to be as substantial as they are . I wanted a set of metal cups because my plastic ones have gotten pretty battered , and these will fill the bill exceedingly well.I ca n't imagine that this set wo n't be durable . The product description does not mention what grade of stainless steel they are made of , but with proper care they should never rust.Oxo did improve the handles over the previous design . I have an older set of Oxo plastic measuring cups , and the numbering did wear off of the grip . With the numbering embossed on the handle , there should be no problem with being able to immediately tell what size cup you 've grabbed even if the paint wears off .	1
I have a lot of good grips products and overall they have been a very dependable brand for great kitchen and household items . These measuring cups are very nice . There are four of them , all heavy stainless steel . You can a 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 and 1 cup measures.The smallest one , 1/4 cup , is a little bit tippy , but the others are all solidly flat . You can scoop with them , measure your ingredients , heat on the stove and they have a ring so you can either keep them clipped together or pull them off to use individually . Recommended !	1
Very nice little set . Comfortable to use and very easy to clean . Well made sturdy stainless steel . Comfortable for my arthritic hands .	1
I find great value in acquiring items that provide quality that will last a lifetime - things like vintage Rolex watches , Spyderco knives , Le Creuset French ovens , etc . Oxo 's 'Stainless Steel Measuring Cups ' are a benign , everyday type of household item that in my books falls into this lifetime quality distinction . Sure , you could find a functional set of 4 standard measuring cups at your dollar store but what Oxo 's version provides through its chunky , hefty stainless steel construction and permanently fixed measurement markings is the assurance that once purchased you 'll never need to purchase another set even as the decades roll by . Measuring cups ... .who knew ? Throw out your old , cheapo plastic set . These cups are one for the ages .	1
This set of measuring cups by OXO has quickly replaced all the miscellaneous sets I 've acquired over the years , including my plastic Pampered Chef ones . These are very sturdy and have a weight to them that makes scooping and scraping easier . My favorite feature is how they easily unclip from the ring to be used individually , which was my biggest complaint with the cheap set I 've used for years . I hated having to wash all the measuring cups after using just one of them.They stack neatly and take seconds to wash . They do not have any measuring lines on the side , but I 've never used those anyways so I prefer them without . This is a set of 4 , in sizes 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 and 1 cup . The only thing that would make them better is if there was a 3/4 cup measure included .	1
Measuring cups are measuring cups ; however , these are superior . First , because of the rubber grips , the size of the cup is clearly stamped for easy reading . Second , the cups are on a ring , but removable for easy use and storage . Finally , the cups ' design has a stable bottom , so no worrying about tipping . I highly recommend this product !	1
These are very nice looking measuring cups - much nicer looking than plastic ones . The measuring amount is embedded on the rubber handles so it wo n't rub off like with plastic . They sit flat on the counter and detach easily from the ring . However , I am concerned about the durability of the rubber handles . Like other reviewers have said , the handles are somewhat bendy , and I do n't know how the handles will hold up after being repeatedly washed in the dishwasher . Despite them being `` dishwasher safe , '' if you want these measuring cups to stay pristine , it might be best to hand wash them . Also , keep in mind that these are not microwave safe , so if you need measuring cups safe for the microwave , you will need a set of plastic ones as well . However , despite these issues , I think these are nice measuring cups and a good addition to any kitchen .	1
These measuring cups are solid , heavy stainless steel . The capacity of them ( often such a chore to see ) is printed in bold , colored letters -- easy to see even without my glasses . The handles , though a bit short in my judgment , are of a non-slippery plastic and feel good in the hand . They are mounted on a ring , or they can be easily disconnected for placement on a rack or other holder.I 'd been looking for a nice set of measuring cups for some time . I finally got what I wanted . Thanks , Amazon ! UPDATE : I was wrong about the length of the handles . Having used them now for a month or so , I see they 're just right for greater torque.Buy these ! They make kitchen life much easier .	1
Considering these are an upgrade from cheap plastic measuring cups , it would be hard not to enjoy the better quality . I like the sturdiness , the stainless steel being safe for stove top use , the rubber grips as a big advantage , and the angled design which makes pouring easier . They do bend a bit under duress , but again , compared to plastic which bends with anything , I have no problems with making adjustments to accomodate . Also , the steel prevents microwave use , so there 's that to consider . Nonetheless , for my needs , these represent a high quality set I wo n't likely be replacing . Good bye plastic .	1
I am so pleased with my set of four OXO stainless steel measuring cups ! I have many other sets of cheaper and expensive plastic and glass cups but have never had any in stainless steel . I really appreciate the large , covered handles that identify the size and make using them easier and more comfortable . Another nice feature is the slightly elongated shape of the cup to aid in scooping and pouring/emptying of the contents . They are dishwasher safe and stain resistant . They are easily removed from the ring that keeps the set together and nest quite nicely to store . I 've had no problem with them bending when I 've used them . Everything has it 's limits but they appear to be pressed well and seem very sturdy between the cup and handle.The only thing I 'd ask for might be more sizes , but these will be in my kitchen for ( most likely ) as long as I can cook !	1
These are solid well constructed stainless steel measuring cups . Of course they are accurate , but they are also comfortable to use . Their rubber grips make them good to use when measuring wet ingredients , or when you hands are wet . They also have a detectable plastic ring that can keep your cups together , or you can take them off and have them loose . I have them attached to pegs on the inside of my cupboard so I do n't need the ring , but it is handy to have .	1
This is so remedial . Buy a Wilton magazine for less money and get more ideas and instructions for your investment .	-1
I 'm very disappointed in this device . It 's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides . The only thing it has going for it is portability . It can only hold regular sized hard covered books . Forget about any size paperback , it will not work . Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions . Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again . I tried with over 10 textbooks and it did n't do well with any of them . For home reading I 'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand . The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it .	-1
I 'm very disappointed with this purchase . The quality of the product is low , the paint is uneven and the bottom of the cup is cheeped .	-1
The small spoon is too small . The bigger spoon is too big . Neither of them are true & # 34 ; teaspoon & # 34 ; size spoons . The flatware is very thin so the knife really has no cutting power ( even for a butter knife ) behind it . HOWEVER , for the price I paid , I ca n't expect anything else . They are pretty stylish at a glance but if you 're looking to do anything that requires a durable utensil , this is n't the one you want .	-1
This is okay for chopping cilantro , but does not puree very well . I my mind it does not live up to the Cuisinart name . Much prefer my old Sunbeam Oskar .	-1
My original mini prep had a sharp blade , not a serrated blade . I got years of use out of it , and I would n't have replaced it but my husband mistakenly through the lid out in the trash . This one is only so so , and food gets caught in the teeth of the serrated blade	-1
This processor does not work . This was a replacement for a Krupps processor and I only used it 3 times . I had to buy a Phillips to replace it .	-1
received in good conditon , had to return the first one , did not chop , got the second one , it was for my daughter she said it did not work well	-1
Not for me . It 's so small ( of course ) and it 's really only good for nuts . It pulverizes other products . I returned it with no problem .	-1
i bought this mainly to chop onions and such to save time of chopping by hand , but no matter what i do i end up with mush and chunks of onion . i dont know what im doing wrong , if anyone has any suggestions - feel free to help me out	-1
I purchased this in advance for what I knew was going to be a lot of food prep Labor Day Weekend.I was so certain of the Cuisinart brand name that I threw out the boxes and other packaging and the damned thing did n't work . Well , it worked for 10 seconds and then died . It was probably the single biggest waste of $ 30 I have ever made and the entire thing ended up in the trash and I spent 4 hours chopping vegetables by hand .	-1
Then go with the Ninja Master Prep . I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush . When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant , so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush . On the New Ninja Master Prep . It has only pulse one speed , but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades , two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done . I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly . Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit .	-1
Just cut your vegtables and do n't waste your money on this because if you want to use it ; you still have to cut your vegtables in small peices anyways . This thing will likely liquify them too ... .not a great product .	-1
For this money I did n't expect the glue under the button names to peel up within a week . and I certainly did n't expect the base to cause messy leaks despite repeatedly replacing the gaskets . And now , after less than two years the motor has burned out ! Shame on you Cuisinart !	-1
I love the blender portion . It works great at crushing ice and other items . The food processor is another story . Works to chop up and blend items , but the motor noise alone has forced me to stop using it . With each use , the noise is louder and so irritating . I am extremely disappointed that I ca n't use the processor portion of it . As much as I love the blender , I ca n't recommend the purchase because you wo n't be able to use the processor without ear plugs .	-1
Read other reviews . The drive on this unit fails . I probably used this blender only around 10 times over the past year , and now its broken.Do not buy .	-1
This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies ( our main use for a blender ) . When the cutter assembly broke ( after ~20 uses ) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement . Since the blender was purchased as a gift ( from our wedding registry ) , we did not have `` proof of purchase '' and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com ( ~ $ 21 with shipping ) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well . This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer `` service '' again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore ( i.e . the replacement part had no warranty ) .If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart ( i.e . Conair ) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service .	-1
Unreliable and hard to clean.I took full advantage of the warrantee on this coffeemaker . With a only 6 months of service , the grind mechanism bound and could n't be removed . Cuisinart replaced under the warrantee ( I did have to pay shipping charges ! ) Less than a year later a repeat performance . Again , I paid shipping and Cuisinart replaced the machine . Well you know what happened ! The third one just went in the trash as the warrantee expired two months ago.The machine was always difficult to clean - so know I am online to look at Melita 's !	-1
We have had this model for over a year and , while it does make good coffee , it is SUCH a pain to clean . You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made . Also , the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water . If I had it to do over again I 'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine . My mother has the Capresso and it 's much better !	-1
This coffee maker makes good coffee , but all the little parts , which do n't fit together quite right will make you crazy . This is a pain to clean . The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove . After a few months , I could n't get it out , even with a pliers . Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off , when trying to remove the basket . I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part ... no response . Now that the machine has n't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee does n't taste that good . In the trash it goes . The machine also `` beeps '' at you a lot ... .like I need one more complaint ! Good coffee , but needs design tweaks and customer service improvement .	-1
The design is such that you do not get maximum taste from the coffee beans . Stay away from this model . A chore to clean , plus mine broke about a year after I bought it.In a way , I am glad . I got a Melitta coffeemaker to replace it and the coffee tastes much better !	-1
Worked great for the first year we had it , when we used it maybe 3-4 times.But after that , it seemed like nothing would ever really freeze up enough . I looked into the problem and decided that I might have damaged the cooling capability of the bowl by cleaning it with hot water ( which is a no-no ) .So , I bought a replacement bowl , and once again , for the first year with a few uses it seemed to be OK.But now once again , it 's just not getting cold enough - and this time I *know* it 's not my fault since I have been very careful to only wash the bowl in cold water .	-1
Works very well -- but [ at the price ] ? Come on ! This unit isvirtually identical to the Deni ice cream maker I bought at Target for [ little over half the price ] this spring -- which also works very well . Shop around , people !	-1
Once I got the hang of it ( there is a bit of a learning curve , but it 's not terribly steep ) , I loved the frozen treats that I could make - especially frozen yogurt.A few weeks ago , while it was mid way thru churning , the upper , cylindrical part of the dasher snapped away from the vertical , scraping arm . Because the machine is out of warranty , I had to order the part 's replacement at my own expense . While it 's not going to break the bank , Cuisinart informed me that it would take 8 weeks ( ! ) to fill my order.I 'd considered ordering the dasher that was introduced in the newer model , since it 's supposed to be more efficient , but I was n't sure that it would fit in the ICE-20.Bottom Line : Great concept , lousy parts .	-1
I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock , and was so disappointed I returned it . It made sherbet ( milk-based ) with no problem at all , but I 've really been craving sorbet , and the freezer bucket simply was n't cold enough to do the job -- it chilled my mix , but did n't even turn it to slush before it had warmed ... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours , only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up .	-1
I got this ice cream maker primarily to make sorbets and the occasional batch of ice cream . The item arrived well packed , accompanied by a very small instruction manual / recipe booklet combination.To get a feel for the machine , I first froze the freezer bowl for 24 hours at zero degrees or less . My first attempt was a Quince sorbet from `` The Sweet Life '' cookbook . I pretty much followed the recipe instructions to the letter . I poured the chilled quince mixture into the frozen bowl with the machine running . 10 minutes passed . 20 minutes . 30 minutes . 40 minutes . My `` sorbet '' was just a frozen drink . Eventually , the freezer bowl defrosted and I had a lukewarm smoothie on my hands.Thinking it was my ability to follow a recipe , I decided to try one of the recipes in the instruction manual . I tried the `` basic vanilla '' . After about 20 minutes of churning , the ice cream started to firm up . But it never got past the soupy slush stage . So I waited some more ... another 20 minutes . The ice cream was thicker but still a soupy mess . After freezing the concoction for 3 hours , it was fine , but more like frozen milk than ice cream.Next , my wife stepped in and tried one of her recipes . Chocolate ice cream . Same results for her . A soupy half-frozen mess.I have lost faith in this machine . I still think the best and most reliable way to make ice cream is with one of those old style churns . I just do n't think this thing gets cold enough . My parents have a different model ( anotehr brand ) and theirs freezes the ice cream within 15 minutes every time.Your mileage may vary , but I would be wary of this machine .	-1
I would not recommend buying this ice cream maker . It is made entirely out of cheap plastic and the motor sounds like a dentist drill . Even the canister is made out of plastic and now there are scratches in it from when I scooped the ice cream out with a metal spoon . I followed the directions exactly and after 1 hour it was still liquid.The next time I used it ( again having the canister in the freezer for 24 hours prior to making the recipe ) , I put the mixture in the canister and then put it in the freezer and covered it with tin foil . I hand-stirred the mixture every 10 minutes and after 1 hour , it was done.Instead of buying this product , I would recommend mixing the ingredients together and then putting it in a plain plastic container directly in the freezer . It will take 8-10 hours for it to harden . You can use the following recipe to start:10 oz plain frozen strawberries ( slightly thawed ) 1/2 cup sugar10 oz heavy whipping creamPuree the strawberries and sugar . Mix in the whipping cream with the other ingredients for about 2 minutes or until the whipping cream thickens . Pour into a plastic container and place in the freezer . You may wish to stir the mixture every 2 hours so that it hardens more quickly .	-1
I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I 'm cooking smelly foods , when people smoke in the place , etc . I had previously had the more standard dual 8 '' window fan setup , and after several months of use , they always seem to get so weak they barely move air . I decided to try this one but it 's not right for my intended use . This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets , is giant , and moves a TON of air . It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door . When it 's off , the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc . Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it , but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who 's in the market .	-1
Other reviewers see the same problem as mine.The lower handle has little to hold it on . The single bolt that came with the pot is too small and wo n't hold on . We were forced into using a 32 thread 1/4 '' hex bolt . It held for a year . Now the handle has fallen off , again . Is the bolt the problem ? No , it 's the threaded receptacle ! MAYBE , if I drill out the receiving threaded shank and try to force a 32 thread # 10 bolt in.If This does n't work , I 'm avoiding buying another Presto from China.When the pot worked , it did well . A little hard to get the aluminium grooves to hit the slots without a fight.Nope , this cooker is useless . Presto you stink .	-1
About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker , purchased from Amazon . It is made in China . This item is made real cheap , it not only does not do the job , the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time . I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out . I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read . I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away . I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star . I will not recommend to buy it . I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker , that works perfectly for years of use . I just wanted a smaller size . But wasted money for this junk .	-1
I 'd used my old pressure cooker for over 20 years . The Teflon coating was chipping off , and because of safety concerns , I was happy to receive another pressure cooker as a gift . That cooker ( the Casa Essentials 5-quart model ) only lasted for a few uses . The silicone seal ring lost its ability to form a seal , and the part cost almost as much as the cooker . I decided to upgrade and bought the Presto 4-quart cooker.Within a few uses , the handle became loose , because the screws that hold it on are too small . Every time I use the cooker , I tighten the handle . Next , the safety seal in the lid started seating improperly and allowing steam to escape . So as the pot heats up , I tap on the safety seal to seat it properly.Today when I tapped , the safety seal fell down into the chicken soup , which began spraying out of the hole and all over the kitchen . Not a pleasant event on a morning when I felt a bit under the weather and was looking forward to a bowl of chicken soup for lunch.I fished out the rubber seal and put the soup in a conventional pan to finish cooking . Because of the problem with the handles , I 'm not going to replace the seal . I will discard the pan and either buy a good quality pressure cooker or do without one .	-1
I will admit that my negative experience with this pressure cooker is partially my fault . I did n't realize that this model did not have a quick release . I should have noticed this from the photo so it is really my fault . I thought all modern day pressure cookers had quick release valves . I have an eight quart pressure cooker by Presto and I am in love with it . That is why I stuck with the same brand . I wanted to get something smaller to cook smaller portions of food.I also did n't like how I had to screw the handles into place . I want something that has permanently attached handles . I 'm going to send this item back and buy another eight quart pressure cooker by Presto . I ca n't seem to find any smaller sized pressure cookers that have a quick release option . If anyone does , please let me know by leaving a comment or messaging me .	-1
I was really looking forward to getting the Presto 6 Qt . Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker . My mother had used one , and the name `` Presto '' really meant something to me . Even though I was unfamiliar with this kind of cooker , the previous reviews left me confident that this one in particular would be a good choice.Yikes ! I opened the Amazon carton only to find a very small box for a 6-qt . cooker . Turns out , this pressure cooker will arrive at your door IN NEED OF ASSEMBLY . Well , I was still game . Pulled out my handy dandy Philips screwdriver and carefully followed directions . The long handles had one screw only -- Not much for all the weight and pressure that pressure cooker handles must endure -- But I still gave it a shot.I made Chicken Chutney ( recipe in the instruction booklet ) which was `` okay '' -- Let 's suppose that I have n't used a pressure cooker before ( too true , too true ) . So if the dish was `` meh , '' that could be my fault . But ... As I was washing the cooker , it really became clear that the handle was loose . The screw was as tight as possible ( the instructions warn against screwing it too tight lest the plastic break ) , and the handle itself was clearly loose . So . . .I am returning it to Amazon ( they have made this very easy , UPS will even pick it up from my home ) . In the meantime , I will be looking for a good quality stainless pressure cooker that is securely made , and does n't come with `` assembly required . ''	-1
Bought this on November 13 last year . Have used it 10 ( that 's ten ) times . I only hand wash it ; I do not use the dishwasher for cleaning it . I use a dishrag plus a fabric coated sponge for washing dishes . No scratchers have been used on it . It is currently showing rust spots around the top edge . Fortunately I did not pay a lot for it , but it still was too high a price to pay for a piece of cookware that basically only lasted a little over 2 months as I do n't wish to eat rust.It is also very lightweight compared to the old pressure cooker my mother had for over 40 years ; maybe that is why the metal is n't very high quality.Firm believer in the old adage that you get what you pay for ; my bad . Have ordered another brand that is pricier . I am not in the financial position to pay more for one specialty pan than I did for my entire set of stainless pots and pans , so we will see how this next one works out .	-1
Strong words for a pressure cooker , I know , but this thing has been such a disappointment . I bought it to replace my old 6-Quart Presto pressure cooker that worked well and faithfully for many years . I 'm not sure if they have started making these things in China after I purchased my last pressure cooker or what . This new one is much lighter weight and the metal feels thin and cheap . The handle screw continually comes loose which makes the handle itself loose and wobbly . The pressure hole does n't seem to line up properly so that I have to use a knife to wiggle the pressure button free to pop up so it can start to cook after the pressure builds . If you are looking for a solid , reliable pressure cooker - - keep looking ! This is not the one !	-1
This purchase was one of the first times that Amazon reviews let me down . As others have recently stated , it seems Presto has changed manufacturing of the screws , making the handles of this pressure cooker unsteady ... no matter how many times I tighten the screws , and how tight I , or my husband , try to get them , they loosen and the handles become very wobbly . This is not just a problem with one handle , but both handles ! I tried this item for a week , which required retightening the handles about a dozen times , and I have given up.Additionally , after only two washes , the screws are already starting to rust ! I did n't wash it in the dishwasher , it was by hand.I can understand why this is an inexpensive product ... it is cheaply made ! However , I am baffled at why it gets such good reviews .	-1
Sadly returning this . The handles wo n't stay tight and the screws that hold them are already rusting . Plus hard to get it up to pressure - too much sputtering around the handle for a long time ! I remember my Mother cooking delicious tender meats in her pressure cooker years ago . But I did not have good results with this one . Followed directions and chicken came out tough . And - a magnet wo n't stick to the interior ( only the exterior ) ... so maybe the interior is not stainless steel , but aluminum..which is not what I want to cook my food in . Thank goodness for Amazon 's return policy .	-1
You can only fill 2/3 of this 4 quart pressure cooker so you can not really do any canning unless using very teeny tiny jars and cooking very small portion of food . I have a 5 quart pressure cook and you can not put a whole chicken in it . You need at least a 6 to 8 quart cooker to cook a decent meal with meat and vegetables . I wo n't recommend buying this pot even if it is cheap .	-1
So we 've had this vacuum cleaner for a bit over a year now . It was purchased September 8 , 2009.Currently , my wife is complaining that the vacuum is not providing enough suction to pick up the dirt . The bag in the back was emptied so we know that 's not the problem . Time is going to be spent trying to figure out what 's wrong with it , and it may be finished das far as I know.My impression of the vacuum over time has n't been that great . It performed rather poorly on hardwood flooring from the start , and I ca n't say I was overly impressed on carpet . It 's clunky to move around , and when the bag approaches full it tends to tip over .	-1
Picture of bag says 'Genuine HOOVER Filter Bags . I was sold and shipped a 3-pack of genuine imitation generic bags instead . While they were made in the USA and may be just as good , do n't bait and switch products on customers . I purposely choose theses because they were supposed to be real HOOVER bags .	-1
It 's basically a small flooring polisher . It beats doing it on your hands and knees but it 's not meant for doing a whole house of hardwoods at one time .	-1
I honestly do n't understand the rave reviews for this thing ( which prompted me to purchase it sight-unseen ) . It sucks well on bare floors , has a long cord and hose , and has a foot-thingy to change to carpet , but so do plenty others without the following:1 . Heavy . Reviewers say it 's pretty small and light but I find it hard to handle.2 . Disobeys . Ok , I 'm being funny but it does n't turn corners or doorways well . You have to pull on the hose and the minute there 's a slight turn , the hose bends all the way and blocks the air , letting out a very LOUD noise that scared the neighbor 's dogs.3 . The hose is SOOOOO flimsy ! My kid 's toy vac has a better one . Super thin inflexible plastic . A few more `` bends '' and it WILL crack . Since there 's no swivel on it either , it 'll bend and crack at the base too.4 . The cord does n't retract ( you roll / attach it to the underside ) . I have n't seen that on the tiniest of vacs in 25 years so I never thought to look for this `` feature '' .5 . The tubes are flimsy too . When you 're using all 3 extensions ( standard if you 're tall or just , you know , vac'ing ) , any pressure you might apply for a rug or what not bends the tubes.6 . The `` air hole '' in the tube wo n't stay shut . I 'm not sure what that 's even for ( suction reduction , maybe ? ) but I do know I rarely use it and it compromises regular performance . But it wo n't stay shut ! Keeps sliding open from the slightest of touches.7 . Everything 's a bit `` too '' long , and `` too '' heavy , etc . It feels like it 's rebelling against being a compact.So mostly , aside from the lack of a retractable cord , this vacuum HAS all the features , but they 're all POORLY executed so it 's awkward to use and will definitely break quickly . It was a bargain , but not THAT great of a bargain . CPO applied their refund policy and took it back . Very nice on the phone , too . I was bummed they did n't carry an alternative model I liked so I could still give THEM my money . I would have .	-1
I suppose you get what you pay for , but this vacuum is just too lightweight , even for a two-bedroom apartment . We returned it immediately .	-1
It has high sound and received with one part of the pipe extension badly cracked . When we first open and connect the pipe to the hose extension it just open widely . It is not durable . I will never recommend this to any one .	-1
UPDATE at 3/8/13 : I 'm still disappointed with the function of the accessories , but the suction is really good . So I 've decided to make do until the bags I purchased are used up . I still had the floor tools from my deceased Dirt Devil canister , and they work okay with this vacuum . I only use the Eureka floor tool in the storage room and garage where my cats spend the night . It works okay on the vinyl/concrete/utility rugs , and on the carpeted cat scratcher.ORIGINAL REVIEW : Did my research and had such high hopes , but this vacuum is a big disappointment . The unit and accessories appear as described , and it sounds strong and has good suction from the open pipe.Except , not . My house has bare floors and large ( 9x12 ) wool or cotton rugs , and 3 cats . After going over the kitchen , I turned around and saw the same onion skin and pet hair just mocking me . Then I spent 20 minutes on the living room rug , and afterwards it looked like only I 'd crawled around picking lint by hand . Other gripes : the flexible hose kinks flat/closed ( does n't self correct ) , the floor tool clogs about every 90 seconds in both brush positions ( and must be cleared WITH FINGERS , the debris does n't suck off by the pipe alone ) .I do n't have the heart to go in to more detail . I 'm not sure how I 'll get my floors clean with this device . This blew the budget I had to replace a 15 year old , $ 40 , Dirt Devil little red canister ( that finally burned out ) . Harrumph .	-1
Pros : Several useful attachments includedCons : Very Noisy , runs hot , average performanceI bought this to clean the cars . It works for that purpose . However , I would n't recommend it for use inside the house due to the noise . I would also be concerned with using it for extended periods of time due to the heat it generates.For the price it is okay .	-1
This was so cheaply made it should have been embarrassing to manufacture it and put it on the market . All it was ood for was making noise ! This one went back immediately .	-1
Cleaned bare floor ... roller jammed on rug fibers/human hair ... roller Not removable ... ca n't clean it up ... ca n't re-use it ... wish it had worked ... nice idea , but not practical for normal use .	-1
This worked pretty great for the first few months.. After changing the filter and using it continuously throughout the past 6 months the performance has gone way down . Its a really big disappointment for the price.. I think I paid nearly 60 at the time . I would recommend getting a bag less wireless vacuum if you are considering . Getting replacement filters for this annoying and the fact that it does n't perform that well after a few uses I would just look elsewhere .	-1
Cant believe the rave reviews . I must have got a lemon . This thing has no suction at all and both of the batteries wont hold a charge after only 2 months .	-1
Works for bare flooring . I was hoping to use it for quick pet hair pick up but it is really weak for that . Basically it is a dust-buster with a handle and flimsy brush attached . Takes a LONG TIME to charge . Not worth it .	-1
I bought it to replace my dead swifter . I guess I was spoiled with the swifter , it actually cleaned my hard wood floors . The Eureka just pushes it around .	-1
I have n't had any problems after several years with this timer however a problem with my exhaust fan it 's controlling has caused concern . You can not manually turn this switch off . My fan was buzzing and not turning this morning when I set the timer to 10min . Afraid it was about to burn up , I tried to shut it off with the timer but could not . Fortunately the fan slowly started turning and did not burn up but I will be replacing the timer asap .	-1
I purchased a Hoover Wind Tunnel model UH70120 and bought these belts only because of Amazon 's & # 34 ; Frequently bought together & # 34 ; suggestion . THESE BELTS DO NOT FIT THIS MODEL ! ! ! Even after bringing this to Amazon 's attention , this 'suggestion ' still remains . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	-1
I would never buy a Hoover vacuum cleaner again . Their customer service is the worst I 've ever seen , there is no service near by and they expect you to pay postage if sending the big non working plastic junk to them or drive 65 miles to their service center.Never again Hoover.Do Not Recommend .	-1
We purchased two of these . They are loud , not `` whisper quiet , '' and work well to block noise , as we live on a busy street . Both started to die around the same time , about a year after we bought them . They began making loud rattling noises to the point where we could no longer use them . Buy another brand !	-1
Pros : Moves a good amount of air , even at speed 1 setting ( lowest speed ) .Cons : Speed 1 . It 's way too loud for me . I set the fan about 8 ft away from my TV , near a sliding patio door . The TV volume had to be turned up quite a bit .	-1
Feb 2012 : My review below was before they swapped the original motor for junk while pretending the unit 's unchanged . It only looks the same but on opening my newest for 1st periodic cleaning bits flew out that proved to be cheap plastic tie-downs that could n't stand the heat and the motor windings seemed similarly downgraded . Check the web for fire hazzard recalls.Jan 2010 : To my original review which follows , I 'm just adding this note that Lasko says this model only draws [ when new ] 83 watts @ High , 69 @ Medium & 56 @ Low Speed . The 170 watts reported elsewhere is in error.I also note neglecting to mention my need to avoid blocking daylight as much as possable , thus clear plastic for the 'shroud ' mentioned below.With no range hood in my city apartment , I 've run these [ at Mid Speed ] virtually 24/7 in my kitchen window for decades , sucking fresh air thru the rest of the apartment while expelling stove heat & air-borne greece , etc.I 'm comfortable with this because it 's relativly easy to take the motor apart for a simple cleaning about once every 9 months [ or so ] . I 've also added 2 4 '' circular layers of the old , cheap , black , 'washable ' air-conditioner filter material between the back of the motor and the interior protective grill to lessen the amoung of gunk sucked into the motor.What with the cooking , this filter and , for esthetics , the inside grill are also removed & cleaned in the bath tub 3 or 4 times a year . The grills are a pain as soaps are only partly effective & brushes do n't quite serve for the tiny grill opening.With all this beating , the fans have all lasted an astonishing 5yrs++ ! BTW : To deaden vibration noise , etc . I hang the fan from 2 springs at the top of the window . I noted that with the fan running I could feel air being sucked in from outside around the sides of the fan so I 've made a clear plastic shroud to block these areas for greater efficiency . I 've also taped bits of this plastic on the 4 corners of the inside grill wher some more air circled in & out .	-1
This review is for : Lasko 3733 20 '' Box FanHow on earth do you choose a box fan ? Well really they mostly choose us do n't they , we choose the first box we see . The product descriptions are n't much help , they mostly all say they are quiet , powerful , low cost to operate , etc . Are they really all that different from each other ? When looking for a replacement fan I found 2 of our fans were recalled in 2005 for fire hazard , so now I am replacing 3 fans . I guess in-plug mini-fuses became universal for a reason . Let 's get started ... The 20 '' box fans we 'll compare are : A - Aerospeed BX100B - Holmes HBF2002AC - Kenmore 32002D - Lasko 3720E - Lasko 3721F - Lasko 3723G - Lasko 3733H - Lasko B20201DESIGN AND DETAILS : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -All have white fans and grills , gray enclosures , 245-260 square inch areas the blades pass through , and 70 '' -73 '' cords.A - Aerospeed BX100- Wavy grill ( BX200/BX400 have other grills ) .- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- Little smaller enclosure ( you would n't notice unless side-by-side ) , though the blades pass through an area near to the highest square inches of the bunch.- The in-plug mini-fuse is easily replaceable if it blows.B - Holmes HBF2002A ( Target ) - Simple grid grill , blades have circle connecting them.- Fan speed dial and plug connection are on the MIDDLE OF THE BACK . This is not ideal if bringing air into the house from a window and not an attractive option when exhausting out.- The in-plug mini-fuse is easily replaceable if it blows.- Looks exactly like the Kenmore 32002.- NEGATIVE : At top speed it vibrates like crazy , enough to move itself.C - Kenmore 32002 ( Sears/Kmart ) - Simple grid grill , blades have circle connecting them.- Fan speed dial and plug connection are on the MIDDLE OF THE BACK . This is not ideal if bringing air into the house from a window and not an attractive option when exhausting out.- The in-plug mini-fuse is easily replaceable if it blows.- Looks exactly like Holmes HBF2002A.D - Lasko 3720- Circular grill , blue logo on the front , blue speed dial.- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- Lasko promotes this as their fan of choice to PUT IN A WINDOW because it is more RAIN RESISTANT ( not weatherproof ) .- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.- This is a wider ( 4 3/4 '' ) and thus fairly STABLE fan enclosure compared to some of their models.- Should be mostly the same as 3721 , except this has the blue logo.E - Lasko 3721- Circular grill , blue speed dial.- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- Lasko promotes this as their fan of choice to PUT IN A WINDOW because it is more RAIN RESISTANT ( not weatherproof ) .- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.- This is a wider ( 4 3/4 '' ) and thus fairly STABLE fan enclosure compared to some of their models.- Should be mostly the same as 3720 , except no blue logo.F - Lasko 3723- Circular grill , blue speed dial.- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- Although it physically LOOKS LIKE one , this is NOT one of the rain resistant ones like the 3270/3721 ( larger size , blue dial , etc . ) .- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.- This is a wider ( 4 3/4 '' ) and thus fairly STABLE fan enclosure compared to some of their models.- LOOKS just like the 3721 , larger enclosure and no blue logo . But again not a rain resistant model.- NEGATIVE : Rattles a little at all speedsG - Lasko 3733- Simple grid grill.- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.- NEGATIVE : Shakes a lot at settings 2 & 3.- NEGATIVE : Listeners thought the hum tone was more annoying than the others.H - Lasko B20201- Simple grid grill.- Fan speed dial is on TOP.- All Lasko in-plug mini-fuses are not replaceable.- NEGATIVE : LOUD at highest setting , listeners thought annoyingly so.- NEGATIVE : Little more of an airplane hum/whine sound . `` ( yelling over a fan ) THEY SAY THEY ARE ALL QUIET ! `` aka NOISE : -- -- -- -- -- -First some things that may help you get more out of this section on noise..- It takes +10dBA to be perceived as a doubling in LOUDNESS.- It takes just under +6dBA ( 5.85dBA ) to be perceived as 50 % ( half-again ) LOUDER.- It takes just over +3dBA ( 3.22dBA ) to be perceived as 25 % ( quarter-again ) LOUDER . ( Note : When you read that +3dBA roughly doubles `` sound pressure '' that 's different than perceived loudness ) Most sounds 50dbA on up have more of a potential to annoy , for example when while trying to talk , and especially starting at 55dbA ( highly subjective , but gives you an idea ) .Okay , now onto the comparison..SUBJECTIVELY listeners liked the WHOOSH of air sound much more than that of the HUM of a rotating object . I noted next to the fan descriptions above which ones listeners felt had a sound they did n't like as much , regardless of loudness .

If a little additional on-going expense for a fan makes this much less costly alternative to air conditioning more palatable , then that 's probably a good investment.However , being green is an important factor for some folks , so here below is a comparison in electricity usage I measured .

The fan surface measurement was done roughly 1/2 way up the fan blades right against the grill.On fan surface air velocity half-way up a blade at one point is , of course , just a sample point , and air velocity at a distance can be greatly affected by the degree of focus/dispersal . Nevertheless , I hope this air velocity info helps us get a better sense for the differences between the fans .

That is , when comparing points where air velocities are roughly equal for the fans ( at the same distances ) , the loudness difference is so small I can hardly tell which is louder and the numbers support that.So there it is , my favorite three and some ways to compare them.SUMMARY : -- -- -- -- -- In the end these are just classic 20 '' box fans which are more similar than they are different . Hopefully whichever you choose wo n't be a lemon and will work for many years . Perhaps somewhere above you 'll find information you can use to choose the best fan to meet your needs.Whatever you get , if it rattles , shakes like crazy , makes an annoying hum , etc. , try exchanging it for another , do n't settle , there are less annoying fans out there and you 'll be listening to them for many years to come.I hope this helps someone : ) .SHOPPING NOTE : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Millions of 20 '' box fans are sold in the U.S. every year . Review sites can not get anywhere near a statistically valid user sample , so although we learn from comments about DEFECTS and EARLY FAILURE , I suggest not filtering out a model based entirely on them.There are also old reviews that have already been acted on by manufacturers to improve the product or fix a description , thus the review may no longer be accurate.That said , defect and early failure comments with details are great for FEEDBACK TO THE MANUFACTURER ( or author ) and to help us all much more quickly SPOT SIMILAR ISSUES and thus get an exchange while it is quick and easy to do . Again though , I would n't use them to filter out a model entirely .	-1
I was considering buying the once reputable White Mountain Electric Ice Cream Freezer until I noticed all the dissatisfied buyers who purchased from 2009 to present ! From 2009 to present not a single review is positive as all have stated that the machines broke down . They are now MADE IN CHINA and JUNK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I have used this peeler only a few times and it is already quite dull . It is now practically impossible to peel an apple with it , although on straight peels , like carrots , it still works like any other mediocre peeler . Also , the `` swivel '' never really worked well . It was always difficult to peel a curved surface like an apple with this thing .	-1
I saw this product on a cooking show being used to core pineapple slices and thought it would be easier than coring the pineapple with a knife . It turns out I was wrong . Save your money and use a knife . To be fair , I have not tried this device on apples . I will give it a go and post another review .	-1
I 've gone through two of these and wo n't purchase another . The first one broke after using it a three or four times , but since I like Oxo products in general , I assumed it just a fluke . The second one I simply threw away . As other reviewers have pointed out , it uses tiny , metal teeth to grip the lid , which slip and could conceivably cause injury . It was worthless , so I 'm back to the old technique of using hot water on the lid and banging the sides with a spoon . Works better than Oxo , that 's for sure .	-1
Bought this six years ago to use instead of the under-cabinet one that was already installed in my kitchen . The under-cabinet one was better at unscrewing a lid , but occasionally the jar would slip out of the vice and my hand would get pinched . Well , this OXO opener proved to be a disaster in every way . Like other reviewers noted , it does n't secure well enough to the lid , slips off the lid , and hurts your hand when it gets slammed into the jar . I 'm surprised no one has sued the company for manufacturing this awkward , uncomfortable , dangerous product .	-1
Bought two of these , one for my mother and one to keep . What a total waste of money . Even my husband could not use this device easily . We finally just trashed them both as no use allowing junk to take room in our kitchens .	-1
I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed . It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use . My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble . The opening is way too big to accomplish that so , back it went to the supermarket . I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it does n't , I am rating this only one star .	-1
I have arthritis in my hands & wrists . My daughter-in-law knows how difficult some kitchen tasks have become for me . OXO has a good reputation for ergonomic products . I think this one needs to go back to the drawing board . I could not open a single jar with this .	-1
I have always trusted OXO products , but this time I was woefully mislead . The internal ejector blade broke with the very first scoop of ice cream . Bad , Bad product . Do n't waste your money on this one .	-1
The metal scraper loop that expels the ice cream is unbelievably flimsy and very tenuously attached on both ends . Although it worked well as a muffin disher , it deformed and popped out the first time I tried to scoop ice cream from a batch I made that was frozen just a bit over soft serve ( I would never use ANY sweeper scoop - even well-made ones like theNorpro 3-Tablespoon Stainless Steel Scoop- to dish ice cream any harder than that ) . Waste of money . Look elsewhere.And for dishing ice cream only , of any degree of hardness , try theZeroll Original 3-Ounce Aluminum Ice Cream Scoop .	-1
I bought this because it was the only scoop BB & B ; had in stock at the time . I needed a # 20 cookie scoop as recommended by Alton Brown . Turns out this is significantly larger than # 20 . As such , the scoops were so big the cookies did n't cook evenly - undercooked in the middle , overcooked along the edges.Not only that , the little metal scraper broke off on the second or third use . Fortunately , I was able to reattach it , but a cookie or two later , it broke off again . It did this same thing for ice cream , too . What were the designers thinking ? ! I replaced it with Oxo 's Good Grips Cookie Scoop ( large size ) from Amazon and could n't be happier . It 's sturdy and scoops the perfect amount of cookie dough so the cookies are cooked evenly throughout and consistently sized.I ended up tossing this Oxo Good Grips ice cream scoop in the trash . If you need an ice cream or cookie scoop , get something else . This thing will just frustrate you and fall apart .	-1
Much like most of the other reviewers ' experiences , the trigger mechanism in my OXO ice cream scoop broke almost immediately , as well . And then , to add insult to injury , when I kept using it despite the fact that it did n't work properly , the metal it was made from pitted/eroded horribly.Although I 've always been a fan of OXO 's products and ca n't recall using any other OXO kitchen gadgets I 've bought that I thoroughly disliked , this is definitely one to avoid .	-1
I could not use this scopp . The squishy parts of the grip seemed to be on the wrong sides of the handle . I could not get the right leverage with the pointed part of the scoop . It made it painful to get out the ice cream . I love Oxo tools however so tried the round ice cream scoop with the bail to pop out the ice cream . It works great .	-1
My son works at a ice cream shop , and when I recieved this ice cream scoop , he was glad that I got one that resembled the one that he uses at work . Until he actually used it . It looks metal , but feels like it 's plastic . When I used it for the first time , I was scooping out very hard ice cream , and it felt like it was going to break . I had to turn it in circles to get anything . I think I will be going back to my old heavy metal one . At least I know it wo n't break in my hand .	-1
This is the worst ice cream scoop ever . The part of the scoop that attaches to the handle is only about 1/4 inch in diameter . It 's a total scam ; they made it look thicker , by making the part that holds the scoop 4 times as wide . You ca n't tell by looking at it , because they have cleverly disguised it with the plastic handle . I found out when the handle broke off in my hand , while trying to scoop some hard ice cream . Oxo , you should be ashamed of yourselves for making this piece of junk , which was clearly designed to deceive the consumer . I 'll likely never buy an Oxo product again .	-1
I LOVE OXO products . I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market . I started using OXO knives when I found a 6 & quot ; utility knife . That is a great knife . OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money . I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy , it was more like cutting with a sharp piece of sheet metal rather than using a sturdy knife . I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife .	-1
What exactly does stainless mean ? How about dishwasher safe ? I think that means you can put it in the dishwasher and it wo n't come out with rust spots , but that 's what it does every time . Nice concept , cheap execution .	-1
The spreader is much larger and wider than I wanted . I have found it useless for buttering bread sticks , which is why it was ordered.This is my fault and not that of the spreader .	-1
I love the size and utility but after you wash it - it looks disgusting and has white spots etc ... I didn ` t put it in the dishwasher it is not dishwasher safe ...	-1
I love OXO utensils and have many of them . But I looked for quite a while for a meat tenderizer and missed the review that said not to put this tenderizer in the dishwasher . Pound raw meat ; wash it in the dishwasher in hot water , right ? The tenderizer I was replacing was aluminum . Now this one looks like old aluminum -- it 's gray and nasty looking . Not something I paid extra for to get stainless steel . It 's totally not up to par with the usual OXO utensils .	-1
This hammer is a thing of beauty , but ( to my surprise ) you ca n't wash it in the dishwasher . That 's an instant fail for a utensil that gets regularly contaminated by raw meat . I returned it .	-1
This does the job fine , but if I had it to do over again , I would have gotten an all stainless one . Not being able to put this in the dishwasher is a huge drawback . My two favorite words are `` dishwasher safe , '' but to not be able to put something that touches raw poultry in the diswasher is insult to injury . I am pricing others and it looks like I 'll be dropping at least $ 18 .	-1
This must be the worst product I 've ever purchased that sports the OXO label . And I 've got a lot of the stuff , and have been generally satisfied with it . I needed a channel knife , wanted one where you could draw it sideways like a paring knife ( instead of pulling it long-ways towards you -- look at other channel knives , you 'll know what I mean ) . This gadget cuts the raggediest , least-attractive lemon twists ever , and it 's hard to pull through the rind as well . So I thought OK , it 's still a good zester . And ... ..No-it's-not . Get a microplane , or maybe a different zester , but this one is a turd . Finally , the handle is not `` comfortable , '' it 's too hard and too big for my ( fairly small but not outrageously so ) hand . The whole tool is poorly designed and clumsy .	-1
The tool works okay enough for zesting , but is terrible at peeling for cocktails or drinks that need a twist . The scoop cutting device on my unit was dull and it did NOT cut into the skin of the lemons , limes , or oranges . So , half of the functionality of the device is lost . Therefore , the OXO Lemon Zester is not worth the expense . No matter how I held the zester or oriented the fruit , it did n't cut . I was left with having to find alternatives and the OXO zester is used only for the thin strips of skin used for recipes ( not for cocktails ) .Perhaps I got a ( USED ) dull one . The blade is not sharp to the touch . But Amazon should not be selling used devices as new , and the blade should not be so dull so fast . Or , it could just be a design flaw.Considering the OXO version is more expensive than other options , I would request my money back , but I spent so much time trying got get it to work , it is even more dull and useless than when I started .	-1
I usually love the OXO Good Grips line of kitchen tools , but this one let me down . The bowl is smaller than my old plastic ricer , and the handle is n't as long , so it 's harder to squeeze . I thought the stainless steel would work better , but my old plastic one is easier and more efficient , especially when I make a half-gallon of homemade applesouce . I 'll keep this one as a backup for smaller jobs and softer foods .	-1
I boiled potatoes to make mashed potatoes however when I used it , the potatoes just remained in the container . They did not go through the holes or sieves even when I pressed it down with the top part . I do not know if I overcooked the potatoes so they were too soft to go through the sieves when pressed but I have not used it again so far .	-1
That disappointment , today I got the apparatus and is incomplete , missing the rubber of one of the handles , if I start it back who knows how long it would last and that would cost , to send me or I replenished by another .	-1
I own this set and it was a complete waste of money . I was originally attracted to these knives because I own a number of other Oxo Good Grips products and , with the exception of the garlic press ( which has a mediocre design and rubber handles that fall off ) , I have been very pleased with the quality of their products . There are two problems with these knives:1 ) The blades are made from cheap stainless steel that will not take or keep an edge . They are dull to the point of being dangerous and notwithstanding several attempts with my diamond sharpener , could not be made sharp . I would use a serated steak knife before I would use one of these knives.2 ) The handles are very poor in design and construction . They have a portion of rubber ridges that are very soft and so flexible that they prevent obtaining a decent grip on the knife . They also are not shaped in a particularly ergonomic fashion and appear , as other people have commented , as if they would not stay long on the knife under any sort of heavy use.Avoid these knives - there are a multitude of better alternatives out there . Although I have no recommendations for a replacement for the small chef 's knife , I do have a recommendation if you are looking for a good moderately priced paring knife : buy one of the Henckels or Victorinox plastic-handled 3 '' paring knives available here for around four dollars . These parers ( I have one of each brand and they are similar in design , shape and quality ) will take a nice edge , fit the hand much better and are less expensive , to boot . If you 're willing to splurge a bit , I can highly recommend Kyocera 's 3 '' ceramic paring knife . It will set you back thirty bucks or so , but it will have the sharpest edge you 've ever experienced on a knife , sharp enough to cut a grape into a slice that is a fraction of a millimeter thick , thin enough to be completely transparent .	-1
The thongs are a bit hard to handle for me and I have rather large hands . They also did n't come together perfectly nor did they feel too sturdy although I did n't really test them .	-1
I have owned mine for 1 month , I saw this morning it had rusted in several places.I am throwing them away and getting a new one .	-1
I gave up on plastic chip clips after my mom showed me an obvious improvement : Binder clips . All metal construction , and a box of 12 costs less than just one of these plastic clips . I use them everywhere . Only loss is that they do n't have magnets on them .	-1
I bought these , but there not as strong as Binder Clips , that I bought at the stationary store , and the binder clips are alot Less money , and you get a box of them , not just 4 ... I do n't keep a bunch of junk cliped on my refigerator , so I kept these OX0 clips in the drawer , they also take up more space then the Binder Clips do ... I 'm not impressed with these clips.But I gave them a 2 star for color ! ! ! Big deal lol ...	-1
I bought OXO wires to replace the wire that will soon break . This slicer is just another junk slicer . When the wire breaks , you throw it away . I think they make this junk on purpose . I am so tired of being hosed by companies selling junk.I am a little angry at Amazon for suggesting that I buy replaceable wires with this . Feels like a bait and switch deal . I did order the other OXO that uses the replaceable wires that I initially ordered with this junk one . You will be money ahead , buying the one that accepts replaceable wires . AVOID this one !	-1
I must say I was very dissapointed with this product . I got to use it about 4 times when it broke during the cutting of a piece of cheese.I hope this is not representative of all of these cutters . But I do n't intend to try one again.To return it and look for a refund would cost more in time and postage than the item costsw	-1
I had to return this item because after I removed the cork from the wine bottle I couldnt get the cork out of the corkscrew . The company sent me a replacement with an opening which makes it easier to remove the cork from the corkscrew . But my old-fashioned corkscrew still works the best .	-1
I expected nothing but the best performance from an OXO product . But this spinner is awful . After many , many spins , there is still a lot of water left on washed lettuce leaves . Does n't even come close to my older and less expensive spinner . A big disappointment .	-1
This is a fairly sturdy , seemingly well-designed piece of kitchen equipment that is supposed to dry your salad greens by spinning them in a colander . You press down on a pump at the top of the lid to get the colander spinning , then you can either wait for the colander to stop , or you can use a brake button to halt the action . I will break this down into the pros and cons that I have found : Pros : It is sturdy . It has grips on the bottom and pretty much stays in place even if you let go of it.The lettuce can be put in the colander , then water poured into the bowl to wash it , then the colander can be removed to drain it , saving the need for an extra washing bowl.It is fairly easy to get a good , fast ( ish ) spin going . Tip : make short , fast pumping motions.Cons : In order to get the fast spin , you must pump for at least a minute , maybe more . My arms got very tired after cleaning two heads of romaine lettuce.There does n't seem to be a need for the brake . I just lifted the lid off when I wanted to stop it . Why add unnecessary functions ? The lid comes apart for cleaning , but I found it extremely hard to get it apart . It 's definitely made for someone with huge , strong hands.And the big topper of them all : it does n't dry the lettuce . I thought that 's what a salad spinner was supposed to do . At first I thought I was doing something wrong , so I tried different things . I put less lettuce in the colander . I broke the lettuce in half to make smaller pieces . I lightly wrung out the lettuce before putting it in the colander . I pumped , let it stop , pumped again , let it stop , pumped again . No matter what , I still ended up with damp lettuce that I needed to pat dry with paper towels . So what is the point of this contraption ? If I just wanted to wash the lettuce I could have used a bowl that I already have instead of paying a lot for this thing . I wanted to give it one star , but because it is fairly sturdy and I can at least use the bowl and colander again , I 'm giving it two . Ca n't anybody make a decent salad drier ?	-1
This product was disappointing . It is a bit difficult to get the lid off and when I used it , it did n't do much to dry the salad . I 'm confused as to why it has gotten so many good reviews .	-1
Based on the video demonstration and other reviews , I thought the OXO Good Grips Green Salad Spinner would be a time , paper towel , and dish towel-saver . Not so fast . Well , actually , it does spin very fast , and you will have some water in the bottom after rinsing salad greens . But the greens are still too wet for salad use . With my old roll-them-in-a-towel method , the clean-up is easy and there is only one step . At least now when I roll my spinach in towels I will no longer wonder if I would be better off with a spinner . I 'm returning it .	-1
I love OXO . I thought they could do no wrong . But this apple corer/divider was a waste of money . We had an old stainless steel one without the handles , so I thought this one would work better . It does not work any better at all ! The apple gets stuck in it , and it 's a pain to clean .	-1
why is this designed to not go all the way to the bottom of the apple ? it makes it so much more dangerous , since you have to put your fingers near the blades to extract the apple sections and try to force the last 1/2 '' of cut.this is what i get for trying to be lazy when making pies , tarts and turnovers , and not just use a chef 's knife and paring knife ( and maybe a corer with a plunger ) .i 'll be doubly insulted if it starts cracking like a few reviewers have mentioned.to sum it up : do n't bother , it 's more of a hassle than a time saver . just get an 8-10 '' chef 's knife and a paring knife ( except for certain tasks which necessitate it , a 12 '' is a little unwieldy for my small hands ) . i know that a lot of people who have never used them seem to find chef's/ cook 's knives daunting , but even super cheap knives are safer , better and easier to use than this , and they certainly are n't single taskers , either . just buy an easy -to -use sharpener ( forget all those over-priced contraptions with `` fingers '' ) and you 're good to go .	-1
I bought 2 of these because I eat a lot of apples and pears . Both of them split on the sides within 6 months . These OXO units 'look ' like they are sturdier , better quality than other plastic units , but they are n't . If you use a corer/divider on a regular basis , do n't waste your money on these ; go for an all stainless steel unit instead .	-1
Most importantly bits of apple remain wedged between the seams of the blades . Hand washing or dishwasher fail to remove the bits . Having to pick at it with a toothpick or tweezer makes the tool a net time loss . In addition as other reviews stated it does n't cut all the way through on some of the apples . Sending it back !	-1
Although I like the design -- especially the non-skid feet -- I 'm ultimately very disappointed in this grater . Like other reviewers , I 've found that after less than six weeks of use , the plastic has started cracking.Contrary to what other reviewers have said , however , you CAN separate the two halves of the grater for cleaning or storage , but I was disappointed by how you can barely spread the grater 's feet out more than a few inches ... I wish it had a full range of movement . As it is , you can only position the feet about 4 inches apart . I was hoping for a wider foot print for things like quesadillas.Overall , a disappointing product . Neat design , bad materials .	-1
I bought one of these , thinking that the price is pretty reasonable . I got what I paid for.When you try to slide out the grater , so that you can clean inside of the ridges that hold the two plates into place , it 's awkward , because you have to align it just so , or else it wo n't come out . I 'd toss it in the dishwasher after using it . After the first round ( we do n't use the drying cycle , because it costs so much electricity ) , it came out with multiple cracks along the side . A couple months later , the plastic underneath the fine grater broke off . That made it so that the black piece up top is absolutely useless , because now it wo n't rest comfortably on the table . Then , the wide side broke.I went to walmart , and got an $ 8 box grater . That thing is solid .	-1
I am usually a fan of OXO products but I have noticed lately that they are not as good as they used to be with shoddy execution or questionable workmanship . I , like everyone else , was hoping this would be the solution to my storage issues with graters but it proved useless less than a year later and with little use to stress the thing out ( almond paste and cheddar cheese were the only things I used it for ) . It developed cracks in the plastic that are impossible to repair . Also , I do not think this is a good grater for the supposed market of arthritic people - it can be difficult to put together.So , in short , it stinks for those suffering pain in their hands and for those who cook . Save your money and just buy a KitchenAid grater .	-1
I had hopes when I bought this one , as I have usually had success with OXO products.Sadly , this grater was not one of those successes . I did n't pay a lot for it , around $ 10 and it lasted about 6 months . But the plastic gave way on the sides , so now I only have the side that is for finer grating . Which I do n't do that often . The cracks start at the corners of the steel grating piece and eventually they just break completely.It needs a stronger design and then it would be much better .	-1
I was disappointed that this grater only lasted for a couple of weeks . At first it broke into two pieces , so I could only use one half ( even when it stood upright as pictured , it never did stay open or grip the counter- it was never stable , and either closed or fell down while grating ) . Then I was left with a flat grater that was difficult to use . The piece that was left cracked on the corners , and broke apart within a couple of uses . Usually Oxo makes great products . This is not a good product . Save your money and buy a different model grater . You will be happier with an all metal model for sure !	-1
The only good thing about this grater is that it does n't take a lot of space , but after using it few times it cracked on the bottom .	-1
When we got this grater , it was nice , the grip is nice . It is hard to fit in a bowl , so we used a plate . Now the plastic has broken , the plastic is very thin , and apparently this item was not made to last . I have always thought of Oxo as being a good product , but lately several Oxo items have been junk.Do yourself a favor , and get an all metal one , with no plastic to break .	-1
I have owned many other Oxo products and purchased this based on my satisfaction with those items . However , the Multi-Grater failed miserably . Within weeks of moderate use , the plastic shell cracked . I continued to use it gingerly for several more weeks until the entire product snapped in half . Not recommended at all .	-1
I like the design of this grater : it does n't take up much space and is easy to clean because it comes apart . Unfortunately , the white plastic broke in several places after only a few months of use .	-1
I was looking for a grater that was easy to clean . This one seems like a good idea ... until it collapses on you . The sides do n't spread apart far enough , so it is unstable and without proper pressure it folds up . With proper pressure it works until the plastic breaks . I 'm surprised Oxo designed this . I 'll be going back to the old fashion `` box '' style grater .	-1
Bristles too short and too soft . Did not last very long . Eat a whole food , plant based diet so scrub lots of vegetables every day . Did like the shape of the brush , fits nicely in my hand as I work .	-1
I do n't like this at all , it is hard to use compared to the handle vegetable brush that I do use . It is hard to hold on to and scrub the vegetables at the same time . I did n't return it because it did n't cost very much and seemed silly to return it , but I do n't use it .	-1
I just love this fexible spatula . I just bought a new frying pan and decided it was time I learned to cook eggs over easy . Well I tried the expensive flexible one from Sonoma and the eggs broke in the pan . My kitchen-aide spatula could n't do the job either . I just happened to see this spatula in the grocery store and figured I 'd give it a try . Well , lo and behold , it does everything I ever wanted a spatula to do . I can flip eggs like a pro now.Oxo Good Grips Silicone Flexible TurnerMarylynEdited to add , Beware the spatula will bend and can not be fixed . Ours bent in the front making it useless . I would n't buy it . Never mind my first review , do not buy this spatula .	-1
I found the Spatula too flexible to support the food that I was cooking . Fish fillets fell off and broke apart.Not what I was expecting .	-1
This is my fifth different kitchen gadget made by OXO that has ultimately failed because it broke . Not a good track record , if you ask me . As a masher it worked fine on potatoes and whole tomatoes , the non-stick coating was a nice feature , the grip work fine . Recently I noticed the handle seemed a little loose . Then while we were cooking Thanksgiving dinner my husband was using it . He pushed down to mash and the whole thing came apart ! The side pieces are inserted into the handle and appear to use tension and some type of bonding agent to hold it together . The repeated force of mashing things was too much for the masher , which misses the whole point , does n't it ? It was amazing my husband did n't cut himself on some of the pieces of exposed plastic , which were sharp . Could I glue it back together ? Maybe . Is it worth it ? No ! 11/26/12 update : Replaced this masher with the Jamie Oliver Stainless Steel Masher . Fabulous five star product , works much better than this ever did ! ! ! It looks like OXO may have updated their design a bit from my version , but the ergonomics and function of the Jamie Oliver is far superior . Check out my review .	-1
This does mash nicely , but if you use it in more than a very small pan , you get your fingers covered with potatoes ! The handle is really too short , and I do n't actually find it ergonomic . It makes you get in a slightly strange position , since your hand has to be clenched on the top rather than gripping from the side . I 'm buying something else !	-1
I 'm a huge fan of OXO , and own lots of their utensils , but these are terrible . The cube ports do not have a lip , so water spills constantly on the trip from the counter to the freezer ( even if you fill well below the rim , which results in a very small cube ) . The plastic cover , supposedly designed to keep out odors , leaves a gap all the way around the tray , making it easy for odors to penetrate the cubes ( and adding to the spilled water annoyance ) . Do n't waste your money ; you will only be frustrated .	-1
I LOVE OXO items . They make some great products , unfortunatly they make some bad ones too . This is a bad one . I bought this so store leftover chicken stock in ( I saw someone making leftover stock into stock cubes and saving it for another day ) . Well I filled up the tray and started to put the lid on , which make the stock start spilling out . After fighting with if for like a mintue I decided , well there is no way I 'm going to be able to carry this perfectly level across the kitchen so keep it from spilling so I gave up . OXO should discontinue this item .	-1
Mr. Scholl 's and all other negative reviews of the OXO covered ice tray are right on the mark . I bought two of these and although I agree the concept is great , they are sooooo poorly executed and a pain to use . Not only are the lids difficult , the trays are hard to fill without spilling water ( whether from your kitchen sink or from a pitcher ) . The curved shape indeed makes novel shaped ice but because of spillage you end up with many of the ice cups partially filled . You end up with ice that melts quickly . It would have been much better to make square cups and a flat bottom on the tray . Getting the lid off is another major production . It does not slide easily to fill or to remove ice . Good idea , yes but totally awful execution . OXO gets an `` F '' on this one . I 'm giving mine away . I bought a couple silicone cube shape trays at the same time and I am going to stick to them until someone comes up with a really great user friendly tray that makes generous sized ice .	-1
Instead of a typical review , I urge you to read the one submitted by Blake Scholl above . He said basically everything that I was going to , and I feel it 's a 100 % accurate account of the product.I love OXO , but this ice cube tray is a pain in the arse . Its only redeeming quality is the fact that I can stack things on top of it because it is covered .	-1
I do n't like the way this thing works ... Luckily , after I ordered it , I found my old cheapie that had been misplaced during our move.I would suggest saving your money and buying one of the cheap plastic ones that work on the push stroke , and peels the shrimp by breaking the underside instead of cutting the shell down the back . I ruined more shrimp than I peeled with this one . I am hoping to find another use for it ! Maybe a grout remover ... .I find that rather sad , because I like the other OXO products I have purchased . The large handles prevents my bad finger from locking trying to hold something of small diameter ... ; 0 ) ) PK	-1
We love OXO products , but this one is not one of them . Shrimps get mangled . Might be good for very large shrimp though , but not for medium ones . My wife found it faster to just use her nails .	-1
I had this for about two weeks . It leaked dishsoap everywhere , and I did n't find it helpful for washing at all . I guess I 'm a sponge girl .	-1
I usually find the OXO Good Grips products to be great ... good quality and designed in such a way that they work better than many other brands . Well , not with this little guy.I was really only looking for a brush that will help me get my dishware and pans ready to put in the dishwasher . Not fully cleaned , but at least with any dried or baked-on food removed . I 've been using a little gizmo that I buy from our grocery store -- basically just a sponge on a hand-held stick -- with no area to add dishwashing detergent . It works fine , but the sponge gets pretty cruddy looking after just a few uses ; so I decided to replace it with one with brush bristles instead.The problems that I 'm finding is that the bristles flatten with minimal scrubbing and the dispensing feature does n't work so hot . It leaks a bit when I 'm not using it -- and occasionally wo n't dispense when I am trying to use it . Also , I realize now that I really want/need one with a longer handle if I 'm to keep my hands from getting fully immersed in detergent and water . The squat design of this one does n't allow you to scrub the inside edge of soup mugs or other limited spaces either.OXO makes anothermodel with a longer handle , but I 'm not sure that I 'd trust the dispenser on it either . I think I 'm going to replace it with anon-dispensing brushsince I 'm really only trying to get the dishware and pans rinsed for the dishwasher . I can add a squirt of detergent for those times when I need it .	-1
overpriced for what you get and it came shipped out bent up with all the brisles . Not worth the price .	-1
This is a good looking brush and it is certainly functional , but it is not cost effective , especially when there are much better options . For this brush , the brush head is permanently attached to the unit . When the brush hair get old , you will have to toss it away . Believe me , the brush hair will get soft or dirty pretty fast . Even if you are frugal/saving , you will need to replace the brush hair once every 6 months if not more often . When the time comes , you will have to throw the entire thing away.There are cheaper brushes sold by other companies . Even Oxo sells two other palm brushes where the brush hair component can be replaced . One looks very similar to this but it is difficult to find . The other one is theOxo SteeL Soap Squirting Palm Brush . Yes , the SteeL brush is more expensive , but you will save money in the long run because you can replace the brush head withOxo SteeL Soap Squirting Palm Brush Refills , 2-Pack . Here is a quick math , three of these permanent brushes ( $ 18 ) cost more than one SteeL brush with two replacement brush heads ( $ 15 ) . If you believe you will go through three of these brushes , than you might as well get the SteeL version . Now , it would be even cheaper if you can get hold of a non-SteeL replaceable palm brush.I am giving this a 2-stars .	-1
My wife needed to replace her 6 '' plastic strainer . Based on reviews I bought this , but it useless . It measures 6 '' across but has a thickish rim so it is actually less . In addition it is very shallow and holds minimal amount of food . Much shallower than the one we had . It is more like a big tea strainer .	-1
This brand is pretty cheap and the handle is flimsy . It should also not show up in the fine sieve category since it is not really a fine mesh sieve , it is a strainer .	-1
I have to agree with the reviewer that said it takes too long to peel a potato with this peeler . The cover over the blade is supposed to keep the peelings from flying up , and it does that . But instead , they get caught under the cover and slow down the works . It 's broad and obscures your view of the blade . I 'm a fast peeler -- thanks to all of those potato peeling contests my mother used to have her children do -- and I did not like getting slowed down because I could n't see exactly where the blade was going , or getting peelings caught under the blade cover . In addition , the sharp end for gouging out potato eyes is kind of rounded . On my old peeler it 's pointed , and works much better . I 'll keep looking for the older style , so I can get my peeling done faster .	-1
I own a number of OXO products , and most of them are fairly well-designed and functional , but the OXO SteeL ice cream scooper an exception , as it does a very poor job of dispensing ice cream . The curved piece inside the scooper that is supposed to push the ice cream out , does work fairly well if the ice cream is frozen and really hard , but if it is soft and sticky , you might find yourself reaching for a spoon to scrape the ice cream out.Constructed mostly of stainless steel , this scooper is solidly put together , but it & # 8217 ; s mostly for naught , as this is just a marginally useful utensil . Given its performance , I don & # 8217 ; t understand why it is rated so highly at Amazon , as it not a product I would recommend buying .	-1
This is crap . I bought this because it looked sturdy and the OXO name . It bent the first time I used it on a relatively light piece of pie . It is just a flimsy piece of steel stuck in an OXO handle .	-1
This product really surprised me because I was a great fun of Oxo products . The Oxo Steel Cheese Plane is a terrible product . I purchased this one about three weeks ago . The first use of this product made it bent where the handle meets the steel . The second use it completely snapped off in half ! ! I still like the most of the Oxo products however , I strongly suggest that you purchase different brand for your cheese slicing needs !	-1
I was hoping to wear these for a wedding ... they look great from far away but you can tell they are cheap if you have a good look .	-1
I have a food truck business and purchased this can opener to open mostly # 10 cans of tomatoe products . It just does n't cut it for that purpose . It worked great for a 14 1/2 oz . can , or the small can of tomato paste , but slips off the rim of the larger can .	-1
This is the first OXO product to disappoint me . Normally their stuff is good quality and lasts well . The handle came off after 7 months . It had probably been used less than two dozen times and had not been abused . I 'll still buy other OXO products but I 'm replacing the can opener with a different brand .	-1
My first OXO can opener lasted for years and then ... ... it disappeared.Fortunately , Amazon got my replacement out quickly.That was June . By December it needs replacement ... ..	-1
I have the 3 qt bowl , and I LOVE it . I love it so much I ordered the 5 quart bowl for when I bake in bigger batches.But honestly , I still reach for the 3 qt bowl , and rarely use the 5 qt . My issue with the 5 qt is the shape . The sides are shorter than the 3 qt , so there is a lot more splashing and spilliage , especially if you 're using a mixer . If were the same shape as the 3 qt but bigger , I 'd love it . But because of the shape ( it basically has a very flat bottom with short sides , while the 3 qt is a true bowl shape with a rounded bottom ) , I hardly use it .	-1
Sequence of events that led to this review:1 . I exchanged the first Oxo kettle I bought because the lid ( not the spout ) did not fit right , and the steam escaping from the top burned my hand.2 . I returned the 2nd kettle because the lid was so tight I had to have my husband open it or fill it through the spout . ( This made cleaning it impossible. ) 3 . The 3rd kettle was returned beacuse it had flaws in the finish and would eventually turn into rust spots.I gave up and expressed my disappointment to Oxo about this kettle , They were kind enough to send one to me . This kettle was great -- at first ; but , after awhile , the handle loosened up and , yes , steam began to escape . It now sits atop my refrigerator looking down on my ten-dollar kettle that has lasted me for years.Save your money . It 's a great concept but short-lived .	-1
I have most of the popular OXO products , but for some reason these did n't work out for me , they snapped and broke in half ( the white one ) and the Green one ( mini ) the top slipped off and fell into the disposal and got chewed up.I still have the purple one , I would not buy it again , possibly next time I will go for solid 1 piece model or I should glue the top part myself using silicon glue .	-1
I liked these , so I purchased a couple of them . But after about 6 months or so , the bottom half of the two-piece handles came unglued , first one , than the other , rendering them useless . I tried to find a way to glue them , but the handle is ridged inside with large hollow spaces , so I could n't come up with an effective repair . Also , I did n't like that the handles trapped dirt and water , which would slowly leak out . The blade , which is removable ( for cleaning ) is too stiff and inflexible and rather thick , so it does not scrape cleanly . It is too stiff and cut very rounded on the end , not very spoon-shaped , so does not seem to fit the corners and rounded places in bowls very well . Because it is removable , it will sometimes fall off during use . I would have preferred a more squared-off spoon blade . It is good for cooking , as the silicone wo n't scratch a non-stick pan and it is stiff/large enough to stir effectively , but it 's hard to scrape the bottom of pans , since it 's so rounded . The handle is comfortable , but very bulky , taking up much more room in the drawer than a flat one . The spatula is slightly over 12 '' , end to end , so may not fit in some drawers . I would not buy again . I hope this helps .	-1
I bought this thinking it would be better than all the cheap supermarket spoon/spatulas . It is worse - the head is not sealed to the handle and batter / food / grease / whatever gets in the slot where the head and handle connect and is impossible to get out - soaking , dishwasher on heat boost - nothing works . Also , 400 deg limit is iffy when using on the stove - 600 deg limit is much better . Mine curled a bit when used on the stove , but since it had a permanent reservoir of filth , I tossed it anyway . Better to splurge on the ones from Pampered Chef .	-1
I guess I did n't have an understanding of the product . so I do n't know if it is good or not . But I do n't like it and its clumsy feeling in the hand , I have difficulty using it for anything . Could be me , but I just do n't care for it .	-1
Lately I 've been replacing a few kitchen gadgets that just do n't work right , and this is one of them . The wire cutters are too weak , they bend out of the way instead of blending ingredients . I do n't know if all wire-style dough blenders have this problem but I think I 'm going to try a bladed type .	-1
This dough blender grips nicely in your hand , but the wires are n't sturdy at all and bend and warp when used on dough that is even slightly thick . Pretty useless , since the point is to use this to blend harder chunks of cold butter or thicker dough . The harder pieces just push the wires aside instead of blending them into the dough.I 've also tried bending the wires back to where they should be and they 're just left wavy and out of place .	-1
Usually OXO products are fairly tough and durable , but not this one . It is impossible to cut cold butter and flower with this blender because the wires just clump all together . You would have better luck with a fork and that is n't saying much.I have n't found a replacement product , but I have seen ones that have solid metal stripes rather than wires .	-1
I bought this blender to make pie pastry , and I was thoroughly disappointed . The wires do n't cut because they just widen and the pieces of butter slip through..I spent a lot of muscle to obtain a very poor result . The handle is nice but it just does n't get the job done .	-1
This one feels cheap and flimsy . I rarely use it and will probably buy a different style of sifter .	-1
I have had this sifter for 5 years . Until this holiday season , I was an occasional user . I like how the small sift area . I like how this did n't rust . I like the top and bottom covers a lot . However , today my sifter fell apart from all the sifting ! I guess I was giving the handle too much stress . I am amazed that this is n't a better sifter out there -- other styles rusted , or the flour flew out while cranking , or the squeeze handle caused hand cramps . I may try the electric sifter next because my hand tends to cramp easily , but that will only work with AP flour or bread flour . I ca n't believe someone has n't invented a much better sifter for the baby boomer generation .	-1
I used my new sifter yesterday for the first time . What a disappointment ! It was extremely slow to sift 1 2/3 cup of flour , taking about 4 minutes . The side to side , shaking motion was tiring , so much so that I had to move the sifter to the other hand . I was surprised at that as I think I have strong hands and wrists , typing a lot and being a keyboard musician.I quickly ran downstairs to the trash and retrieved my old , reliable and fast crank-style sifter . I 'll try the new one again but suspect it will end up in a garage sale ! !	-1
Everything in my order that was from OXO was well designed , but made in China . If I had known , I would have avoided it .	-1
This is a great whisk , until the plastic handle starts to disintegrate ( perhaps from the heat of the dishwasher ? ) . All of my oxo whisks had to be thrown out after about 2 years due to the handles starting to break down .	-1
I got this because I needed something that wo n't tear up my non stick pans . I love the handle , but it is a lot bigger than I thought . I mainly use this for gravy , and it 's just to big and flimsy . I 'd prefer something a little smaller . Also , it has little groves at the bottom of the handle that hold water after washing , because of this it 's better to hand wash than in the dishwasher .	-1
This whisk was highly disappointing . Perhaps I just expected more from OXO but I do n't think it will whisk anything thicker than liquid . I used it the other night to make pudding and it started out find but be the end just could n't hold up to the thickness of the pudding .	-1
Whisking thicker consistency food is a challenge . E.g ; cake batter . It feels flimsy . I rather use a metal whisk if you are planning to have only one .	-1
Oxo has designed many nice things , and their customer service is first-rate ... a rarity these days . Having said that , they have had a few misses , and this is one of them.Who would think a set of measuring spoons could evoke much of a reaction ? Certainly not I , but ... I 've had a set of Tupperware measuring spoons for over 20 years that I consider to be the benchmark for measuring spoon design . If you search ebay for `` Tupperware measuring spoons '' and scroll down to find a set of seven rectangular spoons on a triangular shaped ring ( in burnt orange ) you will see what I have . Ever since I received these as a gift nothing else compares . The fit snugly on the ring , nest tightly , and hang properly.I thought this Oxo set was similarly designed and would be a nice extra set . I was wrong.What I like : - The spoons can be detached from their ring . This is a must for me . I 've gotten so used to this feature I ca n't use a set where all the spoons are on a ring so they ca n't be separated.- The design of the attachment to the ring feels sturdy . The spoons will stay attached until needed.- The selection of sizes . The 1/8 and 1/4 tsp sizes are surprisingly useful.What I Do n't : - First and foremost , the attachment ring . I hang my measuring spoons from a hook under my cabinets for easy grabbing . The oval/rectangular shape of the ring causes the ring to hang `` the long way '' from the hook . This means the spoons settle at the narrow end of the ring and do n't stay nested . They splay all out when hung up and the bulky spoon design exacerbates this problem . If they had a triangular ring similar to my Tupperware set , so they hung better , I could live with the other faults . As dumb as this seems , this a deal breaker for me.- The thick , half-round handles feel clumsy and bulky to me . Because they are rounded on the bottom , they do n't feel as stable as flat-handled spoons . This shape also means the spoons do n't nest as completely as most sets . This could be a disadvantage if you store them in a drawer.- I would prefer molded markings so when the painted on markings wear off the spoons are still usable.I have a small kitchen with limited hanging space and limited drawer space . The ring design means the spoons take up too much space when hung up . The bulky design that does n't nest completely means they take up too much drawer space . I do n't say this very often , but I would recommend a friend not buy this set .	-1
I generally like OXO products for a number of reasons -- ease of use , solid construction , and ease of care . These measuring spoons are generally easy to use , although the depth of the spoon bowl and the shape make it a bit difficult to get some viscous liquids out without the use of a narrow silicone spatula . My steel measuring spoons work better for this purpose.I also find that spices like cinnamon and finely ground ginger tend to cling to the plastic much more than other measuring spoons . There is a lot of thickness to the spoons , probably for sturdiness , but sometimes they do n't fit well into spice containers . They take up much more space than my steel spoons that fit inside each other , as well.Good traits -- I like how tough they are . I also like the plastic ring ( although they 're tough to remove from the ring with one hand ) .So , overall , I was disappointed by these spoons and tried them several times to make sure that my results were n't just flukes , in terms of usage . I 'd definitely advise purchasing a good set of stainless steel measuring spoons instead . These are the ones I use : Cuisipro Stainless Steel Measuring Spoon Set .	-1
I thought I would add an observation seemingly not made by others : these spoons are too lightweight for a dishwasher with any real power . Unless you take care to entangle them inside or under heavier items before you start the dishwasher , they will fly around inside ! After discovering this , I purchased heavyweight stainless steel measuring spoons , which I do not have to worry about when putting them into the dishwasher . As a result , these plastic spoons from OXO never got used enough for the labels to wear off , so I have n't had that problem.My advice : DO N'T EVER buy plastic measuring spoons , unless you WANT to clean them by hand after each and every use .	-1
My husband and I received these as an unsolicited wedding gift . I 'm pretty particular about my cooking utensils , but I figured , hey , they 're measuring spoons -- what can go wrong ? Well , plenty , as it turns out:1 . The measurement labels wore off within a year . Some of the measurements are pretty obvious ( tablespoon , 1/8 teaspoon ) , but for the spoons that are closer together in size , it can be kind of hard to hazard a guess.2 . They 're bulky . They do n't lay nicely in a drawer or fit through the necks of narrow containers.3 . They 're not long enough to reach the bottoms of taller containers.4 . Why bother with the cheesy plastic ring ? It never stays clasped , anyway . I just threw it away.5 . The plastic does n't wash up nicely when switching between wet and dry ingredients . Oils , for example , are quite a pain to get off the surface of the spoon.6 . They 're WAY overpriced for what they are . Just because it 's Oxo does n't mean it 's quality.As soon as I get myself a decent stainless set , these are going right into the trash where they belong .	-1
We are trying to rid our lives of all plastic , whether BPA-free or not , but bought these well before that change . They seem kind of cheap , but do function ok , which is why I gave them two stars instead of one.THE LABELS WEAR OFF EVEN AFTER A FEW GENTLE HAND WASHINGS . I never sent them through the dishwasher , and was careful not to scrub the size labels at all , to no avail.I would spend 5 more dollars and get some stainless steel ones . In fact , try to convert all your kitchenware into Pyrex glass , stainless steel , and bamboo . You wo n't regret the quality or the health benefits .	-1
The rubber grips are nice , but as others have noted , the capacity circles ( painted on ) starts flaking off pretty quickly . Also , they are relatively shallow , so it makes it hard to get an accurate measure . If you do n't want to dirty up several of them ( for example , you need 1-1/2 cups worth ) , the shallowness makes it difficult to `` eyeball '' a half cup . I found I used an older , cheaper , taller set that I bought 20 years ago ( for $ 1 ) more often . They also do n't have a good pouring lip like on some others . With the paint flaking off , they look ratty . I ca n't remember if I threw them out or donated them .	-1
I thought these would come in handy with the `` extra '' measuring cup . I found them too bulky for my kitchen drawer because of the slanted shape and the extra cup . I ended up returning the product .	-1
I have had the black and the white versions , and the colored dot with the number wore off very quickly , even though it said on the package that it was `` guaranteed not to wear off ! '' So , of course I called the company , who to their credit promptly sent me a new set , whose numbers again wore off . I 'm still left guessing if I 'm using the correct cup because now , a couple years later , there is no sign that there was ever even a number on them . I 'm writing this review today because I 'm finally buying a new set in a different brand . I also had trouble with OXO 's stainless steel cups .	-1
I do n't usually bother writing negative reviews , but when I saw that these had a five star review , I had to give my input . For the first week I owned these measuring cups , I loved them . They seemed to hold up well in the dishwasher , and they served their purpose well . Then I started doing some more baking , which involved using the cups to scoop flour and sugar from the bag . Immediately , almost all the handles bent . You can take these in your hand and bend them with little pressure ! I am not impressed . I would rather use plastic measuring cups .	-1
I really like OXO products . I have a number of their utensils in my kitchen and I enjoy that they have nice big handles . Since I started getting gadgets for my kitchen I always wanted these measuring cups . Well I finally got them . I was very excited to use them for the first time . Well I went to scoop some brown sugar and the handle started bending . I was very disappointed in how flimsy the handles are . I think I 'll stick to my plastic ones from OXO , I had better luck with them .	-1
What can I say about these measuring cups ? Well , for one thing , I think the design is overkill . They are very well made , but I 'm only measuring something here , not eating out of them . Also , there are not enough of them . Missing lots of increments . The next is the handle - okay on the plastic but you 've put enough effort in to have made them all little saucepans . Does anyone need that in a measuring cup ? These are not the measuring cup a true cook would want due to the lack of increments . Maybe you can make the saucepans first , then these ?	-1
As previous reviewers have already noted , the handles are not strong enough and they bend easily when scooping out brown sugar or even flour . While you can bend them back , it 's still an annoyance and makes these unacceptable . The basic idea is great , since there are times when you need measuring cups that will scoop ( unlike glass Pyrex measuring cups that are better for ingredients that you pour ) . However , since these do not really do the job , look elswhere . All Clad and MIU France ( made in China , in spite of the name ) make similar measuring cups and they receive positive reviews .	-1
I must have missed the oversized part in the description , but these are crazy big . Maybe my petite Asian hands are at fault , but I can hardly hold these monsters let alone imagine cooking with them . Even my pots are too small to hold them . I 've since bought the Joseph Joseph Elevate Carousel Set and those utensils are normal sized and great to use . ( Note : my hubby said they were fine but agreed we would need bigger pots . The quality seemed fine . )	-1
This utensil is too long , thick and bulky . The tines are too thick to adequately grab thinner foods such as bacon . Disappointing .	-1
I do n't really like it must because my children finds it bulky to use and thus we have not used it anymore .	-1
This is awkward . It is sturdy and easy to grip , like all OXO products , but it does n't fit into a utensil pitcher well . It is hard to get out of drawers because of the size and the shape of the handle . I rarely use it and that surprised me because normally I 'm a pretty big fan of this company 's products .	-1
It seemed ok until I put it in the dish washer . The first time I washed it , it came out with a huge rusted area right in the center . That tells me this is very low quality stainless steel . Will not be buying any more oxo stainless utensils .	-1
I purchased this BonJour frother to replace my old AeroLatte frother . The difference between the two brands is startling ! The BonJour frothing tip is a solid wavy metal tip which actually OVER-froths the milk . This causes the bubbles to keep breaking down . I can only achieve a very thin layer of foam and it wo n't last long . On the othe hand , the Aerolatte frothers ( also widely available with several models on Amazon ) uses more of an open-metal mesh tip on their wand which must be responsible for how thick and dense a foam it will create . I 'm buying another Aerolatte and will use the BonJour wand for things that do n't need thick foam ( like mixing salad dressing ) .	-1
I absolutely hate this can opener . We gave it a long , long trial and a lot of forgiveness , but in four years of ownership it has ALWAYS required two or three trips around the lip to actually cut all the way around . Nowadays it never cuts all the way around , even with six+ times around . I used to own a Pampered Chef can opener that cut all the way through on the first trip then lifted it right off . Wow , I must have been spoiled . Perhaps the folks rating this thing five stars feel OKI about it taking so long , but if you 've ever had a good one , this thing is garbage . I 'm sorry to leave such a bad review , but enough is enough ; now i 'm off to order one that does n't suck ... Kuhn Rikon , you 're fired .	-1
The pressure cooker cooks very well and is whisper quiet . My complaint ? For $ 178.00 I would expect a pressure cooker to last longer than 4 years of minimal usage ! I did n't use it every day . I used it once in awhile and the other day I took it out of my cabinet and the metal disc going around the pressure indicator had fallen off and the plastic was cracked ! I 'm really annoyed ! The company is oh , in SWITZERLAND ? ! how does one get it fixed ? I wo n't be buying another one again . I 'll stick with the US from now on .	-1
I am shocked at how much my boyfriend spent on this pot ! This pressure cooker is beautiful and really REALLY heavily built yet the user 's manual says this cooker is not dishwasher safe ! Not even any part of it ! I find it hard to trust this Kuhn Rikon pot with steam under pressure when it ca n't be washed in the dishwasher ! My mothers old Presto pressure cooker was always washed in the dishwasher , and my daughter , who is still using it to cook for her family , is dishwashing it nearly daily to this day . I 'm going to ask my boyfriend to send this Kuhn Rikon back and buy a Presto pressure cooker . He 'll spend a fraction of the money and get a multi-generational classic . Maybe the Kuhn Rikon is just a level of `` fancy '' above my interest .	-1
I relied on this pressure cooker to prepare most of my food for years , but around year 5 the handle began to fall off as an internal plastic component wore out . The handle can be replaced , but like the silicone valve I also needed to replace , it is only available from a couple of small specialty retailers at a high price . I 've had other pots whose handles came loose , but that was decades after they were purchased for less than $ 10 . Kuhn Rikon 's pressure cooker design might outclass its inept competitors , but its construction quality is nothing special .	-1
I was hoping that this would be more substantial . If you need this type of whip you may find it acceptable at its $ 10 , or so , price point .	-1
I bought this so that I would n't have to buy the stores Stale Fried , taco shells . But since most of the tortillas either break right down the middle and fall off of this baker , or the get REALLY HARD . I would n't recommend it to anyone at this point .	-1
We followed directions exactly ( preheated corn tortillas in microwave with damp paper towels ) , but all the tortillas remained almost flat and unfoldable and when we tried to put them on the racks they just slided off ! ! We tried bending tortillas , but they only broke . We tried spraying tortillas with butter spray , but that made it worse.I was going to buy a steamer , but seemed expensive just for tortillas . Then I googled how to steam tortillas . Easiest method THAT WORKS is to put slightly damp paper towel on plate , add stack tortillas then put another damp towel on top . THEN put ANOTHER same size plate upside down over all . Microwave 45 sec to 1 min and NICE SOFT TORTILLAS that DO LAY OVER the racks . I have n't tried cooking them yet , but at least there is now a chance this may work .	-1
I wanted to cook my tacos without using grease so I got this to cook them in the convection oven . The problem is that the tacos either break when I fold them over or they slide off onto the bottom of the oven . If I were to use this to hold my tacos as intended after cooking it might be alright but I think I would prefer a wire rack so the grease would run off .	-1
This product arrived with shipping damage , but I elected to return it for a refund rather than a replacement.It is n't as thick and substantial as I had hoped . I needed a sheet for baking cookies , and I ended up going to a local restaurant supply store and buying an eight dollar aluminum `` half sheet pan '' that makes beautiful cookies .	-1
With some products , you get what you pay for , and this is one of them.I think Wilton is overcharging at $ 12.This sheet is worth about $ 1.50.The edges are not finished , and so are unnecessarily and dangerously sharp.Not a good quality in something you have to handle a lot.I think this is where they got the price down to $ 12.The coloring is too light ; a good cookie sheet needs a perfectly balanced finish color , dark enough to brown cookies , light enough to not scorch them , not too light so as to not provide any color to edges and bottoms.It 's heavy , but that does n't mean it 's good ; that just means it 's heavy.It 's not usable at this weight for this size.Save your money and your time , and get a decent cookie sheet at double the price.It will make every cookie experience a joy , instead of a headache and a guessing and hoping game .	-1
The design does not protect rendered fat from the heat of the broiler which spatters the fat all over the oven and often starts it afire . Putting water in the bottom of the pan helps but the pan is so shallow the water soon evaporates.However , it works well for roasting .	-1
One of the best parts about this ( and actually draws some fire from other reviewers ) is that it 's plastic , which means no meniscus when measuring water . It 's actually easier than a glass measure because of that.There is , unfortunately , a downside . It does n't matter how easy it is to measure when it 's not accurate . Because it IS so inaccurate , this piece is almost worthless for being more than a decoration.It 's a 6-star concept . With so many possible ways to measure this thing could have been awesome , but the practical realization falls far short .	-1
I bought two of these and they both met the same fate : a small crack in the bottom that rendered them useless . At this price I expected a little more . They did n't last more than a few months .	-1
So much hype about the name that the product I received was disappointing . Made in china with cracks in many places . I will search out a german proofing basket that has the quality I am looking forward . Not a fan .	-1
I have been a fan of Breadman machines for at least 10 years now.So my existing Breadman Ultimate was starting to get pretty old . I figured I 'd treat myself to a new one . Same buttons , same model number etc . Identical.Bought one at a local store . Hmm ... . it burned everything on the sides . And this was using Breadman 's own recipes , as well as some of my own . Exchanged it . Same thing . I tried making the crust as light as possible , and even using a custom program to reduce the baking time . This just was not right.So I just got my third one today , this time from Amazon.com . This one seems OK , thank goodness.Anyway , I wish I could give the product 5 stars because when they work right they are fantastic.But having two defective machines in a row is unacceptable . Therefore , for now , it only gets two stars . If I have any trouble at all with this third Breadman , I will be switching to the Panasonic bread machine instead .	-1
Bought it brand new . Tried 2 of their recipes , one Krusteaz bread machine mix , two of my own recipes . None turned out right . This was my 4th bread machine , wore out the previous 3 , so have lots of experience with bread machines , this one was the worst I ever had . Contacted the company , did n't get much help , just kept saying do a dough ball test , I explained that I had never had to do one before , in years and years of using bread machines . Just too much trouble ... so , got myself a Zojirushi , even though lots more money it works like a champ ... first time , every time , right out of the box !	-1
I am an experience bread machine user having owned several bread machines over the past 25 years . My TR2200 Breadman Ultimate died last week . I do have a spare one for backup use.I decided to buy a new machine to accompany my spare one . I bought the TR2500BC Stainless steel . WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK ! It is cheaply made , noisy , the pan is much smaller than the original machines and the paddle sticks in the baked loaf of bread even when sprayed with cooking spray.I have made 3 loaves of bread using my original recipes and one that came with the machine . They are mis-shaped , under baked with a doughy texture and heavy as lead . I am returning this piece of junk to Target tomorrow.I am so sorry they discontinued the TR2200 machine , it was a real work horse . I loved it so much I bought my 2 daughters each one and recommended it to my 3 Aunts who purchased them . Now I am not sure what to purchase . I dread experimenting with different brands of machines only to be disappointed again.Sorry but I can not give the TR2500BC a favorable rating . I would not recommend this to anyone.A very unhappy customer .	-1
unless you eat hamburgers as your main meat entree , save your money . After cooking a magnificent rib eye steak ( aka `` delmonico '' ) .which I rub with myfavorite White Swan soy sauce ( arguably the best in the world ) a trace of garlic , I subjected the steak to 7 minutes of this highlytouted cooker for a rare finish , I swore off this `` champ '' as thesteak ended up almost tasteless . Due to circumstances , I . no longer haveaccess to a regular charcoal or gas grill . I returned to a `` lodge '' brand cast iron `` griling pan ( ribbed botton ) which approximated the BBQ grill taste by burning stripes in the meat . a mess to season andclean but the food becomes tasty , unlike the `` champ 's ' results . salmon filet and chicken breast suffered the same fate as my steak .	-1
I 've had about 4 of these type of grills , a few of them George Foreman . All were annoying to some degree . This one has some positives although more negatives , unfortunately.Positives : *Cheap ~ ( IF you find it below twenty five bucks , preferrably a sale below twenty or you 'll feel ripped off ... ) *Light ~ For those who ca n't lift the bigger more burdensome ones the weight is good*Small ~ For easy storage although small was n't always a positive..*Chicken and Fish ~ that 's all I use it for as I do n't cook much red meat and it seemed to cook nicely and evenly from both frozen and thawedNegatives : *Cheap ~ Cheaply made , cheaply and poorly designed , rickety*Non-removable grill plates ~ ALWAYS a pain in the butt , even on a small one such as this . ( I 'd like to leave it to cool , come back in awhile and just dip them in a little soapy water for a quick wash. ) Who wants to have to paper towel these things as that does n't get all the grease so I result to soapy paper towels or soapy sponge , trying to rinse with the sprayer from a distance so it does n't get into the electronics , paper toweling again to dry ... PAIN IN THE BUTTINSKI ! ! I 'll mention I 'm a germ freak and will NOT use it with residue . No , no , no . That makes it stink anyway when preheating ... ! *Small - too small . Even if you are cooking for one it 's not big enough for meat and veggies ... well..barely..but I 'm always cooking for 2 and it 's not working ... how many times did I have to try and towel it off while hot for what was left to cook of the small meal.. ? Annoying . *TOO Slanted ~ Ugh this was a problem . My frozen items slid off frozen , slid off thawed , slid off half cooked , slid off while I was arranging them to cook , slip..sliding ... slithering ... and many times right into the muck in the muck dish . Pointless . *Non-stick surface ~ does n't last and who knows what it 's doing to you after you eat it which you will as you never notice that first few tiny chips ... Save your money for one with removable plates that has a good reputation or you 'll find yourself storing it and cursing yourself for the waste of money.That 's my opinion and I 'm stickin ' to it .	-1
We 've gone through two of these percolators in the past year . Each worked very well for a few months , and then problems with the heating element started . On the first unit , the element failed completely after six months , and on the second unit the failure was gradual and insidious . Our coffee gradually became weaker and cooler over a couple of months until one day I realized the pot was not heating the water properly.I note that the price is higher now that what we paid . Too many warranty claims Faberware ?	-1
When i researched ( apparently not well enough ) , and got this 2-4 cup Farberware perc , i could n't have been happier ... after using a mr coffee , this coffee was HOT , and delicious and did n't take long ... .a couple months ago , it blew the GFI plug , and i thought it was someone else 's a/c or something ... well , it did it three days in a row this week ... .it no longer works , cuts off before it 's done , blows the circuit and therefore , brown water ... i 'm so disappointed ... and now , 20-20 hindsight , i 'm reading the one star and two star reviews and see that this is a common element ( no pun intended ) ..amazon , stop selling this piece of crap , please ... i love to order everything from you , and always look to amazon first , but this is such a widespread issue with farberware , you should give them the boot..thanks	-1
This percolator makes really great , rich , hot coffee ... .and in about four minutes ! ! That 's the good news.The bad news is I have owned two of them in the past year and a half ... as they die in about eight or nine months . RIP , Farberware .	-1
To be honest , I do not own this specific model . My review is about what looked like and was sold as the exact same pot a few years ago . Correction , the three pots I bought a few years ago.When three pots failed ( coffee not hot , electic sparks , heating element went ) I did a little research . I do not have all the detail handy anymore , but I remember , the origial Farberware company was a privately held company located in the Bronx , NY . The original owners chose to sell the company instead of giving in to the landlord ; do not believe it was a product or employee issue.I believe licensing / ownership of the brand name changed a number of times . Today it is owned by Lifetime Brands , Inc. , and the Meyer Co. holds the license to market products under the Farberware brand name . I think I got all this right ; who owns and who licenses the right to market products under a brand name gets complicated.Serve it to say , the Farberware brand our mothers knew and loved is not the brand you see on the shelves today . It 's a darn shame . That pot made the best cup of cofee you could get , and it was HOT ! P.S . I purchased and had to replace/ eventually return the Presto Percolator I purchased at WalMart as well . I no longer trust electronics sold by WalMart as I do not believe they meet the same spes as a similar looking models sold in department stores . I might be wrong , but too many returns to trust further.An interesting read : Go here for some history on ownership of the Farberware brand-name : [ ... ]	-1
Now the maker stops prematurely , leaving the coffee weak . I 'm having trouble finding parts to fix it.Also the pour hole is too high . Sometimes it 's hard to get the coffee to pour out ... almost like the air needs a way in . So you have to tilt it a lot . When you return it to the counter , coffee goes through the grounds again .	-1
This Farberware FCP280 8-Cup Percolator worked great initially , for abut a year . Then the temperature of the coffee started getting lower . Over a relatively short period of time , a matter of months , the temperature dropped so low that the coffee was no longer fully brewed.I bought another one , but had the same experience.I then bought a Pr***o coffee percolator , and it is still performing just like new several years later ! I definitely do not recommend this Farberware FCP280 8-Cup Percolator !	-1
PERC 'S GREAT ... ( BUT ) ... IT BOILS ALL OVER THE COUNTER AND HARDLY NO COFFEE IS LEFT IN POT ... SHAME ON U FARBERWARE ! ! !	-1
I 've used these percolators in the past and they are simple to use and convenient . The only thing that remains to be seen is how long this one will last as this product is now made in China.Update : After about a year and a half this product conked out . The previous pot I had was made in America and lasted close to 20 years . It seems that Farberware for the sake of profits has foregone quality control .	-1
It seems I go through these things like I drink coffee . Everytime I buy one it shortly & quot ; burns out & quot ; . My last one , a 4 cup lasted about 3 weeks . I was so happy to have a new one but was quickly saddened when it went poof , made a fire , shorted out my circuit breaker AND scared the crap out of me ! I will now look for a stove top model . It seems the design of it is too open to getting the plug outlet wet . The slighest drop of water will blow it up . The cord that comes with it is also very & quot ; cheap & quot ; and I have gone through many of those also .	-1
The first time I washed the dial , all the printing came off ! I have to take the user manual out what I use it to be sure that I have the dial at the proper setting . I should have returned it right away and gotten my money back , but I just did n't get around to it .	-1
follow instruction 100 % , waited for one week . Not working at all , tried again many times and still same result . Save your money for food better . Do n't make the same mistake like I did .	-1
I do not like this sifter at all because it starts out sifting while using the spring action handle and then it stops sifting after a few pulls and you end up having to shake the sifter to get the flour out . Now I see why it 's up as a clearance item . Do n't waste your money if you are buying it for its intended purpose . You might get by with doing a cup , but no way will it do more without shaking it and hitting it against your other hand . This one was a let down . I ended up ordering the hand cranking kind because I know they work pretty good .	-1
I bought this wire style Wok ring because we have a high end restaurant quality gas range with 18,000 BTU burners , and the more typical sheet metal Wok Rings get red hot and deform when cooking at high temps with our various Woks . This ring looked in the photo to be what we were looking for and Joyce Chen stuff tends to make good products , but on receiving it were disappointed to discover that the ring was poorly made and was also much shorter in height than other Wok rings . I assumed based on the selling price that this would be a high quality product , but instead the wire was not spot welded at the joint and did n't match up to the other end making the ring not sit flat so it wobbled when placed on the stove grate.In the end we returned this to Amazon for a refund and bought a much higher quality wire Wok ring from The Wok Shop in San Francisco for only $ 2.95 plus shipping ! ( Just type the name of the shop into Google for a link ) So ... Save you money on this junk and buy what we ended up buying instead !	-1
The cookie sheet came in unwrapped with some other items I ordered stacked on top of it ! The cookie sheet was scratched all over ! The sticker on the cookie sheet says `` made in England '' , not Germany . No cook book !	-1
After reading the numerous glowing reviews , I bought two of these as a Gold Box item for $ 10 each . If they had performed as billed , it would have been a good deal . Unfortunately , these pans are worth a few dollars at most.The pans are billed as nonstick . They are indeed coated with something , but it does not noticeably reduce sticking . Everything I 've cooked so far ( biscuits , cookies , hot dogs , fries ) has stuck like glue . A $ 1.99 aluminum pan I got at the supermarket releases better than this thing.The pans are billed as being insulated . But the design is ineffective . Everything I 've cooked so far has browned excessively on the bottom . I have tried Airbake pans ( plain , not coated ; I 'd still be using them except the oven I have now is too small for them ) , and found that they really did work in preventing overbrowning . They make a nonstick pan in the same size as this one : AirBake by WearEver Nonstick 14 by 16-Inch Large Baking SheetOr go for the uncoated pan : AirBake by WearEver Ultra Large Baking Sheet , 14 x 16It releases better than Kaiser 's nonstick , you do n't have to worry about scratching it , and it actually protects the bottom of what you 're cooking.The Kaisers are billed as warp-proof . This definitely is n't true . I opened my oven to find the pan skewed out of flat by about 2.5 inches . ( See the picture of this above ! ) My Airbake did warp , but not to this degree.In short , I would highly recommend against this pan .	-1
Mine has never worked properly -- it took a while before I noticed , but the way the probe is plugged into the unit ( not the meat side , the machine side ) affects the temperature reading . Wiggle the wire slightly and you have an entirely different temperature.From reading other reviews , it sounds like mine is worse than most - but there 's something wrong with the design and manufacture of the probe if these kind of problems arise .	-1
This timer is just a little more complicated than it needs to be . But my main complaint is that it uses a hard-to-find button battery that in my experience does n't last particularly long.I 'd recommend one of the timers here on Amazon that use AAA or AA batteries . They last longer and when you need a new battery , it is cheap and readily available.That said , if you need a timer that can time 4 different things , there are n't a lot of other options out there .	-1
I had high hopes for this popper . I read other reviews about the stirring bar getting jammed so I bent mine up just a hair and did n't have too many issues with that . It does n't pop all ( or enough ) of the kernels before starting to overcook the ones already popped . So you end up with a bunch of unpopped kernels in your bowl.Another issue I had with it is melting the butter . The corn is fully popped before the butter begins to melt . Some suggested putting the butter in the top and running it before putting the kernels in , but that is such a messy way because you have to remove the lid holding the melted butter in order to add the kernels . I just melted my butter in the microwave then poured it in the drip cup area after the kernels started to pop.It 's such a mess to clean up too . I rarely use it because of all these issues . I would not recommend it to a friend .	-1
I purchased this because I LOVE air popcorn and quit eating microwave a few years ago . I read many of the reviews about how to make great popcorn and adjustments in the arm . First , you may need to adjust the arm . The whole thing is cheaply made . Even after reading all these great reviews and strategies for using this.I liked the idea of having popcorn made and just flipping it and using the lid as the bowl.I have two types of popcorn and tried both with recommended oil . Both left many kernels in the bottom . I went and bought premium popcorn , which did better . But this take awhile to make and you have to watch it carefully . There are still a few kernels in the bottom even with premium popcorn.I have an air popper that shoot it out and I think that one is so much better than this . It makes it quickly ( faster ) and I am not as afraid of fires and with this one.Final analysis : Does not pop as fast as air poppers such as presto poplite.Most generic or store popcorn does n't pop well ( you have to buy premium ) .Having oil in it and having the popcorn directly on the base makes it dangerous.Popcorn does not taste as good ( even the good stuff ) .I should not have to read through a pile of reviewer comments to figure out how to use an air popper . What a waste of time !	-1
I make popcorn almost every night , and got tired of microwave popcorn , so I bought this hoping to save a little money in the long run . It makes good popcorn and almost every kernel pops ... that 's the good part . The bad part is the clear plastic dome is soooo flimsy that only after 11 months of use it has cracks all over it . It obviously either ca n't stand the heat from popping , or it hates my dishwasher . Not sure which of the 2 caused it , but it 's pretty much a hot mess . I can still use it because it has n't cracked all the way in half yet , but I feel for $ 30 the dang thing should last longer than one year .	-1
We bought a Stir Crazy Popcorn Popper over 15 years ago . It worked great and made great tasting popcorn . It finally gave out and started to leak oil from the motor . Because of the long and good performance of our old popper , there was no question what we were going to purchase to replace it . So we bought a new stir crazy . BIG MISTAKE ! It is a cheap piece of junk . It squeaks and creeks when the motor turns . The quality of materials and workmanship is noticeably less . Worst of all the popcorn does n't taste half as good . I never stopped being a loyal customer , West Bend stopped being a trustworthy manufacture . I 'm going back to popping corn the old fashion way , on the stove . Do n't waste your money on this thing , they have cut way too many corners .	-1
i never made popcorn because within 30 seconds of turning it on the whole kitchen stunk like the smell that comes from burning a teflon coated empty pan ! i immediatly unplugged it and put it outside , and felt sick for hours ! dont even think of buying it unless you want to poison yourself ! im not certain but i believe it has some nonstick coating . either way im certain it stunk of chemicals and certain it made me illFYI : '' Conventional non-stick cookware is achieved through a coating of PTFE ( PolyTetraFluoroEthylene ) , a synthetic substance that has waxy properties . At very high temperatures , PTFE begins to decompose and release fumes which are documented to be lethal to birds and small pets , and which can be harmful to humans . In addition , traditional pans incorporating PTFE are manufactured with the aid of PFOA ( PerFluoroOctanoic Acid ) , which the EPA has classified as a 'persistent pollutant of the environment ' '' i hope amazon boycotts this product from being sold on its website !	-1
I bought this popper based on recommendation of a popcorn fanatic friend who owns the same model . Reading the amazon reviews I knew to watch and make sure the stirring rods did not scrape the bottom out of the box . Easy , right ? Well , following the directions I added the cup of corn and recommended oil to the bottom . The motor was so weak that the stirring rods could not stir the popcorn . I gently wiggled the bottom using the handles hoping to keep the kernels from burning and the handle came off in my hand . Without the handle , it was nearly impossible to flip over the popped corn into the cover/bowl . We had many unpopped kernels . Our friends were mystified as to how we ended up with such a lousy machine , as they use theirs 2-3 times a week and it works perfectly.I can not recommend this machine unless you have an easy way of exchanging it for one that works properly . Personally I have better things to do with my time , so I 'm switching to a hand-crank stovetop model .	-1
It seemed to work , but little to no popcorn popped . I tried multiple times , all with the same result . It must not have gotten hot enough ? I had one like this in college and I loved it , the whole bowl filled up but I think it was a Hamilton Beach . But Amazon was great as usual and the return was easy !	-1
We were given this popper as a gift and maybe it was just an off day at the factory , but the popcorn is wretched . It does n't fully pop -- maybe it does n't get hot enough ? -- so the popcorn is small and has hard kernels . I have to throw out half the batch because I 'm afraid of breaking a tooth . I wish it worked better because cleanup is a breeze , but so far I have n't found anything that beats old-fashioned popcorn made in a pot on the stove .	-1
I recently purchased a new Stir Crazy to replace one that had given up the ghost after years of faithful service . Unfortunately , I wish I had the old one back ! The new Stir Crazy is flimsy , the stirring rod continually hangs up on the popcorn kernels , and the rod has already worn off the non-stick surface of the base . The Stir Crazy idea is just fine ... I only wish they had n't been such cheapskates and lowered the quality .	-1
The humidity buildup in this thing is way out of proportion . I tried less oil , i melted the butter in the microwave instead of on top , but the only thing that would work is simply not using it.Who wants popcorn that sticks to your teeth ? it 's disgusting ! If you want crisp delicious popcorn , stick with a pot and a splatter shield . it works way better than this thing , anyday .	-1
My last two West Bend Stir Crazy popcorn poppers lasted 3 years or more while this one lasted less than 3 months . Guess its like everything else they do n't make them like they used to . I bought a Orville unit at K**L 's when it was on sale and its been working great for almost a year now .	-1
As someone who owned one of these myself , I can confirm the design flaws : * Teflon was used instead of a more durable surface* the stirring rod is metal instead of a non-stick surface utensil* the stirring rod automatically rotates across and - yes - against the Teflon surface , with minimal options available for adjustment . Thus , you can not prevent the rod from scraping off the Teflon surface after repeated use.It 's dumb.I bought mine from a local retail outlet . When the Teflon surface quickly started flaking off , I took advantage of the manufacturer 's warranty replacement . Unfortunately their only redress was : they shipped me a brand new unit of the same flawed design.Sad .	-1
These are now made in China so the quality of the materials is like there baby formula not so good.The first one of these I owned lasted for three years , and the second one six months.The last one I purchased lasted a week.We have actually moved away from purchasing this Item all together .	-1
Bought this to replace my old one that I 'd had for several years now.Either my popcorn is not good or the popper is not working well . So far I have yet to pop a nice batch of corn.My other one popped very well , so I want to give this one a good try , but I have used it 6 times now and have yet to get a bowl full of nice popped corn ! I am very sad about this , may have to return it for a new one , maybe this one is faulty.Want to try different corn in it first to see how that works .	-1
I used a number of recent suggestions on this thread for oil , popping etc . I followed the manual directions exactly.I used Orville premium gourmet corn.I much prefer Popsecret Homestyle.This is so much trouble , and produces nothing I admire in popcorn ... neither did Whirley Pop , which I also tried . I found the corn chewy and not crunchy at every level .	-1
If you do n't mind replacing this machine frequently , then you will probably like the popcorn it produces . Our first lasted about a year , before an internal part popped off and could n't be repaired . In good faith , we bought another , but it lasted less than 6 months , before we the heating element began to fail , producing lots of under-popped corn . Would be great if they could just make them last longer ! We 're going to get a Whirley-Pop to use on a new gas stove !	-1
I trusted this name brand and good reviews and got this unit , less than 6 months and the faucet assembly is leaking from 2 places . emailed customer support and got no answer in a week.Called them after a week and they said yes we are still behind on email from holidays , I have no idea which holidays they are talking about . the lady was very rude and said that yes probably the faucet is crackled or a washer is missing and I have to buy a faucet assembly from them and pay for it . I used this urn for 3 months or less before the problem started and the unit is still under warranty.she was very unhelpful and condescending . very unprofessional.If I wanted a water urn for 3 months I could have bought the 25 $ urn sold at the dollar store and save my self 100 $ and the pain.P.S . inside my urn has turned really black and no matter how I clean it does not go away , vinegar did n't do the trick as recommended in the manual.P.S.S if you really want your water hot go with something else this keeps it warm but not hot.Update : Westbend offered to send me the faucet part at no charge after a second call , hopefully that will fix it.Note : if you use this just for water the metal parts should still stay inside or the water wont heat correctly and your device might burn out .	-1
I bought this brand kettle a few years ago , it was a top notch kettle with a pleasing whistle.I was boiling some water for tea and I guess I went outside and did n't hear the whistle.The heat on an empty kettle of any kind will warp in that situation.I still used it but we bought a new electric stove , and were told a pots had to be in good order to work properly.It should n't be a problem as Amazon still offer the same kettle.Not so , it is not really the same one , though it looks the same ( sort of ) .They made everything a little cheaper , the kettle whistles , but boils over and by the time you get to it there is boiling water spilling on the stove top.The rest of the kettle just seems more Chinese than the original.Why would they replace the kettle spout since the older model was working ? I 'm using the old one now , the new one is with some of the other Chinese junk , I have bought , bound for Goodwill or recycling center.I suppose one has to go to Viking or some other high end store to get something good .	-1
I bought this kettle in September of 2009 , so I 've had it for about 1 1/2 years ... not veryt long for an expensive tea kettle.Today I flipped up the whistle and the whistle `` innards '' flew all about . There are two tiny parts , a screw and a spring , both rusted out , which could easily have gone unnoticed back into the teakettle and have been a choking hazard . As it is there is no way to reinstall the whistle part and I 'm lucky I found the spring , tenuously hanging from the spout cover , before it dropped back into the pot.Beautiful to look at , but it should n't have failed in this way and so soon after purchase .	-1
I purchased this item at TJ max -- for 2x time amount it is for sale on amazon . It says dishwasher safe in the manual and on the storage container it comes with . So I washed it before use and it is not dishwasher safe . I will be returning it tomorrow .	-1
I just chimed in to add a one-star rating . The product is flimsy , a pain to change blades ( & they pop out anyway ) , and lost sharpness after 2 or 3 uses . Everything now gets stuck under the blade halfway thru a slice . This thing is landfill fodder .	-1
This mandoline received top ratings from Cooks Illustrated , which ranked it above the more expensive budget ones like the Borner , so I bought it in spite of my skepticism . At an old-fashioned department store , it was a bit less than the price here.The safety guard does not grip vegetables adequately -- - the spikes are too short to hold the vegetable . Even if you could grip , the vegetable must be oriented perpedicular to the slicer , which limits the types of slices . When I did use it ( without the guard since it did n't work ) , the carrot slices were uneven and looked more torn apart than cut . The julienne function did not fully separate the julienne into separate pieces , so you had to intervene by hand afterwards . The gripper sometimes worked on a sweet potato since it 's softer than a carrot , and the slices of the sweet potato were more even , but I still had to push too hard to feel like it was entirely safe . The plastic also stained yellow from the carrot juice despite being washed immediately afterwards . I 'm going to return it because it 's too much of a safety hazard due to the dull blade and lack of safety guard , since I mostly wanted it for carrots . If you are looking solely to cut potatoes , it may be okay .	-1
Good tool if you are trying to decide if you want to buy a real one . The blades are sharp enough but the spacers fall out pretty easy . You ca n't do waffle fries with it 's attatchments , which was my whole reason for oredering this . Worth this price .	-1
After having some difficulty peeling a clove which it never really did a good job , i have come to the conclusion that bashing the clove with a large knife or cleaver or a chop and bash tool is better and faster than this method . The peeler is a bit too large in circumference and did a poor job when i tried it . The amount of rolling the clove took was excessive and it took longer than it would have had i just bashed it . That is probably the reason that professional chefs dont use a device like this and just go for the speed and simplicity of the knife bash . If you want to spend the day rolling cloves then buy this but i would not recommend it as a serious device and technique .	-1
This item is a joke . It does not work very well . Use a knife blade flat on a garlic clove and hit the blade with you hand . This technique works better than anything . Watch any chef peel garlic and that is what they do . You will never see a chef use this useless device . Save your money	-1
I do n't know why anyone would need this . Does n't do what it 's designed to well enough to justify its drawer space.Pros : - It does work , though not with the miraculous ease other reviewers suggest- prevents garlic smelling hands ( though you 'd probably end up having to touch the garlic to chop it anyway , so garlicky hands are unavoidable to some extent ) - pretty easy to cleanCons : - Needs to use some force . The silicone is not very sticky ( a little slippery ) so unless you press a little hard nothing happens to the garlic skin- A pain to use for many cloves of garlic . Little papery garlic skins get stuck after a while and the roller loses what little stickiness it had to begin with . Then you need to clean and dry this thing out to continue using.- Much more time consuming than smashing the garlic with the flat side of a knife- Uni-function . Literally does not have a single other useful purpose in the kitchen . I 've tried to open jars with it ( does n't work , too slippery ) , use it as a potholder in a pinch ( rolls around , barely avoided a burn ) , and as a nonslip trivet ( too narrow )	-1
This currently resides unused in my junk drawer . I initially bought it to ease the pain of peeling garlic when I make 40 Clove Garlic Chicken . After 5 or 6 cloves , it 's a waste of time because you have to get the skins out and they seem to like it inside and wo n't just come out with a sharp rap on the counter . I have better results putting the cloves in a plastic container with a lid and shaking it vigorously or blanching the garlic and slipping the skins off . I 'm glad others find it useful .	-1
I should have listened..Great for straining pasta but hard to transfer into bowl . Cleaning is another story-gallons and gallons of water are used to clean and rinse-even then it 's not clean . Went back to old colander-too time consuming to use .	-1
Missing a rubber grip on one of the cups . Amazon 's order information tells me the name of the seller , but the seller says they were bought through amazon direct . Not sure about this so I have to send them back . Besides , if the rubber grip comes off one cup when the set is brand new I think that means trouble as time goes on . I wo n't order a replacement set from the same manufacturer - probably will go with a solid stainless steel set . The weight on this set is just ok .	-1
On the bottom of this cup it states that it is made of 18/10 stainless steel . I stored the cup in a moist area outside , but in an enclosed outdoor cabinet that was sheltered from rain , etc . After about 3 months of very infrequent use the cup started to rust . After 2 years of use the cup has rusted so much that it can no longer be used for any purpose . Cleaning it and trying to reuse it has been futile so I had to discard it.Btm line : this product is total waste of your $ , buy another product instead that is made of real ( i.e. , 304 or 316 ) stainless steel !	-1

America 's Test Kitchen is wrong . Extensive experimentation could not yield good rice results . Pasta this way is a joke . It works as an overpriced vegetable steamer.Put rice with less water in a bowl inside a pot with water in the bottom . Cover and steam . Forget the microwave .	-1
The instructions are no help , so it has been trial & error.I have not yet tried cooking rice , I hope it will go better than pasta.The instructions say to cover with water & cook as directed on pasta package . Well , it did n't even heat up in eight minutes . I tried again & again & wound up with farfalle which was still too hard.Next time , I tried boiling the water in the microwave , which took more than fifteen minutes in this cooker . Then I cooked the spaghetti eight minutes & it had not begun to cook . So I stirred & put it back four more minutes . Still far from al dente . But the water had boiled over into the microwave.Another four minutes & it was a little too hard , but I did not want to risk overcooking . Also , about a third of the spaghetti slipped through the basket & stuck to the bottom of the cooker.I would not recommend this unless you 're willing to put in a lot of time searching for the formula . Takes more time than just boiling pasta on the stove.It does look like a good container for taking to pot-lucks .	-1
Just about every russet potato I 've tried to cut on this thing has been too big . I 've had to cut the potato lengthwise or through its width ( and sometimes both ) in order to make it fit . This is ridiculous . This is a french fry cutter , and russet potatoes are the de facto king of french frying spuds . Simply put , this is a poorly conceived product to begin with.Furthermore , the build quality is cheap and flimsy . This will be fine for someone who makes french fries once a month , but for anyone else , it 's going to end up in the garbage soon . Too bad , cause the little 4 '' fries it does manage to put out are quite perfect aesthetically ( other than the length ) . I will be looking into one of the commercial quality cutters not sold on Amazon .	-1
It was way to hard to use , bought it a few months back and watched videos of how to use it and after all that , used it once .	-1
I bought this at another store and used it to cut 20 pounds of potatoes at once . We used this cutter exactly as described and the screen that cuts the potatoes was twisted and bent about 30 % of the way through our stack of spuds . It is going back tomorrow and I am investing in a restaurant quality machine .	-1
This product would have been perfect if it could have fit large sized potatoes . I had to cut all the potatoes smaller to fit in it . It worked well but I wouldnt have purchased it if I had known you could only use small potatoes .	-1
It works fine and comes with 2 blades but why in the living h3ll would you make it 4 '' capacity ? What If I want fries or veggies longer than 4 '' ? Why would you limit your customers to such a finite capacity ? Plus there are these little plastic halfmoon rail guides that leave 1.5 '' of empty space behind the pusher plate just unused . If I cut my potatoes in half I get 2-3 '' fries ... yay ... color me unimpressed . If I just cut them to fit the slicer I end up with .5-2 '' fry stubs left over on the counter . This is a horrible product that could have easily been a 5 star if they had made it 3 '' larger ( that 's including the 1.5 '' of wasted space it already has ) .	-1
The cutter is a good idea in theory and `` should '' work well . Mine failed on it 's third potatoe . The large fry cutter screen bent and fell apart leaving me with only the small cutter . I did not overload it or put to large of a potatoe in it . Now I cut potatoes using the small cutter no longer than 1 1/2 inches and no larger than about 40 % of the screen cutter area.Seems to work well that way .	-1
The blade bent on the very first use ! Very poorly made . I was only able to cut 2 potatoes . Do n't waste your money .	-1
It looks like it would work , it is easy to assemble and clean but it just does not do the job the majority of the time . I could only fit very small potatoes in it to begin with and even then it takes some man power to push it through . By the time I cut my zucchini down to size to fit in I might as well finish cutting it myself.Well it was inexpensive ... for the most part you get what you pay for .	-1
The basic engineering for this apple peeler/corer/slicer has been around for ages , providing thousands of hours of successful apple preparation worldwide . How could the manufacturer of the Progressive International fail in every regard ? The first use was flawed , with irregular coring and peeling , but still faster than hand-preparation . Very careful washing and drying still resulted in a rusty mess when I got it out to use it the second time . With the first apple , the coring arm snapped off the spring and the interlock lever fell to the ground . When I unscrewed the device to see what could be done , the rubber gasket fell off.I am mechanically inclined yet can not repair this . I know people who have had their apple peelers for more than a generation of succesful action and this is ready for the ( expensive ! ) scrap-heap in a few days .	-1
Not recommended . Just used twice . The material melts . Very messy . Do not buy ! The handle looks fine . When I first got it , I was excited . It works fine but the head melts .	-1
I have only had this for about two weeks . Never wash it in the dishwasher . It already has a large crack between two of the slots , extending to the top . There are better spatulas out there . Do n't bother with this one .	-1
It serves the purpose that it was designed for but a little flimsy for my taste .	-1
Cheap !	-1
Not the sturdiest splatter I was using expecting to get . Wish I would 've done a little more browsing before I settled on this one .	-1
this is a piece of crap sorry i wasted my money . will be trying a silicone one in the future . is not even worth one star which i could give it none or negative star for that matter , who came up with this idea ?	-1
Looks like it would be a great spoon in the picture , so between that and the reviews , I bought it . It is worse than the things I was hoping to replace . Not only that , some reviewer mentioned for one of the stainless steel models ( same spoon , just no nylon ) that it is a lunch lady 's spoon . The line is NOT . The scoop of the spoon is so tiny that it is useless . When you add the flimsiness to it , they 're worthless for cooking a huge potful of heavy eats .	-1

very dissapointed in this item , I was expecting a larger/longer utencil but it was similar to what you might find at the local Doller store.Not recommended for the price .	-1
No where in the description did it say the core was aluminum . I was under the impression it was all stainless steel . Would n't have bought it if I had been aware of that .	-1
I 'm sorry , I hate to say this but I 'm VERY disappointed with the quality of this knife . We wash and dry it immediately but it still gets rusty . It cuts very well - I 'll give it that , but the rust leaves a bad taste in my mouth ! Not a good quality knife .	-1
Contrary to the other reviewers , my experience has not been positive . It is impossible to keep this knife sharp . Purchased this knife and the next smaller knife . Bought the sharpener of the same brand . The sharpener apparently does not work.Used another sharpener and that also fails to sharpen the knives . Once dulled , the knives remain quite dull.The knives will not stay sharp and they do not sharpen well.Very disappointed . Would not have purchased had I known this beforehand.That is why I consider these knives not worth the money .	-1
I 've probably had this 200mm ( 8 '' ) 'Professional S ' knife for ten years , maybe more . It 's always given good service for our household use , and gotten ordinary good treatment ( including hand washing only , no machine ) . I sharpen it by hand , and it takes a fine edge and holds the edge reasonably well.So , imagine my surprise when I discovered a crack working its way across the blade , about a third of the way back from the tip , and now about half-way from edge to spine of the blade . Well , at least one other reviewer has talked about the tip falling off so they would n't be surprised . I never heard of such a thing , though.My grandfather 's kitchen knives still work just fine , and they must be at least 75 years old . I have other bladed tools that are even older . I know that nothing lasts forever , but I really expected a lot more from a brand with Henckels 's reputation . I mean , the reputation it used to have.This really seemed like a good knife . Now , it 's only a matter of time until a big chunk of the steel blade simply falls off . 5 stars for what the knife used to be , worst possible rating for this unbelievable failure.Incredible. -- wiredweird	-1
wanted to buy a high quality scissors for the kitchen but the finger holes were too small for the average man fingers . Had to return it .	-1
I bought this based on the reviews and was disappointed to find that it was extremely dull . I ca n't believe how dull it is after such good reviews . Do you all just happy with dull knives or did I just get a bad knife ? I bought an electric sharpener and may keep the knife if I get a good edge on it , but I should n't have to sharpen a brand new knife . I know this is n't as high quality as others in the Henckels line but I 'm tired of shopping and spending . I may return it for a better one.Update : This is a worthless knife . I 've tried sharpening it and it still has a hard time going through veggies ... it 's wider than most knives and I think alot of the resistance is due to the width of the blade . Bad knife , do n't buy . I do n't know why it has all the good reviews .	-1
Knife was no different than any other knife I could have bought anywhere . Blade was extremely dull . I will have to sharpen and see if it cuts any better than others . For now , I was not happy with the knife .	-1
Good sharp knife . It is a J.A . Henckels so you cant go wrong . The main problem with this one is that it is not the same quality stainless steal that is used in other more expensive knives made by the company . After leaving it overnight with some acidic food on it , it lost its shine . I tried cleaning it with baking soda and vinegar and that helped but it appears the surface `` faded off '' . A few days ago I left it in a pot with some water in it as I did not have a chance to do dishes yesterday . I cleaned it off and noticed some small rust spots that had developed just overnight.It may be a good knife but it should not be rusting like this . I have another chicago cutlerly bread knife which is 20 years old and I just throw that in the dishwasher when I 'm done with it . It has never rusted . Basically , spend $ 5.00 more and get a chicago cutlery knife or spend $ 15 or $ 20 more for something of better quality . This is no better than the cheap walmart $ 5.00 bread knives from china .	-1
Please be aware this is not a J.A . Henckels knife . It is a very cheap imitation and not worth a cent !	-1
I thought I was buying the same knives I already had ( lost a couple ) but apparently not.These are not very good at all.They pull/tear at the meat - there is no easy , clean cutting at all.The edges are packed with meat when you 're done and it has to be cleaned off by hand.Wish I had n't waited so long - I should have returned these . Waste of money.First time I 've ever been disappointed in a Henckels product in 35 years .	-1
These knives initially performed flawlessly , but after being washed a few times , they began to rust in the crevices on the handle ends . Maybe we just got a bad production run , but the stainless steel is beginning to turn into stainful steel . I 'm going to send these back and buy something a little more higher end . You get what you pay for .	-1
I was excited about this product and it seemed like such a good idea ! I love waffles , but hate the bulk of and inability to easily clean a waffle maker . So this seemed like a perfect compromise . But for me , it just did n't work . I used vegetable oil to grease the pan- not non stick spray since it seems to get `` gunky '' on non-stick surfaces , and then put my batter in . It scorched quite quickly , even though it was only on medium heat , and then they stuck to the pan when I tried to turn them over to cook the other side . Trying to turn them over was a bit awkward , too . I do n't know if my experience was different since we have an electric flat-surface range ? Perhaps cooking on a gas stove is different ? But I was not happy with how it cooked or the ease of use . I guess I 'll have to drag out the wafflemaker ...	-1
Its a novelty and we have only used it once , I actually think I like making the faces myself without the pan !	-1
This is unfortunately a bad imitation of the old German classic cakepan . It bent out of shape after being heated up with cheesecake baking and once I removed the ring , it would not fit the base again ... Terrible quality .	-1
We bought this and the first time we made a cheesecake and it turned out great . The 2nd one we mad was ruined because the bottom fell out . I think there was a suction formed to the bottom when we put the cake in a bath setting - ruined a very expensive cake for my mom . But we hope to have better luck next time , tho it did make me shy for trying it again .	-1
Purchased based on reviews . Went to make a pretty basic cheesecake on first use that required a water bath for cooking . While filling heard a pop and saw the telltale bubbles appear - ruined . Made second attempt and double checked all seals , same result . Will use for non-water bath applications , but it 's still very disappointing .	-1
After reading all the wonderful reviews , I bought it and tried to bake a flan in it . It leaks !	-1
Enough said . The cheesecake batter does n't leak out but water does , which means that water also enters the pan when using it in a pressure cooker to make cheesecake . The cheesecake turns out fine but the crust ends up being wet . I expected more from this brand even after reading previous reviews .	-1
The pan I received was okay but was not what I wanted . The pan pictured has smooth handles and the one I received has the & # 34 ; braided & # 34 ; texture handles and the edges of the pan are really sharp as another review noted . It is a lighter weight than the one with the smooth handles . I already had an original platinum bundt pan and this was not the same . Mine is the heavier one with smooth handles . I will wait and order what I want later . I gave the one I received as a gift to someone . Since the price was good and it could serve as a gift , I did n't go to the trouble of returning it . It is troubling that the product is misrepresented in the picture .	-1
Purchased at Bed , Bath and Beyond ( got a good discount that turned out not to be as good a deal as I would have gotten on Amazon ) . Normally , I purchase such items from Amazon . I am posting this review as an aid to fellow Amazon customers . Label over digital controls was off and would not stick on . Called Ronco customer service and could not get anyone to answer . Left message that was never returned . Returned unit to B , B , & B for another and had same problem . Used a special glue for film and foils that I purchased for five bucks to fix . Used unit about six times . It worked great . When I attempted to use for another time , one of the two skewers dislodged from the disk it was supposedly riveted onto . I have better things to to do with my time than attempting to contact RONCO and never getting through to them . Tossed unit in trash . I know a number of you out there reading this will think I am just a customer that did not use the unit correctly , or was unreasonably impatient . Wrong , I was very meticulous in using this unit and am a reasonably patient individual . RONCO quality and customer service are in need of major improvements . As for the good reviews of this product on Amazon , I am willing to guess that its inferior quality will ultimately materialize as this product is used more frequently ( just my opinion , take it for what you feel it is worth ) .	-1
I bought this oven from Ronco . The oven is cheap . It does cook a great chicken . It is hard to clean . The rotisserie can roll as you take it out and caused 3rd degree to both my wrist . The worst part is do not buy it from Ronco . They sell you name , address , and credit card number to scammers . I know because it happened to me . Buy it from anyone who will not give your credit card number to Ronco . Use pay pal or Google to purchase safely .	-1
I should have gotten together with the reviewer that said that the bottom never cooked because my top never cooked . So if we gerryrigged our machines we could have one perfect machine rather than two lousy machines . I got it at a great price but thank goodness I could return it because noone wants a raw top with an overcooked bottom . Love these Amazon ratings because at least I knew it was the product and not me .	-1
I just put this sheet in the trash . I had it for awhile but rarely used it . Maybe five times at most . Each time the coating would come off and as other stated , the sheet would rust even though I hand washed it . I tried soaking it since everything seems to stick to it during and after cooking . Tonight , I could not get the food off of the pan . I tried . I came on here looking for a replacement and this one came up in the search . Do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time . Off to find a better sheet for the future that will last longer .	-1
The coating does not last - extremely poor durability . I 've been very careful with this pan , using only wood or plastic utensils and washing by hand only . Did n't matter - within just a few uses , the coating flaked off and the edges on the underside are rusting . Waste of money !	-1
Like other reviewers , I have this product and it began flaking fairly soon . I do not wash it in the dishwasher , it is handwashed only . Once it begins flaking , it continues flaking pretty rapidly . Try another brand.UPDATE : April , 2008 . I 've been using the Duncan Hines branded nonstick toaster oven pan for about a year now and it has performed flawlessly . A much better choice .	-1
It is very small and , after only a few uses and care in cleaning , it is already staining . I do n't think that this one will be lasting long and I will be purchasing a different product when it inevitably becomes unusable .	-1
Handles bend where they are attached to the cups , dont waste your money I am currently looking for a better measuring cup set that will last	-1
Sure , they look nice and are much cheaper than other stainless steel measuring cups on the market . HOWEVER - there 's this blackish substance that rubs off on the inside of them . If you wipe them with a paper towel after use , it turns black . Everytime . I have no idea what it is , but it 's coming from the cup and it freaks me out . I threw them away .	-1
It does a good job of grinding the beans . We use a drip cone filter coffee maker and we set the grind to that setting . The grind is very fine and the grounds cling to everything - the cup , the spoon , and the lid of the grind catcher - making a mess when I open it up to pour the ground coffee into the coffee maker . I have n't been able to determine which settings match to the amount of ground coffee that I like to put into the coffee maker and the catcher is n't condusive to scooping the coffee out with a scoop.I guess I do n't have enough experience with all the different types of coffee grinders to give this a fair rating , but I do n't care for it - it 's going back - I gave it one star .	-1
This toaster is beautiful . The brushed metal obscures fingerprints yet it 's relatively easy to clean . It looked terrific on the counter.Unfortunately , that 's where the good part ends . DeLonghi is usually a reliable , high-quality maker , so the & quot ; bad & quot ; was surprising . The bread never gets crisp ; the crumb catcher is difficult to remove ; it 's as light as a feather , and feels & quot ; tinny , & quot ; even cheap . Mine broke within seven months of use , so it 's not very durable , nor worth its ridiculous price.If I had n't tossed my 30-year-old Astra -- which was still working fine -- I 'd have tossed this one and used the Astra instead . That 's what I get for letting myself be seduced by a pretty face .	-1
What I think this machine does fairly well is _small_ batches of french fries.It does not handle battered foods well , nor I have found it an acceptable replacement for stove-top deep frying of spring rolls and won ton.The thermostat is certainly handy , but I share another reviewer 's annoyance at how easily the basket falls off the mechanism ( it 's not like there 's a huge margin for error in deep-frying , and doing the `` Oh-my-goodness-how'm-I- gon na -get-that-thing-out '' dance while the food is getting darker and darker does not make me especially happy ) .I also do not find the oil drain easy to operate.So I 'm back to stove top methods for most deep frying . Take a heavy pan with tall , but not too tall sides ...	-1
I bought this a few years ago from Amazon . I used it once . In the cabinet it sits , just waiting to be thrown out.It does not work well at all . It is difficult to push the vegetables through . A large portion of them do not get cut up . It is a hassle to try to get this thing clean.What a nightmare ! Avoid this at all costs . I beg of you .	-1
Everything I have ever purchased with the Hoffritz name up until now has been great . Maybe this slicer is too , but being one who can not figure things out without directions , my many attempts to use it have been in vain . The enclosed brochure does n't help you much in placing the blades correctly , using the holding mechanism , and the little rack that holds the other blades is very flimsy with no directions on how to use it.I took a chance when buying it after reading the mixed reviews , but it was a Hoffritz and was on sale for a cheap price , so I took a chance . Since it only cost ... , it 's not worth spending the money returning . I 'll just use the metal bowl and lid . The rest I 'll ...	-1
I bought this for my 82 year old mother in law - thinking it would be easier than peeling potatoes and vegetables the 'old fashioned way ' . It is n't . If a person is losing the strength in their hands or wrists for ANY reason , this would not be the product to choose . Actually it is n't the product I thought it would be . It is well made , and has a nice stainless steel bowl ( the only part she uses ) .	-1
I have a japanese style slicer I have used for years and also 4 , yes , 4 different sizes Cuisinarts . I really like to cook . I was intrigued by the bowl feature and hopefully easy clean-up . The slicer arrived on a day I was making a composed salad . I could hardly get it out of the box in time . I found it very cumbersome in slicing the peppers , the prongs did n't quite work , and the peppers kept falling off . The tomatoes were smashed , the only vegetable that worked half way well , was the cucumbers . After resorting to my trusty chef 's knife , I found it impossible to remove the blade from the machine . I had to wait until my husband came home , and it took him awhile to man handle it to remove it . The next day I tried french fries that worked O.K. , but was a lot more difficult to get the potato thru than my old japanese cutter had ever been , and had the same replay with the blade . I 'm probably going to donate it to charity and maybe go for the real French high end number . Like I said , Greatly disappointed	-1
We received this mandoline as a Christmas gift , so we can not return it without risking hurt feelings . It is cheaply made , has few cutting options , and worst of all , the blades are extremely hard to remove , resulting in a badly cut finger ! Hoffritz is apparently out of business ( Salten has a license to sell some of their products , but not this one ) , and I can see why .	-1
I am not going to extoll the virtues of a mandoline . I have a couple and they are very useful . However , the Hoffritz product is poorly constructed.The most important elements of a mandoline are a sharp blade and firm , even cutting surface . The cutting blade used for this item can not be removed for sharpening and it is made of flimsy , cheap steel that could not be sharpened even if it were accessible.In addition , you need a firm surface so that you get even cuts as you push food through the blade . Again , the Hoffritz fails here . The slicing surface & quot ; bows & quot ; easily , making for uneven slices.You do n't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a good mandoline , but there are far better low cost options that this item .	-1
The sharpener is made from a split plastic mold . Mine split when I put pressure on it from extended use . I epoxied back together but I think the ceramic insert lost it 's availability to sharpen.I 've switched back to the old fashioned way using a whetstone .	-1
This is terrible . I 'll say that I 'm no professional , so I could be using it wrong . It 's pretty self explanatory though and does n't sharpen as well as I 'd hoped .	-1
I bought this machine for my husband for Christmas , based on Amazon 's customer reviews.At first , it seemed like a pretty good machine , even though it dripped badly ( despite the touted & quot ; no drip & quot ; feature ) . It is our first pump machine , so the ability to make lots of steamed milk was a big plus , even though we did n't think the coffee came out as well as our 10-year old bottom-of-the-line Krups.However , it started malfunctioning quickly . The sliding 'knob ' to control amount of coffee did not work . Sometimes only an ounce of coffee would come out , sometimes several ounces , no matter how it was set.Finally , hardly anything was coming out . I figured it was obstructed , and I started soaking the filter in vinegar overnight . This would work for a day or so , then no coffee again . We called the 800 number on the back of the machine , and they said to send it ( our responsibility to pay the postage ) to New York for repair.We use only filtered water in the machine , and there is no scale built up anywhere . The machine is 3 months old and looks new . IT JUST DOES N'T WORK . I will not be buying this kind of thing online anymore . It 's too messy and inconvenient to deal with problems . I 'm sticking with books and records .	-1
I REALLY DID HOPE THIS WOULD HAV BEEN A LITTLE THICKER THAN A SHEET OF PAPER ... TOTALLY WRONG . DONT BE CHEAP LIKE ME..	-1
I ordered one of this tea balls about 7 months ago and quality of product was perfect . Solid ring , fine uniform mesh , fine chain with nice hook . decided to order a few for my parents and O My God ! ! ! what a he.l happened to very good product . The tea ball I got was nothing like the one I got 7 months ago . Mesh has holes in it , chain has some cheap piece of metal at the end of it instead of fine hook . Stay away . This is not the product you want to use for making your tea .	-1
After making about five pots of tea , the hinge broke necessitating manual placement of the clamp . Shortly thereafter the chain broke . This is a bit of shoddy junk that should n't cost more than a buck ; at this price , a one star rating is in order .	-1
I 've used various tea strainers/infusers over the yrs , and this is by far the most flimsy . I have a similiar one ( not this brand ) that I 've had for over 5 yrs . This one looked just like the one I wanted to replace . But this one is much more cheaply made , and the 2 sections can not be secured tightly enough . I returned it .	-1
While I did n't have any leaf leakage , the moment I opened the ball , the latch fell off . It is attached by a tiny , misshapen dot of metal ( someone described it as about the size of pencil lead ) that shows no evidence of stopper or notch that might keep the latch in place upon it . I was able to finagle the latch back on enough to stay shut and be useful , but I do n't think I want to deal with this every time I want a cup of tea.My suggestion : do n't waste your time or money on this tea ball . Pay a few extra bucks for something trustworthy or hit up your local tea shop and make sure you 're getting a good product in person .	-1
Flimsy little piece of garbage . Does n't close completely , letting matter flow into liquid . Do n't buy this cheap little piece of garbage it 's not worth the clicking .	-1
Waited forever for this to arrive . What a mistake ordering from abroad ! First use was the last . The chain and anchor holding the ball ( to the pot or cup ) broke on the first use . Now I 'll have to find another locally . A waste of money and time .	-1
Had about two weeks and it broke . I attempted a fix and hope it works . For the price one can not expect much , but a few weeks of use ? Will not return ; not worth the effort considering the cost . Well , expected better .	-1
The product is good and workes o k . But the catch is easily opened when in use . Tea leaves are released in the water . You have to restrain the tea before using .	-1
Strainer is decently made for the price but it is difficultto mash a teaspoon of tea leaves into it . Since you can onlyfill one side of this strainer , it just does not have the capacityto handle larger dried tea leaves . If you crush the leaves up abit , the resulting smaller pieces slip thru both the mesh and theseam . May work for some but has not worked for me.Capt Tom	-1
CHEAP ... CHEAP ... CHEAP ! ! ! I purchased this and it did not last 2 weeks before it totally fell apart and turned color to boot ! The clasp to hold it shut fell off and the chain fell apart ! Buy at Risk !	-1
I found it hard to get the stainless tops off to fill them , but I like the plastic covers .	-1
I have used one of these for a long time -- I like the glass bottom , though it was never a particularly tight seal . After living for a while with a cheapo IKEA pan in my other kitchen ( I commute 1100 miles and unfortunately have two of many things ) , I finally decided to `` spring '' for a nicer pan , so to speak . The first one arrived and was all scratched up , so I returned it and got a second one . Filled that one up with water , and indeed , drip drip drip drip . It 's from where the collar joins , since indeed , the outer side of the ring has to be looser than the inner side . Batter wo n't drip through it or anything , but butter in a crust , or juice from baking fruit might . It 's not actually worse than the cheaper pan , so I decided not to return yet another one . But I 'm quite disappointed , since I was hoping that by shelling out the cash for a fancier pan , I might get a relatively drip-proof one ...	-1
I was eager to use the new pan for a Thanksgiving dessert . On the recommendation from Cook 's Illustrated , I ordered one from Amazon . It arrived with a couple small dents around the bottom edge , which I was concerned would affect the pan 's ability to seal.Amazon quickly sent me a replacement , which arrived with an even larger dent than on the first one I returned . I am getting a refund this time , and will buy this from a local retailer , where I can inspect it before I leave the store.To Amazon 's credit , I 've learned how easy it is to get replacements and refunds .	-1
I used this on a number of US made Chicago cutlery ( high Carbon steel ) which were very dull . Forget 2 passes , after about 20 passes , there was still little edge . After 20 or so minutes of work , I finally got a barely usable edge . Maybe if you start with a relatively decent edge its OK but if youare starting with a real dull knife , you will not get anywhere in `` a couple of passes . ''	-1
You can do better , this is the economical model in their line ( EdgeCraft ) and you would be pressed to find anything that will ruin your good knives faster.After ruining a nice pair of Wusthof knives , OK , I admit , me stupid ! I sent my Model 110 back to the company with a letter . I was cordial , but told them they could take their product and give it to charity , employee of the month , Good Will , or natives in South America to sharpen their machetes with.My knives luckily went back to Wusthof and were reground at no charge . They even removed the scratches . My students knives got fixed with a professional belt sander I fabricated from one I got at a supply house and 1000 grit and leather belts , and fine stones actually making them better than they were new.It is better to lose eighty dollars than ruin a 2500 dollar knife collection . I blame myself as I am accustomed to sharpening my knives , Wusthof , Shun and a few exotic Japanese blades by hand . I could do better with a piece of hard stream bedrock . I bought it to hone up a few of the students knives as most of them could n't cut warm butter saving me time and effort . Bad idea . Took me a day to fix the mess and restore a 22 degree on the domestics and 15 degree angles on the Japanese . This was the worst product I have ever tested and I tell anyone I see to pass on it.This particular model will destroy your knife 's edge and recreate an abomination of an edge that means you ca n't do anything with it except put in back in the sharpener . And thats not sharp . We did not test any of their other models as we have good knives and want them to stay that way . I never heard back from them , with any kind of communications . For a company of that size not to respond is indicative of possibly the other products they sell might not perform any better.Careful research with other forums and locations indicated similar results . This is probably Ok for the low end 49.95 set of twelve knife users but for the pros , you better do better because of your investment . I have heard this one model is is coming off the market , or discontinued being replaced by a different holder and hones . They still continue to sell this one . Had this company shown any responsibility they could of at least offered me a differential to upgrade or replaced one with less problems.Nothing beats the stones and hones and careful attention to your tools .	-1
This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever used . I was excited to receive it because it is very light . Many pie shield are too heavy and ruin the crust . THIS RUINED MY CRUST . This stuck to every inch of my crust . I was floor . The enter pie was ruined . Stick with foil . Pie shields just are n't worth the aggravation .	-1
I bought a plain and simple 9 & # 34 ; pyrex pie plate along with two of these 9 & # 34 ; pie crust shields . They do n't fit . Sizing is very misleading . Now I 'm looking for an 8 & # 34 ; pie plate to go with these .	-1
This brand of products is n't worth the time . I have made several purchases ( all at same time ) and the product is made in China crap . sharp edges , rusted after first wash. Will not be buying products from this company ever .	-1
This picture of a Gingerbread man cookie cutter is what I wanted , however they sent me a different cutter . The one I received was different , it was fatter and not very sturdy and had no metal brace like the one pictured to keep the cookie cutters shape and make it easier to press into thick gingerbread dough . I make old fashioned gingerbread cookies each Christmas and the dough is very thick and needs a good sturdy cutter to make a good gingerbread man cookie . The wonderful one I had actually had two braces on it , one down the middle of the gingerbread man and one across the length of the arms . However it was lost in a move and I have been trying to find one like it for years . The picture looks a lot like the one I use to have . Unfortunately they sent me a different cutter which is just not up to par . They refunded me the cost of the cutter but never offered to send the correct one . Another year of substandard gingerbread cookies . Having a cheap cutter makes it harder to get the cookie not to break before it even gets to the pan and taking it off to cool is very difficult . When I had the good cutter it was easy to put them on the pan and take them off for cooling . The shape of a gingerbread man cookie cutter is very important !	-1
This was a grave disappointment and I felt like digging a grave and burying the cloth and cover . The pastry cloth is too stiff ( something like a stiff in a grave ) and the rolling pin cover is way to long and does n't fit the rolling pin . What 's the problem here ? Are n't rolling pins pretty standard in size ? I would not recommend this product to anyone .	-1
I dealt with this mug for months , despite how awful it was . It worked best if my intention was to suck down all my coffee at once , scalding hot . If I actually wanted to get out the door with it and down to the bus stop , I could expect that by the time I stopped walking and went in for a sip , some sort of thermodynamic magic would cause the lid to essentially spit my coffee into my face and down my shirt . I actually took to wrapping a paper towel around the cup , just under the lid . It did n't really help . And then I would get this ... spot . A smudge of coffee on the tip of my nose where it kissed the lid , which I 'd then wipe with the back of my hand . So there I am . At the bus stop . Day after day . I 'm drinking tepid coffee from a crummy cup that spews crap all over me like that little girl in `` The Exorcist '' , with a tiny brown smudge on my nose that I absently wipe at , wondering where all the good mugs are . I drive X-country with a friend , spilling coffee all the way . `` Get a better mug ! `` , she 'd cry , yet I was powerless , totally unable to stop myself from using it every day . I tried to hone my technique - lean out , sip slow , sip fast . After I finally got back home , a co-worker actually STOLE it . I did n't say anything . I was stunned . And then one day , she starts complaining to me about `` her '' mug . `` It leaks '' , she says . `` But it 's like I ca n't get rid of it . It spills over my clothes and I get it on my face . And it 's like , I know it 's crap , but I keep using it . It 's SO stupid ! '' And for all I know , she may yet be powerless to escape . But I ... I 'm free .	-1
I really dislike the plastic tops . In my opinion the plastic leeches into my hot drinks , giving it a nasty taste . Also the silicone around the cap leaves a nasty taste on the rim of the lid .	-1
I did n't even open the box all the way when I saw & # 34 ; Made In China & # 34 ; on the outside . I do n't fancy stuff made in China and will instead purchase a Romertopf Made in Germany . I am an avid cook and baker , love quality and the & # 34 ; China & # 34 ; label never means quality . Very sad that I have found this out after delivery .	-1
After reading the reviews of others , I handled these peel with care . Despite my carefulness , the peel warped and cracked within a month . Wood is too think , too soft , too something . Buy some other pizza peel .	-1
I wanted it mainly because it is a thermos , but I gave up and recycled it after a few trys .	-1
Nice solid piece of equipment.But one of the reasons we bought it , was because the thermo feature.It stays hot maybe one hour ... then warm for another hour ... and that 's it.Well built and solid though .	-1
If you like grounds in your cup , this is a great product . I bought it to replace a glass press the broke in shipment . I was willing to pay more for better quality . But ... Every time I make a pot it ends up with a lot of grounds in my cup . I grind rather The screen does n't fit well ... Chew Your coffee ...	-1
This is well made with one serious flaw : every pot has A LOT of grounds which escape the mesh filter . It is n't made properly and the imperfect seal around the edges is the culprit .	-1
The one good cup of coffee is about all it does . The second cup will have a lot of silt and grounds in it . The box claimed that it would keep coffee hot for & # 34 ; up to six hours & # 34 ; . Even with preheating the press before making the coffee , it 's cold in an hour . Giving it 2 stars was being generous I feel .	-1
We had one of these for years , and it finally broke . I ordered this one ... and it 's terrible . I got a replacement wire from the company , but it still does n't work . It hacks away at the cheese and leaves large pieces uncut ... that I have to just tear away . I ca n't make it work right no matter what I do . Seems simple , but it wo n't work .	-1
I purchased this and was very disappointed with the construction . The & # 34 ; blade & # 34 ; did not line up with the cutting slot and could not be adjusted to work properly . I had to return it !	-1
This item is a little hard to use as the dought sticks to the rough inner surface . I just use it to roast vegetables as I now prefer to use a baking stone .	-1
I am returning this , today ! My first of signs this might not work was that it is made in Taiwan . Not the USA like another reveiwer indicates . They may have made Pampered Chef but this is imported.Second , the lid was not a good fit for the base . Since I have never seen one of these , I thought to give it a try.Third , and final break the bank , was that dough came out the edges and created a burned seal beteween the lid and base ! I tried two different bread recipes . Both had burned edges and were far too hard on the outer crust . The top was ok , but the sides and bottom were garbage.Yes , I followed the directions provided . Used the appropriate size dough recipe . And still had poor results.I was so hoping this would work . I will try another method for getting a better loaf . Oh , and yes I bake all the time , at least two loaves a week .	-1
Well , I guess it & # 8217 ; s my own fault for not paying attention to others ' complaints that this thing is as sharp as a wet noodle : they were right ! ! ! It came with a cover for the & # 8220 ; blade & # 8221 ; a complete joke ! ! This thing is so dull , I don & # 8217 ; t even think that the option to sharpen it would be successful , so I & # 8217 ; m going to return it.I backed up my purchase with another similar product , which came at the same time , and appears to be MUCH sharper.I just remember my dad using a & # 8216 ; grass hook & # 8217 ; ( he called it a scythe ) to cut the grass at our house when I was little . It was EXTREMELY sharp , and I actually cut my thumb on it . I guess nowadays , the product police have intervened and they can & # 8217 ; t sell anything actually harp enough to do the job because someone & # 8220 ; might get cut ! ! ! & # 8221 ; Please : PAY ATTENTION to the reviews here , and DON & # 8217 ; T WASTE YOUR MONEY ! ! !	-1
This was my go to pan for everything . I loved it . If the price was half of what it is , I would consider buying one every two years . It is a little too rich for my blood for a pan that is useless after 18 months . The coating is a wonder at first . Then you wonder how you ever liked it . Ours looks like a potholed mess . We used all the safe utensils that live along with the other non-stick pans we have , and always hand washed it . I babied this pan , because I loved cooking in it . Now we tossed it , as it is useless .	-1
I purchased this set about five years ago from one of the cooking stores in the local mall ( it was on sale , and the saleswoman was very , very good at her job ! ) . I was replacing a worn out set of Calphalon non-stick , and I was very excited to get the SCANPAN set home.Well , for several months I was very happy . I liked the weight of the pans ( heavy , but not unmanageable ) , and the non-stick surface seemed to work well for many types of cooking . They even browned well , which is a problem with some non-stick cookware.Then , after about six months , I noticed that the surfaces of two of the saucepans and the large covered skillet were `` bubbling , '' as if the coating was separating from the metal . SCANPAN claims they do not `` coat '' their pans , but this sure seemed like coating to me . I kept using the pans , and the bubbling got worse . Additionally , the non-stick quality of the pans ( especially the large skillet ) began to deteriorate until they were almost impossible to use . Everything stuck to the skillet -- even the use of additional oil did n't help.Right now , the covered skillet is completely useless . I can still use the saucepans , but tiny bits of the black coating do come off in my food ( like with those cheap Teflon-coated pans you can get at Wal-Mart ) . The large Dutch oven is still good , mainly because I have n't used it much over the past five years.I will admit I did not attempt to send these pans back to SCANPAN for replacements , mainly because I do not want replacements . Also , I no longer have the receipt for the set ( my fault -- but I honestly did n't expect to need it ) . So I ca n't add any insight into whether their guarantee is worth anything or not . But a replacement pan wo n't help if the pans themselves are n't worth the money . This is an expensive set of cookware , and it should last a reasonable amount of time ( I would n't expect any cookware to last `` forever , '' but a few months just is n't good enough ) .Do n't buy these . Try a carbon steel pan -- longer lasting , less expensive , fewer headaches all around .	-1
I purchased my Scanpan 2001+ back in 1996 when this was a huge expense for me . The first six months were perfect - the best cookware ever . But then the non-stick surfaces began to slowly deteriorate . The smallest saucepan was so bad I threw it out . Now everything sticks.The two large casseroles are the only items that remained perfect , although one did warp in the oven so the glass cover no longer fits well . I now use those two the most , even for frying.I followed the cleaning directions to the letter , did not put them in the dishwasher and I was the only person using the Scanpan.I just got my things out of five-years of storage which is what brought the defects to my attention again . Maybe I 'll try returning the damaged items as some of the other reviewers have mentioned .	-1
I had this item for about two weeks and loved it . Until , the cord failed and the unit went crazy and gave all wild readings . After reading some reviews here I figured I would contact Polder to see if I could get a replacement cord.I NEVER heard from them.Cheap cheap cheap . Not bad customer service ... . NO customer service . They did n't even bother to tell me to go away . I will never buy Polder again .	-1
This is a great idea , but it broke on Thanksgiving ( first use ) . It ca n't be used over 390 degrees , and I guess the metal in the oven got too hot . I had to go back to my instant read thermometer . DISAPPOINTING !	-1
Had my polder thermometer lasted longer than 6 months , I would have given it a 4 or 5 star rating.Having a probe with a cord is a great idea . It is very convenient for monitoring temperatures in ovens or smokers if you do n't want to raise the lid . Combined with the temperature alert feature ( you can set a temperature to set of the alarm ) , the polder is very handy . Unfortunately , having gone through two probes , it appears that they are too delicate for this kind of use . It is very easy to damage the cord and then you will get wildly off readings.My other criticism of the polder is the time that it takes to react to temperature changes and the length of time it takes to get an accurate reading . My Taylor instant read obtains a reading in a few seconds . The polder often takes much longer ( 15-20 seconds ) , which can be an issue when checking steaks on a very hot grill.In summary , do n't buy this device unless you want to buying replacement probes frequently .	-1
This is a poorly constructed thermometer . After one successful use , the LCD screen showed only occasional lines , rendering it unreadable.If it worked , it would meet a real need . I was lucky in that its illegible condition was obvious before I used it . If the screen went during the cooking , I would have probably ruined an expensive cut of meat .	-1
This WAS an excellent , multi-functional timer , the first time I bought one . It was a stopwatch , timer , and clock , with a magnet on the back so you could stick it on your fridge , and a cord to wear it around your neck . Very well designed and easy to figure out . After several years of daily use , it recently died and I bought a new one . Sorry to say , the new one is far less well made . Cheap , thin plastic . Buttons that are sunken into the holes so you ca n't press them without using the end of a pen . No magnet on the back . And it did n't work properly . I returned it . This is really too bad . Polder had a real winner here and they completely blew it . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I know lots of people love this timer . I am the exception . The buttons are tiny and every time a button a pressed , if you are lucky to press the button you meant to press , a loud beeping sound is emitted . In summary , annoyingly small buttons and loud beeping sound .	-1
I purchased this because the timer on my new oven , the most handy and always available timer in my kitchen , is quite soft . Quiet enough that if I 'm doing another task -- mixing , blending , using the food processor , saut & eacute ; ing with the vent hood on -- I ca n't hear the timer go off . Which is kind of a problem.I hoped this would be a fix . It 's not . As this is equally quiet , making it pretty useless unless you want to wear it on your person . Which you can . But I do n't care to.Second the buttons are fingernail tiny , and I found it a little awkward to punch , even with fairly long , slim fingers and quite a bit of dexterity . ( I 'm a quick typist and texter , for example . ) But most annoying , you have to set not only minutes , to get this timer to work , but seconds . So , to set a 10-minute timer , you need to type in 10:00 instead of just `` 10 , '' as on every other timer I 've ever used . How often do you really want to do that ? It 's non-intiuitive , totally clunky and just plain weird .	-1
This timer is inadequate in two ways . First , the volume of the beep is too low and ca n't be heard more than two feet away . Secondly , the LED began malfunctioning after a few months and made the readout illegible . I would n't buy this again .	-1
The alarms are not loud enough . Running water , dishwasher etc . will cover them up and I have a quite dishwasher . I tried a new battery but did it not help . Also buttons did not respond as quickly as the other three digital timers I 've used . I loved the features and was very dissapointed . I gave it one star because the alarmes do not do me any good if I ca n't hear them .	-1
I gave this away what a waste of time and moneydon ` t get caught up in the gadget game . Who has room for all of them anyway	-1
I was very pleased with this thermal carafe . I used it almost daily to hold hot water for tea . After about 6 months I noticed shiny specs floating in the water . I thought maybe it needed a good cleaning with detergent . 3 months later I noticed discoloration inside the carafe . Using a wooden chopstock I gently rubbed it against the interior of the carafe . The interior was now rough not smooth . The chrome plating ( or whatever it is ) was slowly eroding . I immediately threw it away.No more carafes for me . I bought an electric tea kettle .	-1
I own both this machine and the Breadman Ultimate . They both are great at baking bread and are very versatile . The Zojirushi , however , has a built-in 30 minute warmup for every bread cycle . My breads do n't turn out any better in this machine , but it does take a lot longer , and the wait is frustrating . I wish I would have known about this before I purchased it . True , you can create a program , but that 's not something I want to do each time I bake bread .	-1
I 've owned a bread machine for eight years and wanted to & quot ; up-grade & quot ; - I am disappointed in my choice . It was either the Zojirushi or the Panasonic . I wish I had chosen the latter . I never had one problem with my old ( Pillsbury ) bread maker when it came time for the bread to come out of the pan . This bread maker is terrible in that regard . I did email the company and was told to & quot ; let it sit for five minutes & quot ; and then try and jiggle the outside paddle extensions to help the bread release . This is not wise as even after 5 minutes or longer the pan is so hot , it 's difficult to turn it on its side to try and move the paddles from the bottom.I also notice that on the Medium Crust Setting , the top of the bread is very light - almost not browned sufficiently . Using the darker setting makes the top brown , but also makes the rest of the bread too dark.I did my homework before purchasing this machine - I will try , once again , to email the company to see if they have any other suggestions . But it receives a low-grade from me . C-	-1
The good : the non-stick surface works great and is easy to clean.The bad : does a terrible job cooking rice . White , basmati , jasmine , brown ... rinsed or not , 1:1 through 2:1 water-to-rice ratio , half a cup of dry rice to two cups of rice - it does n't matter . The bottom always burns and the rice comes out gummy . It seems like the heating element is too strong - it finishes up far faster than it should . Add to that the fact that the hole in the lid sputters far more than any rice cooker I 've ever used , and the `` keep warm '' function only serves to burn the bottom rice even more.I wish I had n't thrown out my el-cheapo cooker when this arrived . It was tiny and did n't have a non-stick pot , but at least it made good rice . I know 2 stars is a little harsh , but if a rice cooker does n't make good rice , there 's no point .	-1
Ever since I read in the NYT last year that the microplane zester is one of the three `` must haves '' for serious cooks , I have wanted one , especially since I was thrilled with the other two ( the Oxo peeler and Silpat ) , but so far I 'm disappointed with it . It has few advantages over my $ 3 grocery store small-hole grater for zesting citrus or grating ginger . It 's slightly better in that it does n't release as many liquids from what you are grating , but that may be a disadvantage because you end up needing to grate more for the same flavor . It 's worse in that bits of what you are grating build up on the edges , which are slightly folded over , so you have to go at them with a toothpick , which is tedious.It 's not that I do n't recognize a hierarchy of graters -- - once I bought one at a dollar store which was clearly inferior to my $ 3 grocery grater -- - I just do n't think this one is much better than the basic type .	-1
This home series is awful ... this was purchased to do an easy coarse grate of cheese instead of pulling out the box grater . While the actual grating surface is microplane quality - it 's set inside a plastic frame which does n't hold up to the flexible strength required . After a few rounds in the kitchen , the plastic has cracked and now gaps open when using . Do yourself a favor - spend a few extra bucks and get the 'Professional ' version for a few bucks more . This now sits in a drawer because it 's a shame to throw out the useable part , but really not our favorite grater to pull out .	-1
As many others have stated , buy a Microplane , but not one with a clear plastic frame . I have about 10 microplanes , including several with plastic frames - each of those has cracked and broken , and been replaced by the models with stainless steel frames - and the amazing thing is that the stainless steel frame model only costs a few dollars more than this one.I think Microplane would be wise to ditch their 'Home Series ' and just make the models with stainless steel frames .	-1
These Microplane graters are wonderful , but I recommend the Professional versions instead . If you use your graters a lot , the plastic edges will eventually break , so spend the extra few dollars and get the steel edged Professional versions to start with . I just replaced two graters myself because they broke .	-1

It worked fine for about 6 months , after that the plastic started to crack , Today it cracked thru when and now I find myself ordering a different microplane . They have a professional grade microplane for less than a dollar more so I am going to try that version .	-1
September 2 2005 . Today I finally received my 2nd { second } griddle . The 1st one was an 11 x 11 model you CAN NOT use on glass top ranges . Unfortunatly I re-ordered before the lady posted her warning of the problem on JUNE 28th and today I again received the 11 x 11 inch model . I have e-mailed Amazon and asked THEM to fix their problem and send me the correct griddle . No point in ordering from this site . The picture and written discription are correct but the details in mini type below do n't match . Those little numbers are the model # , sku # , etc and ALL are WRONG , WRONG , WRONG ! !	-1
Good weight , attractive , no protruding handles interfering with its fit on the stove top , large cooking service , good for defrosting and cooling down . However , mine has stains and sticky residue that is not washing off . The item has been cared for as directed ~ not high heat and not washed by the dishwasher . Certainly not used more than 10 times ~ for making pancakes , browning onions , bacon , sausage , etc . I 'm thinking that the onions created the non-removable residue . The lifetime of this item is too short ~ and I paid more than $ 63 for it . Anyone knowing how to clean it , let me know ~ else it will be returned .	-1
This may be a great canner but forget about it as a pressure cooker . The instruction manual on the first page says DO NOT use to cook dried beans , lentils , rice etc . Wait a second - is n't the whole point of a pressure cooker that you can cook things like garbanzo and great northern beans really quickly ? ? Unless you are planning on just cooking meat and veg in it , buy something else if you want to use the pressure cooker function .	-1
I bought this canner with great expectations , but was very disappointed . It was expensive and I was willing to pay the price for a really good canner . The problem I had was that it was VERY heavy , which is good , unless you also can not get the lid off , which is not good . I tried this canner several times and every time the lid was a struggle to remove . The biggest selling point to me was that it did n't need a rubber gasket . The biggest disappointment for me was that the lid did n't come off ( because it did n't need a gasket ) .The upshot . Get a Presto canner with the gasket for lots less money . I now have 2 of them and they 've worked well for me for years .	-1
The product looked like it was damaged due to shipping so I requested a replacement . Damage was on the lifting handle with the aluminum being buckled were it was hit . So I sent it back and received a second one , the second one was damaged as well , same place on the handle and a large gouge on the lid.The manufacture needs to package this item better . I 'd asked Amazon send me a third replacement but they refused . I 've researched this item and still would like one , because it 's cost $ 200.00 I except it to arrive free of any damage .	-1
After I purchased this pan at first I was delighted . However after less that a year , a third of the non-stick finish has lifted and flaked off . I called their warranty numher , 1-800-388-3872 , only to find it no longer is accessible . I received a message that the number could not be accessed from my location in the US . I tried my MCI calling card and still no luck accessing their 800 # . There is no email address or street address given on their web site either . POOR quality and NO service !	-1
I bought this for my husband who likes to make smoothies with his breakfast . I was tired of the crappy blenders not blending up the ice thoroughly . So I searched online for a quality blender that could sustain heavy duty daily use . This one seemed perfect . At first it was really spectacular , pretty quiet and liquidated the ice cubes to nothing . Then after 6 months , it completely died . Ridiculous , nothing lasts anymore ... even if you do spend good money .	-1
i was too cheap to get the vitamix and thought i could get by with this waring . which LOOKED like the waring i 'd had previously . but clearly , looks are n't everything . this thing barely blends . utter waste of money . gearing up to get a vitamix ...	-1
This blender was great while it lasted . We were looking for a medium-range blender - something that worked well but was not $ 400 . We were initially happy with this purchase - it 's simple and I love the fact that the pitcher is glass and not plastic . We used it on a weekly basis to make smoothies , for about a year and a half . Then it started smelling like burning , the motor got really loud , and the glass canister started leaking from the bottom . Since this is & # 34 ; professional quality , & # 34 ; we expected it to last a lot longer . We have replaced this with a Ninja .	-1
After having one of the predecessors to this blender for a number of years I wanted a 2nd one . Reviews were pretty good so I ordered . Received it quickly but did n't use for about 6 weeks ( AFTER Amazon 's return period ) . Made mayonnaise and was put off by the horrible burning smell of , presumably , the wiring . Called Waring , said to try it a few more times and the smell will go away , or I can send it ( at my expense ) to their service center for repairs or replacement . Used twice more for equally non-taxing blending jobs , smell still present when using it , will have to return to Waring , and will probably buy something else . Very disappointed for a `` professional '' unit ... my first clue was that it was somewhat lighter in weight than the previous unit . Lesson learned : use an item in the 30-day return period .	-1
Unfortunately this blender is not the same as the model from the 1950 's and 1960 's that was such a prize . I was hoping that it would disassemble for cleaning like that one but it does n't . As the man said , & # 34 ; If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it ! & # 34 ; I would give a bunch for a blender like the one we had when I was growing up .	-1
This brand used to be one to get . This model is total garbage ! It leaks on the top , its made very cheaply on the bottom of the pitcher.The part that engages into the drive is the worst design I have ever seen for a blender . After a week it started to make really bad sounds while running.I can not wash out the smell that is in the pitcher , I do not understand why . I think the plastic bottom has trapped the smell.All we use it for is making baby formula .	-1
I own and wrote a glorious review of my Waring blender with stainless steel body which looks nearly identical to this , however , this product ( listed as stainless steel ) is fake ! There is no metal in it . If you look carefully at the pictures , you can see it is exactly as the white one ( which I assume is also plastic ) . They merely put a scratched mylar coating on the plastic . The other plastic pieces also seem flimsy and poorly made . The quality was much worse than my old , cheap $ 15 Braun juicer . The power of this unit is decent , but not so much that I think it qualifies for a $ 100 juicer . I would have given this a much better rating if it was half the price or if it really was made out of stainless steel . The `` stainless '' finish is fake and does n't match my other stainless appliances .	-1
This was n't even in my hands for five minutes and the turning knob was broke . You need to pull the button out then turn it , when you shut the lid it locks automatically . This was returned the next day , I searched the net for many ideas on what to use to store my Cuisinart blades and discs , and I came up with a Stearlite plastic container , you can find them in Walmart , this one is a little long and tall , it has locking flaps on all sides . I keep my chopping blade in my processor . I place a dish hand towel across the bottom of the container , in the center of the towel , I place my dough blade , then fold the towel sides in over the dough blade , I place my discs , one on each side of the towel , sharp side facing in so they do n't scratch up the plastic , on top of the folded in towel I put the dowel that fits into the discs , then on top of that , I lay a small potholder , I close my container , snap all sides in place , and place the container in my cabinet on a shelf , this takes up no space on my counter like the holder would . The holder does n't feel real durable to me . I came up with this idea and I really like the way its working out and I 'm saving money : ) I also just want to mention that the holder is open on the bottom , it 's not all closed up underneath , this bothered me as well .	-1
A blade holder is a great idea . I like the idea that it keeps the blades safe . Unfortunately , my disc holder locked itself permanently and I had to take the unit apart to get to my blades and discs . Cuisinart needs to upgrade the quality of the locking mechanism .	-1
This product works well in storing your blades and other parts , but good luck getting them out of there ! Once the top closes , it locks shut , preventing your items from jumping out ? In order to unlock the lid you have to pull this teeny tiny knob and then turn it WHILE you are pulling . The problem here is that there is no grip on this knob , and if you are in the kitchen , half the time your hands are soaking wet or greasy , so with no grip on this knob , you can run into some trouble . To alleviate this problem , I 've replaced the knob with one similar to that of pin ball shooter , it has a convex shape with a knob at one end , giving you better leverage when opening the lid.There is just one last thing I will say about this too , BE CAREFUL WHEN PICKING IT UP . Do n't put your hand through the bottom like I did and slice open your finger ! ! ! There is no base to the base of this product , meaning when you pick it up from the bottom , all the blades are protruding from beneath it ! I 'm giving this thing 2 stars , one for doing it 's job of storing things , and one for the price . The other three missing stars are for the horrible design flaws in this item .	-1
It does not hold discs that have the stems on them which my discs do . I returned it . It may work just fine for someone who has the discs with no stems .	-1
I had it returned to Amazon , as these discs do not fit the Cuisinart Elite 14-cup Food Processor ( this , is the model I have ) . I had to visit the Cuisinart Web Site to order the proper ones ( and , as the Elite 14-cup Food Processor is so new , they had all but the `` Grater '' disc currently available ; therefore I ordered the two `` Specialty '' discs they have , and will order the Grater disc when it becomes available .	-1
Did n't fit , could n't get the arm attached no matter what I tried , had to return in the end , which was a nuisance .	-1
I agree with other 1 and 2 Star ratings now ... I read all of the reviews first , but still had to find out for myself ... Tried it on potatoes and other veggies ( carrots and zucchini ) for julienne cut , it just does n't do a good job ( too thin for french fries , and sort of rips other veggies , not smooth or straight cut . I wish someone would come up already with a good thin and medium julienne disk , at a reasonable price ! I am still hopeful one day they will : - )	-1
This blade cut a few very thin slices of sweet potato and then cracked the detachable stem that holds the disc . The blade came with no instructions for use . Frustrating , to say the least . I have had to purchase a new 1 at $ 14 a pop . Not a huge expense , I just should n't have had to make .	-1
I purchased this product about 2 years ago . It lasted less than a year before the blender jar blade came apart . I still use the mini chopper occasionally for making small amounts of salad dressing or pesto.This product is also rather lightweight compared to my most recent Kitchen Aid Blender.I would recommend buying a heavy-duty blender and nice food processor instead if you can spare the funds .	-1
I was so happy when my friend got this blender/food processor for me since it meant that I wouldn & # 8217 ; t have to buy one for myself . But when I used it to chop some vegetables , it just went poof ! I still don & # 8217 ; t know what happened .	-1
This is such a poorly designed blender . The small piece that latched the bowl also broke on me . Spend the extra money and get a better one .	-1
My first suggestion to anyone reading reviews on this product is to keep looking . If you need an explanation , read on ... This unit required replacement parts after 3 years and Cuisinart 's replacement parts are poor . Both parts of this unit are VERY loud when running , especially the food processor . Enough to leave my ears ringing after making a batch of hummus . There has to be quieter models out there.I 've replaced the blade for the blender attachment twice . The first time the plastic around the blade cracked when I was tightening the base to secure the blade . The replacement immediately would not work . The blade simply would n't turn . I called customer service to get another replacement and luckily they shipped a new replacement for free and paid the shipping on the return of the faulty blade.Next , one of the pieces of plastic that secures the lid to the bowl of the food processor attachment broke off , so the lid does n't stay on properly ; you have to hold it down . I order a new bowl from Cuisinart , go to try it out and my existing lid wo n't fit . The circumference of the bowl is slightly smaller than the lid causing it to not fit . So , I call customer service and explain . They send me a new replacement , shipped for free again . The second replacement has the same issue . I call customer service again and their response is that I 'm doing something wrong and that they can have someone talk me through the assembly . Really ? ! Who is that dumb that they ca n't figure out how to slide a lid onto the base ? I insist that the replacement product is faulty . They say to just use a little more force to get the lid on . Right . They wo n't send another free replacement . I also learn that the replacement parts are manufactured by a third party , not by Cuisinart as the original parts are made . Bottom line is now I have to hold down the lid on one side so it stays on because Cuisinart ca n't take responsibility for poorly designed products.I will be purchasing a new food processor , but NOT from Cuisinart .	-1
This Cuisinart toaster worked fairly well -- for about 3 months . Then the handle that holds the toast down no longer engages and it 's trash ! Total waste of $ 50 . Will never buy another Cuisinart product . Do n't waste your money on this one !	-1
Personally , I do n't like burnt toast and hate this toaster . I thought buying a Cuisinart toaster would insure a lasting appliance . I may as well have spent $ 10 at a discout store . I have had this toaster for a bit over 3 years . We do n't toast often , but for the last year I have been tolerant of popping up the toast half-way through to see if it is ready as if I wait for the machine despite any setting it will burn . Very disappointing for an appliance that is supposed to have a good reputation . Two starts as it did work fine for 2 years .	-1
I 'm sorry I went for a cheap Cuisinart . I should have known I would not be happy with this for long . It has a glass pot which means eventually it will have a very unhappy ending for me . It does n't automatically shut off . Half of the time I use it , I forget until I smell burning coffee . It has one of those tricky catches so you can take off the pot while it 's brewing but again , if the pot is n't inserted just right , you 'll have a mess all over the counter . You have adjustments for the number of cups you are making so if you forget to adjust that the coffee can be horrid . I think I 'll just put it away for the days I have to make a full pot for company .	-1
The packaging did not appear to be damaged , but when I opened the actual product , it fell apart into at least 10 pieces ! I figured okay , let me put it back together , but it was so irreparably damaged , that the pieces were not fitting together either . Not only that , the housing had also fallen apart , and the motor mechanism and wires were all totally visible and exposed . The product seems to have good reviews , so I 'm going to call this a one-off , but still such a disappointment . Returning and ordering a similar one ( the Krups one ) .	-1
Our office grinder broke ( Braun , very old ) . In a pinch , ran out , bought this one . It takes 20 seconds to grind it to the proper grind ( twice as long as any other ) and when you pull the top off , the coffee falls out , and one `` load '' is not enough for a pot of coffee . Immediately ordered another brand ( let 's just say it starts with a `` K '' and it rhymes with pups ) and it is the opposite - wonderful . The K brand grinds fantastically fast , does a full coffee pot load , and you can turn it upside down and use lid to transfer the load . Amazingly ( read , stupidly ) simple . I mean , this is not rocket science . How can they get this so incredibly wrong ? lol	-1
I used it once or twice , never noticed the difference in the taste of the coffee.Now just taking up counter space , since I have Peet 's grind my beans to what I want , and I do n't miss the mess of grinding at home	-1
Bought two - one for home and one for office . One died in 3 months and the other died in about 18 months.Such a shame on cuisinart . I feel let down.Even when it works , not my favorite for coffee , as the capacity is very small , just good enough for running one round in an espresso machine .	-1
For less than sixteen months this kettle worked like a charm . Unfortunately , the kettle just suddenly stopped working , and had to be replaced . Given the other reviews indicating a pattern here , we did n't choose to go with another Cuisinart.When we received an electric kettle as a wedding present 37 years ago , I could n't see the point , but quickly learned the error of my ways . It 's unbelievably handy to have at hand , even in this day of microwave ovens . Nothing is better , in my experience , for making a great cup or pot of tea ; and that alone would be reason enough to have one.This kettle seemed to have everything I wanted in an electric kettle , and more ! Cuisinart seemed to have avoided all the design flaws that caused our earlier kettles to bite the dust , but apparently did n't succeed .	-1
Really loved this kettle and used it everyday , but it gave out on us after 6 months . The previous model made by Cuisinart was better , although it was not cordless , it lasted many years ( actually the older model still works , it 's just a little corroded inside ) . So I figured this newer model would be even better . Considering how expensive it was , it should have lasted longer . I 'm very disappointed as I thought Cuisinart usually made solid products .	-1
This is the second of these tea kettles we have owned and from which we have received too few years service , especially for the high price tag -- $ 100 at time of purchase . Then , it seemed worth it because we trusted the Cuisinart brand.We used one at the office and one at home . The office unit died after one year . We thought it a fluke . Both of us were working long , long hours and never got around to asking Cuisinart for warranty replacement . The house kettle lasted till the warranty was up and slightly longer . I had hoped we could get them repaired at a small appliance repair , but apparently they are not worth the trouble.I have a kitchen full of Cuisinart appliances , but in recent years the quality seems to be going down and down . My 23-year-old Cuisinart food processor is still going strong , but I 've had to replace several other of their appliances after only a few years service.I 'm looking into other brands for my next kitchen purchases . Breville seems to get good reviews .	-1
I purchased this after the original bowl ( which we had used maybe 3-4 times over a year ) would n't get anything cold enough to really `` firm up '' .But this new bowl ended up having the same problem - in less than a year , after only a few uses , once again nothing got cold enough anymore.I was careful never to wash it in hot water as the instructions said ( I only used cold ) but that did n't help .	-1
Like everything else Cuisinart , the newer versions of the old standards are simply not the same . The new products take shortcuts . Shorter , lighter power cords , flimsier plastic parts ... I just bought $ 60 in replacement parts for my 1985-ish Cuisinart food processor . It would have made sense to buy a new processor altogether ... EXCEPT that I know from experience that the new one would be , as my first father-in-law would have said , `` Made to sell . `` When I had two Cuisinart coffee makers -- one conventional and one single cup -- die recently , both within a year or 14 months of their purchase , I decided Cuisinart no longer deserves my consideration.My new brand of choice , I think , will be KitchenAid .	-1
The machine works OK . But not great for a $ 150 investment.My mother had a cuisinart from 1970something . It was a work horse . You would put anything in there , and suddenly , it 'd be ground to a fine powder in no time flat . Coconut ( dry or fresh ) , nuts , seeds , whatever . Pulse once or twice , and get perfect minced onion , garlic , or ginger.This one is a different story . I do n't know what they did to the motor , but it 's not as powerful as my mother 's old school one . When I pitch some nuts in there , it never gets it smooth , even though I am careful to add enough oil or water ( after pulsing it down to a fine meal ) , and it 's still not doing the job like the old machines do.Furthermore , the motor starts to heat up , and I get nervous about overloading it . It 's a good thing that I am being careful , because Cuisinart has a whole load of bull plops to go with its so called warranty.1 . You have to pay $ 10 to ship the new part to you.2 . The blade is n't covered . My blade broke , and now they 're telling me I need to get a new one . I was n't grindings stones , I was grinding fresh coconut.I would n't trust Cuisinart to keep up its promises of excellence as they used to have in the old days . It 's time to find another brand .	-1
First use - trying to chop some veggies . The chopper tool turned some of them into mush before the rest of the ones rattling around got chopped . Ruined my food and made the recipe inedible , literally . I 'd have been far better off chopping by hand.Second use - try to shred some cabbage to make sauerkraut . The continual snap and unsnap required to loosen and attach the food pusher is a major pain in the you-know-where . Why they designed it so it has to snap and unsnap makes no sense whatsoever.This was a complete waste of money and cabinet space .	-1
Worked quite well until the blade mechanism broke after a few uses and the replacement part from Cuisinart is way too expensive when you factor in the part + shipping/handling . This has been the case with many Cuisinart items so I am no longer a fan of any products made by the company .	-1
Difficult to operate . Shaft keeps slipping . Need an engineering degree to operate the mechanism . Hard to clean up . Should have listened to the reviews before made the purchase . Would return it but after 5 or 6 uses the plastic shaft is cracked . That must be why they sell replacement blades and shaft .	-1
I bought two of these Mini-Mate choppers several years ago ; one for my mother.One quit working after two uses . Seems like many others experienced this problem so it is a quality control issue and some reviewers reported that the replacement units also had short life spans.The other one still works today and I use it a couple of times a month . It 's great for chopping small quantities of onions and garlic . Be sure to insert the blade correctly as it can go in both ways and the reversed blade is for pulverizing hard items and does not chop . Grey part of spindle must be on top for blade to cut . Cleaning is easy ; the cup and blade can be rinsed and placed in the dishwasher . The motor can not be washed , just wipe it with a damp cloth and a little detergent if necessary and then dry it with a paper towel.This chopper is ideal for small quantities of food that would get lost bouncing around in a bigger machine , and it works like a charm . Unfortunately , it has serious durability problems and I would not recommend its purchase . I believe Cuisinart no longer makes this model MM-2M , as it can not be found on their website . Any available units are probably old overstocked items . If you think the low price is worth a risk , go ahead - you may get lucky like my other unit.Anyone looking for an alternative mini chopper should look at the KitchenAid KHB300 Hand Blender . It costs a lot more , but also has other attachments and functions .	-1
I consider myself a coffee snob - so weigh my opinions accordingly . For my residence I use excellent equipment , but for my vacation cottage I just ca n't justify spending [ a lot ] on a grinder - so I bought one of these little things . La Pavoni has HISTORICALLY had a great name in the espresso world , so I figured it would be a passable [ less expensive ] burr grinder ... .you get what you pay for . This is not , in any way , a well made grinder and 'passable ' may be overly kind.I am now on my third one , it gets used intensivly one weekend in 10 and I have only been using them for a year . The burr mechanism is a flat parallel design which has a tendency to overheat the beans as it grinds . Further , the entire mechanism depends on a single small nylon gear which has been the failing point of each one I have owned.It generates static such that you have to brush the ground catcher after every use and with fresh roasted coffee ( we use a Hearthware ) it is unusually tortuously inconsistant ; it can not handle Colombain Excelsio grade beans as they are too large.In all , this little thing is a REAL disappointment . After doing a little research , it turns out this is just a rebadged OEM from a `` European '' manufacturer . Not the best use of [ my money ] .	-1
I bought this burr grinder in order to avoid the coffee mud that you get with a French Press . Unfortunatly , I concurr with an earlier review by saying that this grinder gave me a lot more powdery grinds and hence a lot more mud than my old blade grinder did . If you 're making drip or espresso it 's a great grinder , but I 'm having better luck with the Solis Maestro Plus grinder for French Press . I also found that this machine was a little messy : it tended to spit some grinds out of the port .	-1
I had the older version of the Braun hand blender/chopper for many years and loved it . My motor finally gave out and I had to purchase this newer version . Big disappointment . This turns everything to babyfood ! It does not chop , it purees . I recommend the KitchenAid chopper . I believe the price is usually around $ 39.99 . It 's worth the extra $ 10 . Also , KitchenAid can handle a bit more volume .	-1
Mine quit working when the filter basket mechanism failed and water would not pass through it after about 6 months . It made good coffee , but I do n't think it gave me the value I expected . Seems like it should last longer than that .	-1
Purchased this item March 2007 , totally broken down and out of warranty July 2010 . This is not your mothers Waring blender that it will last a lifetime . This is a cheap plastic item that you will throw into the landfill after couple of years . It is a good example of Braun quality .	-1
As one who works in manufacturing , I know the pressure to deliver a product to the consumer at a price he or she is willing to pay , BUT continuing to produce a product with a long-term design problem is inexcusable . Braun should recall all of the MX2050 blenders due to the design of their drive gear . The plastic gear breaks once too much torque is applied , and the teeth simply shear off.I have a suggestion for anyone looking for a general purpose blender . Go to eBay in the `` Collectibles '' area , and look for a good old Oster or Waring - one from the '60 or '70s . No , these older blenders may not have the latest CPU technology , or fancy modes , and they may be the wrong color , but they work ! And , they will continue to work after the Braun has chewed up its next drive gear . You can buy a really nice used Osterizer or Waring for less than $ 25 on eBay , and either will outlast the MX2050 .	-1
I use this blender primarily to make smoothies with yogurt , frozen fruit ( strawberries , peaches , etc ) and water , and I fill the jug with the ingredients . Sometimes the frozen fruit will jam up , stopping the blades . The problem is that the plastic gear that connects the blades to the motor becomes stripped over time until it no longer works at all . Mine lasted 8 months , using it perhaps once or maybe twice a week.NOTE : I too researched this on Consumer Reports and verified that my blender is the new , `` improved '' unit that the magazine said was OK . They were wrong.11/06 : Note also that my unit has been at the repair shop for over 2 months waitinf for parts , which are back ordered . I finally got fed up and complained and Braun is shipping me a new unit , which is also back ordered . I hope the new version is better than the old one11/20/06 : Called Braun and demanded that they send me a new one since the parts were not obtainable . They said they would send me one but it is back-ordered . They were very nice over the phone , though.12/12/06 : Finally did get my unit . Alas , it has the very same gearing system as the old one . I guess I 'll be gentle with it and hope for the best , then when it breaks , I 'll buy another brand1/15/07 Am being gentler by feeding fruit in one frozen strawberry at a time , but this time it actually burned out -- smoke started coming out . Into the trash	-1
After arrival everything WORKED PERFECTLY , just as CR reported . I just wonder how they do a rigorous test on appliances such as this . I think they tested this brand new . Anyway , this is made unusually cheap for a Braun product . After some months , the Braun PowerMax became the Braun PowerFlop ! Others expressed similar results gears broken etc ... Now I 'm looking into The Oster Beehive line close in price .	-1
I love this blender . Well , I used to ; I do n't anymore.I have had two of these blenders in the past eight years . The older one burned out about a month ago . ( Ironically , in that same week , two other Braun appliances -- a hand blender and a coffeemaker -- burned out , too . Died . Dead . ) Today , the second blender , as did the one before it , lost its cheap plastic gear-teeth , and I ordered another blade assembly . In both instances , the gears broke ( see photo ) while making bread crumbs , although , each time , the glass jar was only about a sixth full , and the bread was first torn into small pieces . I initially bought these to grind ice but found them useless for that.The good news is that these blenders and their cheap blade assemblies are no longer sold in this country . When this one dies , I will purchase one made by Breville.Braun was a great German brand known for design and engineering , but its reputation for quality went downhill after Procter & Gamble bought Gillette in 2005 . ( Gillette had acquired Braun in 1967 . ) In a new development , De'Longhi , the Italian manufacturer , bought manufacturing rights to the brand in 2012 . Maybe the Italians will restore German quality to Braun .	-1
i cook a lot of indian food , and many recipes call for pureeing various spices , chilis , and other vegetables into a paste . this is what i bought this blender to do . much as i love my food processor , it does n't really turn out a smooth puree , especially with small amounts of material.this blender has failed completely to puree anything . i even tried to make hummus , and all the machine did was thow the ingredients onto the side of the jug and spin the blades uselessly . maybe it would puree a very liquid vegetable soup , but that 's not what i bought it to do .	-1
After reading the reviews I was convinced this blender was the best for the money . I mostly make smoothies and similar textured things and this blender ca n't keep a blendable mass moving . It is also terribly noisy and shaky on the low setting and the icons on the control panel are hard to decipher . It gets one star because the glass and blades are sturdy ( not much help if the machine ca n't do the job . ) I considered returning it , but decided to avoid the hassle and use it until it burns out , and then replace it with something else ( do n't expect this to take too long . )	-1
Discount any review of a blender that reflects only several months of use . As a smoothie addict , shoveling a dozen or more ice cubes into the jar daily , I 'm still looking for a machine that can go the distance ( is a full year 's use asking too much ? ) . The Braun burned out in the first 90 days , faster than my Black and Decker , Oster , even Hamilton Beach ( though it lasted longer than Back to the Basics ) . The best thing I can say for the Braun is that it does n't have the impossible-to-clean push buttons ( always look for a single switch , a knob , or a touch-pad ) . Otherwise , their shavers have served me better , mowing down whiskers more dependably than ice cubes.I 'm going back to the beginning and giving the classic single-switch Oster another try , though I 'm beginning to feel guilty about cluttering the landfills with more broken machinery and useless glass jars . [ Update : I decided to give the reconditioned Kitchen-Aid sold by Amazon , currently at a drastic price reduction , a try . So far , so good . It 's solid and heavy , built like a fortress . ]	-1
A few months ago we searched for a new blender , and the trustworthy consumer magazine rated this one a good buy . In this case the magazine was wrong ( although I still trust and use their recommendations ) . We bought this blender on their recommendation despite reports of broken plastic teeth . After a couple of weeks of making smoothies the same thing happened to ours . It seems that Braun could spend an extra $ 5 to make teeth that hold up , and this blender would STILL be a good value if it were $ 5 more expensive , but believe the reports , the plastic teeth break easily and quickly with any hard use !	-1
This blender is awful . We 've had it a few months now , and while it appears to be well-constructed of heavy glass , basic no frills controls ... the blade connection in the bottom of the container is plastic and it strips out of the motor constantly . We end up grinding the plastic more than combining what 's in the blender .	-1
Most people say lot of good things about this kettle , I agree with them.However , mine now takes a longer time for auto shutoffto kick in . I 've removed the Ca build up with no avail.Now I am shopping for another one .	-1
I had to though mine so did 2 of my friends becouse of rust inside !	-1
I thought this was a good idea when I bought it . This feels like one heavy pan . I use cast iron skillets for just about all my cooking , including crepes . This pan feels heavier than any of them though I doubt it actually is . I had no troubles following the direction for seasoning the pan . All cast irons need proper seasoning . Once seasoned cast irons become semi-nonstick . I have not had any trouble with sticking . I did have a problem using the cornbread recipe that came with the pan . It more than filled the pan . To really be usefull you need to know how the capacity of the pan which is not provided . It looks like it would be great for scones too .	-1
Purchased this and used two times , the tray that holds the water is warped , the top does n't fit tight , the eggs do n't get cooked , half raw , difficult to clean and hard to get the eggs out of poaching tray .	-1
It was so banged up that the lid would not open and I could not push it out . I do not think it was the shipping issue since packaging and the box it was in looked perfectly fine . I think the manufacturer placed defective , banged up bread box inside the box . Also , the description extolled its flat top that could be purportedly used to store more stuff on top . No way . It is so flimsy , it seems like even a piece of bread on top of the box will dent it.And it also seems super large in size . I am surprised people say it is a great box for a small kitchen . No way ! It is huge . You can fit two loaves of bread in there and then some .	-1
Bought this as a gift for my mom - was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box and it was severely dented ( which caused the paint on the underside to chip ) . She decided to keep it as we were able to pop-out some of the dents and she was did n't think anyone would notice the chipped paint on the underside . It was strange because the box was not at all damaged , but the item was a mess . I had read similar reviews and ignored them . Very Disappointed .	-1
I bought this exact same dish rack from another company ... . I liked this dish rack for the stainless quality and for looks . I was very disappointed that it has no sides , therefore cups and bowls , etc fall out continually . Nor does it hold many dishes at one time . The drained water stands in the bottom tray and has to be emptied with each use . The stainless steel will indeed last forever , but not in my house .	-1
I got this at a grocery store thinking it would be great since I only drink a little bit of wine or sake at a time.I ended up giving it away to goodwill after a few months because it does n't really help the wine or sake ( at least not for weeks like I 'm prone to need between glasses ) and it is annoying to use the plastic thingy , trying to get it tight and worrying that you 're going to break the bottle.I think a nice reusable cork kind of gadget would do just as good a job , take up less drawer space , and look prettier in the bottle .	-1
I felt like I wasted money buying this . The pack only cools your wine bottle if it 's about half full . If I had to guess , it drops the temperature about 5-10 degrees F , so it 's not very sufficient I 'd say .	-1
I got the nutmeg twister specifically for adding nutmeg to the top of homemade eggnog . Its elegant design makes it a lovely addition to the table . Unfortunately it produces flakes and chunks of nutmeg which seriously detracts from the enjoyment of smooth and silky eggnog . I also like to add freshly ground nutmeg to homemade horchata . Even coarsely ground nutmeg would be acceptable , but again the chunks and flakes are unpleasantly left on the tongue . This texture would be acceptable in baked goods , but just does n't work for beverages .	-1
I saw this grinder on display at a small kitchenware shop and gave it a few turns . It easily produced a cloud-like drift of the thinnest possible nutmeg shavings ! Of course , I bought one , but mine never worked remotely as well . It had all the problems described at length by other reviewers -- the spring slipping , the need to constantly readjust , not being capable of grinding the whole bean , seemingly not sharp enough . It was so different from the demo grinder that I contacted William Bounds and they sent me a replacement . It was to no avail . Wm . Bounds company advises putting the nutmeg into the receptacle , and then turning it upside down to screw the top on . I 've faithfully done this , with marginal results and this action must be repeated many times during the life of one nutmeg bean . Apparently , some people have gotten a good model , which means that Wm . Bounds should really be taken to task for their poor quality control . I see that Peugeot is producing a similar grinder , and it may be worth trying . Or , since Wm . Bounds guarantees their products for life , I might just send this one back and try again . There is a $ 6 shipping fee ; mail to : Wm . Bounds , Ltd. , Attn : Repairs , 3737 W. 240th St. , Torrance CA 90505 with your grinder , the description of the problem ( `` does n't work '' ) , your return address . Or there is always a little microplane grater at a much lower price , which works wonderfully .	-1
It was red . It was cute . It was lead-free and exactly the right size . I was like toad when he saw the motor car -- I had to have it . One click , and it was mine : smooth , shiny , and European-made . And now for the reasons I consider the pan a bad investment : * I spent a lot of money on a pan that can break -- and I know that because I broke a Le Creuset pan in half even though it only fell a very short distance . * The interior needs to be babied -- and I 've been doing that with this pan since I scratched and chipped my previous Le Creuset pans . I find the pan not that easy to clean , even when coated with oil before adding the food . * One of the excellent qualities of cast iron is that can handle high oven temps -- not this pan , I had to pay extra for a stainless steel knob so I could cook at 450 . * The walls of the pan are quite thin . * I doubt that the lid of the pan seals well . * And now the major reason for the poor review : the hole for the knob screw has rust coming out of it , causing the lid coating to stain ! If size and price are of major importance to you , you might like to look at the seasoned Cajun Dutch Oven in the 2 quart size . You will have to maintain the seasoning , but it it in the $ 20 range and has no knob hole .	-1
I have many Le Creuset pots and dishes , and am somewhat of a brand loyalist . What a disappointment this one turned out to be . It began to develop chips in the enamel , after only a month of use ( which included NO steel utensils , only wood or silicon or other `` enamel safe '' items ) .	-1
I received this pot as a bonus with purchase . If it had not been free I would have been very disapointed ! I cook every day , and this pot is only good for boiling water . It is imitation and in my opinion should not have the Le Creuset name . I would never pay $ 40.00 for a pot of this poor quality !	-1
Product was not well protected and arrived in pieces . Upon further inspection it was marred prior to delivery . Color was true to color shown .	-1
First use - blew a fuse immediately . I excused it -read all the reviews..pressed lighter , etcsecond use ... blew a fuse AND the juicer.Useless at this point and BTW it is not even on the B & D website	-1
I have had many high-end centrifugal and gear juicers which require throwing in the entire fruit so I wanted something that would be quick and easy to clean . This is neither.With the Black and Decker name I thought it would be a quality item . It is n't . It takes a long time to juice a grapefruit - or an orange , and it does n't do a very good a job leaving pulp in the skin . Too much pressure stops the motor , not enough and it does n't turn . The automatic reversal seldom works . Cleaning all the pulp from the strainer is near impossible . Cheaply made - the handle on the plastic container broke with hardly any pressure.If you are really interested in a citrus juicer , read all Amazon reviews ( do n't just read the good reviews ) , go for one that will cost you more but do the job better .	-1
This was a Xmas gift . I used it once . The scecond time I used it it broke on the plastic canister where the handle is.I spent time trying to find a customer service for this item . There was n't any . Or even a listing where I might get a new canister.Sure there 's a warranty . But I do n't have the receipt or any info on it.At least my hand-held juicer is sturdy and not make out of cheap , defective plastic ! ! ! !	-1
We bought this to replace our 25 year old can opener after the blade on it snapped . We looked around and quickly discovered that finding an inexpensive opener was easy but a quality opener was going to be a difficult task.Out of shear frustration we ended up selecting this Black & Decker . At first it seemed `` ok '' , but after just a few months we are back to using our old `` manual - hand wind '' opener . The reason is that the top lever is too cheaply made and it flexes . Over time ( not much time ! ) it gets too loose to hold a can anymore . We lock it in place , it spins an inch or two and the can drops onto the counter . Repeat this scene over and over ... ! At the end , the lid is never ( REPEAT - NEVER ! ) separated from the can - ever ! It 's back to the hand held and a search of a decent electric continues .	-1
Here 's the deal -- I 'm a sucker for the free shipping option . So I went with these cookie cutters ( which cost less and had free shipping ) instead of my gut -- I had borrowed the Wilton cookie cutters from someone else , but I figured : How different can they be ? Here 's how:1 . The Wilton cookie cutters are larger in scale , so for little hands , it makes them easier to use and larger cookies for easier decorating.2 . One-third ( I counted ) of the non-letter Rosco cutters have those insets other folks have mentioned , making them useless for making cookies ( because you 'd have to literally dig out the cookie dough from those parts ) . I kept them for my little girl , in case they 'll work with her play clay ... but it sure makes them pointless for cookies.3 . Unlike the other reviewers , my Rosco cutters arrived promptly . But again , I wished I 'd spent a bit more on the Wilton cutters.Have fun using your cutters , whichever you choose !	-1
I wish I would 've returned this toaster immediately . The levers work poorly ( one broke completely within 6 months ) . Long toasting time - with uneven results . Bagel feature isnice , but I certainly overpaid for it . This toaster is onit 's way to the landfill .	-1
I bought this toaster nearly a year ago . After six months it began toasting unevenly . Not happy with this as I have to flip the bread in order to toast it all over . I would n't waste my money on this one again !	-1
I like the design , it 's user friendly , space efficient , aesthetically pleasing , etc . But it comes WITH spices that I would not have chosen , plus who knows how they were produced ? That part was n't clear to me . For people who buy their own spices , be aware that many will not fit in the spaces . Too bad , because I love the way this one looks ! If you are not attached to buying your own spices , and are happy to use the ones that come with the rack , then it 's an excellent deal so go ahead .	-1
Despite what the photos and descriptions show , this product has plastic bottles . Flimsy , thin plastic bottles . They fall out when you rotate the rack and do n't fit properly into it . The spices in the plastic bottles were aged and turning brown . I do not recommend this product at all . Buy something , anything else .	-1
Looks great , Heavy , powerful . I have all Kitchen aid products . They look great together.The problem is with making smoothies . Frozen fruit is apparently hard to push around . It catches on the sides and jambs the blade.The blade is spun by this small black toothed gear attached to the top of the motor . It 's made of a rubberized plastic type material which is molded over a metal piece . That connection will break as experienced by other users.I 'll assume that that type of mixing may have not been anticipated by the engineers . All other tyes of general blending may not tax that connection as hard as frozen fruit.Therefore if you blend frozen fruit get a different mixer.I got a Waring Pro uses the same designed coupler but is replaceable for $ 5 .	-1
As mentioned in other posts this blender leaves a lot of chunks in the bottom . I use mine every morning for protein shakes and I always have banana chunks left over at the bottom . The design of the plastic base that is attached to the glass is also poor . If you leave the unit assembled while in the dishwasher you get about two cups of water after it runs through the cycle . I think I can fix this by drilling some holes in it but I may get too much noise . Other than that it is quiet however I will search for a different brand next time .	-1
I finally decided to take the plunge and get a new blender -- a really nice one , right ? I figured since my experience with my KitchenAid stand mixer has been nothing but outstanding , I could n't go wrong with their blender.Let me sum it up for you : It 's big and heavy -- the base alone weighs about 10 lbs . It 's clunky to use -- lifting it off of the stand is awkward . And ultra-power ? Hardly . It 's like buying a Ferrari and getting Yugo ( you remember those , right ? ) horsepower when you step on the gas.This is coming from a gal whose main use is whipping up some protein shakes and frozen drinks , so it may be different for you . But unless you enjoy powerlifing in your kitchen instead of the gym , go with another brand .	-1
I could list all the things I did n't like about this blender , but I wo n't . You might wonder how anyone could screw up something as simple as a blender , and the only thing I can figure is that when they designed this one , they felt that they needed to do it in a way that differentiated it from other blenders that have been popular for a long time . The result is a confirmation of the wisdom in the old saying : If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . I did n't use mine enough to have any of the failure problems described in various reviews here because I hated using the thing . Okay , I 'll tell you one things I did n't like about it . It would n't blend a banana into a protein shake , no matter how long I let it run . Why spend money on a blender that wo n't blend ?	-1
Looks nice but not functional . Not much power , and the food gets caught in the bottom . It does not whirl around , including from top to bottom , like my cheapo old Oster . Also the lid is wide and has a lot of nooks and crannies to catch food in , so a lot gets wasted on the lid unless you scrape it all out . Disappointing .	-1
Yes that is the only problem ... it does not blend . If you put items in that were first blended with an Oster then it would work . You can put in fresh strawberries and blend it for 10 minutes at any speed and there are chunks of fruit ... .always . This blender does not blend . Also , the pitcher ways a ton .	-1
Bought from Amazon ( $ 59 ) August 24 , 06 . Died August 30 , 09 . Had n't used it in 2 months when I took it out and nothing ... . no display , dead . Two days later it lit up and worked ... once and never again . So I conclude it 's the digital control unit.Well , I emailed KitchenAid and they said being it was over one year that all they 'd do was sell me a refurbished for $ 27 . I do n't know if that includes shipping.Went to Fred Myers and bought an Oster 2534 for $ 20 and for backup the Hamiton Beach Walmart had on sale for $ 10.I hate to sound my age or wax poetic over the past BUT back then when you bought an appliance you never gave a thought to it failing to work long and hard . It was a given . I still have an Electrolux canister vacuum that beats any canister around . I inherited it in 1973.From what I understand you can not repair your own KA hand mixer because `` Parts not sold separately . Must be purchased as a complete unit '' .I ca n't find the digital control unit for sale anywhere . Has anyone here repaired one of these mixer him/herself ? I 'm not going to just throw this thing in the trash can.We were thinking of getting a KA stand mixer , classic or Artisan , but not now . Bad quality , short warranty , no parts.I must say , I 'm disappointed . I expected a heck of a lot more . My last one lasted 17 yrs . and it was the cord that failed . I would of fixed it but decided to treat myself to a fancy top of the line mixer . This KA is made in China btw . Price is no longer an indication of quality.Oh and good luck with KA 's website . It 's awful . You have to have flash installed or forget it . The HTML ( non-flash ) site does n't work for me . AND I can not find a list of authorized service centers . Anybody ? I 'm waiting on their email , again .	-1
I bake about once a week and bought this because my old Oster hand mixer burned out after more than 10 years . Was very excited after reading all the great reviews . I was so shocked when I used it the first time - cake batter splattered out of the bowl ! Never encountered this problem before . Had to transfer batter into a deeper bowl . Then had another shock when I used the whisk to whip up cream - cream splattered all over my counter ! And yes , I did start on low and slowly cranked it up . Am returning it .	-1
I bought this item just before Christmas . The first time I used it to mix cookie dough the beater wires bent . I contacted Kitchen Aid via live chat on their web site and they said I should have used the dough hooks . On their web site it says that the beaters easily mix cookie dough . The speed selection is a waste too . For what this mixer is capable of doing , they should have just had a High , Medium and Low setting . The 9 speed function is just a marketing ploy . Not only are the beaters low quality but also are out of stock for 30-60 days . I ca n't even beat eggs with it now . I do n't know if I will waste the $ 15.00 for new beaters . I would not recommend this item to anyone . I have previously bought several Kitchen Aid appliances including a stand mixer.02/14/13 update . Bed Bath & Beyond replaced the entire mixer . I use the mixer but not for anything heavier then cake batter .	-1
UPDATE : After exactly one year and one day , from purchase , one of the beaters broke again . This time , the cheap wires simply sheared from the shaft while wife was making chocolate chip cookies . Luckily , KitchenAid sent me a new set , but it took almost three weeks , we had to use the wisk attachment until then . I 'm surprised others have n't experienced this more often. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Disappointing that the beaters are so cheaply made . The wisk end is press fit into the shaft . The beater was already loose when I recieved the mixer . I can only hope that this was done intentionally to prevent damage to the mixer.Fortunately , my workplace has the ability to do stainless steel welding . I 'm going to ask for a replacement set and sell them on Ebay . The demand is going to be high for them !	-1
I 've enjoyed KitchenAid products for years so I was very interested in having the KHM7T replace my old lower-powered 5-speed KHM5DH . Amazon describes the KHM7T as having a 1.6 ampere motor rated at 200 watts . ( Actually this should be more like 192 watts at 120 volts AC , but who 's quibbling ? ) Imagine my disappointment when it arrived and proved to have only a 0.6 amp motor which rates no better than 72 watts . That 's no better than my KHM5DH . I told KitchenAid of Amazon 's error . As the KHM7T is sold nationally the error will occur regardless of where it is sold . Otherwise a different model number would be required.There was no problem returning it for a full refund.An August , 2011 update . Amazon.com still describes this mixer as havinga motor rated at 1.6 amps . This is a blatantly inaccurate descriptionconsidering the unit I received . Do n't believe everything Amazon.com tellsyou . The Amazon blurb should have been corrected years ago .	-1
I have the 5 qt bowl and bought this set for my sister that has the smaller bowl . The bigger ones fit mine perfect , but they were too small for hers . The smaller size certainly did n't work for her smaller bowl as good as the bigger one did for my bowl .	-1
I have a 5 quart bowl , these are five quart lids , Simple ? No , not really . They do n't fit.Great Frisbee 's though .	-1
I thought these would be great for baking storing icing or refrigerating cookie dough , these were I bit to small for my bowl so just make sure you order the right size .	-1
I concur with the others , these do not fit the Artisan mixer . I did a lot of research on line , including with KitchenAid , to be told that this lid fit my mixing bowls.It does not .	-1
I bought this thing for my mother because of limited counter space . I thought it would be a really heavy duty and long lasting kitchen tool . Sadly it lasted for about 2 months of daily used before it failed . The failing was related to tolerances between the wheel and cutter depth . I was very disappointed when she had me look at it for possible repair . It is a riveted together and stamped steel piece of crap . Surely not worth what was paid for it by half . Save your money .	-1
I had really hoped based on some of the previous reviews this was the King of can openers . Well I have had this attachment and used it a fair bit for a year , maybe actually even two now and have to officially declare it no better then any other o.k . at best electric can opener . It really only works sometimes on some cans and usually take several revolutions just like most electric can openers . It only gets worse with time just like most electric can openers . Far too often you are left with a lid you have to open the rest of the way with a manual can opener just like most electric can openers . It sticks out of the front of the kitchen aid like an ugly sore thumb unlike most can openers.I still find a good manual can openers to be far superior to any electric option . It 's funny when you think how long cans have been around and how hard it is to find an easy powered way to open any can automatically and efficiently .	-1
Bought this can opener attachment because I have had my kitchen aid mixer for years and have been very happy with it . I though I could not go wrong by buying the kitchen aid can opener attachment but I was wrong . It does not grasp the can properly thus creating and even cutting surface on the can . After using this attachment I still have to get out the manual can opener to finish opening the cans . I will be returning this product shortly . I am very disappointed after spending all the time to research and the money this thing cost is just seriously flawed product . Do n't buy this attachment .	-1
The juicer splatters juice everywhere near it . The little pulp strainer constantly falls off into the juice . It is an ergonomic disaster , since you have to bend your wrist up , push forward , and resist the machine . We 're getting a separate juicer and ditching this disaster .	-1
If you want to grind your own meat , I recommend buying a real meat grinder instead . This is great if you want to juice your meat , because that 's all I could get after it clogged up before even putting out a clump of ground meat.I have used this one other time and it worked OK but was painfully slow . I thought I 'd use it to grind this half pound of meat this time , but noooooo , it just could n't handle the task . I ended up giving up , digging my meat out of the clogged up apparatus and using the food processor . Thirty seconds and done .	-1
I purchased this product with high hopes of grinding my own organic chicken and grass-fed beef . I have to say that I was pretty impressed on how well the product grinds the meat , but not at all impressed or happy with the gray metal ooze scraps that are intertwined with the meat on the way out of the grinder . I am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend it to anyone . I have returned it and hope to find one with the same outcome without the metal ooze .	-1
Wow guys , are you serious . Inferior metal , ridiculous cutter material , cheap metal with no edge . Plunger a crime that it was changed into a 2 and one . Plastic sucks guys , period . All I see is a company that was great pouring gas on the fire to extinction.I 'm done with Kitchen Aid , ruined by over seas labor that has redesigned themselves to non existence . Nice goin greedy fool whom made these silly choices .	-1
If you want to kill or ruin your K'Aid Mixer , then this accessory is the perfect one to do it ! ! I bought this piece of junk last year and thought ; `` Oh , goody ! ! ! Now I got a food grinder for my K'Aid mixers . '' Boy , was I wrong ! ! ! This unit is just a worthless piece of junk that should be left right where you see it ; on the store shaelves ! ! ! I went to use this for the very first time , and it made my K-5SS Stand Mixer 's motor start to labor badly - amost to the point where it was about to stop working and die altogether ! ! Liquid had leaked into the transmission and messed up the gears badly ! ! I was almost faced with a $ 125.00 repair bill ! ! ! I had to finish the job with this unit attached to the smaller K-45SS.But luckily , the mixer began to rebound in the days ahead and has mended itself back up to full operating speed ! ! It works fine now . But as a precaution , I sent this ill-fated piece of junk back to where I bought it from ! ! I 've since bought a separate electric food grinder , which works beautifully ! ! Do yourself a favor . leave this in the stores ! ! Also , it 's shown with a wooden pusher . That is truly false advertising because , ; like the rest of the unit , the pusher is plastic now , had been for a long while ! ! ! Do n't buy this . It 's and ill-fated piece of junk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ~Daquan13 .	-1
I should have rad the reviews before I purchased this one . I trusted the brand name - big mistake ! Countless other customers had the same problem I encountered : when grinding pork , gray stuff fell every now and then down into the bowl . It appears to be shavings of metal . When researching the issue , I found many websites with blogs where customers elaborated on their bad experience with this meat grinder . KitchenAid should have recalled this item a long time ago !	-1
I was looking forward to making sausage and tried the day after it arrived . A horrible afternoon followed with mush rather than ground meat produced , and stopping several times to clean the mess stopping the mush from exiting the grinder . Also , my wife noticed the black stuff exiting around the hub.Seeing others complaints and the fix of inserting a washer to fill the gap between blade and disc I tried it and it grinds as if should with the fix . I will be looking to Kitchenaid to supply me with a thicker blade to solve the problem as another reviewer did . I should n't have to do it myself.Follow up : called customer service who insisted there is no quality problem but I insisted on replacement under their `` no hassle '' exchange policy . Received the replacement and the cutter blade is dramatically different in look and thickness . No gap between the cutter and the plate . They must have had a bad batch of cutters . They should at least admit the problem , I suggested they read the reviews and they will see there is an issue .	-1
Short and sweet ... BUYER BEWARE . Second time using this attachment a gear broke loose and chipped the Artisan tilt back housing that holds it in place . Mixer was able to run on one speed only . KA had no sympathy at all . Repairs were same cost as replacement , so we trashed it . Wife was upset - I was/am angry . Do n't be like us , get a dedicated meat grinder with a reverse function . SHAME ON YOU KITCHEN AID .	-1
If you 're going to use your Kitchenaid strainer attachment ( KitchenAid FVSFGA Fruit/Vegetable Strainer and Food Grinder for Stand Mixers ) for anything more than a cupful of food at a time , you 'll need this attachment too . However , it is seriously flawed and there is n't much you can do about it but put up with it because you really need this part.Frankly , this food tray should be built into the fruit & veg strainer attachment hopper and not a separate item . Because it 's separate , if you do n't have the tray shoved firmly against the hopper of the strainer you will have liquid leaking out and down the head of your mixer . You have to constantly keep alert so the easily bumped out of position tray does n't cause problems . It 's a poor design overall , but better than nothing.If you 're going to to the trouble of setting up the fruit & veg strainer you 're probably going to process a bushel of tomatoes or a pot of cooked apples into sauce , right ? Messy jobs , and this design of separate parts is bound to make the job even messier.I am not at all impressed with the Kitchenaid system for fruit & veg strainers . I used an Oster mixer for 30 years , with all its many attachments , until the plastic parts just fatigued out . The Oster 's strainer system was far superior in capacity and simplicity . But I do like my new Kitchenaid mixer better ... just wish the fruit & veg strainer system could be sent back to the drawing board.I 'm seriously considering using aquarium grade silicone glue or something to permanently attach the tray to the FVSFGA hopper .	-1
nice large size . The food grinder attachment is worthless . And I love kitchen aid . But their food grinder is way too expensive and does a terrible job on not only fruits but meat as well . Sorry kitchenaid I hope you read this your product sucks .	-1
What a leaky , messy contraption ! Got the tomatoes ready . Assembled the thing , and placed containers to catch the juice & pulp and the seeds and skins . Oh boy ! Of course I might have had a better experience if I had not been laughing so hard . And yes , Virginia , it got on me and my clothes . I sent a note to KitchenAid and -- -they did not respond . At all . Who is KitchenAid hiring these days ?	-1
Too slow , gets clogged alot . My hand crank strainer is much better to use even with all its problems .	-1
First I must confess that I have wanted a stand mixer for years . As I was researching grain mills I found this , and used it as my excuse to buy the mixer . I love the mixer , but the mill is terrible . I wanted to use this mainly to grind gluten free flours , however rice comes out much too grainy to be of any use in baking . Even after several runs through the mill it has the consistency of large grains of sand . I tried to contact Kitchen Aid via e mail to see if there is any kind of internal adjustment that can be made , but they never got back to me .	-1
I have been pleased with my kitchenaid and most attachments for it , but not this one . This attachment puts a very large stress on your kitchenaid and you risk ruining the motor and/or gearbox . If you intend on grinding grain any more than very small amounts very infrequently , you really need to purchase a real grinder.What I did not like about this grinder:1 ) If you try to run wheat through it to grind it finely and are trying to grind a cup or more you risk ruining your machine . You really need to run the wheat through several times . First on a very course setting , and then on subsequently finer settings.2 ) I was never able to get the flour as fine as I wanted . Yes , I know this is whole wheat flour , but this mill can not produce the fine flour possible with other home units on the market.3 ) This unit is very slow , and it takes a long time to grind a cup of wheat.What I did like about the grinder:1 ) if you are making corn meal for cornbread or tortillas , this unit does much better . For the courser grind needed in corn meal , I found this unit to do an acceptable job.I basically gave up on getting anything useful out of this product , and ended up getting the Wolfgang/KOMO stand alone grain mill . I find it outperforms this kitchenaid unit by a long shot . I have also had good luck with the Nutrimill unit .	-1
The slicer/shredder : I find the slicer does n't work good . If you want to shredd a cabage or potatoes for a meal there is a lot garbage produced until you are ready . The grinding plates are very dull and you need to use a lot preasure to get the job done . I should have returned it ! The fruit strainer : Is producing a mess and very bad to clean ! Would not buy it again ! I 'd rather try a manual one ! The grinder : Good for small jobs . Tried sausage making with it . Took two people and more than 4 hours to process and stuff the casings with it . Okay to clean.Overall : To me a waste of money and cupboard space !	-1
The meat grinder leaks . The shredder/ slicer is not effective . It can not even thred the mini carrots . No comment on the strainer since I have not used it yet . Overall , a very dissapointing buy .	-1
Sausage stuffing kit - sweetjuicing kit - okslicing kit - really weakthey just are not sharp , it would have been less work to weld knives to a car tire then cut carrots that way.I 've said my piece .	-1
I did n't bother coming here first because Amazon wo n't ship this attachment to Australia.Anyway , I finally got the thing the other day , after a lot of trials and tribulations , from a local store that was able to get it for me . And after all the effort and waiting to get it , what a huge letdown . I honestly expected more from KitchenAid.I have not used the grinder to grind - I did n't need a food grinder . I only purchased it to make pasta , and the plates are made to be used with the food grinder only.I have worked as a professional cook , have successfully made hundreds or maybe even thousands of kilos of from-scratch fresh pasta in my life , and have never come across such a reputable manufacturer offering such a poorly designed product as this . Shame on you , KitchenAid.For years , I 've used my little Italian hand-cranked pasta maker , and thought I 'd try this one because it would allow me to make tubular macaroni . I also thought the extrusion process would be easier than cranking . Not true.As others have said , getting the consistency just-so for extrusion is tricky . A couple of batches ended up in the rubbish.The object is to continue to drop walnut-sized pieces of dough into the tube , while also catching the pasta as it comes out of the machine . Because it tends to get warm and stick together in one huge blob , people on the KitchenAid boards have suggested sprinkling the emerging pasta with flour . And for this , you need three hands . Those of us lucky enough to have been born with three arms may find it a breeze , but the rest of us will struggle . And this is not even to mention the additional mess ( and wastage ) of the sprinkled flour ! By the time I was finished ( or rather , surrendered ) , the place looked like an explosion in a flour mill ! ) .The first disk I started with was the noodle disk , and then went to the lasagne disk.I ca n't see how the lasagne disk can be used for ravioli , as it has a `` join '' in tbe middle of the dough ( which can be seen as a transparent streak . This is because the dough is actully extruded from this disk in two pieces which join when they are dropping from the disk ) . I ca n't see that pasta holding up to being filled and boiled.The instruction booklet ( it was the European version ) was a letdown - only one recipe - `` Basic Egg Noodle dough '' . The recipe in English was in the `` home style '' volume measurement of cups , whereas the European measurements were in weight ( used by professional cooks , because it 's more precise ) . I used the European ones , except that was difficult to translate the names of the ingredients ( KA , please give us weight recipes along with the volume measurement ones , in English ) . I could n't believe that the KA website does n't have any recipes ! Do they really want to sell these things ? The instructions could have been clearer . I expected to drop a walnut-sized piece of dough into the machine , and have at least something come out . But the first piece is for the 'screw ' . It takes until the second piece and beyond , before you start seeing pasta . They could 've mentioned that , as I thought I was doing something wrong.I do not recommend spending money on this pasta maker ( the food grinder might be good . I have n't tried it ) . The only thing this purportedly does that my hand-cranked one does n't is tubular macaroni , and after seeing how it handled simple fettucine , I have my doubts about it ( also , the instructions said that macaroni could not be dried and kept , but had to be used within 4 hours of making , which may not always be practical ) . I 've decided that if I need macaroni , I 'll buy it ! The rest will be more than adequately handled by my dependable Atlas machine ( for which I now intend to get the add-on motor ) .Now , I think I 'll go to ebay and list this attachment , since I have no need for the grinder part , and the pasta function is pretty dismal .	-1
I had nothing but bad luck trying to make pasta with this junk . The extruded pasta stuck together and is really a pain to try to pick it apart . I tried tweeking the recipe that came in the manual but still no luck . Not worth the bother . I am getting a roller attachment for my mixer . Total waste of money , time and effort . KitchenAid should take this off the market .	-1
Tried to slice ... ... .did n't work ... ... .tried to shredd cabbage for slaw ... worked barely . Definitely not worth the hassle and clean up .	-1
This is faster than trying to slice large quanities of veggies with a knife , but poorly made . I agree 100 % ! with the 1 star review by Steve `` SRG '' ! If you are thinking of buying this read his review first . A neighbor had just bought this so I got to try hers first , thank goodness ! Does n't work well at all . Blades are n't sharp and are already starting to rust on hers . I would only use this if I were trying to slice 10 or 15 pounds of cucumbers for pickling or some other major slices endeavor .	-1
This was a gift . It was one of those gifts we should have returned for store credit but my husband , for some reason , wanted to hold on to it . Which is ironic , as we have had it for 2 years now and he has never used it.I have used it to shred carrots , zucchini , cheese , and onion.It did not work for the onion well at ALL . It shaved off large chunks which went all over the place . I detest chopping onions and I thought this would be a quick and easy way to chop up an onion for meatballs but instead I ended up with a huge oniony mess and still had to chop up another onion by hand.Worked well on the cheese - swiss and gruyere ( sp ) - but truthfully I do n't find shredding cheese by hand to be THAT difficult and I only used this that time because we were having people over for fondue and I was running way behind schedule . So it saved time in the shredding but I had more stuff to clean up afterwards , I 'd have been better off planning my time better and having extra time to shred by hand.For the carrots and zucchini - I like to make muffins with these for my son because it 's an awesome way to sneak veggies into a preschooler ; - ) . It is very tiresome to finely shred 3 cups ( packed ) of carrots by hand . This makes it much easier ... but it lets a bunch of these big chunks through in the process , too , so you have to go through and pick out the big chunks by hand ( Toddlers notice big chunks ) . Does a better job with the zucchini but still not perfect . Biggest advantage over hand shredding is it seems to make a little less juice since the process is lighter on the squash - but still not recommended unless you are shredding a lot of zucchini.My biggest problem with this device is , well , for the work involved in setting it up and cleaning it , and for the amount of space it takes up in your cupboard , you really might as well get yourself a food processor . It will do more , and probably do it better . This is really pretty much a waste of space and money IMO .	-1
This is the poorest excuse for a slicer/grater I have ever seen ! It simply destroys things like potatoes and carrots . The cones are absolutely not sharp . I did get an e-mail reply from Kitchenaid which suggested that I return them to the place where I purchased them - fat chance when I got them in a set ! They obviously know there is nothing they can do to make this attachment work - which is what I asked about - I thought maybe there was something I was doing wrong . I must say the food grinder works swell and so does the strainer attachment so I do n't feel completely ripped off . Sorry to say I did n't read the reviews here first ! !	-1
It is not easy to attach and not very good at slicing.Get a real food processor instead .	-1
The hopper is an improvement & designed well for both wide and narrow items.With fresh crisp vegies I still was not impressed enough to keep the slicing grating kit I purchased & returned for a full refund.New modern slicers & graters should sharp enough to cut ok. My kit did not perform well at all.Light will reflect off a dull cutting edge , it 's as simple as that.A dull cutter will make any electric tool motor work harder than it should.Did I just buy an oddball set of cutters ? Nope ! A sales person opened another brand new box and the slicers were dull.The shroud attatchment gets stuck easily in the mixer until it 's inserted and removed a few times . A drop of cooking oil helped that . My grandma would put a drop of cooking oil on the bronze bushing to lubricate & prolong its life.Cutting foods the same length & no taller than the hopper improved performance a little .	-1
A sausage stuffer should provide maximum pressure to force meat down a narrow tube without incorporating air . This does not do that . Like others have pointed out , there is no seal for the plunger , which means it is difficult to force the meat into the `` grinder '' attachment . Once there , the spinning worm gear does not provide enough force on its own ; only forcing more meat upon it with the plunger will help it to extrude properly . Even then , more air is incorporated . And , of course , it is far too high off the counter surface for sausage stuffing.While the idea of using a hand-crank stuffer when you have all the power of a Kitchen-Aid right there may seem unappealing , a cheap hand-crank stuffer will be far more effective than this . I urge you to go that route . You might think the low price on this piece may make any suffering worthwhile , but I urge you to reconsider .	-1
This attachment is worthless ! ! If you really have your heart set on making your own sausage , then buy a real 5 # sausage suffer . You will end up packing more air into your sausage casings than meat . I honestly used this once and it went right into the trash .	-1
I purchased this kit along with the food grinder attachment so that I could make sausage without spending a ton on a separate stuffer . I 'm now going to buy a separate stuffer . The kit worked , after a fashion , however ... Being a conversion kit to the grinder , it naturally is elevated about a foot or so above the counter . The means that you can not allow the stuffed casings rest on the counter as you stuff . The weight pulls the casing off the horn.Also , trying to feed the ground meat through the machine was messy and difficult . You had to feed meat in , add more meat periodically , control the feeding of the casing , hold the sausage as it filled and , since you 're doing all this stuff at once , start and stop the machine periodically . It 's nearing impossible and very frustrating for one person to do alone.Also , depending on the consistency , much of the meat came back up the feeder neck as I pulled the plastic plunger out . This means re-feeding the meat 3 or 4 times before it actually gets through the machine . A /very/ slow process .	-1
... .of folks who are n't happy with this attachment . Made sausage for the first time , last night . It took FOREVER to stuff 3 lbs . of breakfast sausage into the casings . I was doing this all by myself and my arms nearly fell off , they got so tired . The ground meat feeds into the tube at less than a snail 's pace . I will be saving up for a REAL stuffer .	-1
I have many Kitchen Aid appliances including my dishwasher , stove , microwave and refridgerator . Obviously , I have brand confidence but I 'm not happy with this cheap plastic product . I feel the same way about most of the plastic add-ons -- they simply do n't stand up to the test of time . My meat grinder cracked and I replaced it with a vintage metal model which will last for years . This product is way over priced considering it 's about 25 cents worth of plastic .	-1
So the first time I used this I saw meat squeezing out the ring that screws on over the sausage nozzle . I then used the included plastic & # 34 ; wrench & # 34 ; to screw it on tighter . Though that solved the issue of meat squeezing past the ring , when I took it off I saw the flared flange base of the sausage nozzle that is held tight to the face of unit by the screw on ring had cracked . while it is still useable for now I wonder how long before that crack develops into a problem requiring replacement . After one single use this is not acceptable . I believe the pressure that this unit develops even at level one which is what I had it on at the time is simply too great for plastic pieces to handle . The stainless units by another manufacturer are indeed 3 times the price but I doubt they would break like this cheaper plastic stuff has done . The nozzle that broke was the one inch larger nozzle not even the smaller breakfast sausage nozzle so I am almost afraid to use it . This was a waste of my money , do n't waste yours ... .	-1
I 'm one of the many people who have said `` I got the grinder attachment and it 's great ... but the stuffer sucks . '' Well , it would be nice if it sucked in the right direction ... maybe pull the meat through with the auger , but it does n't . Yes , I 've seen it work properly on an episode of `` Good Eats '' but Alton had a different , no-tapered feeder that is apparently no longer available . My experience with it was taking over an hour to stuff 5 pounds of meat ( which was growing warmer and consequently less safe ) .But here is the worst part : even IF you can get the darn thing to work , you 're essentially doing a second grind to the meat . That 's just not good sausage making.Do n't get this product . Either resign yourself to making sausage patties with your KA grinder attachment , or commit the money to getTSM 5lb Sausage Stuffer . I do n't own that specific model , but I got a nearly identical product from Amazon from another maker . 5 pounds of meat goes into collagen casings in about 1-2 minutes . Admittedly you get a couple extra items you have to wash , but it beats the aggravation of wrestling with the KA stuffer .	-1
I 'm a pasta neophyte . Making my own bread has convinced me there 's as much art as science in a good dough but I 've tried these attachments with 3 different recipes with disappointing results each time . Fettuccine performance was so-so , making hand-separable noodles but the linguine cutter is really lousy . It just makes a corrugated ribbon .	-1
First , let me say that I love KitchenAid products , and have the stand mixer and many of its attachments . The pasta roller is the first piece of equipment that I 've had any trouble with . The problem ? The shear pin -- which is a non-replaceable part -- snapped during use , rendering the roller useless . Unfortunately , this happened about six months after the 1-year warranty ended . Now , I understand the reasoning behind having a shear pin to protect both the mixer motor and the operator . But generally , when made-to-fail parts are employed , they 're designed to be REPLACEABLE . Not so with this gadget.The only reason I 'm giving this thing 2 stars is because of my long and happy history with KitchenAid .	-1
I bought these attachments back in 2005 or so and except for a few cleanings they 've never left the shelf or have been used . Today I discovered the white plastic scrappers on the roller one is cracked at about a dozen places and I assume if I run it they 'll crumble . This product either does n't age well or needs periodic lube job .	-1
But I have to say that I purchased this item to use with my KitchenAid stand mixer to be used as a splash shield which I realize it is not.I found it to be desperately needed when mixing items that are fairly liquid , like my pumpkin pie mix . However , what is really needed is a splash shield and I realize that the name does n't really say anything about shielding splashes , just pouring . And for that I suppose it 's ok , although I do n't know that it 's really needed for pouring ( guess depends on the type of item ( s ) your mixing . When I 'm done , I still have to check the wall and items near the mixer for splashes , which are always there . I suppose it would be good for adding flour or other powders maybe.Also I treat it with kid gloves when storing and washing as it seems to be somewhat flimsy , I 'm afraid I 'll break it . And be careful when using it as there is not a significant overhang to secure it to the bowl . One time my attention strayed slightly and I must have been holding it with my hand and it just slipped off one side and INTO the bowl . Thankfully , I was on the lowest speed mixing and I yanked it out ( probably not wise ) immediately.I know this is the only shield out there for KitchenAid and I can admit it is needed . But the product is DEFINITELY overpriced .	-1
While checking with KitchenAid customer service regarding this particular pouring spout I was advised it was no longer made nor sold by KitchenAid due to the complaints by customers of the 2 piece design and it falling into the bowl . I was advised to purchase the 1 piece pouring shield for my mixer and am so grateful to have read other comments on Amazon by customers advising to call KitchenAid ... such a great site where consumers rule and are not limited to speak the truth.I have since purchased the 1 piece pouring shield , bowl covers and an extra bowl for my mixer .	-1
I bought a kitchenAid stand mixer for light use at home to make cookies and now the machine is leaking oil . Apparently this is a common problem because if you search the internet about this machine leaking oil you will find several blogs where hundreds of people complain about it . Please do research about this machine before you buy it . By the way , my daughter just got one for xmast and hers is also leaking oil . Check out this site and you 'll see how common this problem is and how the Kitchenaid company refuses to fix this problem . [ .. ]	-1
The Classic worked fine when I was making pizza dough once a week with 2 cups flour but when I started using it weekly to knead bread dough with 5 cups flour it started leaking grease/oil . Not up to the task .	-1
I think this was my favorite gift this Christmas . My bread making experience has progressed from letting a bread machine do it all and hating the loaf shape to letting the bread machine knead and raise the dough to form my own loaves . OK , but I wanted more output . The first batch of dough from the KitchenAid K45SSWH used 8 cups of flour and pretty well max-ed out the bowl capacity . Dough definitely climbed the hook and had to be un-hooked several times while I adjusted the water content . That much dough slamming around really torqued the bowl onto the stand and it took a strong twist to unseat the bowl . I 'm 6'- 1 '' , # 200 and I mean a strong twist . Actual mileage may vary . Fit and finish of the machine and attachments looks really good . My wife is interested in pasta attachments so we 'll update as our experience grows.Revision 1Update from 2nd batch of bread dough.10-speeds ? I do n't think so . I found 5 speeds numbered 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 & 10 . However , this may be a manufacturing defect . While changing speeds from 2 to OFF , the machine detected a weak contact for the STIR speed . Jiggling the control is necessary to re-activate the STIR speed . Generally speaking , weak electrical contacts demand higher current to maintain power so they suffer a shorter lifespan.The bowl was easier to remove this time . Break-in helps , I suppose . I plan to query KitchenAid support about the issue of speeds . Will post the outcome.Revision 2 , 1/23/2012I have swapped e-mail w/ KitchenAid support and the issue is still open.Revision 3 , 1/23/2012KitchenAid support has arranged a warranty replacement with a pre-paid shipping label for return of the defective unit . Let 's see how the new mixer works.Revision 4 , 1/26/2012After initiating return procedures 1/20/12 I received a replacement today . I 'm satisfied and enlightened . The K45SSWH is NOT a 10-speed mixer . I presume KitchenAid `` dumbed down '' the description to address a demographic with a 5th grade mentality . The K45SSWH is a VARIABLE speed mixer with six detents or presets , if you will . As the speed control is moved from Off/0 to 10 it clicks into 6 notches at STIR , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 & 10 . Between those notches the speed increases at a variable rate . My wife noticed the variable speed aspect of the replacement unit and I found it present in the original . The only fault with the original unit was the unreliable operation at the STIR setting ... and the confusing description of the speeds . KitchenAid could avoid some customer service overhead by using a better description .	-1
I have been making espresso and cappuccino for nearly two years , first on a Delonghi pump espresso maker , and now on a Gaggia Baby . While I was waiting for my Gaggia to arrive , and I had already given away my DeLonghi , I borrowed this Krups . It makes normal drip coffee as well as any $ 30 machine , but for the extra money , it is incapable of making espresso . In order to make espresso , you need a pump to pump water through the very fine grind ( espresso is a grind , by the way , not a roast ) , and you need a boiler with temperature ( thermostat ) control . This unit has neither ! For temperature , it merely passes water over a heat coil ( called a `` thermoblock '' ) which merely heats it up randomly until it has enough pressure to steam through the tube , thus charring your espresso grounds and producing a black burnt watery substance which bears no resemblance to caramel-striped espresso . Considering you can buy a Gaggia Carezza for around $ 189 here at Amazon , a top of the line semi-commercial Italian machine similar to what you 'd find in a cafe , and any old coffee maker for $ 30 or under , there is no reason to buy this Krups . I can only imagine that 90 % of its cost is pure profit -- it certainly is n't justified by its innards .	-1
I had one of these Krups Bravo espesso makers for about two years before the heating element started deteriorating to the point where it took 10 minutes to make a single carafe ( 4 cups ) of espesso ... the heating element kept clicking on and off about 5 times before it was finished . This was very frustrating since I use it every weekend and NEED my coffee quickly in the mornings.So , I got a brand new one this past Christmas , the Bravo `` Plus '' . `` Plus '' must stand for `` ... '' because the very first time I used it to make espesso the heating element worked MORE POORLY that my two-year-old one that I was replacing ! It took over 10 minutes just to make one carafe full of espesso ! Anyway , I 'm never buying Krups again and I DO NOT recommend this specific model . It ... .	-1
While I save the expense of filters , it just does n't give me that clean taste of coffee that another more metallic brand of permanent filter gives me . In fact it has the look of gold colored nylon versus the more & quot ; solid & quot ; golden filters of other brands.Cleaning it is a bear , not so much getting the stains out , that works well enough , but it takes a lot of water to finally purge the filter of grounds that accumulate in various nooks and crannies.But it 's still probably in improvement over the paper filters .	-1
After 15 years , my Atlas pasta machine gave up the ghost , so I replaced it with this one . What a mistake . The directions state that you should run a batch of dough through the machine to remove any residual grit left over from factory assembly . But , the amount of machine oil and dirt being removed was incredible . I ran two batches through and was still found large amounts of oil and dirt coming out . Further , the dough began sticking to the machine and would n't go through fully . I do n't know if this was due to the amount of residual factory oil in the machine or not , but it made a real mess . I spent about 1/2 hour with a toothpick cleaning it out.Worse , during the second batch I noticed that chrome was flaking off the rollers.At that point , I gave up and returned the machine . I 've since gone and bought another Atlas pasta maker . After running dough through it once , I seem to have gotten all the factory dirt out , and it 's working just fine now .	-1
first , it 's not made in Italy , maybe CucinaPro 150 is , but 177 is made in China . I used around 10 times , and the attachment fell apart , totally . And the price is n't worth returning . I opened the attachment , unbent the bended comb and put it back . Now it 's working again , but I am still unhappy about the quality . I will buy a better one when I could n't fix it anymore ... ..	-1
Being an avid cook and baker , I had wanted something that would give me more options with pasta than the electric Simac that I already own . After much anticipation , the machine came , and this was nothing more than disaster ! ! What a dissapointment that was.. It would not clamp firmly to the table , much less the counter.. It must be operated as well as held down all at the same time , thus the need for 4 hands.. while trying to roll out the pasta , it did nothing more than roll it up into little balls under the cutting mechanism , or shread the noodles.. This then led me to the task of cleaning . being Not made from something like stainless steel , you can not use soap and water to wash it , and much of the dough remained stuck underneath and inside the mechanism ( s ) . even upon letting the dough dry in the machine , it was next to impossible to brush or dig out with a tooth pick ... Definately not worth the money or the time..	-1
Clamping system to hold machine to counter is awkward , unbalanced , finicky and once you get it positioned just right it comes loose during use . Cutting wheels are aligned poorly ( unless you like double wide fettucine , ours cut only every other noodle . ) Customer support is almost non existent . I say 'almost ' because you can go to their website and send them an email . Just do n't ever expect a response . They get one star , because I ca n't give 'em zero .	-1
I have several issues with this machine ; * You have to have a very specific type and thickness of counter or table for the clamp to work . I do not have the correct type/thickness . Therefore I must have one of the kids hold the machine while I use it . Since the kids are n't really strong enough to totally hold it in place , I end up partially holding it myself while trying to use it . * The handle falls out constantly , and I 'm worried it will fall on the kid 's head . * There are numbers on the dial which are suppose to show you what size the rollers are set to ... but on mine they are printed in the wrong place . They are totally off of the holes , half the dial shows the wrong number when set to a hole , half shows no number at all . * The instructions do not tell me how to put on the spaghetti/fettuccine attachment ! I have n't figured it out yet . So I have been just cutting the pasta by hand ... Therefore this pasta maker ends up being a $ 30 , very hard to use rolling pin . * The recipes included in the instructions do not anywhere near work . I had to add way more liquid than the recipe listed.It gets the dough flat IF you can manage to use it . But that 's about it . It 's cheap because it is very cheaply made . You 're better off just getting a cheap rolling pin until you save up to buy a better machine .	-1
So I bought this on behalf my little kids who wanted to give this to their Mom on Mother 's Day.On the very first use , it broke after about 10min . I was amazed how flimsy the internals were vs the exterior build . Amazon was great in the return process . I pitched in some extra $ $ $ for the kids so that they could get Mom a better one ( from another brand ) that looks similar to this unit but does not break .	-1
I was totally blown away by the terrible quality of this rack . Basically , the rack comes unassembled . You get the frame and the drying rack dowels . The wood is cheap and thin . The unit is wobbly and fragile . It is difficult to string the pasta through the narrow slats . This rack is highly over-priced . The low quality and the cheapness of the construction of this unit is sub-par . The only redeeming quality of this rack is that it is a converstation piece .	-1
Previous reviews say it well . This is simply to confirm : - difficult to store- very cheaply made- requires assembly- not worth the money at any priceAlso , it 's not very tall . Perhaps I just stink at making pasta , but my pasta was entirely too long when compared to the height of the rack .	-1
Received the dryer and assembling it would not be a BIG DEAL even through no instructions were included BUT UNBELIEVABLY they also `` forget '' to drill a hole for the screw to go through one of the feet at attach the base to the upright ... well , ok still no biggie IF I HAD A DRILL however the screw needs to be recessed on the underside of base to stand flush so I 'd not only have to own a drill BUT a 1/4 '' circular chuck to recess the scream head into the foot to allow it to stand flush ! RIDICULOUS where was the quality control here ... more trouble than it 's worth to either fix it or send it back ! I 'd suggest that you buy a dryer you can `` see '' in a brick and mortar store .	-1
I 've bought two of these ... the first one I had trouble using , so I gave it to Goodwill . Someone recommended it again , so I thought maybe I was just using it incorrectly . Still same problems.My main problem is that the plastic press that makes the indentations and the metal frame have somewhat sharp edges , and I 've had problems with it cutting into the dough and creating a weak spot that opens during cooking . The pasta dough is n't generally flexible enough to adapt to the sharp corners and shape of the plastic press plate . I heard that adding egg makes the dough more pliable , and also used semolina flour . I 've been trying to make whole wheat pasta and have finally perfected a recipe . It works okay with this frame , but I still think the design is not the best.I 've also had a problem with overfilling that causes the ravioli to `` mushroom '' below the frame , which makes them difficult to remove.I just purchased a different version that is a solid mold ... there is no overfilling problem at all , and it works better than the Villaware V5500.Ravioli Maker - 2 ''	-1
I was excited about this purchase , but it was broken . The timer and light worked , but the plates did not heat up . The amazon seller said I could not return it to them because I had thrown away the box . But the seller said I could call Hamilton Beach for a replacement . I did , and Hamilton Beach said they will send me a replacement . I hope the new one works .	-1
This can opener was given to us as a wedding present . We previously owned a Black & amp ; Decker cordless hand-held can opener which we loved and when it comes time to replace the Krups , we 'll be looking for another Black & amp ; Decker.One of my primary complaints about this opener is what makes it unique : the crimping edge which removes lids from the side instead of the top . I often use canned items such as cranberry sauce or tomato paste . The best and easiest way to remove the food from the can is to remove both ends of the can and push one end through the can . The food is removed from the can cleanly and completely . However , you ca n't do this with the Krups Open Master Can Opener.Another thing Krups could have done to make this opener more versatile is to make it cordless instead of having to be plugged into the wall . We have a large kitchen and it 's much easier for me to bring the opener to the food prep area than the other way around . Unfortunately , there is no outlet near that end of the counter area ! Additionally , the Krups is often difficult to attach to the cans and I find myself using a hand held Swing-A-Way $ 5 opener 95 % of the time instead of the more expensive electric model .	-1
Hopefully it was only a bad one because I 've read so many good reviews of it ... but the first time I used it , it overheated and the motor stopped working - permanently . Thank goodness for Amazon -- I returned it and bought something else that works great !	-1
I searched specifically for a BURR coffee grinder ( a specific type of grinding mechanism ) on amazon.com and this came up so I ordered it . Subsequent research led me to conclude this is not a burr mill at all as amazon.com erroneously categorizes it . Fortunately I was able to cancel the order just in the nick of time . Now I 'm off to find a true burr mill and I doubt I will be ordering it from amazon.com.The only saving grace is that I was able to cancel the order just in time , but clearly amazon.com searches are no longer to be trusted .	-1
I 'm sorry to report I bought this based on its great reviews . After a short lifespan of infrequent use , this unit went KA-PUT . Just like that.KRUPS - out of `` warranty '' . Wish I had n't tossed my old funky Toastmaster- it was 18 years old and still did the job .	-1
We purchased this because of the excellent reviews . But once we opened the box , we opted to return it because the grinder cup and blade are not removable for cleaning . The product instructions emphasize the need to keep it clean because residual oils become rancid and spoil the taste of the coffee . But the only way to clean it is to wipe it out . There is no way to clean the blades , under the blades or in the tight places that we want to keep clean . Our last grinder had a dishwasher safe grinder cup and blades ; we 'll purchase a different model with the same feature .	-1
Pros : It does grind coffee wellCons:1 . As other reviewers have said , the coffee grinds are caked along the metal bottom of the grinder . They 're packed in there so well you need to scrape them out.2 . The smaller ground particles tend to stick to the plastic surfaces , too , so that when you up-end the unit to dump the coffee small particles fly all over your countertop.The oval shape and gap from the inner wall are probably the cause for these issues.There 's a lot of work to get the ground coffee out of the machine and it makes a mess . I ca n't recommend this product .	-1
This grinder in the UK has twin blades , that are reported to work extremely well.Here , in the USA , you only find a single blade unit.In addition , it seems suspect to me that they only list the blades as stainless steel here in the USA , but NOT the grinding bowl.In the UK , the bowl is prominently listed as stainless steel , as it should be.There is no online contact info for the company so it would have to be called to find out why this is so.I have noted that this is standard practice now , with so many food preparation devices , here in the USAwhere one part is stainless and the other aluminum . This way , as the food is prepared , small amounts of aluminum get ground into the food.Even commercial food prep devices , such as mixers , are being sold here in the USA with Stainless Bowls , but soft aluminum blades and mixing attachments that also leach aluminum into the food . This is surprising for a commercial mixer , as in the old days , if I remember correctly , their parts had to go in high temp dishwashers , or be bleached . Now they are forbidden to be handled in this fashion . We are instructed to wash them in gentle water and soap.Pasta makers for this country are now sporting aluminum rollers , but being sold abroad with stainless.A medically trained friend of mine asked , `` Can you spell , purposely induced , Alzheimers anyone ? `` I think I will pass on this unit , and purchase a non toxic grinder , with all stainless parts that touch my food , if one can be gotten.If I find that I am wrong about the bowl , and it turns out that it is stainless , and the plastic top is not made with BPA , as so many plastic containers and tops are for food prep items ( such as the Vitaprep and Vitamix machines , where food hits the soft plastic and scores it , at a reported 200pmh , so now due to consumers noting that , they have replaced it with Tritan tops whose composition is not available , according to the company ) I will re-post.However , based on my findings of other food prep machines , it is likely I wo n't be back .	-1
I had an Krups that was over 25-30 years old and very user friendly , so when I melted the cord by leaving it near a burner ) - : it was a no brain-er to buy another Krups.The old model was exchanged for a newer and deeper container which might have worked except for the fact that whenever I check the grind to see if it is fine enough , I am unable to get to cover back on . If I try , and push the cover on by forcing it , the cover then becomes too difficult to remove a second time and when I try , coffee flies everywhere.My counter is a mess every time I grind coffee . I will look for another brand .	-1
After only a month or two the little plastic things that held it together broke and it literally fell apart . Do n't buy this one .	-1
I never had the chance to love this product like so many others have . The first unit I ordered , upon turning on , emitted a burnt plastic smell . I thought maybe it was a defective item so I exchanged it . I experienced the same thing with the second unit . I did not bother with a third try . Perhaps it was a bad batch with Krups .	-1
I bought this to grind nuts and flax seeds to put in my smoothies . It would always leave some almond chunks no matter how long I ground . In fact , if I ground for too long it would start to turn the grounds into almond butter while the chunks just spun around . Finally , after a year the motor would run , but the blade would n't spin . Adios , Krups grinder . Into the landfill with you .	-1
Broken after a year . Way too expensive for what it does n't supply , mainly 'mist ' . An overpriced 'toy ' . Customer service is excellent , however , and the broken part was replaced at no charge.I agree with one of the other reviewers ... If the oil is heavy , such as EVOO , the oil will come out in a stream . The best I can say is that the Misto might make an adequate plant mister .	-1
I recieved this as a Chirstmas gift and was excited . I had seen it ... It worked ok but not great -it was not a fine spray by any means . After a month and a half of using it a few times a week , the cap of the pump cracked and it no longer works.Pretty disappointed .	-1
I really liked this but it got really gross black mold very easily . It does n't spray exactly like a Pam or other type spray but it does still work .	-1
I do n't know how this gets so many great reviews . I have to pump-prime it every time I want to use it , it dribbles oil all over the spout , and half the time a fat dribbly stream of liquid comes out instead of a nice broad stream of oil . I like being able to add my own good oil , but the spray quality is terrible .	-1
I really wanted to like this product . I bought it thinking I was going to love it . And I did , for a while.My problem is that you can only fill it half full of oil so it felt like I was constantly filling it with oil after very little use . In addition to that after you spray oil on your pan for a short amount of time , you have to stop and repump it to that it will continue to spray a fine mist . Also it quickly got clogged and as one reviewer has stated , once it is clogged ; it 's goodbye Misto . I used mine probably less than a year before we finally went back to buying already canned spray oils.I guess I should have read the reviews because it sounds like if you know the tricks and take the time to do the work such as loosening the top , you will be able to use this item for a long time.good luck to other purchasers .	-1
Perhaps if you are just using this to spray a little oil on your food , it 's ok . But it sucks for baking . I do n't used the pressurized oils like Pam since they leave behind a film after baking that does n't wash off . So I really wanted something that could spray *just* oil . BUT I can only get 5 muffin wells sprayed before it 's 15 pumps . So for 12 muffins that 's 45 pumps . And the spray IS uneven -- it does n't coat well at all . It 's just easier to dip a paper towel in margarine and wipe it on .	-1
The object is badly and cheaply realized . I already shared an image where is possible to see the internal plastic part of the cap that came-off at the second pumps.Another problem is that part of the oil is 'sprayed too thin ' , more then spray it you atomize it , so that the atomized part is too 'light ' and 'stay in the air ' instead pf your food , and eventually fall off the dish and you can even breathe it ! I had one I bought in Italy that was half the price of that one but worked well for 2 years , so no excuses , that works wrongly because it is cheap , cheaply done not cheap in price .	-1
Well I thought this was a good idea . I wanted to stop buying pam spray and use the oil that I like to use . I was not satisfied buy the results . I put my oil in and pumped the air in and tried to spray it on my baking pan and it was n't a consistant spray . You have to refill often . Needless to say I am still buying pam spray .	-1
I own one of these - it sits up on the top of one one of my kitchen cabinets , unused . I bought mine several years ago when it was much more that this one is now - however , I still think it 's overpriced and ineffective . Why ? Mainly because it 's just too damn hard to work with - If you read enough of these reviews , you 'll see that you just ca n't pump it up and leave it that way , 'cause it clogs up if you do that . So , you have to pump it up each time you use it , and then release the pressure each time . Really ! Well , if you 're OK with that , I suppose this is a fine little single use device - but I think it 's just a royal pain to go through all that silliness - here 's my more satisfactory option.I went down to my local restaurant supply store , and I found a quart sized sprayer , you know , the kind with a big pump handle , not unlike the kind that many disposable cleaners come in - and in fact , that 's just what this little item was intended for - so the pump mechanism is nice and strong . And since it was empty , there was no worry about toxic residue in the plastic , as would be true with a used Windex bottle , etc . The price ? All of $ 1.64 ! I bought it thinking , `` Hey , if it does n't work for oil , there are a 100+ other uses for it . `` I took it home , washed it up , dried it and filled it with peanut oil ( no problem with filling this one all the way up with oil ) - gave it a few pumps , and voila , it was spraying oil as fine or as thick as I wanted - I love it ! Really friends , there is no reason you have to endure the agony of this ill-conceived device - as long as you get a manual pump sprayer with a good , sturdy mechanism , you 'll have a better device for spraying oil - and less expensive too . And do n't worry if you do n't have a restaurant supply store in your neighborhood , Wal Mart sells these things too - hell , I bet Amazon sells them too.There is one area where Misto is admittedly better than my big pump handle oil sprayer - it looks a whole lot sexier . But frankly , I do n't care so much about the looks , as long as it works better , easier , and costs less . Yes ?	-1
It leaks olive oil all around the nozzle . All the pressurizing and releasing pressure and then it just dribbles and has very little ( and very uneven ) spray . Too messy . Too much hassle . Went back to using Trader Joe olive oil spray .	-1
Do n't know what went wrong , but ours was dead on arrival . I had heard good things about it , but now I 'll never know ...	-1
I found this product easy to use , but it aresolizes the spray more than the Pam or other nonstick sprays . I recommend using this underneath an exhaust fan or outside . Breathing the areosolized oil posses a danger . I do n't recommend for the use of oil unless you can protect your lungs.. I will use it as a water mister for my plants filling it only with water . Does produce a good mist .	-1
There are several devices out now that use air pressure to spray canola oil , or other oils with a high smoke point , to lubricate cooking surfaces without the abuse or cost of store bought aerosol sprays . They can be used to lightly spray flavored oils or olive oil onto salads or even sprits water or brandy onto cooking loaves . It is a really good idea and it saves the environment and money The problem is that this device , and I 've had two , leaks badly.The seal at the bottom of the chamber gives out under pressure after a while and then it starts to ooze out and becomes a mess . You get it on your hands and clothes . The nozzle also can clog up and it goes from delivering a spray to a stream , probably not what you want when lubing the grill of an already burning BBQ . Once could be just a bad item but I 've had two bought in different stores and both developed the same issues . That becomes a design flaw probably brought on by the low price.Sure it 's tempting to go for the cheap item but do n't do it . Pay a little more and get one that is going to last and not make a mess . Personally I 'm very happy with the `` Prepara . ''	-1
I 'll be quick ; it leaks like you would not believe ! What a great idea , but cheap components make it worthless . Ours leaked within a few weeks and the retailor refused to take it back . Save yourself some time and frustration and just throw a $ 20 bill in your trash - it 's quicker and less harmful to our environment . Or better yet , keep the $ 20 in your pocket and pass on this all together .	-1
After a month , all I get is a stream . It sprayed at first , but now it is useless since it only shoots out a stream . I 'd advise looking for something higher quality .	-1
I believe I received a defective one . I never have trouble with anything I buy on Amazon , with the exception of my last two purchases . I was never able to get this thing to work and had several people look at it who already own one and everyone said it was defective . Ugh . I was too busy to send back and missed my return window .	-1
I had bought one from Costco that I liked okay so decided to get another one for avocado oil ( also from Costco ) . The two not only look different , but this one appears to be poorly constructed . It does n't spray as well or hold the pressure very long . I 'm sorry I bought it . Will undoubtedly throw it away before too long .	-1
I do n't know why it is that no company can make a mister that works and LASTS . I have gone through more of these gizmos than I care to tell you . I have followed the instructions of how to fill , how to store , how to twist , how to untwist , yada yada , but all to no successful end . It 's a throwaway item . I find myself opening it up and pouring it out , that 's how I know it 's ready for the garbage heap .	-1
Tried pumping , could not build any pressure . Apparently was a poorly handled previous return.Reported to Amazon , they quickly sent a new one . New one was empty and clean , holds pressure works as described .	-1
doesnt work as designed . difficult to guess how much is half full , , , should be see through . the pump only holds a small amount of pressure .	-1
I really thought I would love this . I was paying an outrageous amount to buy olive oil in spray can 's from the store and thought this would be a really great way to apply only a limited amount , but not pay the cost ( per oz ) that comes with the spray can.Unfortunately , it does n't spray well . At first there is too much pressure and it 's just a stream , then it becomes a mist like spray ( what I wanted ) but it only last a second before it becomes too low a pressure and it starts a very jerky uneven spray.After only a short period of use , I suddenly realized I had used almost a whole bottle of olive oil already . I was paying less than the spray can , but I was consuming more than 10 times the amount of oil I thought I was using . Needless to say , I have the added weight gain to show for it.Also , with normal regular use , there ends up being oil all over the canister , the table , and a lot of other surfaces around the general spray area of my food prep area .	-1
We used to have a pampered chef sprayer and it worked much better than this thing . The lid has separated from the plastic pump part . But more annoyingly , the spray is like a jet spray from a fire hose not a nice even mist like the pampered chef kind .	-1
Got it , really no directions were included , but it says fill half way with your favorite oil and pump with cap on then take cap off and start using . Sounded easy enough - NOT ! This thing has not worked since taking it right out the box . I would return it if it was n't so much of a hassle . I would not recommend this - such a shame .	-1
this is a bit too much work to get the olive oil out to spray . It does the job it intends to do , just a bit too much effort involved .	-1
I bought this before there were written reviews . Like a lot of other people , I had to go through all sorts of experiments to try to keep it working . It never had broken pieces , just stopped working . I used very light oils , too . Nice idea , but it 's still just an idea , not a reality . I ca n't believe they 're still selling this junk .	-1
I had no problem buying this because I already owned one that has been working well for years . This time I am not happy with the purchase . It drips more than it sprays and it basically just makes a mess .	-1
Wired product . I do n't really get it ... Thought it would just be a spray but everytime you need to pump it and it does n't leak ... . It looks pretty on the countertop but that 's it	-1
It worked well for two or three weeks , then -- -no matter how carefully we cleaned it -- -it only sputtered pitifully .	-1
even brand new , it didnt really MIST ... it was more of an enthusiastic dribble ... I have to admit I didnt even keep it long enough for it to clog , so no comment of durability	-1
The idea of having a sprayer to fill with your favorite oil is nice . The sprayer certainly works well when new . It looks very nice on the countertop . But the pump locked up within a few months . That is not surprising since the device is designed to pressurize air I within an oil can . Unsaturated oiled in turn undergo a nasty reaction with oxygen . In effect , the same reaction that hardens linseed oil causes your favorite olive oil to turn into a rancid shellac . Pressurizing atmospheric oxygen within the container only serves to speed the reaction along . Depressurizimg the oil is a good way to spare the sprayer , but it is still doomed to a fairly short life .	-1
I 've had the same issue as others -- stops up if I do n't use it everyday . Would be a great product if it worked when you needed it to .	-1
We filled this mister half full of oil per the directions to leave room for the needed air pressure . After pumping it several times to pressurize the oil in the can , we can only get a few squirts out of it after which it just dribbles out . It 's a lot of work to spend just as much time pumping it up as actually using this mister . Would not recommend .	-1
Bought from bed bath and beyond . Worked fine for about 3 months and then started acting up . Followed directions but oil either comes out like a stream or too much mist that goes every where except the pot .	-1
I am going to say this is a vastly over rated product . It looks nice but the spray is more of a drizzle and the Sprayer leaks a small amount of oil at various points ( notably when depressurizing after use , and in the pump well ) so that it really has to be rinsed after each use which overall makes this more trouble to use than it is worth .	-1
I ordered this off of Amazon and it came in a day before the estimated date.That was great to expect.But this Misto sprayer does n't really `` mist '' it just sprays and splats the stuff outit does n't even cover the area that is being sprayed very well either - cuz when I used to cook with , my eggs got stuck to the pan ... and I had to pump and spray the Misto like 2 full times on a small pan ( 6in in diameter ) and it still did n't do the job ... Whatever , it was interesting to try ...	-1
It would get clogged and not spray evenly even when I would release the pressure . Only lasted 2 months . What a waste . Keep your olive oil in a bottle instead .	-1
I did not purchase mine online , I got it from bed bath and beyond . I was excited to get it , but I immediately noticed brush strokes , like someone had painted on aluminum colored paint . When you look at the inside it is not a metallic color and indeed the & # 34 ; unit & # 34 ; is plastic perhaps bonded to some metal though I think it is n't likely.The unit tends to clog , but they all do and its hard to fault them for that . You have to clean it.The worst part is that is smells terrible . It has a very potent chemical odor , that smells similar to paint . It still smells this way and I 've owned it for a year . I spent several days wondering if I would get sick from using it in case the oil dissolved whatever was producing that odor . I did not get sick or even get a headache , but I have strong reservations about using this product . The product will work if you clean it . The deceitful title & # 34 ; aluminum & # 34 ; and the terribly and questionably safe odor reduce this to 2 stars in my book.This is not made of brushed aluminum . Well I ca n't say that with certainty . Mine is not brushed aluminum . I possess a few items made of quality metal , this is made with neither quality or metal.But it costs ten bucks so if you are as exacting as me you 'll be disappointed but lesson learned get something else .	-1
Cheap , flimsy construction with less structural integrity than a tin can . Worse , the interiour has a strange , metallic odour that does not wash out and that you certainly do n't want to transfer to anything you intend to eat . It has been years since I have seen a truly high quality mister but this is surely the worst .	-1
Throughout the years I have used and owned many different versions of the Brita Pitcher Water Dispenser . All of these filtered water containers have been great . The only complaint I have ever had with these filters is size . The Brita Ultramax Water Filter Dispenser was supposed to answer this problem . Unfortunately due to bad design , it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past Brita products.Pro : Size : This water dispenser can definitely hold a lot of water . ( Ironically , this is really a disadvantage ; as you will find below . ) Con ( s ) : Mold : If you do not let this filter dry within a maximum of two days , you will get mold . This mold will probably make you ill ( sore throat ) ( Conversely if you look at it from another point of view - it will strengthen your immune system ) . To avoid this problem , the water dispenser should be washed every week at very least ( to safe you should wash it more often ) . I have never had this problem with Brita 's other products ( I have friends who never washed their Brita pitchers for months , and there is not even the slightest sign of mold when they do wash it ) .Left Over Water : Due to the faulty design of the product , there will be left over water both above the filter and below it . Besides turning the product upside down , you can not dispense all of the water . This is just stupid and hints at the lack of quality assurance testing of this product . Not surprisingly , this helps further contribute to mold growth.Conclusion : Save your money and buy Brita 's other well designed pitchers or even Pure 's pitchers . ( The key word is pitcher . ) You will only waste time and possibly your health with this poorly designed product .	-1
I followed the directions but this filter seems bad ... I will go to Target to buy anothe one because I dont know how long this filter has been around eventhough it came new .	-1
These filters do n't make a difference in the taste of our water so not sure if they really work . They are the standard replacements for our Brita water pitcher but I wonder if Brita sells better filters that are compatible .	-1
I 've been using Brita water filters for over 10 years now . It used to take over 15 minutes for a pitcher full of water to filter through . But I noticed that the last few packs I bought did n't filter very well , and did so very quickly.Then , the last package I bought is downright silly , the water filters through so fast . I 'm sure you would get better filtration through a paper towel in a funnel . We can assume that Brita has gone south.If anyone know a reasonable alternative , could you post it here ? Thanks !	-1
Rarely do I ever give something one star . I almost could have given 2 stars because my water is okay to drink after I run the filtered water through 3 coffee filters . It is the lack of customer service that caused the 1 star.I have been so disappointed with these filters . It is bad enough that you get activated carbon coming out of the top of them , but 3 of the 4 in the 4 pack had carbon floating in the bottom of the pitcher . Okay , I know this is not harmful , but it really freaks people out . My tap water is horrible and needs a filter . I was impressed with the filter operational specs and did not read user comments before buying Brita pitcher and filters.I contacted the company and they sent me a coupon for $ 7.99 ( it will replace one of the 3 defective ones ) . I am on the 4th one now and we will see if this one leaks carbon too . For as much as these things cost , I should not have to filter particulate matter out of my filtered water . I also would not recommend putting these filters into the refrigerator at all , ever . The water tasted really bad . I ran it under hot water upside down for about 10 min and tried it again . The water tasted better . I am looking at a sink mounted systems as this is not an affordable long-term solution .	-1
this filters filter my water but not as good as the original I got in my pitcher . Seems like it uses a different material inside to make the job . My water taste still a little bad after filtering ... I will try another kind next time and will not buy this one again . I wish theire was a way to know if it was an imitation of the original filters before buy this . Do not waster your money on this ones ...	-1
Yes , as someone else noted , the container for the grounds has a lid and the grounds come out of a small hole in the front that feeds directly into the container . It still sprays coffee grounds all over , because the pieces do n't fit together quite right . I even tried using rubber bands to hold the parts together and they did not help . My workaround is to put it in the sink while it runs so the grounds will be contained.After it is done grinding the coffee , the sink and the grinder are covered with coffee grounds , and cleanup takes a while.It gets two stars instead of one because it *does* grind the coffee , but there has to be a better way .	-1
I bought this unit at a local store in October 2002 and it has already quit working . The motor has NOT burned out and the documentation for it says it has thermal shutdown features . But it do n't function at all anymore ... I bought a 160 watt unit from Starbucks ( vs Capresso 's 100 watt unit ) and ca n't believe the difference . The noise level alone tells the story . Comparing the burr grinders of the two units shows the difference between a well-engineered product ( Starbucks ) and the Capresso . The Starbucks uses stainless steel screw and chisels vs the Capresso 's pig metal nubby burrs.I 'm kinda new at the whole coffee grinding thing and ca n't afford a 600 dollar professional grinder , but I could afford the Starbucks unit which is half again as much as the Capresso . It only goes to show.. You get what you pay for !	-1
Yeah , it does n't grind the coffee fine enough so I end up using more coffee to get my brew strong enough . I bought 2 of these ... 1 for the office & 1 for home use . Dissatisfied with both . You got ta grind it for like 5 minutes to get it even close to being fine enough .	-1
If I could have bought replacement blades for my old grinder , I would have . I looked but could n't find any ... . so instead , I bought one of these , and to start with the box it was in was so flimsy the grinder literally fell out of the package , hit the floor ... . and became instant garbage.Silly me , I stupidly bought another just like it . This one stayed in the box until I actually opened it . I cleaned the grinder , got my coffee beans out , and plugged the grinder into the wall socket ... . and discovered the switch was broken and the stupid thing would n't turn off . I 'd call that a dangerous malfunction.I returned it for a refund . Do n't waste your time or money on this grinder . The name Capresso may be Italian , but this is a cheap machine made in China and it seems to me there 's no quality control because there 's no quality TO control . Skip it , and buy a real grinder like a Krups . I gave this grinder one star , but it deserves ZERO .	-1
I had purchased one of these a couple of years ago . I thought that it looked like a good invention . Boy , was I wrong . The first and last time I used it , the popper caught on fire ! I was scared to death ! To this day , I still have no idea what went wrong . I will gladly stick to stove popcorn made in my Farberware Classic 2-Quart Saucepan . It comes out perfect every time .	-1
I have used the popper for 5 years..I am on my 3rd one , or should I say I am throwing out my 3rd one ! The plastic gear which enables the handle to turn melts like a 2 cents Made In China piece of junk ..Also , their popcorn has a very limited shelf life and goes stale in no time..The product used to be better ...	-1
Made in China ! The gears did not align properly and I had to return it .	-1
But u get what u pay for , and Whirley-Pop is made to fall apart - it also no longer has wooden handles . If u wan na popcorn popper that will last , check out the Great Northern Original : Great Northern Popcorn Original Stainless Steel Stove Top 6-1/2-Quart Popcorn Popper .	-1
I bought this pot and after reading reviews I realized it was not the pot they made years ago . I opened the box to examine the pot , and immediately understood wht some people were burning popcorn kernels to the bottom of the pot.The pot has a coat hanger type of paddle , and it does not ride on the bottom of the pot , it hovers a little bit up from the bottom . So kernels that might start to stick , or not get moved by the whisk type of paddle , plus high heat , equals burned popcorn kernels . That would happen with duds , kernels that do n't pop.I did not like the aluminum pot , it was too light , and the paddle gears were plastic . Plastic is never a good idea for gears , period.I then bought the all stainless model from another company in Amazon , for more money , and it was worth every penny . The stainless pot has all metal gears , and the paddle is flat and rides on the very bottom of the pot , nothing will go under it like the wire paddle can on this aluminum pot . I highly recommend the stainless model . If quality and dependability are at the top of your list , then the stainless model is what you want . This pot is on the way back to Amazon . The picture of each of the pots may look the same , but once you have them in hand , they are much different..	-1
The plastic gears on these poppers do not grip to the metal post/crank and slip . Any resistance results in the user turning the handle but no movement within the popper . Worked great for first year of average or less use but now , pretty intermittant and a really , more pain than worth . I only continue to use it to keep oil buildup off of other pans . We shake , not crank , now . Wo n't buy another as it 's unfortunately yet another disposable product that overloads landfills .	-1
the stirring mechanism works as stated but I had to put a pad below it to even out hot spots . Given a second chance , i would look for a better pan	-1
Bought this for my husband who has always been a big popcorn far . We were going between this and one of the move expensive theater style poppers . My husband loves how easy it is to use and how great the popcorn turns out . As the one who ends up having to clean it it is pretty easy to clean which is a plus in my opinion . For the price it is a very durable and dependable buy.Updated 20 Nov : My husband has used the heck out of this thing since I bought it . The only problem we have had which is the reason I am going down to 4 stars is that one of the wooden `` knobs '' on the top came off and ended up going into the popcorn while using it . He ca n't seem to get it to stay screwed on now and will most likely have to glue it back on . Now sure how that is going to hold up with the extreme heat . Guess we will see . Still a good product for the price.Update 10 Dec : After the initial problem we had we have been very careful with the popper . Unfortunatley last night when I went to wash it by hand the long metal `` stirrer '' came out . Once that happened not matter how hard we tried we couldnt get it to go back in.. Kinda discouraging since my husband really did like the popper . I know it was on the cheaper side but it is discouraging for it to have only lasted for a couple of months..	-1
Ordered this item January 31 this year . Have used it maybe 6 times . No longer holds pressure . Gasket is in good condition . Never had a problem with closing it ; do n't understand the reviewers that mention this . Water sputters all over the stove near handle now . Pressure indicator will pop up indicating it is hot enough , then if I lower the heat even slightly the indicator drops . Can not just leave it on high because the water steams away and the food burns . Pressure indicator drops immediately after removing from heat source . Always clean the gasket and operating valve after use . These devices make me nervous so I 'm very thorough about cleaning and care . At this price , this should have lasted longer than 2 months ! My mother had her cheap aluminum one over 30 years.Regarding Fagor America customer service . Called during their 'business hours ' . Was told to leave a message and will be called back within 48 hours . Unacceptable , this would mean that I am forced to sit at home waiting for the telephone to ring or play 'phone tag ' with the customer service department ? ! Even leaving them my cell phone number would do no good as I do n't have it turned on at home , in my car , in places of business , etc . So again , I would probably only receive a message telling me to call them , and back and forth we 'd go . Being somewhat optimistic , I did leave my name and number . Will update this review if and when I hear back from them.Thinking that maybe I 'd have luck talking to a human at customer service , I tried their other selections , 'to order parts or accessories press X ' . Here again , you ca n't speak to a person , but must leave an address and they will mail you an order form.I can only assume that they are having serious quality control issues and receiving too many calls , hence you ca n't speak to anyone.So here again I 've purchased an item from Amazon that can no longer be returned due to the length of time since ordering . Will purchase my next one at a store so I have some recourse when an item proves defective . As much as I shop on Amazon , this is disappointing .	-1
Worked great for about 6 months using it once a week . One day it was near the end of a 2 hour cooking cycle and it made a `` pop '' noise and proceeded to blow the entire wet contents of the pot out the vent , even after I quickly turned off the burner ! ! I had 3 small whole chickens in the pot , which I cook regularly for my dogs , and out came grease and liquid ALL OVER THE PLACE ! It is a good thing I have a restaurant range with a large side-to-side roll out drip drawer under all burners or this mess would have spilled down through the stove . As it was , I had it on cabinets , floors , counters and 2 '' of grease and mess in the drawer which is 48 '' wide and 2 '' deep ( front to back ) . I replaced the gasket , thinking this was the problem . NOT SO ! Two more tries cooking very small amounts as a test run and and two more messes and I gave up ! It took hours to clean up the mess in my kitchen . I have cooked with pressure cookers for 40 years and have had a variety of them including the very expensive electric teflon coated models ( not worth the money because the coating erodes away quickly under heat ) so I know how canners work.I have tried repeatedly to contact a customer service person through their 800 number and it 's a merry-go-round with the automated answering system with `` leave a message '' as the only viable option - NO RETURN CALL , tried e-mails - no reply back . I gave up , threw it away and bought a fabulous All-American Pressure/Canner and I LOVE IT ( see my review ) !	-1
I bought two of this item because people said that a 1 quart Mason jar fit inside it perfectly . Unfortunately , since those reviews were written , the design must have changed because quart sized mason jars do not fit the yogurt makers that were delivered to me . The glass jars are too narrow and too tall to work well with it . Now , unless I can find a short fat quart jar , I am stuck with the plastic liner that came with the set . Very disappointed . : (	-1
It is just like a slow cooker and it is so small . I had been using a slow cooker to make yogurt by myself and then I thought that I could get a yogurt maker to save my trouble . But after I got it , -- -- I found it is just another smaller slow cooker ! ! You have to go through all the same steps : warm your milk in a clean container ; -- - put it into the slow cooker or the so-called yogurt maker ; put the yogurt seed that you bought ; -- - make sure the temperature not too high to kill the yogurt bacteria ; -- -watch the time to make sure you are not `` overgrow `` it ; -- - take it out.There was at least twice that I thought I needed not to watch the time -- because , it is a yogurt maker and it should stop by itself , but it did not . And then my yogurt turned into something hard to describe -- sticky and very sour.Now this `` Yogurt maker '' is not used anymore at my home .	-1
The Seller maybe `` NEW '' to Amazon as the reference states_BUT I think the Seller needs to check prices prior to posting_maybe reading the post or something rather.Or could this be an investment we need to know about OR the peak cost of GASOLINE per 1 quart_oops ! _per 1 gallon ? ? Good luck new seller on your great bargain basement priced items .	-1
Because of the rave reviews ( there were also negative reviews ) on Amazon , I thought I would try the VillaWare V3200 Classic Belgian Waffler . The first one I received had a broken part . The replacement I received ( Amazon very quickly sent me a replacement ) did n't make whole , usable waffles . No matter which recipe I tried , the waffle stuck to the waffle iron and I had to dig it out . It was a big disappointment .	-1
I ordered this about three weeks ago when it was on sale . Since then , Amazon has sent me three stock pots , each as replacements.The problem is a quality control issue , seemingly with Calphalon . But Calphalon can not directly help me . I called them , but because these pots are made in China , Amazon has to replace them . Calphalon can not issue replacements as they do not have access to them here in the United States.Each of the three stock pots arrive scratched , or with very small holes in the coating from the manufacturing process . It looks like the entire silver aluminum base has been spray painted with the lightest , thinnest possible coating of the dark material that you see , that material which you think is so indestructible.Well , it is not indestructible . It is incredibly thin . Every pan I 've received has scratches showing the silver underneath , dots where when it was `` spray painted '' or however they apply this coating in the factory , the coating did not stick to the silver in some places.Who wants a brand new pot that arrives and already has compromises to the anodized coating ? This is a very poorly made stock pot . It looks GORGEOUS except for the issues with the coating . It sits on my stovetop and if you do not see the areas where it is scratched , it looks indestructible . It looks like a sturdy pot and has the most marvelous handles . It has a very pleasing shape . It looks like something you ca n't wait to cook in . It looks wonderful sitting on my stove top , but I am sending it back to Amazon.If they can ever get their quality control issues resolved , so that I can receive one where the coating is not compromised , I will gladly try to cook in it.Until then , I will wait.EDITED TO ADD : Also , I tried to store this in my cabinet . Just the briefest contact with another pot , and I do mean the briefest ; it barely touched it -- scratched the exterior so that the silver aluminum underneath shows through . So if I ever did end up with one and used it for cooking , I would be using kid gloves to do so . These are not hardy , sturdy pots as they initially appear.~~ > > `` I want to die peacefully in my sleep , like my grandfather . Not screaming like the passengers in his cab . '' & lt ; & lt ;	-1
This pot = thin junk . Older Calphalon made in USA = thick , heavy , high-quality . Very sad to see such a nosedive in quality .	-1
This Pot is heavily & deeply grooved inside which translates to a quick & dirty finishing/polishing job on the part of Calphalon . You can feel the grooves with your fingers easily and it is as if the company did not fully smooth it out.I own several Hard-Ano pans from Calphalon and all are nearly mirror smooth in surface , not this one.This pot is huge and inexpensive..39.99 -w- free shipping.But I feel again disappointed to see that Calphalon has decided to undermine their own Brand Name and quality integrity.Calphalon used to make great cookware , but not in these new China made , low end models.I think i will keep this as i do not plan on using it too often , it is more a `` special use '' pot . And for the money it is OK.But if you are using the stock pot often and see it as an integral part of your kitchen I strongly encourage you to get something else like All-Clad ... MC2 .	-1
The reviewer that said they do not match is correct-they look cheap and although likely as functional as any other , I donated mine unopened to Goodwill .	-1
These tongs are a bit hard to hold and to squeeze . More importantly , the odd-shaped business end does not hold food very well . Skip this item and buy traditional spring-loaded aluminum chef 's tongs with scalloped edges , which are very reasonably priced and work very well . Or if you need to work on a non-stick surface , choose bamboo or wooden tongs . But skip these ; they do n't work well .	-1
I 've had this for three years . It worked ok for while . Now the remote module wo n't communicate with the base thermometer , which kind of defeats the purpose . They still work fine as two separate thermometers . However , now the probes are starting to fail . The probe wires are pretty flimsy in my opinion and should n't be subjected to extreme heat like open flames.I would give it 2.5 stars but 2 will have to do .	-1
This would be a fantastic item - if only it would work ! I followed the instructions exactly and repeatedly for set up . It works great for about 20 minutes , then it loses the remote signal from the probes even when the receiver is located 15 feet away from my smoker . The signal wo n't come back until I go through set up , re-entering every setting only to lose the signal again in about 20 minutes . I made certain that I have n't exceeded operating temperatures or violted any other parameters for use . This product is a dog !	-1
Gave up trying to get the wireless connection beyond 12 feet so just used it as a regular thermometer that I had to run in and out of the house to keep checking the temperature ... way over paid for that , the connection is horrible on this tiny piece of crap . The thermometer did n't even last 6 months of casual wear on top of that . I got poor quality for 6 months for $ 40.Run away screaming from Maverick . Do not waste your money on this or any product they sell.Never , never , never again . They should call it DEAD PONY rather than maverick .	-1
This item is meant for roasts only . the `` probes '' are huge and do n't work on smaller items like burgers and chicken . It is cheaply made as well . I 'd return it if I could , but waited too long to finally navigate the steps to using it .	-1
I usually try to be objective with my reviews but this product is just pure crap . That said , I must admit that the master unit works fine just as an oven thermometer , but I already had two Polder oven thermometers that worked perfectly . I bought it strictly for the remote function but after numerous attempts , always explicitly following the instructions , and replacing all batteries & # 34 ; just in case & # 34 ; I have never been able to link the remote to the master . As a former electronics technician , I think I can safely say that the problem , in this case , was not with the user . I am sure that there are some good units available , possible even from Maverick , but this unit is not one of them .	-1
Bought this a while ago ... liked the idea of two probes because we sometimes cook two tri-tips at once ... Well that didnt last ... one stopped working about two months in . The other still works , but im not thrilled . I am going to look for one that checks temp of bbq interior and the meat ... would be helpful for my big green egg !	-1
I bought a high-end Cookshack smoker several months ago . It is a wonderful product , but did not come with a temperature probe . Opening the door while smoking can adversely affect what you cook , so this wireless thermometer with two , independent probes seemed like exactly what I needed to fill that gap . And it was , for the few weeks it lasted ... The first probe died after only three uses despite that I never cranked the unit above 225 degrees . It was n't the thermometer or remote unit , as the other probe worked fine in either port and the receiver was perfectly synched with the base unit , but for some reason the probe began registering a temperature some sixty degrees off reality . The second probe worked for eight uses before dying as well . Rather then trying to replace the probes tossed this piece of junk and picked up a competitor 's product . The TruTemp unit comes with only one probe and no remote , but it was half the price and has lasted three months with no problems . Sadly the Maverick has a great concept , one I really wish had worked , but without sufficient quality or reliability it does not succeed with it . I doubt that I will ever purchase their products again . Just ca n't trust 'em ...	-1
The probes do not survive in a BBQ . I have destroyed two regular probes in the BBQ in the last three years and the newest & # 34 ; High Temperature & # 34 ; probe lasted ONE use ( THAT was $ 20 wasted ) . The smoker probe , of course is not intended for hi-temp work and was not used in those conditions and still survives.That said , this device does work well in conventional ovens but if you want a remote temperature probe for use in a BBQ , I strongly suggest a different product .	-1
Am using the thing for the first time today . In three hours , the control element has dropped the signal at least ten times . Every drop requires several minutes of effort to get it to reconnect .	-1
Hard to start operating . Does not operate reliability . It says it will operate 100 feet . Must be afull small feet.This is a very frustrating device . I gess I need to look around more . Temperature can be read reliable at the transmitter but not on the reciever .	-1
This spatula was great at first . It was easy to flip eggs and other things . However , it states that it is heat resistant up to 430 degrees , but it started to warp and deform at lower temperatures . The middle prongs also broke on me ! Had to trash it . Was nice while it lasted .	-1
I bought this spatula specifically to use in nonstick pans to avoid marring the finish . Unfortunately , this Pelton spatula arrived with roughness around the edge of the entire part that goes in the pan . It looked as if it had been stamped out by a machine in the manufacturing process and then did n't go through any refining process that smoothed the edges or any inspection process to detect the problem . I urge anyone who buys this spatula to check the edges before using it in a nonstick pan because the issues with metal utensils are sharpness and roughness , and this product had both of those problems.I was aggravated about having a product I could n't use for its intended purpose , and I did n't want to bother with sending it back , so I used my good nail file to smooth the edges . It took me about 10 minutes or so to remove the roughness , but an effective finishing machine should have been able to do that in a matter of seconds . I ca n't recommend this product on the basis of my experience , but I do like the weight and shape of this spatula .	-1
The plastic a but melted and it left blue streaks on one pan . The plastic is discolored black as well . I was not searing when it melted , just normal cooking of onions . Not happy .	-1
I have a standard Cuisinart Stainless Steel pan and at high heat I left the spatula on , and the end melted . Not pleased . It was good to use until then , light and great for fish .	-1
I just received my set . The glasses are so ... beautiful ! Yet , 5 out of 6 are defective ! ! What a big disappointment ! I have been looking forward to receiving my first Riedel ... .Amazon.com provides great deal which I got $ 80 for 6 glasses , but they were obviously factory seconds ! So disappointed ! However , the design of the glass are beautiful ! ! I am still returning them ! So sad ! ... ... : (	-1
When I ordered these bowls , I was under the impression there were 3 bowls in the set . When the package was opened the package , contained only 2 bowls . Since I purchased them as a gift , I did n't realize there was a bowl missing until now . The smallest bowl was missing .	-1
You can find the 8-pc . set with the BIG bowl ( 4 qt ) at another major retailer that starts with a 'W ' and ends with 'almart ' for the same price . These bowls are great , but buy smart and get yourself an extra bowl .	-1
I paid almost $ 5 more for this pan because the picture looked like it was n't the GripRight pan . What I received definitely looks more like the GripRite . From experience I have learned it 's the handles that are very difficult to get clean and they can make storage a hassle , so I wanted the smaller handles . I fell like I wasted more than $ 4 bucks .	-1
They are shipping the `` grip-rite '' version , which has larger grip handles on either side , and is NOT the product that is pictured . I specifically needed the small handles so that the dish would fit into a square water bath that I use . There is another listing for the grip-rite versionPyrex Grip-Rite 8-Inch Square Baking Dish , Clear , which is what I received , for $ 4 less than this listing . Very disappointing .	-1
There 's no question that the glass pans made in the U.S. today are not your grandmother 's Pyrex.The original Corning Inc. pans , invented in 1915 , were made from a particularly strong material , borosilicate glass . Virtually all glass bakeware sold in the U.S. since the 1980s is now made of a different material , soda lime silicate glass , said Daniel Collins , a Corning spokesman.Company officials say that soda lime silicate glass is better able to withstand impact if banged or dropped and that it is better for the environment . Ceramics experts also note that it 's cheaper than borosilicate glass .	-1
This is so big , I didnt realize just how huge it was . It does not fit in my cupboard . Seems like its for when you double a recipe . I wanted to return it but it would cost $ 9 which is more than half of what I paid for it so its not worth it : - ( i recommend to by anchors , its cheaper , comes with a lid , and is meant for a single recipe ( not double )	-1
I 've had this product for a few years now . Just tonight I used it to put a ham steak under the boiler . I let it broil for 7 minutes and then was going to take it out to flip it . The minute I started to take it out of the oven , it exploded in my hands . My knuckle has a deep gash and is severely bruised - I 'm still unsure as to whether there 's glass in there or not . There was glass 8 feet away from the stove . There was no cool liquids being put into the pan , nor was the glass cold when I put it in there ( it was room temperature ) .I 'm just glad that neither of my kids were in the room when it happened .	-1
Soda glass bakeware seems to be the norm in USA now for major manufacturers . So sad to see Pyrex degenerate along with so many other companies . We replaced our 9x9 and 9x13 with Fiestaware , and could n't be happier . Yes , it is expensive , but if you shop sales , it becomes more affordable , and it will last forever -- probably become part of your estate . The Fiestaware cooks and bakes beautifully , can do oven , broiler , freezer , and microwave , never explodes , is colorful and beautiful , and , amazingly , cleans up like a dream , usually with just a soak in hot water ( soapy if really bad ) , after it has cooled down . All you have to do is wipe it out and rinse it off . Unlike other ceramic bakers , the vitreous glass goes all the way around , even on the bottom . I does n't seem to mark from metal utensils either . I do have an older 4.8 qt Pyrex baking dish made of borosilicate , and I 'm hanging onto that one forever . We also bought good quality larger stainless steel roasters . Our other Pyrex glassware is now relegated to refrigerator storage and food prep . So far , nothing coming out of the fridge onto the quartz countertop has exploded ! It never goes into the microwave , however .	-1
In case you have n't read the January issue of Consumer Reports yet , let me summarize : Corning sold Pyrex to World Kitchen , who is using cheaper glass which makes it more likely to shatter from heat . The European Pyrex still uses the traditional Pyrex formula and is as heat-resistant as ever . Consumer Reports says : `` We baked at least five samples of each brand in a 450-degree oven . All of the U.S. Pyrex and Anchor dishes shattered when placed on the wet countertop . None of the European dishes ... broke '' here 's the European product : Arcuisine Elegance Glass 2.8 Quart Rectangular Baker	-1
We may have had a bad one but the plastic tube cracked after a couple of uses .	-1
this cookie press would not release the cookies . trigger was very hard and the cookie came out , but would not release onto the cookie sheet . one shot after the other only created a blob and one press created bits of the cookie . Regardless , they all stuck and never released : (	-1
Since I am a certified , card-carrying cheese lover , my ( now ex ) boyfriend gave this to me as a thoughtful , out-of-nowhere gesture . Frankly , I was so excited that I could n't wait to break out a nice bottle of vino and grate myself some Romano ! However , I was sorely dissapointed when it just did n't work.The issue with its design has to do with the crank or & quot ; thing that you turn. & quot ; Since it was so short , I could not get the leverage necessary to make it work . Because of this , the cheese came out in clumps or not at all.I would advise cheese enthusiasts to spend a little extra money for a better-constructed grater -- or else buy the grated cheese in a can .	-1
The problem with this and virtually all wire mushroom slicers made in the USA and some abroad is that they will go bust on you eventually ! One day the wire will give this little mean snap and curl up on you . No one so far seems ot know how to crate a longlasting product of this type .	-1
This model is a nice little pepper mill : relatively easy to fill , easy to use , and reasonably priced . Unfortunately , performance leaves a lot to be desired . Turn the handle one direction and the pepper is very coarse ; I would described it as cracked rather than ground . Turn the handle the other direction and it grinds so fine that nothing comes out . Perhaps if the mechanism were adjusted it would work ; unfortunately I ca n't figure out what that adjustment would be . Based on other reviews , I 'm guessing my experience is a quality control issue . If it worked I would be happy . As it is , I 'm purchasing yet another pepper mill .	-1
Bad design on the plastic cover to hold all the accessories in -- it looks like they were going for looks rather than practicality.The suction is OK , 12 amps just like my previous Eureka upgright . I guess not much has changed in 5 yearsThe storage position is a little weird since the assembled wands hook onto the canister . You always need two hands to move this thing around.Again , if it were n't for the cheap plastic cover , this might be OK , but I ca n't recommend it . If I paid list of $ 369 for it , I would definitely return it . Fortunately , I paid $ 179.99 - $ 30 off and a $ 20 coupon from Amazon , making it a $ 130 vacuum shipped to my door . Still I would say it is only worth $ 99 .	-1
Bought this to replaced a scoop made in 1923 . That 's not a typo I wrote 1923 . It 's a scoop that was passed down generation to generation and although it still works flawlessly I did n't want to risk breaking the wooden handle since it has survived this long.This Norpro is really a pain to use in ice cream that is very solid . The problem is with the grip and spring mechanism . In order to get a good grip on the thing you have to apply force which in turn squeezes the handle and the risk of pinching a finger is a very real thing . Plus the descooper or whatever its called does n't work so great if the handle has already been squeezed . You can sort of get a good grip if you grab it near the neck but then your palm may be pinched and your hand is practically in the substance . The old 1923 model has a perfect mechanism that is a spring mechanism attached to the outside of the scoop and pressed with a large thumb lever to release whatever is in the scoop and it has an easily gripped wooden handle . Guess they do n't make them like they used to ! This will work I suppose but I would n't let children use it for fear of injury .	-1
I do n't know if it was `` user error '' or not , but I was very disappointed when I used this what-I-felt-to-be beautifully designed piece of equipment . The roaster completely stuck inside the chicken ; it and the chicken were very hot to the touch , of course , so I could n't get hold of it to grapple with it very effectively ; but I did n't want the whole thing to cool off totally , because I wanted nice hot chicken . I ended up ripping the whole thing apart and using the chicken for a nice batch of broth . I found the roaster very cumbersome to use , and , I 'm sorry to say , I have n't used it since . If there was a trick to it that I did n't know , I 'd be very glad to hear about it ...	-1
I thought it was the poor design but then I saw one of these at a store . The stem of mine sticks up into the funnel leaving a reservoir where liquids get stuck . The same model I saw in the store did n't have that problem . I just got unlucky and it does n't cost enough to bother with a return .	-1
This is made of unfinished pine and brittle plastic . I put some food grade wood oil on the pine part..because it had splinters.I had a knife long enough to cut with the plastic on , so that was not an issue . I put it on a shelf , one side of the pine box was not attached very well , and it fell to the ground and the plastic broke . No way to repair it . Definitely NOT worth anything !	-1
DON '' T BUY THIS ! This is a poor design to say the least . Add poor quality and you have a serious junker you will return or throw out	-1
Total and absolute piece of crap.I wanted to like it . But the wood is much too soft . The back panel falls off every time we use it . Even my 8 yo declared it to be total junk.This could be improved in design with better quality materials.I wish I could get my money back .	-1
I titled this review such because there HAS to be something better out there ! Are we not living in the 21st Century ? I read numerous reviews on the seemingly few bread slicers out there because I wanted a quality product at a good price that was easy to use and would help me slice my precious bread machine loaves consistently . What I ended up getting ( and what you will get if you order it ) : A box containing a wooden board with crumb catcher and three plastic pieces with some screws for you to assemble the product . The wooden part of the product is great and the crumb catcher is great but the plastic pieces that screw on are a bit flimsy and do not stay on tight so when you cut the bread ( like other reviewers mentioned , get a *long* bread knife ) it wobbles a bit and does not always make it easy to get even slices . The plastic end piece on mine says `` Our Daily Bread '' which is a bit cheesy . The end piece will not stay put either because the sides are a bit wobbly . I disagree with some of the reviewers who think the board itself is too wide . It is a little wider than a bread machine loaf but I think that is a good thing as you would n't want a slightly misshapen loaf to not fit inside the slicer at all or worse , risk putting your fingers through a loaf by trying to cram it between the slicer guides.Still trying to make an informed decision ? It *may* help you slice a bit more evenly , but maybe not . I find that sometimes I get a more even slice if I manage to hold the plastic sides just right . Will it save you time ? Maybe . It all depends on if the plastic sides will stay on tight.Bottom line : either have your kid design and make you one in wood shop class ( or make one yourself ) or just buy a cutting board with a crumb catcher and wing it on the slicing . The third option is to buy this product and put up with it ( I guess that 's where I 'm at since I like the crumb catcher and my patience has n't ebbed quite enough ) .My question is : Why has n't someone invented a counter top electric slicer that is more or less a scaled down version of the industrial sized slicers you sometimes see at bakeries or in stores overseas ? Maybe someone is afraid they will be sued if their child drops their hamster into it ( or worse ) ? We do have Cuisinarts with rotating metal blades ... Please , someone hear us frustrated bread makers ! !	-1
It worked about as well as the executive branch of the federal government . Fortunately , it broke pretty soon after it was placed in service . If only the executive branch would break down that rapidly . Amazon might make some money .	-1
This item was pictured with the bread keeper , but it does not fit in the keeper . The slicer item is way too tall , and there is not a bread knife out there that works with it . Would not buy this product or recommend it to breadlovers !	-1
I bake my own bread , and I slice it with a sharp bread knife , the slices sometimes do not come out as thin as I want , thats why I thought a bread slicing guide would be the perfect solution . I ordered the Norpro guide , because I like Norpro and I have bought so many useful tools from them , not this time though , the guide is much bigger that my loaf , that makes the loaf go back and forth with the knife , you will have to press hard on the bread to keep it in place , but the bigger problem is that the slices come out too thick , I could make thinner slices with out the guide , thats why I stopped using it and went back for the manual slicing , I even tried an electric knife , but I still think manual slicing is the best , it gives you control and good results .	-1
One of the slats was unglued from the base and placed between two of the other slats . Also , some minor assembly is required . The plastic parts need to be screwed onto the wood part , but there were no markings to indicate where the screws should go and no starter holes . Seemed to be very cheaply made . Naturally , I 'm returning it .	-1
I was very , very iffy about buying this product after reading the reviews , but it was 1/2 the price of the next least expensive one I could find that I liked , plus I bought it during a 4-for-3 kitchen promotion , so I thought why not.I bough it to try and save money and eat better . I was making all of our bread except bread for sandwiches because I just could n't slice my bread straight enough . I was paying a ton of money to buy bread that did n't have high fructose corn syrup in it . I figured if this worked , I could save money by making all of our own bread.I have this bread makerSunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmakerand the 2 pound loaf wiggles around from side to side as you slice , but is so tall it is above the guides.It needs rubber on the bottom to keep it from sliding as you slice . I have a extra long bread knife but it still easily finds it 's way out of the guides . None of the guides have broken off yet , but I am super careful with it after reading the reviews.It 's very pretty , but it 's not very well designed . Pay twice the price if you have to , it 's better than wasting your money on this .	-1
This Norpro 370 Bread Slicer SEEMS like a decent product . It arrived with `` Our Daily Bread '' where it says `` Bread '' in the picture - the plastic end piece . SO , this sits in the drawer and we use it maybe five or six times . The side rail where you slice the bread and where it is attached to the wood with a screw just broke . Cheap junk that is poorly made . I got ripped off and it 's not worth the money or effort . Save your money and just slice your bread on a good cutting board with a good bread knife . Homemade bread is meant to be unevenly sliced and this is just junk .	-1
Plastic breaks easily . When it was hit with a knife when cutting , one of the tines broke . Not good quality for the price	-1
Basic design does what it is supposed to do , but the width of the unit is a little wide , so that an ordinary length serrated bread knife keeps slipping out of the grouves . I would prefer the slices to be a bit thinner . The plastic is a bit flimsly , but has not broken so far .	-1
I bought this timer to replace an old one I had that I had loved a lot and got years and years of use out of . But like everything else in this world , I guess , they just do n't make them like they used to . From the beginning it has had a way of randomly stopping in mid-time , and I have to keep an eye on it to make sure it 's still ticking . Give it a shake and it starts up again - but what good is a timer that you have to keep an eye on ? May as well just keep an eye on the clock . I guess the thinner plastic should have clued me in - also the bell is not nearly as loud . This is what my husband calls a `` product simulation . '' It looks and smells like a real timer , but it is not one ! I 'm off on the hunt for one that really does work like the real thing used to !	-1
I contacted Amazon about this timer working and was surprised that I never heard from them . I wanted to exchange but was n't sure that I could . It quit working just after the return date expired . I only used 2 times to time boiling eggs .	-1
This egg timer worked well the first time I used it.After that , it just did not work . No color change at all .	-1
Thought I 'd give it a try . I think I 'll stick with my old fashioned hour glass style egg timer . If you put it into a deeper pot with lots of eggs , good luck trying to see it clearly when the water 's at a rolling boiling . It also turned a dark red and that made it harder for these older eyes to read . Nope , this thing is not for me ... ...	-1
I bought one of these many years ago from Brookstone , and it worked perfectly . After misplacing my original , I bought this item which looks the same . The quality is certainly not the same , as my & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; one has split in half after only two months in use.I was a little suspicious of it when it arrived , since it did not have the same heavy feel of my original egg . Still , it worked fine and I boiled eggs nearly every day with it . Then one day I pulled it out of the water in two pieces -- -as other reviewers noted , it had split neatly where the two halves are glued together ( with the & # 34 ; timing & # 34 ; paper between ) .I am going to buy another replacement , from a different manufacturer , because this item as a kitchen gadget is great for egg enthusiasts . Hopefully my next one will be nearer to my original in production quality .	-1
Mine had one simple problem : By the time the color changed at all , the eggs were hard boiled . This inaccuracy made it useless to me , and I abandoned its use , it is much better to soft boil by starting with cold water and heating until boiling , then just a few seconds more , the eggs are perfectly soft cooked every time.I loved the idea of this device , being a gadget geek , even though it was analog , and not digital . But first and foremost , a gadget must work . Even if it is harder to use the gadget than the ordinary scheme for doing whatever , the gadget must work .	-1
I own this product , but I did not buy it on Amazon . I still wanted to review this product because of the problem I have with it . This item gives off such a bad smell that the first time I used it , it made me almost ill . It smells like melting fiberglass or something similar , which seems very wrong . Foreign chemicals are not something I want to eat . And if you think it does n't matter because your food is inside an egg shell , you are probably unaware that egg shells are porous , and so I believe that a chemical solvent that vaporizes so easily could also become dissolved in the cooking water and get by the egg membrane inside the shell . I even tried boiling the plastic egg again the next day in plain water with no real eggs , and the same smell eminates from it . So I wasted my money . PS I gave this item 2 stars because it actually cooked the eggs perfectly , but for the reasons given above I threw them away . Several tried and true ways to perfecty cook soft and hard cooked eggs can easily be found online .	-1
I do n't really like this Bacon Press . It 's not the greatest thing.It 's easily rust , even greased , awkward to use , and does n't fit any size frying pan well . It stays in my cabinet .	-1
The handle on this meat pounder is very short . Even before I used it on meat , I tried it out on a folded kitchen towel . Every time I pounded with any force , my little finger hit the top of the stainless steel disc . I sent it back and will purchase another one designed more like a hammer . I think you get better results with leverage .	-1
I actually put this on my wish list , thinking that it was absolutely the most unique honey server I 'd seen . When I received it as a gift , it was even cuter than pictured . However , when I filled it , and used it the first time , I was incredibly disappointed ! The plunger that holds the honey in is lifted when you press the handle , but it does n't lift far enough to let more than the tiniest trickle of honey come out . Took FOREVER to get enough honey on my piece of toast . It looks wonderful , but if you want to eat your toast before it gets cold , this is not going to work for you !	-1
This is a nice idea . Yes , it is a bit awkward to fill , but more to the point , it leaks . It sits on a little glass bowl when you are n't using it , and the honey seeps past the bottom stopper and gradually fills the bottom bowl . Too bad .	-1
These are cool in theory , but they leak from beneath and ruin the shape . I have used the for pancakes and for eggs and both leak . They are good if you use them like a cookie cutter on sandwiches , but that was noo what I bought them for . I wanted them for eggs and hot cakes .	-1
This item is too small for large amounts of pasta . It would be cheaper to purchase a large dowel and hang between two chairs .	-1
Like most other poor reviews the spring stopped functioning after being used about a dozen times.If it could be opened up the spring could be fixed and it would be easier to clean.Cleaning it well is impossible . I solved guide binding by breaking it off and pushing the plastic rod into the handle . I 'll take it to the office and fill in hole with acrylic plastic . You could also glue a small disk over the hole . Cheap price , poorly made product .	-1
I liked this funnel at first , especially since it fits both regular and wide mouth mason jars . But I have only had it a couple of months and it 's already rusting . It has 4 rust spots , 2 of which appeared after a month .	-1
A waste of money . Cheaply made and not at all what I was looking for . This is more work than I expected because there is nothing really helping you push down on the tortilla to flatter . I pinched my finger right off the bat . Sorry I bought it .	-1
I bought this so that I could press my homemade corn tortillas without having to improvise with what I had at home or have fingerprints all over them . As others have noted , this press just does not get tortillas thin enough . In fact , it seems that there is just a hard limit on how much you can flatten with this contraption and no more . No matter how hard I press , it does not get any thinner . I was also very annoyed that the first time I used it started producing little metal shavings as the press was closing . I was worried some of these might make their way into my tortillas -- not funny ! I eventually started putting a kitchen towel over the area where the presser arm comes in contact with the top of the press to prevent any more metal from coming off . I feel like I am filing this thing down every time I try and press something . Bottom line is , it starts to get your tortillas flat , but then you still have to use a rolling pin or something to get them down to a normal depth . I think aluminum may be the wrong material for this application.I will note , for those who do n't know , this press is really for corn , and not flour tortillas . I will be trying to return mine unfortunately .	-1
It did n't compress the dough well and it left little metal shavings every time I pushed down . I do n't really want to eat metal shavings .	-1
After a couple uses the handle broken off . The metal is too thin to take the pressure required to press a tortilla . It also would not press a tortilla anywhere near thin enough . I 'm going to buy a wooden one like they use in Mexico .	-1
The base bends , at the handle base , when pressing . This creates more work instead of reducing it . I am pressing out pie dough for miniature pies and the dough is not as cold as recommended . You get a really thin side and really thick side . The flexibility could be fixed by mounting the unit to a sturdy board but I should n't have to do that . I will just return this one and buy a cast iron one .	-1
It does not hold a charge very long and is not really good at picking up things from a tile floor , this was a total disappointment .	-1
I have a hand held vacuum and it has more suction than this vacuum . I would return it now if I could . Not good on hardwood as advertised .	-1
This is really quite a bad cordless vacuum.It has almost no suction ( those that write that it does have not really tested it ) .1 . Turn it to floor mode.2 . Put your hand at the nozzle . You will feel nearly nothing.3 . Put down some white powder carpet freshner.4 . Turn the boss to carpet mode.5 . See how long it takes to remove the white powder.6 . Run another vacuum across the same area.You will prove to yourself that this picks up only the minimal amount of the powder with mutliple passes required at that.Not recommended .	-1
At first glance this looks like a great spice system ... not so . The bottom hatch does not always click tight and no matter how much you think you 've gotten all the extra spices out of that compartment more tends to find its way there and leaks all over my counter and the base unit . I am constantly having to wipe the spilled spices up . After many WEEKS of searching for a better alternative I am going to order a new spice system from custom magnetic spice rack dot com . I 'm hoping that system on the inside of my pantry wall will work out much better for me ... sigh .	-1
I guess the old adage is true , you get what you pay for ! The unit is not as sturdy as I had thought , and the plate is a real pain to clean . But , it does cook food as advertised , but the actual cooking space is limited .	-1
The stand and bulk of this grill are just for show . If it was just turned into a large electric grill with removable plates it would make sense , but this thing is bulky , a pain to clean , hard to store , and is just a one sided George Foreman grill.I bought this grill and used it twice . It 's hard to explain , but the food did not turn out well . I use a real wood smoker , charcoal , propane and several electric grills and this one gave the worst results.Tried it again and the same results , so instead of wasting my food I broke the grill apart and tossed it in the trash.Probably should have sold it on Ebay , especially seeing the high ratings on Amazon , but I did n't think anyone would pay even $ 10 for this thing .	-1
I bought this grill a few months ago , but did not use it much . After about 3-4 uses , it no longer works ! The heating element is built into the plate that you cook on and have to clean . On a `` normal '' grill , the cooktop comes off so that you can soak it or clean it esily , but this method is not possible with this grill . The place where the heating element plugs in is threaded into the base so that the user can not see whether the heating cord is lined up properly with the piece it needs to be inserted into . As a result , the prongs on the base bent after about 3 uses , and the grill no longer works.The grill is also very large and clumsy . Though it has a stand and you 'd think you could leave it outside , no , you are warned not to do this . So unless you want to lug the grill in and out of your home , this grill , which is larger than my last outdoor grill , must ( or should ! ) be stored indoors . Frankly , I do n't have room for such a large contraption in my home.I guess the plus side is that it cleaned easily and cooked okay for its 3 uses , but it 's really not worth the trouble in the end . Back to the broiler ... .Sept. 11 , 2013 . I want to add this addendum to my review . I called the company , and they were excellent about sending me a new unit . I think the new one may have a slightly better design , especially regarding the insertion of the electrical cord into the grill . I still think the entire design needs a think .	-1
I was so tired of lugging those propane tanks around to get filled blah blah blah . We were on the market for a new grill and when I saw this , it was a no brainer . We have used it 4 times now and are extremely pleased with ease of use with great results . It cooks more evenly than the regular kind of grill too which make it super simple to use . So easy to plug in and then just wait a few minutes for it to heat . Love it and will never go back to the propane or charcoal means of cooking outdoors . Also the cooking surface is roomy and would easily allow 5-6 steaks to cook at the same time . Cleaning is a breeze too . All in all , perfect and just what we were hoping for ! UPDATE : 5-18-2013 OK . I guess I was hasty to write such a rave review . After using this grill now for about a month , we are not liking it so much . IT IS SO MESSY ! Grease gets all over the top dome and is very hard to clean . Plus , we are finding that because it does n't have the good grill flavor , we are avoiding it . It does cook evenly and if you were to use chicken more than beef you would probably be satisfied with this grill . We like chicken and beef so it really is n't working for us . I think my husband put it toward the back of garage now ... oh well . We may try to cook some cornish hens on it or bake cookies on it ? ? ? It would sure beat heating up the oven in the summer . I will update again if we have any success with that .	-1
i bought it from reading such good reviews , but the problem is that it does not get hot enough , it takes a long time to heat up .	-1
UPDATE ... 2 stars ... Now that I 've had this several months my opinion has changed . It has started to over cook one side consistently It is always the side I cook second ( after the flipping of the skillet ) .Original Review ... 5 stars ... We make homemade waffles about 4-5 times a week . I was tired of having to replace plug-in waffle irons every year ... no matter the brand or price point we paid , they simply give out after a year and start sticking , burning , etc . This stove-top waffle iron is great . Our waffles never stuck , not even on the first use . Simply spray with Pam and heat each side of the griddle for 1 minute on medium-low heat ... then pour in batter ... we heat the first side for 50 seconds and the second side for 2.5 minutes on medium-low heat . Delicious .	-1
Nordic Ware 9-in . Bacon Tray had to be returned as it was broken on one edge . End of story .	-1
To pop popcorn you must have steam . The lid has gaps that let all of the steam out , so corn does n't pop well at all . I put 1/3 cup of popcorn into my 1200 watt microwave for 5 minutes and only half ( if that many ) of the kernels popped . I put the kernels that did n't pop into a brown paper lunch sack & in 3 minutes almost every kernel popped . This thing is getting returned !	-1
I did n't like it , and no longer use it . I burned myself twice , and found the top piece no longer fit right , after a few times in mircowave oven .	-1
I so wanted this product , but , alas , it produced so much heat or steam that my microwave got overheated and shut off.I bought some new popcorn and tried again -- same result . Darn .	-1
gave this away after trying it twice . My husband and family hated the shrivled popcorn even when it was cooked properly & not burnt . Got the air popper -- see my review for that .	-1
I was relieved when it arrived crack free -- then I held it to a bright light and a superfine crack could be seen starting half-way up the side . Another short one was on the lip where you hold it when hot . After two uses the cracks could be seen and felt with my fingertip . It still pops corn.I 'm giving it 1-star because it proudly says `` Made in America '' and given how few things are still manufactured here I expect pride in quality control , or please do n't tell anyone it was made here . Obviously the problem is in their container material itself , or their process up to the shipping.I recommend you purchase this Nordic Ware product in a store where you can hold it up to the light and look for cracks.Update 90 Days Later : two more crack along the lip , dark stains in the bowl from burning popcorn.EXPERIMENT : I saw a few reviews that mentioned using a glass bowl . I took a large Pyrex bowl and put in 1/3 cup of dry popping corn and covered it . In my Oster microwave it took longer to pop but it left fewer unpopped and did not burn any . I burned some in the Nordic Ware . The popped corn was the same quality.The advantage of using a glass bowl is you likely already own one and wo n't up more shelf space . The disadvantages are the glass bowl stays blistering hot longer and it will shatter if dropped.My next popper will be a hot air and I 'll use a Pyrex bowl for microwave popcorn .	-1
I feel that I wasted my money on this popper . It takes up to 15 minutes to pop 1/3 cup of kernels in my Jenn-Air microwave , and even then many kernels remain unpopped . I threw this popper away and bought the Presto Microwave Popper that is also sold by Amazon . It pops 1/3 cup of kernels in just over 4 minutes , with very few un-popped kernels . In short , unlike the NordicWare popper , the Presto microwave popper actually works .	-1
We had something similar to thee a number of years ago and one nestled well inside the other for more convenient storage . Also , they fit securely both on the plate and on top of each other in the microwave . These do neither . They do keep food from spattering so as to keep the nuker cleaner but we have had one plate fall off the other because of lack of correct stacking ability . They do not fit the plates well .	-1
The amount of condensation that builds up because of the lack of steam vents borders on the hilarious . Bought a different one .	-1
I will ask Amazon to send me a replacement , as it must have been defective . I used it to cook fish , so the temp wa n't even that hot .	-1
I liked the look of this cover and because i was renovating my kitchen I wanted a new look . I gave this product 2 stars because it stopped splatter . But it began to melt after the second use . I am going to use my old one until I can find a replacement .	-1
Explodes every time and makes a huge mess in the microwave . Also , one of the hinges broke . I am throwing it away .	-1
I love having eggs in the morning , but I am lazy and also always short on time . My solution ? This microwave egg thing . It does n't work . In any way . The eggs are usually runny on the outside and overcooked on the inside , Not my ideal order of eggs . Plus , the second time I put it in the dishwasher the top part cracked in half rendering it useless . Save your money .	-1
I found the design lacking . It does n't always stay closed in the microwave . The eggs pop . I 've found silicone cookers are a better option for nuking eggs .	-1
The hinge broke after the second use . The results are uneven at best . You will find better designed units at your local dollar store for $ 1- $ 2 . Some of Nordic Ware 's other stuff is OK . But , not the egg poacher .	-1
I do n't know how the people here who have praised this product managed to cook eggs that were edible . My first try was by following directions at the lowest time ( 1 minute 15 seconds ) and I ended up with perfectly hard cooked eggs . So , I tried again , lowering the cooking time to 1 minute . This time I had one egg hard cooked and the other with runny whites . I then thought maybe a little more water might help so I used a tsp of water in each cup . Same results as the second with one hard cooked and one barely cooked . That 's when I threw it in the trash.I was trying to find the perfect method for cooking eggs where I ended up with fully cooked whites and a runny yolk . I have tried soft boiled ( too iffy on the timing ) , over easy ( I mostly broke the yokes ) and poached ( again iffy on the timing and mostly messy ) . Finally I came up with the perfect way to cook eggs the way I like them . I found a frying pan that perfectly fit two eggs . I melted some butter in the pan and cracked in the two eggs . I let them cook over medium low heat for about a minute to mostly set the whites . I then added a couple of tablespoons of water , put on a glass lid and turned the heat to low . I then `` steam fried '' the eggs for another 2 minutes or so , watching the yolks through the glass top . When the yolks were slightly filmed over , I tested the whites . Perfectly cooked . I then drained the eggs on a paper towel and flipped them onto a piece of buttered toast . Heaven ! Perfectly cooked eggs , firm whites and runny yolks . I just wish I could figure out a better way to drain them so I ended up with the yolks face up on the bread but , what the hey , I 'm just happy to have perfectly cooked eggs !	-1
Maybe I am not smart enough to get such a sophisticated device to work for me . Threw it out after four or five tries .	-1
This is made from very cheap plastic . The hinge snaps off EVERY TIME I open it . It 's a pain to put back together after you have the eggs in the wells . You can get better versions at grocery stores for a lower price .	-1
This is an automatic starter , but if you have less than 6 oz you have to do it manually . The one you have to start ) O think now it 's the mini ) is so much better	-1
We bought this a year ago after our microwave 's built-in turntable system quit , despite several negative reviews . Even from day 1 , this thing spun way too slowly and seemed way too high maintenance . Worried about someone over-winding it , and just not that impressed with it , I considered returning it but did n't because we needed SOMETHING . Several months ago , my oldest moved out and I gave him the microwave ( and this turntable ) . He says the spinning speed got even slower over time , and then the feature that senses weight stopped working last month . In other words , when he takes the plate or bowl off the turntable it keeps spinning . No way to stop it spinning except let it run itself to the end of that winding . Now , he says it does n't work at all.I just logged on hoping to find something different or better , but this still seems to be the only option here . I 'd almost rather replace the microwave than spend another $ 30 on this .	-1
I washed the pan with mild soap , made sure it was dry and coated it with baking spray ( I use it all the time and never have any problems ) and only half of the cake came out the rest stuck in the pan , I was going to take this to my quilting group and maybe it fits as the cake is in peaces just like our quilts before we sew the pieces together . I do not recommend these pans so do n't waste your money keep it in your pocket . I love to shop at Amazon so this was really disappointing .	-1
These pans are very thin . If I 'd seen them in person and picked them up and discovered how lightweight they are , I never would 've bought them .	-1
They sent the wrong ones , which I now have to pay the return shipping on . Not happy !	-1
We ordered two new trays and screens . The new screens are terrible compared to the originals that came with our FD-1000 . The new screens have a huge hole in the center so you ca n't place items close to the center , the vent holes in the screens are smaller with a LOT more plastic so , not as much air passes through them and they have big button things in the middle that food sticks to.We called NESCO and they said this is their new design . The old design is no longer available . We are very dissatisfied with the new design .	-1
I bought a set Colonial Boston MANY years ago and have been EXTREMELY happy with the 'Original Set ' . As you can see from the images I 've added , I STILL have many of the original documents . The original 18/8 Set has served my daughters and I well over the years . It 's design was perfect . Simple to hold for kids , No sharp edges other than the fork points , and no fancy , pertruding designs . REALLY , they are perfect.But over the years some spoons and forks have disappeared . To the rubbish with frozen dinners I suspect . Only one that ran ever returned , but it was injured beyond repair from it 's fight with the garbage disposal . This is when I decided to 'refill ' the set . I was happy to find they were still in existance and picked up a set of 4 . The differences were slight but noticable . The writing on the back . The bend in the forks . The joint of the knives . But what REALLY made them noticable , was when they came out of the dishwasher with rust spots . I did n't want my kids putting cheap , rusty silverware in their mouths . It took me a while to find out what had happened , and as others mentioned , it was Onieda 's 'Bait and Switch ' tactics . I was duped into the purchase of the immitation 18/0 set as well.If a liar lies only 1 % of the time , are they not still a liar ? Oneida may not have done this with EVERY set , but they did it to the one I own . This immitation of the original Colonial Boston should NEVER have been called 'Colonial Boston ' Or 'Minute Man ' ( a name this set was also known as at times ) . If anything , MAYBE Colonial Boston II . Still deceptive , but at least they would have told of a difference . The way it is now , it 's pure deception.I DO still love my set , and believe it 's the best design and quality for a family . But I would NEVER purchase from Oneida again . My kids have heard me enough , so I doubt they will buy Oneida either ... To the person putting down Amazon , I disagree with you . They do n't control the Products descriptions and Deception done by companies such as Oneida , But at least they allow purchasers to fairly display their concerns through these reviews . I feel it may affect selling prices , but I see less manipulation by Amazon on good and bad reviews that other sites who seem to only show positive reviews ... Kudo 's to Amazon ! ! ! I did my searches , and I found someone who sells individual pieces on a bay and I was able to get some in GREAT condition , matching my existing set perfectly and out of the ones I got there , only one was not labeled 's.s.s . 'Buyer Beware ! !	-1
Though I agree that for the first 6 months I owned this , it was a great travel cup , kept my coffee warm , it was spill proof in my backpack , and attractiveHowever , after only 6 months , the screw on cap fell apart into two pieces after washing it in hot ( not boiling ) water . I 've had some of my cheaper coffee mugs for years and have never experienced this . So now this expensive mug is totally useless . An expensive product for the limited time I 've used it . I could have bought a cheaper mug for 1/3 of the price , and though it may not have kept my coffee quite as hot , it sill would have been fine.Do not buy -- either that , or do n't wash the lid in hot water .	-1
Cuisinart is supposed to be the top of the line . I got a 2014 14 cup processor and liked it until the tiny `` plastic '' part broke on the work bowl that engages the motor when clicked shut.To replace , you have to buy a whole new bowl for over $ 30 . One would think a quality conscious company would not use so cheap a part . Look closely at it , because I 'm sure it will break again in the future .	-1
I really wanted to like this . I gave it a week and tried several different things with it . Here is how it did:1 . Chopping onions : some pieces were tiny , others were too big and by the time you cut into 1 inch pieces as directed by the book , you might as well chop it all2 . Slicing cucumber : some of the slices were perfect , and others were paper thin3 . Slicing celery and carrots : again , inconsistent - when you get near the end the pieces turn sideways so some slices are long pieces and others are circles ( and some gets caught under the lid ) 4 . Shredding mozzarella : HORRIBLE ! The book says that if you partially freeze it first it will shred fine . Not true ! This made a terrible mushy mess . The motor kept stopping because the cheese was n't shredding and lots of it got stuck between the lid and the slicer.5 . Chopping walnuts : this actually worked fairly well , but again the pieces are all different sizesI could n't justify keeping this for the price based on all of the inconsistencies I found . I am returning it and will try thePresto 02910 SaladShooter Electric Slicer/Shredder . It is a fraction of the cost and for what I want it for ( mainly shredding cheese and slicing veggies ) the reviews are great .	-1
My 10-year old Bravia food processor gave up the ghost when I over-challenged it with a huge hunk of hard cheese , and I could totally kick myself for ruining it . Especially since I replaced it with a pricey Cuisinart 9-cup brushed stainless model that was 5-star rated -- that has turned out to be a major disappointment . I have a dog who is allergic to most everything in the dogfood world , so I must make his food myself . One of the components is a `` salad '' comprised of spinach , baby carrots , and apple , with a little olive oil . My old Bravia took about 8 seconds to mulch this into a lovely slaw , with all pieces evenly chopped . The Cuisinart practically liquifies the spinach , while the apple and carrot are still in large pieces . I have tried processing the carrots and apples first , then adding the spinach , which works for the apples and carrots , but the spinach just sits there without moving . The only way I have been able to make this work is to do the spinach separately from the apples and carrots , then mix them together by hand in a bowl . This makes what should be a 2 minute job into a 10 minute one . Another surprise was when I discovered that the Cuisinart 9 cup processor bowl only holds 2 cups of liquid . My Bravia could be filled 2/3 full ... Unfortunately , the Bravia is no longer made . And buyers beware ... when I checked with the Amazon website , their refund policy says I can only expect `` up to a 50 percent refund '' on the Cuisinart because it has been used , even though it is under 3 weeks old . I ca n't remember ever having to return anything to Amazon before , so the return policy came as a surprise . I have only owned one Cuisinart appliance in the past -- a toaster -- and it was great . Was n't Cuisinart the creator of food processors eons ago ? ? You would think they would have this thing perfected by now ... . I am very , very disappointed with this product.July , 2009 . I 've had this food processor for not quite 6 months . I use it every three days to make my dog 's `` salads . '' Last evening , the black trim on the handle of the 9-cup container broke off in my hand when I was removing the container from the unit . You would think that the manufacturer would realize that a handle that receives a great deal of torque ( twisting the container on and off the motor unit ) should be a one-piece component and not two pieces . My handy hubby has epoxied the handle back together , but he 's not optimistic about how long the fix will last . I 'm told that Cuisinart is no longer a French company , but is now American . This is totally a design flaw , and the American parent company , not the Chinese manufacturer , is to blame . It seems that many products become trash when they become American . How unfortunate . I am going to contact Cuisinart to see if they will replace the container , and will update this posting with the results.Later ... Yes , actually the Customer Service was quite good . They replaced the bowl with the broken handle . But , now , the pusher , which has a `` pin '' which apparently enables the motor when the components are properly assembled , has separated from the pusher . I can still use it , but must be very careful to make sure the pin is manually inserted and at the proper depth to enable the motor . Bother ! ! I have purchased a new pusher ( $ 14.00 ) , and a new bowl ( $ 30.00 ) just to make the cost of shipping worthwhile . And I am now getting a decent result with my dog 's `` salad '' by putting chopped apples in first , followed by the spinach , then weighing everything down with the carrots . But honestly , I ca n't wait until the motor dies on this food processor so I can buy something else .	-1
After using this infrequently over a year 's time , the bowl latch lock on the left side broke while I was shredding soft cheese . The quality of Cuisinart food processors has declined greatly , I had a DLC 7E that lasted nearly 25 years .	-1
Times have changed and so has the parent company that sells and services your food processor . The quality of materials and workmanship have gone downhill too ! My experience with the corporate machine was horrible . Days of long waits to talk to a customer service rep ... never paid off . Each time I called I was eventually forwarded to a recorded message that explained that they were too busy and that I needed to leave my name and phone number . I never did get a call-back . Finally , after several attempts , I was able to get past the initial phone queue and actually talked to a live person who took the information about the condition of all the clear plastic parts on the processor . They were all severely cracked and were not far from flying apart . It seems they knew of the problem and offered to replace the parts on warranty . All I had to do was give them a credit card number to charge the shipping to . AND , nothing would happen UNTIL I sent the old pieces back ... again at MY expense.I sent the parts back promptly , but they did n't ship for another two weeks . And , here is the highlight of the episode ... The lid they sent was the wrong one . Another round of phone calls yielded a person that said that Cuisinart had not processed the replacement yet ... a full two weeks after they were notified . I still have not received the lid and the processor is useless without it.BEWARE ! This company tries to sell their products in the top-end of the price range , but their corporate customer service system is as bad as it gets ... at any price . You can do yourself a favor and shop for another brand . I 'm looking at KitchenAid . Shucks , it ca n't be any worse ... and MAY be a much better experience over the long run .	-1
I bought this as a gift for my sister . Within the first year the body cracked and while she still uses it , I do n't feel safe about it .	-1
I hate to return items so I decided to keep this . I am pretty certain it was already used . Nothing in the box was wrapped in plastic like normal . The box was really worn as if it had been opened several times . You can tell when something has already been opened . It is kind of cheesy ... not what I expected but I will keep it and give it a try . It looks much nicer in the picture .	-1
the product is very cheaply made and does n't hold up . The on-off trigger just fell out of the unit one day for no reason . very noisy unit . not well designed .	-1
I make most of the bread we eat and wanted a way to cut the loaves that would n't leave my hand in a cramp . I was just going to buy a new bread knife but persuaded myself this would be better . Definitely not better , in fact much worse . I ca n't slice half a loaf of bread with this knife without stopping to rest my arm.The problem seems to be the position of the motor . The back of the knife is very heavy and the front ( blades ) is very light . The poor balance puts lots of strain on the forearm and hand.I know you are thinking I am just a weakling , nope , I row and am at the gym 4x a week . : ~ ) This is just a poorly designed machine .	-1
First of all , this knife is underpowered . It bogs down easily and the blades feel reluctant to slice into anything . But there is also a fatal design flaw . The internal mechanism of this knife uses a stainless steel worm gear to drive a nylon circular gear which in turn drives the blades . The second time I used the knife ( on Thanksgiving ) the blades siezed up on a piece of turkey bone . The nylon gear ceased turning because of that but the worm gear continued to spin . I took it apart to see why the knife blades no longer moved even though the motor whirred away . Result ? The nylon gear is stripped and the knife is irreparably dead . It is n't that hard to design a mechanism with a safety cutout to separate the gears if one stops rotating ( or alternatively , to build both gears out of stainless steel ) and given the fact that this is by far the most expensive electric knife there is , Cuisinart certainly should have been able to do so . A knife that disintegrates as soon as it hits something tough is worthless junk . This one cost me $ 25 per cut .	-1
I bought this unit on Amazon about 2 years ago and have used it to carve turkey , brisket and chicken . I have used it 22 times and the knife just stopped working . It 's performance was OK , easy to use and clean , but when my old electric knife lasted for 15 years , this unit is not recommended .	-1
Worked great , then failed . I really dislike how kitchen appliances are made to be disposable.. it is such a waste .	-1
( I bought from Macy 's , not Amazon . ) I use the food processor more than the blender and have been disappointed with its design and performance . In order of importance:1 ) It is extremely LOUD . So loud , I wear ear plugs while using it for more than a 10-15 seconds at a time . Lest you think my hearing is delicate , I saw Jimi Hendrix perform live back in the day.2 ) There is no slow speed . Stir is very fast , and it goes up from there.3 ) As others have noted , the parts break too easily . We already replaced the bowl and now handle it with kid gloves.4 ) My previous food processor had a split pusher block which helped ( a lot ) when feeding carrots and other narrow veggies . The Cuisinart lacks this simple feature which means I foolishly guide the food down the feeder chute with my hand.5 ) For some reason the rubber feet stick to everything . If we leave it on the counter for too long , the feet come off when we pick the base up.It gets two stars because it does process food and blend , but so much else is a dissappointment . Do n't buy this product .	-1
After owning several Cuisinart appliances I 've come to the conclusion that they are the worst on the market . Bad design , lousy functionality ... not a good buy.The body of this is plastic , the lip that locks onto the bowl broke on the 2nd use . A safety issue is that it will run even if the top is not locked on both sides . Minimal speed controls . Mostly just top speed . The blender does work ok ... and the processor does work..it just seems like it 's a real chore to put the thing together when you need to use either of the functions . Sorry I bought this ...	-1
I have had Cuisinart Combo Blender and Food Processor for years . When my first one started falling apart after 10 years of use I decided to buy a new one . The old on the plastic was brittle and things kept breaking but the unit still worked and functioned great . I bought this modal and within a month the bowl chipped and I got such a run around from Cuisinart about replacing it although it was under warranty . They finally sent me a new one . A few months later the unit just stopped working . They told me it had a 3 year warranty but they did not make it easy for me to obtain that service . I sent them my receipt as they asked , called , Emailed and even had registered my product but they said they never got proof of purchase and would not help me . I was so frustrated with the Customer service I just gave up . I will NOT buy another Cuisinart Combo Blender again .	-1
I bought this blender and food processor [ ... ] thinking that it was a 'good buy ' . This is the worst blender I have ever owned ! It went back ! I wanted a blender with a glass jar and flat buttons that did well at blending ice for smoothies and making milk shakes . This blender makes a lot of noise/vibration and does n't do that well at blending anything . The base is stupid , its a big hollow piece of plastic and after using it 2-3 times it started to leak ! I hate all the bulky parts that come with this thing . If you need a blender just buy a blender !	-1
This duet blender seemed just dandy until I started blending shakes daily , using ice . Then it went to hell in a hurry . It burned right out , despite having an ice setting . Smoke issued from the bottom and it was too scary to use anymore .	-1
I read the reviews on this pretty thoroughly before purchasing it . I did check the plastic base of the pitcher - and like someone else mentioned , I too found a hairline crack . I called the company and they gave me no problem - they are sending a new one . I have still used it a few times , and it seems to work great . We are very happy with it so far - it is a million times better than our last blender.UPDATE : The blender only lasted a year before we had the same problem as many others - the blade seized up and tore the bottom to shreds . They sent us a replacement , requesting that we return the broken blade ... . Six months later the exact thing happened to the replacement blade . In addition , the food processor had issues that caused damage within the first few weeks .	-1
THIS MACHINE SEEMED TO BE HANDY BECAUSE IT HAD TWO APPLICANCES IN ONE . IT WORKED INITIALLY THEN BROKE AND THE COST OF SHIPPING TO REPAIR IT WAS NOT WORTH THE HASSLE . PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF MONEY ! ! !	-1
I purchased this toaster about 13 months ago and was dissapointed immediately when I found that even on the highest setting the toast or bagel would not be done after the first pop-up . And of course you send it down again and it burns if you do n't watch it . Then the ultimate insult , one of the elements quit working altogether 13 months later and now I am flipping the bread to toast both sides . As annoyed as I am having wasted my money on this disposable toaster I am looking forward to finding one that will work and be reliable . I wo n't be looking at Cuisinarts !	-1
The finish is not smooth.I do not want to cook with this rack asmy concern is that the coating may flake andmy family may ingest it .	-1
I have used this pan for about 3 years , part time.It beats a crappy Farberware or similar hands down but do n't be fooled so fast about it being a `` luxury '' pan.I have been a witness to Calphalon 's declining quality in recent years and this pan is one of those.Food sticks to it easily . I am no stranger to butter and oil and still this pan makes food adhere . I find that it helps to give it a slow and lengthy warm up to the proper temp but i am resigned to just knowing that food sticks to it now.It is a useful size and shape for spontaneous cooking but i recommend going with a true high quality item such as MC2 from All Clad .	-1
After I read the reviews here , I brought one a month ago from Amazon.As my habit to prepare cooking ware , I boiled water with 80 % full & water+ 1 T of cooking oil for about an hour each time trying to get ride most of chemical residual.The 1st time I used the pot for cooking , the food stick on the bottom of the pot ! I was so SURPRISED to see such a nice pot with this low quality ! Disappointed !	-1
I love calphalon products , so it was a no brainer to order this . I was disappointed . I find it one of my most troublesome pans to clean . I do not have that problem with anything else I 've ever bought that is caphalon , but this tends to simply gather dust until I have no choice to use it .	-1
My first Calphalon ( teflon coated ) set was replaced in its entirety by the company . After pouring hot caramel from the saucepan , I noticed some of the coating from pan 's bottom was missing . Not a good experience , A similar experienceoccurred with another piece from same set . During a year 's convalescence , our housekeeper cooked , cleaned , etc . Once able to get back into my kitchen , I was shocked at how horrible the cookware looked . Set was replaced at no charge to me with the Commercial Hard-Anodized product . Basic food sticks , ( eggs , bacon ) skillets especially are difficult to clean using just Scotch Guard pads ( I 've added baking soda on occasion to speed up process ) . Several pieces are discolored `` almost rust-like '' appearance . Yesterday , visited a major dept store in search of a crepe pan and the salesman recommended Calphalon . Emphatically , told him no and explained my experience . He reminded me of the Lifetime Warranty and recommended I contact the company . He also shared other shoppers have expressed similar concerns with Calphalon noting `` It 's not for the serious home chef . `` I 'm not certain I want another set of Calphalon in my kitchen . Considering going to a restaurant supply store and investing in a professional set of cookware . My dad gave me some pieces nearly 20 years ago and it was an amazing experience . Yes , he was a restauranteur and chef.Calphalon is great for the occasional cook who wants attractive cookware donning his or her kitchen .	-1
This pan was a major disappointment ! I purchased this because it was commercial & hard anodized with a major brand name but that did n't change anything . The first time I used it was to boil noodles that were stirred with a plastic utensil and there are now marks and/or tiny scratches on the bottom ! I had had it with what has been reduced to throwaway pans with the non-stick surfaces that easily scratch , begin to flake and finally end up in the trash . I ca n't believe this is what Calphalon is selling as a commercial pan with a suggested retail of $ 119 ... though I paid $ 29.99 it was n't much for a saucepan with a lid but it 's still a major disappointment . It 's equivalent to the throwaways from the local box stores.I can only guess that there was a problem with the anodized surfaces in a lot of pans and that 's why the price is so low on Amazon . In any event , if you do n't care about marks or scratches then seize the deal and be forewarned . I buy a lot on Amazon and giving something such a low rating is a rarity for me . It has the 2 stars because it 's a nice size at 2.5 quarts , pretty rugged and I hoped all those other poor reviews was due to a bad batch and that I would n't get one ... . and that was a stretch . I have n't used it long enough to determine if the 2 stars is too high so I may be back to reduce that count to 1 star .	-1
It 's a worst piece of Calphalon Commercial line I have owned . The pan has good size ( only 10 '' foot print ) but very thin . Like the other reviewer , the first time I have boiled a large piece of chicken breast in the pan , the interior surface at the bottom seemed to wear away leaving irregular , shiny permanent stain marks . I do n't cook acidic food at all . I wish I can return this pot .	-1
Buy this mixer if you having to use a brillo to get your beaters clean every time they come out of the dishwasher . Hey Hamilton Beach , what kind of cheap Chinese metal did you make these out of ? Every time I take the beaters out of my new Bosch Dishwasher , they 're rusty . I 've tried rinsing them in the sink first but they still come out with rust on them . The problem is with the cheap material HB uses to make the beatters . The mixer itself seems decent for the price but do n't buy this if you do n't want rust in your food .	-1
There is danger with this model and the danger is that the beaters will not go into the sockets not just a little hard but a whole lot hard and when you are mixing I feel the beaters moving from side to side in the sockerts and it makes me nerous while i am using it . Also this unit does not have a slow speed . The first level would be what I call medium and them medium would be fast . I can not imagine anything needing fast with this speeed control that it has . I have had mixers all my life but i have not had me nervour to use when i am trying to make something for my family .	-1
I hate this knife . I 've had it for a year now and every once in a while I figure I 'll give it another shot so I pull it out again and am quickly reminded of why I hate it.First : the two blades are too far apart - I end up with a good fraction of what I 'm cutting getting shredded BETWEEN to the two blades.Second : there 's no lock for the trigger so you have to hold it down for the entirety of the slice ( and if sawing through a thick roast , you 're holding it down for a REALLY long time ) .Third : The handle is large and awkward . I do n't have small hands but just to be sure , I had my large handed friend try it . He did n't consider it to be particularly comfortable either.I 'm going to see if I can find a better electric knife because , lord knows , a good one could get a lot of use in my kitchen . The `` try agains '' for this one are over - I 'm putting it on Ebay for some other unfortunate soul to use . Clearly there are a lot of positive reviews so I 'll sell it to someone who might actually like the thing !	-1
The handle is way too big , so when you try to cut the turkey , you ca n't get a grip on it . It slides around , so the finger slips off the trigger . I wonder what were they thinking when they made this product . Box is crappy quality - it 's brittle inside.Would not recommend buying this . Go try some out in the store , and make sure the grip is smaller and more ergonomical , otherwise , you 'll be as frustrated as I am if you get some grease from the turkey on your hands .	-1
I purchased this knife to replace a Hamilton Beach electric with swivel blades and a carry type grip with pull up trigger that I have used for many years . I could no longer find that style so went with the `` wand '' style now sold by almost everyone . This knife set included a guide for bread slicing.First , this knife was very effective cutting our Turkey for Xmas . No issues on meat . The knife was less effective on the softer items and turned our fresh baked loaf of bread into stuffing material . So +1 for meat and -1 for bread.Second , this knife is EXTREMELY uncomfortable to use more than seconds at a time . The trigger is awkward and hard to hold in the `` on '' position in the best of circumstances . When the unit is slippery ( e.g . from juices on the meat being carved ) it slides back in the hand making operation of the switch almost impossible for someone with adult male hands . With large carving tasks , like the above mentioned Turkey , I need to periodically set the unit down to allow the pain to subside before resuming . The design is ergonomically challenged.The blades clean-up very well in the dishwasher . The cord is long enough that the knife can be used for either side of the cutting board . This knife would have received 4 stars if it was n't so difficult to use comfortably . And really , why do you buy and electric knife ? A good alternative ( albeit more $ $ ) would have been the Hoffritz HZEK1 Electric Knife , but Amazon has apparently discontinued that brand .	-1
Thank goodness this was so inexpensive . It might be able to cut through some English muffins . But as far as slicing ham , it was a disaster , although it probably woud be okay with a Pre-cut spiral sliced ham .	-1
I would have sent it back but I waited too long . I really do n't like it . I am going back to the brand I had before .	-1
This was either a faulty electric knife or the product is poorly made . It would go for a couple of seconds then stop , then go a couple for second or two .	-1
I did n't purchase mine at Amazon , but since I 'm now looking for a new food processor ( and it came up ) , I thought I 'd tell you the good the bad and the ugly about this machine . Yes the price is low and there is a reason for that . The machine comes with several blades and that is swell , however your machine is not strong enough to do much in it . I have a bread recipe that makes 1 loaf , this machine will do it , however , it smells like the machine is on fire when I attempt to do so . The dough ends up inside the metal blade somehow and that is a huge pain to try to clean . I also use quite a bit of cheese and sometimes , I do n't have the time to shread it myself . This handy-dandy food processor can grate part of the cheese and the other part ends up sticking to the top of the shreader blade . I end up getting a little shreaded cheese ( Yes , I sliced the cheese to make it easier on the processor ) and the rest is just a liquified version of cheese . The shreader blade is alot of work to get clean after that . It 's fine for someone who does n't use it much , provided that the items you are attempting to process are pre-chopped by hand first . This kind of defeats the purpose of a food processor in my book . So , my friends , I 'm moving on to something bigger , badder and better !	-1
It 's well worth spending 30 % more to get a more robust machine with better parts and container . I knew better : small kitchen appliances should start at $ 60 at least if you want them to last more than 2 years . This one did n't last 2 weeks . My bad . This is a toy and not suited for repeated use over the years.The motor seems like it could power a house . Too bad it will see little use .	-1
I had been researching processors for a while and was on a limited budget so I went with this one ( $ 30 on sale ) . I got home so excited to check it out and it had a starnge discoleration on the blade shaft . I went on to investigate it and realized there was sticky , gross food all over it ! ! ! OUTRAGEOUS ! Then I plugged it in , and of course it did n't work . I do n't know what the people who owned it before me did to it , but it obviously could n't take it.Now I wonder if they just packed it up and returned it , or if Target was responsible for this ! No wonder it was on sale !	-1
I threw mine away because I could never get that new appliance plastic taste out of it . Everything I cooked tasted like plastic and went in the garbage . I tried everything to make the smell go away ... finally , I gave up . Save your money	-1
Why bother paying money for something that only stirs drinks ( spoons work ! ) or blends cocktails and milkshakes ( that 's what blenders are for ! ) . I received this as a gift , and at first thought it was the neatest thing ... a retro milkshake maker . But it does n't have much power , you have to make sure the cup is securely on or a huge mess will splatter everywhere , and if your ingredients are hard ( like ice or ice cream ) you 'll be waiting forever for the drink to be made . Stick with a regular blender for milkshakes and drinks , and save some money and counter space .	-1
does not work well with hard ice cream . Probably work great with soft but who has that on had . I still use my had mixer . Love the cup that came with it . would probably be fine if you were making a shake with soft ice cream It has power the mixer only has one little round plastic think at the bottom and its just not enough to mix that hard ice cream . very disappointed .	-1
I had to develop a strategy for adding milk and ice cream just the right way to get it to mix . Otherwise , I ended up with lumps of ice cream in a puddle of milk . Then , after just a few weeks of regular use , it started to make a burning smell and an awful noise that sounded like the motor was falling apart . This might be good for mixing powdered mixes with liquid , but is nowhere near powerful enough to make an ice cream shake .	-1
Not really worth it ... .more of a novelity then anything else ... look sturdy in picture but is plastic toy to be honest . It works , but if you have a blender use it instead and save your $ $ .	-1
This product could be great if you just want to mix powdered drinks . However , I bought it for ice cream shakes/malts . This is NOT a good product for that . It is not powerful enough for ice cream and the mixer continues to hit the side of the metal cup making loud noises . I will stick to my blender .	-1
... to pry this thing open ? ? I tried at 3 minutes , 4 minutes , 5 minutes ... I started to get worried at 10 minutes and unpluged the unit . Then I pried it open using a knife and proceeded to break a chopstick getting fossilized batter out of the grooves . I needed a toothbrush to get the gunk out . Oh , and it was still steaming at 10 minutes . ( The steam was definitely not coming from the waffle ! ) Then , I tried it again , with a different batter . Same result ( mind you , it takes about half an hour to pry everything out ) . And again , with cooking spray ( so much for non-stick ! ) and again with about five seconds of cooking spray . That did the trick , but the waffle had the texture of a deep-fried cake . Hmmmm ... it was tasty though , hence the two stars.Is this supposed to be non-stick or what ? ? ?	-1
This waffle maker is Definitely Not for Morning waffles . If you have all Sunday for brunch , you can make decent budget waffles for 4 in half-an-hour . Do n't expect 'restaurant quality ' as some here have said . These make deep-welled , tho unevenly browned , home-made American waffles . Good to eat , but not really Belgian as you may find in a nice restaurant.I made the buttermilk recipe from the package instructions . Took 7 mins . per waffle ! ! I used a kitchen timer . Breakfast for 4 ? You 'd have to make the waffles in advance to have them ready for all to eat together . 1/2 hour to cook four waffles = not hot and crisply just-made . I did try using less batter , but they did n't cook faster . It just made a funny-shaped waffle as the batter did n't fit the full grid , and the thinness made the top-side cook even more unevenly with lots of pale , unbrowned edges . Probably the recipe , which was very thick batter.They turned out ok , tho they cook unevenly . The bottoms evenly brown but the tops are not cooked evenly ; from pale-ly done to brown . Also , the 2 front elements on the top iron cook faster/darker than the 2 rear ones . Each of the 4 topside end up varying brownness . ( I even tried turning them over to brown the tops better . ) They do come out crunchy on outside and cooked moist inside ; not soggy but perhaps a little too moist.The worst is that there is no timer . The instructions say they are done when the steam decreases . Ok. Well , at 7 mins. , there was still an ample amount of steam coming from the unit . But I found this time was best for the recipe , so they do n't burn.You ca n't clean this unit with damp paper towels , as others have raved can be done . Paper towels do n't reach into the deep wells . I used a silicone pastry brush to 'dust ' the elements clean , then used a paper towel to clean up around the rim , and on the outside case.If I had to do it over again , to get as-close-to-Belgian-style waffles at home , I would try one of the brands where you can flip the sides over . Perhaps they would cook more evenly because of the flipping ; gravity side down cooking better.I also suggest that all these new wafflers , whatever brand out on the market today be made with removeable plates for easier cleaning.Happy waffling !	-1
Well . It makes waffles . Just not very well.First , it does n't have a light to show if it 's preheating/preheated . There 's just a little orange light that basically tells you that it 's on . You just plug it in and wait.Second , it gets REALLY HOT . Duh , but I mean the handle that you use to lift the top gets so hot that you need an oven mitt to open it , which is a minor annoyance , but a big pain to open without scorching your hand . You would think they would use a heat resistant material for the handle , at least.Third , it does n't make your waffles golden brown . I mean , I left the waffle in there longer , experimented with different sprays , altered the mix ... but no . No golden waffles here . I 've used my friend 's black and decker waffle maker frequently before I bought this one that somehow produces golden , crispy and fluffy waffles with ease . And here I thought waffle makers were all equal . My mistake.Fourth , A MESS . Spill guard is worthless . I had batter oozing out of the right side and one of the squares on the left was thin and holey , because the batter did n't spread evenly . And remember what I said about this thing getting hot EVERYWHERE . That means you ca n't even touch it to tilt it , evening out the batter.Waste of money .	-1
We had a waffle maker , which broke . We replaced it with this because of its lack of controls on the front , which is what did in our previous waffle maker . It 's a decent waffle maker , and it makes crisp , fluffy waffles . However , I think it overcooks them a bit for my liking , and it 's not configurable to change the cook time , so I have to peer in occasionally to see if the waffles are done to my liking . Also , it does not use any audible tone to indicate that waffles are finished , which is another negative for me . Finally , I feel like it takes forever to cook waffles , and that 's my main dissatisfaction with it .	-1
So lucky to have a `` king unit '' ; means the one who escaped from the QC line.Broken after 1st waffle finished and stop to heat up for 2nd one.unplug and let it sit for 30 minutes and try to use again , still not heat at all , the heating light never light up again ... too bad	-1
While this waffle maker makes good waffles , the design is not well executed . The handles are small and very close to the griddle . They get extremely hot , and you have to reach into the steam from the batter to get them . It 's very easy to get burned - actually it 's impossible to use this unit without an oven mitt .	-1
After reading the good reviews for this waffle maker I added it to my amazon wishlist and received it as a Christmas gift.We are SO disappointed with this waffle maker . The waffles are n't crisp . They come out more like tall pancakes with squares in them.In addition , the waffles tend to stick to the waffle maker and it 's hard to get that stuff out of there.We are n't nearly as happy with this waffle maker as we were with our Presto 03510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker . That thing made the crispiest waffles ever . Since it stopped working after 2 years I thought I 'd try something else hoping it would last longer . It might last longer but the waffles are n't very waffly.I 'm thinking of buying the Presto again because I miss those crispy waffles ...	-1
Let me preface this by saying that at $ 4.40 there is n't much risk in buying this thermometer . Given Amazon 's great customer service I 'm sure I can return it but it 's not really worth sending it back . I 've read the previous comments and 5-star ratings and I 'm left wondering if anyone else checked the accuracy before commenting . I checked it out at with accurate digital and analog thermometers at room temperature of 68 degrees , at refrigerator temperature of 36 degrees , and at a freezer temperature of -2 degrees . In all cases I found the Taylor Professional Freezer-Refrigerator Thermometer to read 3 degrees lower than actual temperature . There does not seem to be any way to adjust the dial with the exception of taking it apart and moving the faceplate ( not sure if that is possible without breaking it ) . I gave it only one star for just this reason ; that you can not calibrate the unit for error , not for the inaccuracy itself.It does have a big dial and is easy to read but I think at the critical temperature of a refrigerator it is important to be accurate . I realize there may be many people who do not have the equipment to check out the accuracy as I do , but there is a significant difference in storing food at 37 degrees F rather than at 40.So if you 're agreeable to mentally normalizing the temp ( as I will do ) when you read it , I suppose you 'd be satisfied with it given it 's low cost . That last statement presupposes that the one you buy has the same inaccuracy as mine . Who knows , the one you get might be `` right on '' but how would you know that without calibrating it ?	-1
I rarely give bad reviews because most products have one redeeming quality , but that is not the case here . The build quality is terrible , glass is loose , the needle wobbles and frequently rests on the face . It is grossly inaccurate , off by 20+ degrees . at room temperature it often reads between 140 and 160 . At boiling it reads well over 212 , no way to be sure how much.Do not buy this product . I 'm looking for a replacement already ,	-1
temperature is not accurate . I have a very very old meat thermometer that is more reliable than this piece of junk . do n't waste your money on this	-1
I received this thermometer as a stocking stuffer and initially , I was enthusiastic since I like to barbeque and the analog models I had were not instant response.Unfortunately , this unit was no improvement . It might be instant response but it was rarely accurate . In a number of instances , the variation in temperature between this unit and my old thermometers was greater than 20 degrees although calibration of each unit happened at the same time .	-1
I did n't expect the world from this thing , I had an older one from this company and it was ok . Took about 20-40 seconds to get an accurate reading . This new one however is un-usable , Cooked sausages after 12 minutes ... reads 105 F , burgers after they are well done ... 120 F. The time to get to that point is over a minute as well.Point is this thermometer does n't even do it 's basic job and is worthless even for basic needs .	-1
Slow reading ; I melted the dial cover by mistake . Not a good value ...	-1
Time is relative . If you are slow and consider an `` instant '' to be ~20seconds , this thermometer is for you.When I look at the gauge , I can read it instantly , but that 's true of any thermometer.I purchased an electronic thermometer that gets its reading in under 10s , so I 've been using that .	-1
I 'm having accuracy issues even after calibration . It is reading a good 10 degrees lower than actual temps in the 150 to 180 range . I tested it against 2 very high in systems I use at work .	-1
I had the opportunity to use this thermometer once after losing my previous meat thermometer of 15 years.The second time I went to use this thermometer , the internal face spun around freely inside the enclosure . Obviously this makes it impossible to tell the temperature and rendered the thermometer useless.I always try to remember that you get what you pay for . For this product it 's sadly too true .	-1
I 'm pretty sure I could have gotten a more accurate reading by poking my finger into the roast . Not joking ! This thermometer is so wildly inaccurate as to be less than useless . It 's not off by a degree or two - it 's off by several dozen degrees !	-1
I did n't realize from the picture that this thermometer is only about 5 inches long . This is way too short for measuring the internal temp of a compost pile . Most of these are 18 in long so I thought this one was too . It 's pretty much useless .	-1
Too small . I have to put my reading glasses on to see the numbers . I do n't use it very often .	-1
I 've owned several of these probe-type thermometers over the years , they usually wind up getting their faces melted by well-meaning family members who leave them in the oven with the roast , are left in the sink to soak ( they 're not waterproof ) and in general they do the job they 're designed to and , all things considered ( Dollar-Yen conversion , Balance of Trade , `` The Fed '' and Fiat money , and the amazingly poor quality of goods flooding the US markets since Nixon went to China ... I told you `` all things considered '' and I may have missed a few key points ) , one would think that under weekly use , stick it in a piece of roast , or a roast chicken , rinse and wipe off the tip and put it back in the mixed utensil drawer , it would last for decades . But this last one did n't . I did n't buy this through Amazon or I might have a leg to stand on , and the kitchen store at the mall has closed its doors . Bummer . What happened is the calibration scale came loose so there is no way to read the actual internal temperature . Thinking the `` base nut '' ( a stainless steel hex nut below the needle/scale housing ) might be tightened , I tried this , but it came loose , and proved to be held in place to the probe and housing with a very small dab of adhesive , not welded/silver soldered as one might think , not threaded , not splined and indexed , but slip-on assembly just held together with glue . Very poor overall design , very poor construction . Very disappointing . I 'm TRYING to spend a whole lot more for another one , thinking it might last longer , be better construction , but I do n't want digital/electronic . Just simple . Professional grade . Willing to pay much more .	-1
The reason I 'm scared to use this Taylor Classic Roast-Yeast Thermometer is : # 6 on back of package instructions says , `` The black fluid in the thermometer is nontoxic . However , it does have a sharp taste and definite odor . If the thermometer breaks on insertion or is discovered broken , the meat can be cut out around the thermometer to remove the discolored section . '' ( There 's more ) Made in China . I would never have bought it if I knew this about it .	-1
I do n't use a thermometer very often but when I do I have never felt comfortable that the reading was accurate . There had been times when it appeared to be too low a temp for the time the meat had been cooking or it 's the reverse and too high . Today I used it and it registered to the very top above the highest reading.Simply not reliable .	-1
My old candy/frying thermometer broke . I had liked it so much , I replaced it with the same type , this one . Unfortunately , they are no longer good quality . I have only had this a few months and the numbers are fading . A thermometer without numbers is useless . Do n't buy this thermometer .	-1
I 'm sure it will get a 5 star if I ever get the item . I placed the order on 2/6/07	-1
I have the same thermometer but it was sold as & # 34 ; Food Network & # 34 ; . Never really accurate and lost accuracy during each use ... now constantly reads 120 degrees . Same as other reviews numbers fading or disappeared ... Would have given zero stars if available.Spend a few dollars more and buy a digital probe style ... not as convenient but accurate .	-1
Initially I loved this thermometer . It seemed to be both responsive and accurate . Then the nice black numbers started to disappear . Ultimately , the temperature I was measuring became guesswork . Then I accidentally resolved the issue - I dropped the thermometer and the glass shattered . Excuse the slight touch of sarcasm but breaking the thermometer was n't detrimental to its accuracy .	-1
The first time I used this thermometer I pulled it out of my candy and noticed that the numbers on the thing had faded and halfway disappeared , releasing whatever ink they use into the candy I was making . Sure it was a fluke , I returned it to get a new one and the second one did the same thing . Gross ! Talk about a fatal flaw ! Not only do the numbers become illegible after two or three uses , but who wants to eat ink ? Ew . Stay far , far away .	-1
Similar to another reviewer , I bought this at the recommendation of a respected test cooking kitchen . It quit working after a year . Also found that the metal hook on top ( that allows it to hang from an oven rack ) scratched the bottom of all my metal baking pans .	-1
The thermometer worked perfectly in my gas oven - for a while . All of my cakes and casseroles turned out beautifully . Unfortunately , the liquid in the tube separated the day I was making my Thanksgiving pies . I figured it was an unlucky fluke , so I ran to Ace Hardware to purchase another for the same $ 15 . The second one died the same death a month later , just in time for my Christmas pies . I finished my holiday baking sans thermometer.Later , I emailed Taylor ( it has a nice warranty ) , and they suggested I place the thermometer upright in the freezer until the liquid reconnected , or alternately , hold the thermometer at the end opposite the bulb and swing it to force the liquid back together . Neither option worked . I would have contacted them about replacing it , but I lost the original purchase info in a hectic Army move scheduled right before New Year's.Both thermometers were very accurate ( judging by my cake and pie baking performances ) . However , the liquid in the glass seems doomed to separate . Apparently it is volatile and prone to separation , especially when stored at warm temperatures ( a gas oven ) and in a horizontal fashion ( design feature ) . I think it might be helpful to remove the thermometer from the oven and store upright when not in use to extend its life , but that is something I am unlikely to remember . However , considering the second thermometer lasted only a month , even attentive care might not add a significant amount of time .	-1
I , too , bought this because it was highly rated by Cook 's . Contrary to their review , however , I find it neither easy to read nor stable . After it gets a little dirty ( which wo n't take long in the oven ) it is nearly impossible to read . And if you rest it on top of a rack you will knock it over when you put anything in the oven . If you hang it will also get knocked over . It is accurate though .	-1
Buy at your own risk or return quickly.That others reported the numbers rubbed off when cleaned did not bother me . I wanted a new oven thermometer that would be easy to read.Firstly , however , I wanted one that would be reliable ... truth telling reliable.Have two others , both now register very different # s than the setting and I thought this would be the tie-breaker.On the first use it only registered the setting I put the oven on - and I know from history that is just plain wrong , that my oven is off 15 or more degrees [ how many degrees is what this piece of metal was to show me ] . Set the oven for 350 , this registered 350 and the other two thermometers showed 15-30 degrees lower . Should have sent it back then , but I was making something that day that was forgiving re precise temp. , so I shrugged and decided to try again another day.Today was that day [ of course , the day after the return window expired ] : and it stopped registering when it got to 400 degrees ; exhausted probably from having been used once already.So , this thing is worse than the two I already have . Will now look for a 4th one to purchase . And maybe a new stove in the Fall .	-1
I just received my Taylor Oven Guide Thermometer . I wanted an accurate thermometer to check/verify various temperature settings in our 36 '' Wolf Gas oven.The thermometer itself is simple and appears to be high quality . Upon checking the thermometer out further I noticed that the glass thermometer rod slides back and forth , left and right , on the stainless steel holder , thus accuracy goes right out the window perhaps by as much as + or - 15 degrees . What I did to correct this was hold the blue bulb end of the thermometer in boiling water and made adjustments until the blue line and the metal scale on the thermometer were aligned exactly at 212 degrees F ( the boiling point of water ) . Next , without moving the glass rod , I locked it in place on the stainless steel scale with small dabs of high temp gasket cement on each end where the small rivets and holding bands are located.Taylor Products : If you are reading this please make a note that the Taylor Oven Guide Thermometer has a manufacturing/design defect . The Taylor Oven Guide Thermometer with shipping was fairly expensive . The customer should not be expected to have to calibrate and then cement the glass tube to prevent sliding or back and forth movement in this type of thermometer.If this thermometer came calibrated +/- .5 degrees and locked in I 'd given it 5 stars .	-1
No matter how or where I mount this thermometer , I ca n't tell what the temp is in my oven . I 've got a squeaky clean window , so that is n't the problem . I 've tried to put it as close to the window without being in the way of the food I 'm cooking . I 've tried it with the internal light on and off . I 've tried different angles by bending the base . I even tried to rotate the thermometer glass ( VERY carefully ) . No matter what I tried , I still ca n't read the darn thing . I guess I 'll try a good old dial type next .	-1
nuff said . has n't stuck well to the sink from day one . one suction cup works better than the other . it just sits above my sink with sponges in it , which is n't much use .	-1
I think it has something to do with the surface of my sink but very disappointed . I still use it to hold the sponge but , it just sits in the bottom of the sink .	-1
This caddy serves the purpose of holding a sponge and a liquid dishwashing soap . Nice look in our sink but it only lasted 2 weeks before rusting . Suction seems ok as mine held its place in the stainless sink and our granite counter top . If you are looking for a stainless one , this is not it . Just spend more and look for a stainless one .	-1
It 's works but honestly you do n't need it . It makes my table dirty ...	-1
It 's very small and does n't stick well on the side of the sink . Can hardly out a scrubber in there and when the scrubber is wet , it 's too heavy for this stand . Waste of money .	-1
I like the design , but it no longer sticks to the surface . It is currently sitting on my counter , still holding the sponge . It keeps it off the counter and allows it to dry , but I do n't like that it moves around because it ca n't stick .	-1
I had one of these before that was excellent , but this particular one was extremely hard to pump and lasted less than a month before the cup that builds suction broke off inside and I had to throw it away .	-1
I bought one to give it the benefit of the doubt . I 've used it six times so far and found that it does nothing . If anything , it seemed to make the fizz die faster . This is just my opinion . It did n't work for me . I pumped it enough times and took every precaution to keep the soda out of the device itself . Even pumping until the bottle is very , VERY hard , it still did n't hold fizz for a few days . I am thiking the previous post is correct . Air pressure does not keep CO2 in the liquid . Perhaps if it pumped pure CO2 into the bottle it would work , but it does n't . I supposed that is why they make smaller bottles . I wo n't waste money on another one .	-1
Worked well for a few months but after that I noticed I started opening drinks and they were completely flat . Worse off then if I had just put the regular cap on . Lost its seal and I threw it away .	-1
PLEASE READ THE 1-STAR REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING ! This is too common . BOUGHT 7/2012 , RIP 6/2013.I barely used this POS much less than 1/month for a year , then after going paleo last month I started using it 3-4X/week on soft veggies such as onion slices , herbs , or to make mayo . 1 month later it died . I plugged it in to make some guac and NOTHING . no motor sound at all . so mad I 'm on here looking for another one . If this had been $ 20 I 'd be less mad but $ 40 for basically a month of use ? GGggrrrr ! ! That 's what I get for picking an item because of the cute colors but it also has great reviews ! my little cheapo electric $ 20 push-button chopper I got from a chain drugstore before this one lasted YEARS but was too small so I spent more money on this piece of junk.I just read in another 1-star review that the warranty is 1.5 years so lets see if I can get a free replacement ( that will probably die also but at least give me more time before I have to buy a DIFFERENT brand ) .	-1
I am really disappointed with Cuisinart . This product was already not great to begin with , but now it has completely stopped working after maybe a dozen uses . I will not buy a Cuisinart product again .	-1
The two buttons process food exactly the same way . The unit does n't really chop nor does it grind ... More like MUSHES everything together to become glob . I do n't really recommend it .	-1
I bought this in addition to my Ninja . I already have a generic brand of a tiny food processor and it works way better than this cuisinart does . I simply pureed steamed peaches and steamed sweet potato and apples . All of which were near a pureed state already . It took more than 5 minutes per 3 cup , even with water added , to puree these items , one by one.You can not push a button and let it go , you have to stand there and hold the Chop or Blend button until you want to just drop . Then , even while you have your hand over the entire food processor , trying to hold it in place , it still manages to vibrate across the counter . I have never in my life seen anything so stupid or cheap . I have no time to stand there holding a button and why it takes so long to puree mashed food ? I 'll never know.The color is beautiful , I ordered the dark blue , but as far as any other functionality ? It 's worthless to me . Even after I pureed my baby 's food , it still would n't go through a sieve . There has to be something better out there for creating a puree . If you want it for chopping , well , good luck , it will be vibrating away and you 'll be trying to hold it down .	-1
This product is functional so no complaints about it working , however , it is so cheap it does n't line up with what I have come to know and expect from Cuisinart . The `` brushed chrome '' is plastic , as it the canister itself . I use it , but keep it hidden under the counter when not in use as it is n't worthy of being on display among its classy counterparts . Tsk , tsk , Cuisinart !	-1
Cuisinart is the brand standard , so I thought buying a low end model would be fine . However , I was making a potato soup - and it was leaking from everywhere . I had to push down on the lid with a cloth to keep it from spurting everywhere . Definitely not air tight when snapped together . I would recommend buying a higher version - this works but is messy and cumbersome .	-1
I bought this thinking it would be a nice little chopper for herbs , garlic or parmesan cheese . It fails miserably . The only thing it chops well is air . The blade spins nice and fast until you put anything in and then it comes to a grinding halt . The only thing I 've managed to chop with it is a few sprigs of parsley . Apparently , the motor is so weak that it can only handle the lightest task . It 's a complete waste of money and I do n't recommend it at all .	-1
The cutters are flimsy and thin . They were bent out of shape when I took them out of the box . It says 10 piece set but there are only 7 pieces in it . Uh ... that 's called false advertising and it 's against the law the last time I checked.The pieces are kind of big for a kid 's gingerbread house . We are allergic to gluten , so I made my own gluten free dough . It took an enormous amount of dough to make just one house . I guess your perception of size is relative , but for that amount of dough , it gets costly.Overall I 'm unhappy with this product .	-1
I ordered the Fiesta butter dish in Shamrock -- very pretty color . I really like Fiesta dishes , but the butter dish top just does n't accommodate a standard 4 ounce block of butter . There is plenty of room on the base of the dish but the top just dangled on top of the butter . It 's too narrow and short . Too bad -- I would have loved to have kept this butter dish had it worked ! Fortunately , the return was easy and I received a credit right away .	-1
I could n't wait to open my new package of fiesta dishes ... But , when I did , I found nothing but pieces : ( This is the first time that I have had problems with Amazon but this was bad . There was nothing marked on the box to say that it had fragile goods inside . Inside the box , there were three of those air bags down at the bottom ? ? ? There was nothing protecting the dishes on the top , bottom or other side . I do n't understand , anybody would be able to pack this box better . I 'm still waiting for my replacement . I will post again once that one arrives .	-1
I love Fiestaware , but this Ivory color which looks beautiful here , came to me as a very pale yellow . You would never consider it Ivory . I got this color when it first came out so I am hoping that they have improved the color .	-1
I ordered two sets of these to start with . Both came with a large number of pinholes and some small , what I guess you would call blistering . Extremely poor quality craftsmanship when you consider a four person place setting will run you $ 200 . I will be opting for other brands .	-1
Not only did Amazon send me bad set , then bad replacement set , they screwed around and refused to send proper return labels and home pick up after 4 request . 3 were very polite requests , the 4th was hostile . I will drive them over to the UPS for shipping after the storming is over . This killed many orders I would have made . Sick of the horrible service .	-1
I purchased eight 4 piece place settings in cobalt . No doubt , the color is beautiful ! However , every plate that I opened had little scratches all over already , just in packaging . On the dark color of the cobalt , the scratches in the clear glaze really stand out . I ca n't imagine how badly this would scratch with everyday utensil use , if it scratches so easily just by stacking.For that much money per place setting , I was expecting more . So , sadly , I wo n't be keeping these : (	-1
This item is well crafted and looks great . However , it 's entirely the wrong sizing to hold Sweet & low packets . It 's actually way too big and the packets clumsily fall around ... . I ended up purchasing something else skinnier and longer . This item now holds teabags	-1
My pepper mill took a few more months , it seems , to get stuck in coarse-grind mode , but is now firmly stuck there , dispensing only tooth-jarring chunks of pepper . I tried everything short of breaking the thing open . I 'm going to try to get a replacement from the company , and if I do , then I 'll give it another shot , but I 'm really regretting not just shelling out an extra few bucks for something better . If the replacement breaks , I 'm going to bite the bullet and buy a Perfex .	-1
I ordered this mainly for the task of fine grating , hence I ordered also the recommended specialty discs with the fine grating . I figured if I would have a gadget to do fine grating by the bulk ( I got tired doing it by hand ! ) , I might as well have one that can do the slicing ( I have used my Zyliss mandoline for slicing purposes ) . The photo is misleading as it shows slices of what seems like a whole apple . The recommended disc set should have also come with a recommendation to get a stem disc that will enable attachment to the food processor ( but like I said , they are not compatible ) . The food processor that will go with this disc set and the supposed disc stem is another model , but definitely not this one . Which model ? I do n't know . Cuisinart 's documentation leaves a lot to be desired . No reference was made on the product literature of the disc set as to what food processor model this set can be used in . I am returning both products . What a waste of my time ( and I have to pay not only shipping fee but also a restocking fee for the disc set which came from Kitchen Clique ) . I am not a happy customer this time . : (	-1
Thought it was new but it probably was not . Motor was burned out and never worked . Did not have the time to start returning so I just gave it to charity for parts .	-1
I would simply expect a blender to blend smoothies and crush ice , but this product does n't work well at either of those things . It is very slow at mixing a smoothie/milkshake , and I have to stop several times to push the ingredients down with a spoon because this blender does n't blend them , except in the bottom 2 inches of the container . I 'm going to give mine away and try the Oster Beehive blender - I 've used one before and it worked well . I have n't used the food processor , but based on other people 's reviews , I think I 'll give that away too and get a real one.Do n't waste your money - look elsewhere for a blender .	-1
I first reviewed this item favorably a few months after purchase ; however , this dispenser simply does not hold up . After 3 years of use it leaks constantly and pours inconsistently . The pouring irregularity was noticeable at first , but combined with constant and inexplicable leaking it has made this product more trouble than it 's worth . The leaking eventually got so bad that I threw this dispenser out . When taking the price into account this purchase has been a tremendous disappointment .	-1
Most of the glasses came in-tact but two of them were broken . I 'll be calling Amazon and see if they can ship two more glasses or I may have to return them and wait for new ones.The smaller glasses seem a bit more sturdier than the bigger ones..Again , for $ 22.49 I was hoping to get more value for money..The glasses have a slight bend ( dent ) and that gives you a good grip to hold onto..Update : Called Amazon and they said they would be sending another shipment . Its great Amazon is standing behind its products	-1
Nice color , but did not hold up to shipping at all . Of the 16 glasses 11 had broken in shipping !	-1
I bought these about 4 months ago , because they got good reviews , and I really liked the color . However , they have not held up at all . The first two that broke , I convinced myself that we were too rough with them . One by one they went though . We bought two sets , and have 5 glasses left . Is it possible to get a bad batch of glass ? I would give them 5 stars if I bought them as disposable glasses.If you own these , hold them up to the light , and you might discover cracks in yours too . They are not always easy to spot . And , sure they stack , but good luck getting them apart.Glad I got them at a good price , or I would be disgruntled , rather than annoyed .	-1
Swing-A-Way can openers are no longer made in the USA and the quality shows . We bought one to replace the previous model that had lasted over 15 years . It was obvious from day one it would n't last more than a year . It was `` stripping '' cans within two weeks . We packed it up and sent it back to where it came from and got our money back.Very dissapointing to see another quality American-Made product destroyed by the China Syndrome .	-1
I bought this can opener after much searching for a can opener made in the USA . Several reviews and other sites stated that the Swing-A-Way 709BK is an American made product . This is FALSE . I received it today and there 's a big MADE IN CHINA stamped right on it . It feels flimsy , not much different than a $ 1.99 can opener from walmart . Way overpriced for the cheap made in china junk it is . I 'd send it back if it would n't cost more in shipping than this is worth . I do n't know if these were at one time well made items , but they definitely are n't now ! If you want a quality product made in America that will last decades , STAY FAR AWAY FROM SWING-A-WAY !	-1
Here 's the scoop on the `` made in China '' discussion regarding Swing-a-way can openers . I called the AMCO Company last week and was told that since approximately 2008-2009 all their Swing-a-way can openers are made in China . Seems the original company may have changed hands a couple of times through the years , so those brands we could rely on , and were American made are no longer around . After spending quite a bit of time on the Internet searching , it appears that none of the other home can openers are made in the USA either . I called OXO and one other company as well , and the story was the same , all made in China . I just finished rummaging around in storage ( ie. , `` should have thrown it away '' stash ) and found my two old Swing-a-ways and will try to clean them up and see if they will continue on for a few more years .	-1
Horrible design where dirt glogs easily and you ca n't get inside to clean ! I am giving mine to the Salvation Army for a tax write-off and looking for a simple design I can unclog !	-1
I bought this fan for a friend . They were previously on sale at Cosco @ 2 for $ 39 . She was disappointed , as she said it was n't very powerful . It does move air around but that 's about it . This fan is OVERPRICED ! !	-1
Yeah , it will last for a few years until the cheap bearings fail ... then you 'll hear a low rumble at first which goes away for awhile when they warm up . After that it will get louder . Soon it will just seize and stop . That 's when you discover that the motor has overheated and burned out although there will be no visible indication of that fact . It just wo n't rotate at all . That has been my experience .	-1
The good- Very quiet , at first ( more on that later ) The bad- Steam comes out at a low rate , even at the high setting- Needs frequent cleaning due to scale , especially on difficult to clean heating elementThe very ugly- After 3 months of use has become very noisy , to the point that we are rarely using it . Quality control is not what it needs to be .	-1
The air cleaning ability of this machine is minimal and only good for airborn large dust particles . Does not clear smoke for example . Because of its design ( intake/outflow ) it makes a better fan or white noise machine than any kind of air cleaner . I 'm no engineer but I think If the intake/outake areas were reversed it would be a bit more efficent . This machine does not move the air around even in the immediate area around it .	-1
I had , note HAD , two ( 2 ) of these Honeywell units , and overall , they were on the noisy side when compared to the Hunter Quietflo , but they did the job , BUT just FOR a few years , then both of motors burnt out ... the first unit warned me with a squealing noise for about a week and then just froze up ... the second one , well , it was the silent sufferer of the two , never complained but just stopped one evening within months of the first . If it would have be just one of the air purifiers , well , I would have though bad luck ... but both ? NOT . I had the motors checked out and both were DOA ... my option was to send them back to Honeywell and have them replaced for almost price that I paid ... the other was to buy another . That is what I did , but , not Honeywell ( I bought the Hunter QuetFlo # 30402 ) . For the price of a Honeywell the motor should run for many years , not just a few . Conditionally recommended	-1
***Instead of returning it yet Im ordering another hepa filter from `` ashtma allergy technologies '' Ive used them for years for these supplies but wasnt sure if their hepa 's will smell now too ( didnt in past ) , they say they are not made like honeywells and use plastic white not black rubber for the reasone Ive stated below . I have one on order and will update after trying it , it is a 45 dollar extra expense tho ' , but I vacuum them so they do last . You can find that company online , they will take the return if ness ' too . Ive had good service in past from them and do have a past hepa from them its fine.ORIG review : The negative reviews about filter odor is true , I tried to ignore them but ... I was unsure on buying this because I really wanted another honeywell ( I 've used them for 20 yrs ) but the reviews worried me . I ignored them because you can only get the tower purifiers in this price range now and they just do not move enough air to meet my allergy / asthmatic needs in any size space . ( I tried one first , in our small apt ) .This honeywell seemed to be the right choice , easy to move easy to turn on and change filter and it sounded nice like we were used too , quieter then what we had but still white noise and not `` whirry '' sounding . We used it first night after airing it outside ( running it ) and vacuuming hepa filters.Well I had awful allergies , and opened it up when it was warm inside the rubber seals on the helpa filter ends wreak of chemicals , I recognized** as something that will only get worse.It eventually turns fishy or vinegar odor as it ages , and other reviews confirmed this . Im very frustrated since this was my only choice and the one I wanted . The larger honeywell round ones get even worse reviews for my issues . ( odors on filters too ) So it smells and will not off gas ever so IM done its going back to the store . Maybe if your only concern is dust and dirt but not odors and allergies it would be okay ? ( for a small room ) .Note : if you still try it , make sure yours comes with all four rubber feet on bottom or in box , mine missed one and they wont send them , said they cant must be returned ( for a sticky rubber foot ? ) LOL This was before I knew what is smelled like . **I recognized the odor because last summer we purchased an office chair whose seat has this toxic rubber in it smells identical and is now hitting the fishy faze . And Im stuck with it . Not again , not for me not for my lungs . Especially from an air cleaner ! ! Defies logic .	-1
I was very interested in this product , but some investigation reveals that it may no longer be supported by the manufacturer & filters may be or become hard to obtain.I could n't find this model on Honeywell 's website ( though I did see a picture of it somewhere ) . Perhaps it was replaced by the Enviricaire Elite series ? Another website that sells filters for this product says they can no longer obtain them from Honeywell and Honeywell has not provided any explanation for the current situation . Search for `` enviracaire replacement filter '' on the web to see what I mean.Do some research before purchasing any of the Honeywell Enviracaire products .	-1
This is supposed to be a universal double boiler , but it 's hard to use because it fits no pan well -- making it hard to stir , and giving you a limited `` surface area '' for use . Also , due to it 's curved bottom , it wo n't stand up on its own if you remove it from the `` boiling '' pan ( to set beside you as you mold candy , etc . )	-1
I loved this until the teflon coating starting flaking off.we were using this to boil the milk for yogurt for my grandaughter . the teflon started to flake off ... so we ca n't use it.I am a little paranoid about food and contamination ... ( all my grandaughter 's dishes and food storage are glass or ceramic ... ) no plastic ... so flaking teflon did not work for me.I had to throw it away ... .. a stainless steel version of this would be great so if you are the mfgr of this ... consider making that.the product is good except for the flaking teflon coating .	-1
I would not buy this item again . The top layer of fabric on this item was very cheap and thin . So thin in fact that for me it started peeling off . I am not sure if it was due to the exposure of heat or if it was just a cheap product . It was almost flaking off in my food . Gross ! Don & # 8217 ; t waste your money unless you want to eat fabric .	-1
I was very disappointed once I received this product . It is far smaller than I had anticipated . I should have read the reviews a little bit closer since some of them did mention the measurements . The measurements include the handles rather than just the cooking area , which makes a huge difference in the amount of total cooking space . There were also two chips on the pan , which would have caused some issues once I washed the pan . I sent it back and ordered the large rectangular pan instead , which should supply the cooking area that I require . I am sure this product is useful for small turkeys and roasts but I wish the measurements would have been a bit more accurate or at least stipulated in the description that the length included the handles . I will order this brand again but I will not buy this particular pan for my needs . Happy cooking ! !	-1
My son made a turkey using a recipe that called for 20 minutes baking at 500 degrees . Well the turkey came out perfect , and my son was pleased about getting such a huge roasting pan , but he scorched the bottom and we still have n't been able to get all the black crud out . Maybe it was our fault and you 're not suppose to use this at such high temperatures . But it was definitely not easy to clean . If we ever figure out how to clean this without ruining the pan , maybe I 'll add on a star later .	-1
I bought this to cook my 12 lb thanksgiving turkey . The size is right . Big enough for the bird and more . Small enough to fit in a standard oven . I 've given it only two stars because this is NOT my grandmother 's granite ware . It is very thin . The finish is blemished with metal showing through in some spots . The lid does not fit tight . I plan to use it for the holiday . I will cook my turkey in an oven bag in the pan . I do n't expect this to last . Consider it a heavy duty disposable .	-1
I was very disappointed in this pan . I have had ones over the years including a nice round one and the lids always sat on the pan without sliding off easily . While I was not expecting an expensive pan I was expecting a basic functional pan . Also , I did nick my wrist on the top of the cover as it was rough . Amazon as always took the pan back and refunded me accordingly . You will be better off going with another roaster .	-1
The pan was a nice size and was to replace one we have had for 10 years that we use all the time . The first one we ordered had chips in the granite all around the top edges of the pan . The lid was fine . We exchanged it for another exactly like it . This one came poorly packed and the granite was rubbed off to the metal on the edges where the pan rubbed the handles . We returned it for a refund and bought one from walmart which came in good condition .	-1
Not the best instance of this kind of thing . Arrived with a dent on one side and coating chipped off the bottom .	-1
I had this juicer for about 2 months when the `` lock '' started giving me trouble , then would n't lock at all . It will not work without locking . The inside is a cheap plastic , although the outer stainless steel is nice looking . The juicer did not juice well , the pulp still retained lots of juice , being very moist . Would I but this product again ? Never !	-1
This Juicer has a top cover that is cast in flexible plastic . It 's so poorly designed that the plastic is far to flexible and touches the spinning blade when you press down on the vegetable with any force at all . The pieces of shredded plastic end up `` somewhere '' .The juicer has that characteristic smell of melted plastic when left out of use for too long -- this is extremely unhealthy . Consult one of the recent popular documentaries about the effects of plastic poisening on people 's health.The plunging hole is very small . You 'll often find yourself having to slice a vegetable down the middle to get it to fit in.Vegetables easily get stuck in the hole . Then you have to press down hard -- and get shredding plastic again.My experience is only with the typical things one would juice : carrots , apple slices , celery sticks . So I am not trying to juice anything exotic w.r.t . my comments.This juicer should not be in production .	-1
First , the good parts : the soleplate is indeed very smooth and stays clean . The auto-off feature is nice , but you need to be careful when you 're ironing to not let the iron sit or it will shut off when you do n't want it to.Now , the problems : it 's VERY difficult to fill the iron with water without spilling , even using a measuring cup with a pouring spout . Even worse , the iron spits out bursts of water for no apparent reason when it is set on & quot ; steam & quot ; . This has happened when the iron is first filled ( not over-filled , I fill it according to directions ) and also has happened in the middle of a tank , as well as at the end . I 'm talking BIG amounts of water , too ; enough that you have to refill the tank earlier than you would if it behaved properly.I do n't remember it doing this as much when the iron was new , but it 's developed into an annoyingly frequent problem . I will have to get a new iron , and it will not be another Rowenta . My old GE never did this , and it ironed just as well as the Rowenta , so I guess if Black and Decker is still making irons , that will be my next one . But no more dripping Rowentas for me .	-1
For years I have always bought Genuine Honeywell pre-filters and they are top quality . These are very poor quality . In places you can see through them , so dust and dirt will go right thru them and clog the expensive HEPA filter . I expect these pre-filters will reduce the life of the HEPA filters by half or more.Seller was very nice and offered help but I 'm gone for the summer with no time to fix the problem.If you need pre-filters , get the real thing - Genuine Honeywell .	-1
I thought I bought this filter from this place before , but I 've never had one I had to cut , so I must have been confused . Cutting one to fit is a pain in the you-know-what . First off , I 'm in the top floor of a 3-story condo , so I ca n't run outside to cut the thing which would be better because IT MAKES A MESS . You 'll have charcoal all over the place . And I do n't have a workbench either so trying to cut a nice straight line with a pair of scissors is a real challenge . What I 'm left with is a big mess and a filter that I screwed up cutting and off to the hardware store I go to buy the real deal . If you have a workshop at home in the garage then this may have some value . If you can easily cut a straight line with scissors , you might find it good too . For me , I 'll take something I can use out of the box , even if it means paying more .	-1
As others have mentioned , this is just one big piece of filter that you have to cut to fit your air filter . I would never have ordered it if I 'd know this .	-1
Avoid this product and by a real honeywell pre-filter . This is a cheap imitation that frays when cutting . This is a inferior product !	-1
I have had this for more then a month and it smells the room up whenever I turn it on .	-1
I have a 50150 model and it says right on the label attached to the bottom of it to buy replacement filter 21500.On the the box that this came in it says it will fit 50150 but this filter was not tall enough for my unit.It was too much trouble to send it back so I ripped the rubber off the top of the old filter and attached it with silicone to this new one . That was enough to get it to fit but I should not have to do that for a 50+ dollar filter.I do n't know if this is a one-off problem but I do see I 'm the only one with this problem to post a review .	-1
Returned this as the noise level was just too high . And would n't work well on a deep pile carpet either .	-1
I purchased this vacuum hoping the rotating brush would work well on dog hair on furniture . It does n't help . The rotation on the brush is too weak . I found the ~ $ 20 BISSELL Pet Inspired Pet Hair Vacuum Tools on my regular full size canister vac works much better .	-1
The switch between rotor and hose is simpler , but also prone to fouling and loss of suction on hose.Even at peak performance , this model is disappointing compared to older , lesser-powered models.It also runs hotter and makes noticeably more noise .	-1
This is so loud it hurt my ears to use it . I had one years ago that I liked so I do n't know what they did to increase the noise , but unless you are completely deaf I would n't recommend it .	-1
I actually had my mom 's Dirt Devil from the 70 's when i moved out and LOVED it . Then it died and I bought a replacement . I am soooooo disappointed . This thing doesn & # 8217 ; t work half as good as the old model . I do NOT like how the front flips to move to the attachment part . It keeps slipping down and dirt get kicked everywhere instead of being sucked up . The suction is wimpy compared to the old one . I can make it about half way up my stairs before the motor gets hot and smells like its burning ( no issues with the old one doing that ) . I thought that maybe I got a dud so I bought one from the store too ... . it sucks also ( not in a good way ) . I am going to have to continue to search for a good handheld vac . Dont waste your money on this thing .	-1
SORRY I BOUGHT THIS . IT IS SO NOISY I HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS . GUESS IT WORKS FINE AND NOT TOO HEAVY BUT NEVER AGAIN	-1
I use Vacu Vin stoppers for my wine and have been very happy with them . But this ... it only holds a seal about one out of every four times I try . And how do you know when it 's held ? By breaking the seal . It 's just a crapshoot as to whether the food is in a vacuum or not . So I just do n't use it .	-1
I bought this new , and it worked great , UNTIL I made the mistake of taking the freezing bowl out of the freezer , to thaw out , and stored it for 1 week . When I refroze it a week later , it never made ice cream again , no matter how cold the freezer was or how long I kept it in there . I suspect that once you freeze it and keep it in the freezer , you MUST keep it in there from then on and NEVER thaw it out . I returned mine , but I will never buy this type of ice cream maker again for fear that it wo n't work .	-1
Bought this as one of my Father 's Day gifts to my husband . Big mistake . I do n't believe it would make a difference if it were new ( it was factory reconditioned ) , but results so far have been very disappointing . My husband is a great recipe follower and the frozen yogurt was a huge disaster , and the real ice cream was too soft . I was hoping to be able to make frozen yogurt with luo han and/or stevia and avoid all the sugar and artificial and bad ingredients in the kinds you buy in the yogurt shops , but it does n't look good.I will try this myself this weekend , and if it works out better I will comment further .	-1
I bought both KAS ( Vicks ) humidifiers V745A and rwm-975n and they both had the same problem . THEY LEAK WATER ALL OVER THE FLOOR ! One leaks from the cap , the other leaks no matter how you mount the water tank . A coincidence ? No , KAS makes horrible humidifiers .	-1
I purchased this humidifier after my old one broke . The box claimed to be extremely quiet . It lied . Big time . On the lowest setting it is tolerable ... barely . On high ? My hairdryer is quieter . The lights all over the thing are also extremely bright . I have it wrapped in a t-shirt . It also does n't seem to humidify well . I leave it on high with my bedroom door shut for a few hours before I go to bed and the room does n't seem to feel any more humid than the rest of my dry home . The small vapor pads that scent the air is a nice touch but they are only useful if the thing is right next to your bed and trust me , with the noise this thing makes you would n't want it anywhere near where you 're trying to sleep . It was an utter waste of money .	-1
This is a mediocre humidifier at best , I only bought it because it was at my local CVS and I needed one at that moment . It is not easy enough to clean , it does not humidify well , it is louder than it should be ; I will continue to research and try to find a better one .	-1
I purchased then returned this product . The main reason was because it did n't seem to efficiently draw air through the moist wick filter . The tip of the filter dries up . The air seems to travel on the outside of the filter before its expelled out of the top . In addition , the fan is extremely loud on high , so you ca n't run it a max capacity during the night . ( Med and low were ok but it did n't seem to generate enough humidity ) The `` scent pad '' quickly wore out and is not very functional . Looking at the humidifier straight as pictured on this site , the air is channeled left and right . it is not 360 degrees . There are better humidifiers on the market .	-1
You would think if you received an item that had major parts missing ( heat shield , ETC . ) that when they sent a replacement they would make sure it had all the parts in it ! NOT AMAZON ! This item was missing the heat shield ( which it states clearly on the unit `` DO NOT USE WITHOUT HEAT SHIELD '' , flavor injector , kabob rods , coupon book and warranty card ) . So I notified Amazon and they shipped another unit out right away , but it also was missing all the same parts ! ! Tried to contact Ronco ( the manufacturer ) and waited a long time on hold several times without a person to speak to , also sent several emails which were never responded to ! Since these were `` factory reconditioned '' units it appears that the manufacturer is mostly to blame but Amazon should be aware of problems with items they sell and should make sure they contain the items that are supposed to be included ( from this forum it appears several other people have had this same experience ) . I DO N'T UNDERSTAND HOW THESE PEOPLE STAY IN BUSINESS , IF I RAN MY BUSINESS LIKE THIS I WOULD BE PENNILESS . So I ca n't really describe how this unit performs because I never got the chance to use it !	-1
I bought this toaster after Consumer Reports rated it a `` Best Buy . '' At about $ 60 , it was the most expensive I 'd ever purchased , but I thought it should probably be worth it with all its features . What a huge disappointment ! The selection buttons seem to be for decorative purpose only . Choose defrost - full power . Choose bagel - full power on both sides ( I called Cusinart support and the rep checked with his supervisor and came back to tell me that `` yeah , the bagel feature does n't really change anything . '' Add to this that it was the slowest toaster I 'd ever had and I realized I 'd made a bad buy.I gave the toaster to a charity ( should I be embarrassed ? ) and bought one from Black & Decker for half the price . The B & D ; toaster does everything that the Cuisinart does n't - and much more quickly .	-1
I 'm not as impressed as I thought I would be . after reading the good reviews I thought it would be a heavy quality made toaster . I am glad I did n't pay more than I did because it does n't feel heavy or like quality . I have to leave it on number one or the toast comes out black . I thought cuisinart was always quality . I do n't think that anymore ...	-1
The grill marks on the top are very shallow , making this device better for panini than for grilling meat . If that was what it was advertized for I 'd give it 3 or 4 stars . The plastic cleaning fork is worthless , and the non-stick coating begins to flake after 6 months . The barely raised ridges on the top makes the top of your meat evenly brown & dry without the grill marks . The bottom is not nearly as cooked as the top , and has the best marks near the opening where the grill lines are raised to form `` teeth '' to hold the meat in . When the grill started flaking , I went back to the Cast Iron grill I can put over 2 burners & control the temperature . I still use this grill for grilling panini sandwiches , as it makes the bread nice & toasty . Not reccomended for meat unless you make sure they are even & level . Not very fun to clean .	-1
It was so small and the quality is so cheap . It was light and the cover was filmsy . You ca n't really cook much on it . After one use , I did n't even bother with it ; I just donate it . Do n't waste your money on this product like I did .	-1
i used to use this whenever i was grilling a type of meat or vegetable , but it always burns them and leaves other parts uncooked if other pieces arent uniform in thickness . this is not grilling because the heat is only transfered from those protruding grill lines which burn anything your cooking to simulate grill marks . all my marinades burn and get stuck to the grill . you definatly need to get a cooking spray because if you brush it on it will come right off . this is bad because i like to use olive oil , but even if you put it into a spray bottle it still likes to drip off . cleaning this unit is a chore because you can not soak it , and it takes a bit of time to cool down before you can pick it up and go wash it in the sink . you also have to hold it at weird angles ( upside down even ) to avoid water getting into the unit especially the top half . the surface isnt really non stick and requires some scrubbing with a soft sponge . the bun warmer is useless , your better off having the grill open and placing you buns on that . the only thing that this thing does well in is make grilled sandwiches , the bread doesnt burn really but does get good marks if you butter it lightly.if does take out alot of the oils but also alot of the juices because everything is being pressed , it is not a time saver , if you have a decent stove at home use it , the cleaning time will be comparable and you wont get transfers of taste or burnt bits onto other dishes . also the teflon nonstick coating has been questionalbe as a carcinogen in studies.if you want something nonstick at a decent price get circulon , they make some decent cookware with also raised ridges that helps with reducing the amount of oil needed to cook .	-1
While I agree this pan is good looking , it 's not good cooking ! Takes a long time to heat up and bottom does not heat evenly . If I 'd known Farberware had changed their `` classic '' pan , I would n't have bought it . My advice -- look for another brand .	-1
We bought this to replace a broken Farberware pot of similar design . This is an inferior look-alike and it is not 18/10 stainless steel ( as was advertised when we bought it ) . The lighter steel leeches a metallic smell and taste into food . We sent it back . Avoid .	-1
If you THOUGHT that Farberware made good quality cookware , you are wrong . They used to . But now they 've cut corners and are creating such low quality cookware that it 's actually a safety issue . And JUST TRY to contact Customer Support , Feedback , or even try and find the President of the company ! You 'll find `` shell corportations '' /licensing companies and TONS OF COMPLAINTS on various state Departments of Consumer Affairs websites.I tried contacting them to report a serious problem with the new cookware that I 've added to my collection ( a 9 3/4 '' fry pan & a 6 3/4 '' sauce pot ) . On both the part where the handle connects to the metal cookware is now manufactured HALF AS DEEP as their older products . The screw holding them together loosens up with just a single use . You 'll need to keep a Phillips Head screwdriver at the ready to tighten the handle each time you use the pot ! ! ! Without putting too fine a point on it , please note that the pot -by definition- usually contains scalding hot liquids , so you sure do n't want an extremely wobbly handle while you 're using the cookware ! ! I tried to contact Farberware to report this , and to see if they had a `` work around '' in place , like maybe longer screws ! Farberware 's own Website is so obstructive , and impossible to use that it can only be a deliberate attempt to disavow product warranties and to wall themselves off from actual customer feedback . You find yourself in a loop that does not allow input . And there is no other way on their site to contact them except by clicking on the `` Contact Us '' which only sends you annoying emails back with non-functional links ! Doing D & B ; research I found that the current holder of the Farberware license is MEYER CORPORATION U.S. and their President 's name , so I 'm going to follow up with POST MAIL.But I first wanted to warn you ! I 've always found Amazon 's product reviews to be EXTREMELY helpful and have positively guided a lot of my own buying decisions . Unfortunately , I had not checked product reviews before buying the two new pots because of my prior good experience with the quality of Farberware products . So live and learn . I 've also learned that TRUE high quality alternatives to Farberware are Creuset , Lodge , and the dutch oven from the Mario Battlia line . AVOID FARBERWARE LIKE THE PLAGUE ! -alana	-1
I have a set of this cookware , which I love . It 's heavy , and holds the heat . You can use any utensils , even a whisk . It 's great.It is pricey , so I attempted to get a 'deal , ' a used fry pan . This apparently was not used , but it had 'cosmetic damages , to 10 % of the unit . ' When I received the pan , that 'cosmetic damage ' turned out to be a fair sized dent in the pan , such that the lid would not fit securely on the pan itself . I was going to try to pull out the dent , but I slept on that idea and decided to send it back . I 'm grateful for that option . If you really need a 12 & # 34 ; pan , you may want to bite the bullet and pay for a new pan .	-1
I really do n't like this one at all . Makes very weak coffee ( what happened ? ) , is lukewarm ( have to use microwave to heat a cup of coffee ) , spout leaks , and has a cheap feeling tab to pull out for filling coffee . After just a week of using this , I 'm going to shop for another one from Krups .	-1
I have had the unit for over a year and can say it never functioned as a frother . In the beginning it would make hot milk and that is about it.I put it away for several months and got it out today to try again . It sat for 30 minutes and no steam . Yes I had cleaned it thoroughly with water that last time I used it . I threw it in the garbage . I am happy for those who say it works really well but you would be better off buying a Mrcoffee espresso machine and using the steam attachment .	-1
This machine is a clunky , poorly built , waste of money . I 've owned it for about a year and a half and am desperately in search of a new machine . The `` semi automatic '' tamper works only about half the time . The other times it allows the fresh brew to dump into the waste box . The gear on the top rusts after about 6 months or so , causing constant scraping and cleaning to be required . Additionally , the frothing arm is WAY too short to work in a reasonable size frothing cup , and it only heats ( to 160 deg . ) one cup ( 8 oz . ) of milk at a time ; and only AFTER you brew coffee - so forget about making hot chocolate.I have tried to make this machine work well and 'tweak ' how I make coffee to have minimal hassle , but this machine is flatly too poorly designed to work well constantly . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I read all the positive reviews here , and purchased Capresso . I am disapointed . The best feature is the ease of use , automatic disposal after brewing , and a large water tank . Unfortunately , there is no way to make a strong coffee in any quantity in this machine . It only takes a scoop and a half of coffee , and a scoop is barely bigger than a teaspoon . Try to put more , and the lever will not close , or worse , open mid-brewing , dumping your coffee inside the machine . I tried several kinds of coffee and several levels of gounding ... no real results . I can make better expresso in my old 4 bar steam machine . My Capresso is going back .	-1
Honestly people , do not buy this . Not only did it fail at making even a half-way decent cappucinno , it is honestly god-awful-ugly and incredibly cheap looking . After a day or two of trying relentlessly to `` pull '' a decent espresso and telling myself , it 'll blend in , I decided it was one of the worst purchases I have ever made . It served espresso luke warm , and the frother never got enough steam to create a decent head of foam . I am not sure why they claim it is an automatic , as it is so weird ti is more work to figure it all out . Before you write me off as a technophobe , I am definitely , not- I even read the entire manual and watched the video twice ! So sad.Thank goodness Amazon will easily take items back within 30 days . This is my only 1 star listing ever .	-1
I bought this to try out the All-clad line of cookware . I thought this would be good to fry a couple of eggs since I like to flip them without a spatula . Man was I wrong . This pan is so heavy that flipping would be difficult even if I could prevent the eggs from sticking and the handle is so heavy relative to the pan that it wo n't lay flat on the burner . It 's not practical for much and I never use it anymore .	-1
We used this pan about three years and then the non-stick coating wasno longer non-stick . An expensive lesson for something I never intended to replace.With all the research out there questioning the safety of non-stick surfaces , you 'd be better off trying stainless or cast-iron . With a bit of work ( seasoning ) , cast-iron can be nearly as slippery as a non-stick coating , and there 's nothing that matches the traditional look and feel ( and cooking ability ) of cast-iron.Try a Lodge `` Logic '' cast-iron pan ... very cheap at Walmart and other mass-retailers for $ 10- $ 20.You ca n't go wrong , and you 'll never buy `` non-stick '' cookware again .	-1
I 'm not giving this pan a low rating because it is n't good , just that it likely is n't going to last long enough for the average home cook to justify its high price . We have a set of All Clad stainless that we 've used for fifteen years , and we love it . We also used to have a nonstick All Clad frypan that we threw away after two or three years . Yes , you could baby your nonstick , and just use it to cook omelets , it would be great for that and might last forever , but if you want a nonstick frypan for frying most foods , at a higher heat , All Clad wo n't last longer than cheaper pans . We 've come to realize that a medium priced nonstick pan that distributes heat well and can be replaced without breaking the bank makes the most sense , at least for us .	-1
You have the bottom of the pan clad in stainless steel ... the advantage of that ? You can dishwasher stainless . But you ca n't dishwasher nonstick ! You just have the disadvantage of slower heating than you would with straight aluminum underneath.And then you put teflon on something that costs over $ 100 ... the pan will last 50 or more years , the nonstick about five if you use it lightly and do n't let some idiot put metal on it ever.There 's no indication that they will resurface your pan either ... the warranty just covers defects , not use.I think this is very wasteful economically , if not environmentally ( because it is a massive yet not durable product , even if you recycle it ) . You can get a cheaper nonstick that will serve you for the five years just fine ( e.g . Calphalon commercial ) , and better you can get this pan without the teflon and learn how to season your own cookware and make it even more nonstick than this can ever be and yet utterly indestructible , even with metal utensils.People will only buy this for the looks . After all , they do n't know how to cook anyway .	-1
4th degree burns can be suffered when handling this metallic brim stoke pot , which does n't have cool iron density retraction at the handle . You are better getting a cool wave disperse model which Maytag sells , but if you use a Calco hand glove , this is just as good .	-1
I do n't know what these are supposed to be used for , but they 're not very good for anything I 've tried them on.There 's a spring at the hinge that is really stiff and rough when you close the tongs . The gripping surface on the tongs is so smooth that they just do n't 'grip ' anything ! These tongs have been sent to my kitchen junk drawer.They 're very beautiful of course ( it 's allclad ... ) , but do n't even waste your money on this shiny piece of junk .	-1
Update : I heard back from All Clad about these and their response was pretty much `` too bad for you '' '' We thank you for your email via All-Clad.com . We thank you for your feedback . The tongs are mainly for use of smaller tasks , and not heavy meats.We thank you for writing to us . If you have additional questions , please contact a representative in our consumer service department at 1-800-255-2523 . Representatives are available from 8:30 AM to 9:00 PM EST , Monday thru Friday . `` I bought these for use on the grill because of the All Clad reputation and I 'm really disappointed.These are so `` soft '' that they have bent several times already lifting items like chicken and racks of ribs . While these might be OK for pasta or salad , for lifting anything substantial , they are not up to the task . It is almost like they wer not tempered correctly.PROS : - All Clad- Great fit and feel- Really good looking- Comfortable- Easy clean upCONS : - They bend really easily.I would look at something else for the grill .	-1
I 'm an All-Clad fanatic . I have their pots and pans , their measuring cups , and most of my cooking utensils are All-Clad . All of them have exceeded my expectations in its quality , design , and utility , except this one . Thank goodness I did n't pay for them ( I got this as a bonus gift to buying bunch of other All-Clad pots and pans ) b/c unlike other All-Clads , they are NOT worth the price ! The locking mechanism is not designed well -it takes a little more effort than my other tongs to lock and unlock during cooking , which might not seem much , but it becomes a huge nusiance when you use it as much as me . But what 's most disappointing is that the end of the tongs are so flat ( my other tongs curve inward slightly so that it will hold onto food better ) that unless I use extra force to hold onto the food , it just slips out ( talk about hands cramping ! ) . Like others have commented here , it looks beautiful , but in terms of getting things done in the kitchen , it fails miserably .	-1
This thing is hard to grip food without it sliding off easily . Probably the worst All-Clad product in my collection .	-1
I love my All Clad cookware , so I bought this with high expectations . I was disappointed . I find it quite painful to hold . The ridges in the handle cut into the hand unless you hold it a certain way , and that way of holding it feels unnatural to me when you dip down into a pot . This ladle is also very short measuring just 11 '' in full length , so it 's not ideal for large pots of pasta . The 11.5 '' claim appears to be a slight exaggeration , or they 're measuring it at an angle . I wanted to like it because I assumed it was made in the USA . When I looked on the tag to confirm this I found that at the bottom , in small print , it says `` Made in China . '' That was all I needed to see . I returned it in favor of theRosle Long Spaghetti Spoon , which is German-designed but again made in China . ( It 's hard finding anything not made in China these days . ) The Rosle is more comfortable to hold , but only 0.5 '' longer . It just feels less awkward , and the brushed steel finish of the Rosle does n't show fingerprints like the polished steel finish of the All Clad . The downside for the Rosle is that it 's more expensive.The only high mark for the All-Clad is its sturdiness . It is very solid and appears well made for China . That affords it 2 stars , but the awkward and uncomfortable handle and short length were deal breakers for me .	-1
This is one of those All Clad branded products that really is just using the name . It 's made in China . There is no real difference between this branded pan and ones made by other companies . Sure it has the All Clad shaped handle , but the quality , heating characteristics , and functionality is not superior to brands such as Kitchen Aid , Calphalon , etc . With this sort of pan or with a stove top griddle I 'd just buy the least expensive , semi-known brand and not pay top dollar for the All Clad name .	-1
I feel that I am committing a mortal sin by saying that an All-Clad pan is not a good pan , but this one is not . Most people believe that All-Clad is exceptional cookware and I agree for the most part . This pan , however , is simply not a good or even average grill pan.A grill pan is supposed to approximate the flavor and markings achieved by using a good charcoal/gas grill or an open flame of hardwood . The flavor is achieved by having sharp edged grill strips separated relatively deep valleys . Over a hot flame , the valleys allow the drippings to burn and emit smoke . This pan has very flat grill strips and extremely shallow valleys . The result is no smoke flavor and no grill marks.The other failing of this pan is its light weight . The pan comes up to temperature quickly , but when you throw in two or three 1 & 1/2 pound ribeyes , it quickly cools off . This s a pure aluminum pan and as a result is light weight has little reserved heat when the steaks hit . The result is steaks that have been sautted rather than grilled . You do not have the deep , rich crust that you expect from a good steakhouse.If you want to grill indoors - then get a heavy pan that can leave clear grill marks . Based on my experience , I can recommend Lodge or LeCruest .	-1
Our All Clad non-stick grill lasted only about two years with very occasional use . After about two years , it gradually , and increasingly , became harder and harder to clean . The non-stick surface got to a point where it actually made food stick more than a non-stick pan . Finally , we could n't clean it at all . The food literally stuck on the grille so badly that we could not scrape it off even with the edge of a knife.We have owned many non-stick brands like Calphalon , Analon , Nordic Ware and Circulon for many years with much more use than this All-Clad grill and we have NEVER had a pan stick like this one.I decided that there has to be something wrong with this thing . So , under All-Clad 's lifetime warranty , I spent $ 16 and returned it to them to replace it.I just got the pan back from them and a letter saying that there is nothing wrong with the pan that was caused by a manufacturer defect . They went on to say that the pan had been overheated and that voids the warranty . OVERHEATED ? ! ! Are they kidding me ? They said that the grill should never be used with a heat setting above medium.We cook , it 's that simple . We set the burner to whatever level we need to cook with and then we cook . We have never burned anything while cooking on that grille.All-Clad has found a crummy and convenient way to refuse warranty service on their non-stick pans . If the pan fails and you return it , all they need to do is claim that you turned the burner up too high on it . Their lifetime warranty is a bigger joke than the pan itself . I feel that as expensive as All-Clad products are they should honor their product lifetime warranty . This pan lasted about two years with low use and really is a low quality . This is suppose to be a higher-end product that lasts longer than two years.Buy Calphalon or Analon non-stick . I know from experience that they honor their warranty and they truly are far superior cooking pans compared to this second rate All-Clad product and their fake non-existent `` lifetime '' warranty .	-1
This griddle looks great , but I had to send mine back . This is because the bottom is raised about 3/8 inch due to the grease channel that runs around the perimeter , and it is thus not compatible with our ceramic cooktop . I contacted All-Clad , and they confirmed that it will not work on smooth cooktops . It would have been nice for the manufacturer to point this out in their product description , but they do not .	-1
Wood is splintering before they were even washed ! Blades rusting , rivets coming loose . This is nowhere NEAR the quality of the company in the early 1990s , which was amazing ( I have the 400T set , whatever its called , beautiful buffed gloss wood , full tang blades , razor-ground edge , sharper than anything in my antique razor collection ! ) .Even the block is JUNK . These people that gave it 3+ stars have been conditioned by $ 20 knife sets and have n't seen quality like my old set . This isnt even worth $ 20 ! I ended up using them , taking 1 to work each time I needed one , and throwing them away instead of even washing them . Not even worth recycling . Put it in the landfill !	-1
This device is massive compared to most digital thermometers . The copper tip is as long as a steak is thick . You ca n't possibly use this for anything small . It will work for a roast , but not everyday things .	-1
I was looking for a Braun but could n't find one . I came across this Krups and liked the way it looked . All the other brands I looked at were black and boring or silver , which was n't appealing to me . I love the clock and it is easy to program . I do not have any problem putting the caraffe back in like other reviewers do . I have been using this for 2 months and the coffee is great . The only down side is that it is made in China ( but is n't everything nowadays ) . Most coffee maker 's do n't tell you where it is made , you have to find out after you receive it and look at the box . Luckily the coffee and the counter appeal are fantastic ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! UPDATE : July 11 , 2013..I would think a coffee maker would last more the 2 yrs . Around the first of March 2013 the programmable timer quit working . Now I do not wake up to coffee already made , big problem . I am not a morning person and need my coffee waiting for me . I will have to buy another coffee maker ( but no another one of these ) . What happened to the day when things last 10 to 15 years ? . I bought this because I thought it was German made and Germany makes good products . But they outsource a lot of their items to China like we ( USA ) do . But only the stuff they sell to other countries . The items they sell to Germans they still make in Germany according to my research . I know give this 2 stars , one for each year it worked .	-1
Put this coffeemaker on our wedding registry and within two months the awesome blue light ( which was one of the attractions ) burnt out . Also as time went by , the hot plate became corroded . Love the look and ease of use although also experienced difficulty with inserting the carafe and had to clean up its drips every morning . We 're on our way to Bed , Bath & Beyond to return it . : )	-1
I bought this coffeemaker to replace a 25-year-old Krups that finally died . The new unit looks nice , seems to be well-made , and - if it 's anything like my old Krups in quality - will probably outlive me ! Love the `` analog '' clock and the dual-view reservoir . My only complaint is that it 's difficult to see the coffee as it 's dripping into the carafe . And the carafe lid is not removable . Other than those two design flaws , it 's a nice machine and makes a decent cup of coffee.3/1/14 update : the unit began to malfunction about a month ago - and grounds ended up getting into the coffee . To no avail , I tried other grinds , different paper filter brands ( had always used Melitta ) . Got tired of my coffee having `` chew '' to it , and gave the thing to a thrift shop .	-1
These stoppers require that you hold the pump more perpendicular above the stopper and then hold the seal more firmly . They are n't as forgiving as the old stoppers for when you hold it at a slight angle . Its frustrating when technology moves backwards , and then they call it progress . This company used to have a better product line with their containers as well . However , this product might still be better than the practically non-existent alternatives . This product deserves three stars , but I 'm giving it two stars because so many of the other reviews are skewed way too high .	-1
Did n't like these stoppers at all . Ca n't remember if I have ever had to write such a negative review but these stoppers are not worth a penny . They do n't have ribs like the previous ones I purchased and so the & # 34 ; cork & # 34 ; ( stopper ) does n't stay in the bottle . It slowly releases itself . And DEFINITELY you can not lay your opened bottle down in your fridge unlike the other ones who were so perfect .	-1
We could not get the stoppers to hold their vaccum . We are going to return them , although the bother is more than the cost .	-1
These do n't have the three ribs needed to TRULY seal the bottle . These keep the wine for , perhaps , AT MOST , one-half the time that the originals did . Why they had to tinker with a perfect design is beyond me ! Perhaps e-bay , or some dusty restaurant supply stores still have the really good ones ?	-1
First , to be fair , I want to be upfront and say I put this pan in the dishwasher . Honestly , I do this with all my non-stick pots and pans because I find it cheaper ( cost = time , energy , and money ) to put non-stick pans in the dishwasher and just replace them every X years as needed . T-Fal is really the only company I can find that claims there pans are non-stick and dishwasher safe . I can say that although that may not be entirely true they will last and be fully non-stick for a very long time before they need to be replaced and they do have a lifetime warranty for the frugal minded . This pan did n't even make it through one or two washings , which for me really draws into question of the quality of the pan . Of course the warranty is void by putting it in the dishwasher and sadly the only use for a sticky crepe pan is to take up space in a landfill . Would someone please make a high quality , glass lid , oven safe handled , nonstick set of pots and pans , pretty please ! ! !	-1
( Purchased in may 2003 ) I just have to say how excited I was when I bought this skillet because it was `` calphalon '' wooooo ! ! ! Oh well after 2 months of using rubber spatulas , it 's peeling ! ! ! where is it now ? , somewhere in a junkyard . I do n't want to develop cancer from Calphalon you know . Too many law suits nowadays , anyway ... . Those of you who enjoy it , more power to you . Me I 'm a cast iron gal.Back to nature ...	-1
Every time I try to use this in the oven , the food smokes on the sheet , causing my smoke alarm to go off in the apartment ! I ended up using this to protect my coffee table under my laptop computer .	-1
huh ? What on earth ? Had some cookies on this , and it just started spewing smoke . Unless you are looking for a chilling effect for fancy presentations , stay away from this product .	-1
Non-stick qualities are decent but not exciting . There can be uneven browning on some items , especially small ones . In addition , it gets filthy easily and oils do n't clean off as easily as I would have expected .	-1
After about 5 uses cookies stuck to it just like a cookie sheet . First 5 uses they would slide right and it worked as advertised . All downhill from there . Have tried scrubbing it with dishwashing soap , letting it sit in the sink in soapy water for half and hour , cookies still stick to it .	-1
These are not your mother 's Revereware . They are flimsy , warped the first time we used the pan , are much smaller than you 'd think . And they are not made in the USA .	-1
Hi , Some of our Revere pieces are 30 years old , so I was thinking of a new set , but based upon the reviews , I will treasure my current set . It has served us well and keeps on going.There is quality out there , you just need to look for it and pay the price . I purchased the large ( 14 '' x17 '' ) All-clad cookie sheet in stainless last month and it is excellent , but it was expensive , $ 80 ! This was probably our fifth cookie sheet , and everything before this one rusted . This one should be our last . This should have been my first cookie sheet.So for baking , I just stick with a good stainless steel , adding one piece at a time , including some from the Vermont Country Store . Cheap stainless steel rusts . The non-stick products have to be replaced in 3-10 years . I think it is cheaper just to buy a good stainless product to begin with and not waste money on the stuff that does not last . I have a few baking pieces I have not found in a good stainless yet .	-1
Trickery ! Amazon links this from the web as made in USA . Clearly it is not made in USA . Trickery ! I can not find one single made in USA tea pot on Amazon . Booooo ! Bunch of fake employee reviews for cheap as day made in China teapots .	-1
I love the look of this tea kettle , and that it whistles cheerfully , but the handle gets way too hot to ... handle , like , scalding . We tried putting different amounts of water to make sure that it was n't that we were filling it too much or too little , but with each test , the handle was untouchable with bare hands . I do n't want to have to use oven mits every time I make a cup of tea !	-1
I previously had the larger Revere kettle and loved it ; quick to heat the water , a good loud whistle , clean pouring , etc . When it finally wore out , I went to get a new one but this 2 quart one was the only available size . Big mistake . This kettle spits out large amounts of boiling water while whistling ( there 's no way you can fill it to the 2 quart level ; half would go all over your stovetop or , much worse , over yourself ) , and dribbles hot water down the base while you pour . The whistle works , at least . But it 's really not a safe kettle and , as I said , I was a big fan of the Revere kettles .	-1
Do n't think you 're getting the Revere kettle of your memory . I had this replacement for a few months when the little hook you use to open it broke . I got in touch with them and they told me I might find a replacement on eBay ... .in other words , drop dead .	-1
not only does it only toast one side , it takes several attempts to make the bread stay down to be toasted . The blue flash at eash attempt is not some thing I care to see in an electrical appliance . The plastic case does stay cool , but as a toaster , it is n't much .	-1
This Toaster is Junk ... the left side already does NOT work.I had my old ... taoster for 7 years and this one not even for 2 weeks and it soes not work . Do Not waste your money .	-1
If I could rate this thing at 0 stars , I would . After only one month of use , toast sticks inside and the & quot ; cancel toast & quot ; function will no longer work . I have to unplug the toaster to get toast out of it.There 's a reason this toaster is inexpensive : it 's a cheap piece of junk .	-1
I loved the idea of a 4 slot toaster and this was my first . However after just one month , one side of the toaster quit working-burnt out . So now I am right back where I started from with just 2 slots .	-1
The description for the toaster said it had deep slots for bread . I use a bread machine to make bread and wanted a toaster that would toast the entire piece of bread and not have to reverse the bread and start over again . The toaster works well with store bread but not with bread made in a bread machine . The delivery from any products ordered from Amazon have always arrived promptly and earlier than promised .	-1
This has got to be one of the worst toasters . The bread jams or does n't go down . I does n't brown evenly . Only one side even works on mine . Skip it !	-1
We were so looking forward to fresh lemondade . The moment the Salton arrived we opened the box , pulled out the lemons we had bought in anticipation and began juicing . On the 5'th lemon the gears stripped and the juicer no longer turned when applying even the slightest amount of pressure to the lemon . We were all very disappoined , my 5 kids and I : ( I had hoped for better after reading the great reviews written by some of the others .	-1
... though it ai n't THAT bad , either ! Pros : quick , easy , no-brainer way to cook , at a very appealing price . Cleaning is easy : let it cool , then pour hot water over it and wipe down with some paper towels . The plastic cleaning utensil supplied is useless unless you use it while the grill is still quite hot , which puts you at risk of burning yourself.Cons : the drip tray needs to be bigger ... it can be pretty messy having to move the full one out of the way and put the empty one in place.If you are cooking more than one batch at a time , you will need to clean off the gunk on the grill in between batches , or else cooking time and evenness will suffer greatly.Despite its double-heating-surface design , the bottom surface is much hotter than the top surface , so you WILL need to flip your food , especially if you 're grilling anything thicker than say half an inch ( chicken breasts , steaks , etc . ) .The only way to achieve the nice browned/charred lines you see in the pictures is to apply addtional pressure to the grill from the top so that the meat will be pressed more tightly against the heating surfaces ... this was easy for me since I use it on my balcony floor , so I just put on ( shoed ) foot on top of it.There needs to be an on/off switch , so that you do n't have to plug/unplug the darn thing every time ... what a pain ! A `` ready '' light to tell you when the grill has been preheated enough would also be nice.The recommended cooking times on the cookbook were often way , way off ... which means you have to fiddle around for yourself.While food grilled this way is still much better than what you get from a microwave , and equal to a conventional oven , it still is not anywhere in the same class as a charcoal or gas-fired grill.In a nutshell : buy it for the price , speed and simplicity , but do n't expect much more than that .	-1
I bought this rice cooker today from store . As soon as I removed from the package and tried to keep it on table it could not stand straight . The Base was all damaged . Not just that the quality of metal plate in bottom is flimsy..screws are pathetic ... Never buy this one !	-1
Overall workmanship seems below par . For example , the lid does not fit well . I wish we had spent more money and bought quality .	-1
Once upon a time CorningWare was a name you could trust . Their unique pyroceramic glass cookware was almost indestructible , being devised from materials used for the nose cones of ballistic missiles . It was true `` Space Age Technology '' that could go directly from the stovetop into the refrigerator with nary a crack . A single CorningWare dish was said to have a lifespan of 1,000 years.This was seen as a problem when the CorningWare brand was bought by World Kitchens Incorporated in 2001 . They did n't want to sell you a dish every 1,000 years , they wanted the dishes to break so you would have to buy new ones . And so the pyroceramic formula was discontinued , and regular white-glazed stoneware was sold under the CorningWare brand.Which is what we have here . This `` CorningWare 2.5-qt . Oval Casserole with Lid - French White '' is a fine , serviceable casserole dish that will bake up some tasty things in your oven . It has a classic design , and does just what it is supposed to do . No real complaints in that department . If all you are looking for is an inexpensive , temporary casserole dish , then this will fit the bill.It just is n't really CorningWare . This casserole dish is designed to break , and it will eventually . Try and use it on your stovetop , or the extreme temperature changes that have become the hallmark of the brand , and it will shatter . Something to be aware of if you are buying this for the brand .	-1
Photo is misleading . I thought I 'd be getting larger pieces.Other than that , the pyrex is good quality . Sometimes requires cleaning with scotch brite .	-1
I have not had these long , have not used them for anything but freezing so far and after reading the reviews I wo n't be using them for anything but freezing and storage.But even then I found it was very difficult to get the lids on . Finally I ran a lid under hot water , then quickly dried it and was able to get the lid on the container but otherwise they would not fit.I wonder if these are even made in the US .	-1
This is the third time I tried to get the 7-cup size with a lid that seals tight . Even in this set they do n't . I thought maybe by swapping vendors I 'd get a good one . I 'm not lucky with this brand .	-1
I do not like it because this set is too small.I do not know how to use it.I will not recommend it .	-1
When this set arrived I was disappointed because the glass containers were much smaller than I anticipated . It is my fault for relying on the Amazon photographs and not previewing the container sizes before buying . I will keep them because I already recycled the packaging but I would not recommend this set for storing food unless you are saving your leftovers for your pet mouse ...	-1
This 10 piece set is no longer sold though Amazon . Just wanted to let you know since I had problems with both 10 piece sets I ordered at the same time.I bought these sets because I was tired of my huge collection of plastic storage containers . I wanted to use them for freezer to oven/microwave use . Unfortunately , all of the lids on the round containers did not fit . I was not able to even force on a single one of the round lids . The rectangular lids are fine and tight . Pyrex will not help take care of the problem , so Amazon customer service , after several emails back and forth , is taking care of it.I read the reviews for this item , and for other sets in this line , and though the problem with the lids was mentioned , it seemed to be in a small minority . Until I get replacements , the round containers make nice soup bowls ! When I use the items to freeze portions , there is little frost when freezing for up to 2 weeks . I usually wrap the containers in plastic for longer storage . Defrost overnight in the fridge , then reheat in oven or microwave . The glass containers perform great , with nice uniform heating . Just a warning-microwaving is often quicker than you might think , and the container is very hot.When storing same size pieces , I must put paper towels in between , because by nesting , the containers tend to get stuck together . If you are not strapped for space , separating sizes should n't be a problem .	-1
Pyrex is only a trade name ONLY now , licensed out to World Kitchen . It is NOT the original invention from 1915 that we all remember . It is NOT Pyrex BOROSILICATE glass anymore ( after 1998 ) . It is NOT safe to plunge into ice cold water from boiling oven anymore . It 's also heavier because it 's NOT PYREX anymore ! After 1998 , when Corning Glass stopped making Pyrex . ( Think fiberoptics and bankruptcy , etc . ) They sold off their 'household ' glassmaking and it reformed as World Kitchen . PYREX is borosilicate glass and very resistant to wear and chip and cracking due to exposure to heat or quick changes in temperature . This is why Pyrex and Kimax and other borosilicate glasses are used for chemistry glassware . ( Timex was to watches as these were to chemlabware ! Takes a lickin ' and keeps on tickin ' ! ) Corning has licensed the name of 'Pyrex ' to World Kitchen , but nothing else about it is 'corning glass ' . ( As an aside - Corning made/makes great glass - of all kinds . A world-beater in their day . Management screwed them over going down the wrong economic road . Do check out their lovely glass museum in Corning , NY ! ) NOW , World Kitchen makes their 'pyrex ' measuring cups out of ordinary soda-lime glass ( kitchen drinking glass type ) . This is NOT safe to expose to heat changes ! ! ! ! ( Think wear safety goggles - like you WERE working in a CHEM LAB ! ) I suspect that soda-lime glass is denser than borosilicate , but the actual measure wall thickness may be different now than before , and , thus , this accounts for some of the weight difference . If you want my opinion - find 'vintage ' Pyrex Measuring Cups somehow and they will last multiple lifetimes . I have one of my mom 's and she has two of her mom 's measures . My new ones can not hold a candle to the old ones ( 30 to 60 years old ) and are n't worth a tinker 's damn . Happy times in the kitchen !	-1
TheHolmes HASF-99 10-Inch Velocity Blizzard Stand Fanis no longer sold by Amazon and now only seems to be sold by third party merchants . That should be your first clue that this item is sub-par . I am sure they had to deal with many returns and complaints due to it arriving broken or breaking shortly after . While the fan itself does have some good qualities , everything around it ( the body , extender bars and base ) is made of really cheap plastic and will definitely break sooner than you think.I probably would have given this 4 stars too if I would have written this as soon as I got it . But after a full summer using it this gets no more than 2 stars , and that 's being generous . For starters , the price offered by Amazon was much lower than any of these sellers . At this price , I personally would n't be buying this under any circumstances.The BadThe base of this fan has some cheap concrete in it to weigh it down . The concrete in mine was cracked in shipment , however , because the packaging did n't secure it well . I thought I would still give it a chance . Check your shipment ! If the concrete in the base is damaged in transit , just return this . It will eventually break all the way just from using this fan , as you will soon read.The height is somewhat adjustable because you can use or not use one or all three bars that are interlocking . But the problem is that the weight of the base slowly wears on those bars whenever you have to pick up the fan to move it . It only took a few weeks for one bar to break . Then the next bar broke a few days later . Now I have the equivalent of a table lamp . And after all that , the base broke too . The only wear and tear on it was from moving it . That 's not enough to justify the short life span of all these parts . It 's almost painfully comical to see just the fan head sitting on the floor like that because all the supporting parts have long broken.The GoodThe fan itself is nothing special but works ok . There are multiple speeds and you can set it up to sweep from side to side , both features that are common with almost every fan . At the greatest speed , this fan is pretty good and creates good circulation . I have used some larger circulation fans , and this does n't rise to the level where it deserves to be called a `` blizzard fan . '' Still , the fan mechanism held up longer than any of the body parts , and like I said works well enough to get this guy up to 2 stars.These days there are more options in fans available . I recently got aHoneywell 3-Speed Digital Tower Fan with Ionizerthat I 've been quite satisfied with . The air flow is comparable and the design is much more efficient space wise . It 's a higher cost , but if you need something for a room it 's much better looking too . Other than that , if you are looking for a circulation fan there are other options , though I have n't tried all of those.Versa-Kool 12 Inch Circulation Fan 12 VoltHunter 90021 Century 12-Inch Performance Oscillating FanHoneywell HFS641P 16-Inch Remote Control Stand FanJust do n't try this one though because it 's really got a short life span.I 'm surprised by the cheapo construction from a brand like Holmes . Regardless , some people may still buy this . Perhaps if the wear had n't already started in delivery this would have lasted a little longer . But if you do n't want it to break on you , the minute you set it up do n't move it at all . And do n't pay anywhere near list price for this , because frankly it 's not worth it.Happy shopping . Good luck .	-1
After one week , this charmer began turning off as it oscillated to the left , then turning back on as it moved to the right . I 'm not making this up . After two weeks , it oscillated to the left and gave up the ghost . Get something else .	-1
This little guy puts out some serious windage no doubt . However , it seems a tad noisy to me .	-1
Purchased a set of 4 spoons . Delivery was prompt . Spoons however do not work very well as they are not sharp enough to easily cut a grapefruit that we tried eating . We have an old set of `` Florigold '' spoons that work much better but wanted to get another set for a summer home . These are not going to make it and we still need to continue searching.The Florigolds have a very fine and sharp cutting while these are very coarse and not sharp enough to easily get the job done.Still searching.Tim	-1
In the drawer , even with careful use , the pieces come apart and the knives move all over the drawer . It is made of hard plastic and I wonder if material so hard is dulling my knives . Not what I was hoping for !	-1
Thought these would be great for making egg , sausage and muffin sandwiches to freeze . BUT some of the rings would not hook to the center because the metal was not cut out so it would fit over the center ... The ones that did cook over the center , when you tried to pick the rings up with the handle when the eggs were cooked the cheap plastic handle pulled out . The plastic handle would not stay attached . Very cheaply made , sent all four sets back	-1
In the picture , the rings looked like they would work great but after actually trying them out , no way . When all put together , they are very flimsy and awkward . I ended having to use them separately but then , then needed to be made of metal ( like stainless ) as their not very heavy . The actual ring idea works great but this item does not . I may try to find one that is put together solid and/or individual ones made of metal . All in all , I would not buy this item again unless I just wanted to fry one egg at a time .	-1
I look forward to my future guest ; s then I can prepare eggs for 4 persons at once ! thanks , this was a good deal .	-1
too small and the eggs stick to them , became more of a pain using them . Now I just stamp a hole is a large piece of sourdough with a cup and crack the egg in there.. yum .	-1
I was disappointed to find that this contraption is very flimsy and not rigid.The rings flop around and can easily fall off.The handle is low and wide and gets in the way.The rings are small and are sized for english muffins ( 3.5 '' dia ) .They are too small for pancakes and large bagels.There also tends to be leakage under the ring when using scrambled eggs.I 've abandoned the handle and just use a pair of tongs to lift the ring off.Next time I 'm going to try the Silicone Egg Ring by Trudeau ( 4 '' dia ) .	-1
They must be referring to the black paint not sticking to the tin . I wonder if they made the 'non-stick ' broiling pan in my toaster oven too ... : (	-1
The first time my wife used this the plastic handle melted completely . Other than that she was more than satisfied with the rings .	-1
I 've used these three times and have given up . The eggs leak and spread out around the rings , and then you have a real mess on your hands with these rings embedded in your eggs , and the eggs sticking on both the inside and the outside of the rings.Non-stick ! ! ! The joke is on you if you buy them .	-1
An individual ring is best . Used all four this morning and egg yoke leaked from the bottom of each as I broke each egg into the rings . When I lifted the set from the handle the whole thing came apart . Have used it earlier for one egg and it was fine , sized perfectly for muffin or bagel . Good concept but needs work for four eggs at a time . Might work for a pancake sandwich but I 'm not going to try it.The part that holds the four rings together is plastic . . . ? Guess what ? It melts !	-1
I didnt find this all too useful . I couldnt get the ravioli sheets to stick together well as they all came apart . Maybe I 'll try again and re-review if it works better next time .	-1
After only 1 use the paint came off the bottom of these and stuck to the tortillas which had to be trashed .	-1
Warped trays overlap to the point there is not complete coverage on one `` side '' ( no matter how you position the trays ) . Any more you just do not see good scores for cheap made items from China . This is no exception . American made craftsmanship died in the early 1980 's . We pay the price for corporate greed in more ways than one . Sad , sad , sad . . .I gave it two stars because it is functional , but cheaply made and OVER PRICED . It pains me to think that someone in China got paid a wooden token to make this . It should have cost mo more than $ 9.99 tops ! I buy American made when I can , but some items just are not made in America . This is one of them .	-1
I received my bamboo steamer today , and everything the more critical reviews state is true . The pieces do not fit together well , and the bamboo is rather flimsy and rough . Also , my particular set has dark spots all over one of the trays already . I could imagine how bad this would get after using it as a steamer . The only reason I 'm not returning this item is because I 've decided to use the unspotted tray to store garlic , shallots , and other small onions . Otherwise , this would have been the first item I 'd ever had to send back to Amazon .	-1
I suppose the smallest one could be given to a child.Even the largest of the three is small with too few wires to effectively whip .	-1
These wshisks are light and overall are constructed well . HOWEVER , the disk at the end of the handle sticks out and is quite sharp ! I was not going to risk getting my hand cut while using this thing and since it 's too much trouble to return them to Amazon , I just tossed them out in the trash ! What a waste of money !	-1
When I opened the package I laughed my head off . There is no balloon about it . A balloon whisk is not stiff . the largest whisk looks like it might be able to beat 2 eggs . Do n't waste your money .	-1
First , let me say that the clock on this appliance runs slow , so I 'm returning it . Even if it worked , I 'd hate it . To make coffee , you must lift up the entire top , which means you have to pull it out from under upper cabinets . Inside , the water opening is very small and difficult to reach . At the same time you have to bend down and squint to see the cup markings on the outside . The stray coffee grounds are impossible to clean from the area around the cone holder and they end up in the coffee . The water goes through too fast and the coffee is very weak , especially for a partial pot . I find all this very disappointing because I used to be a product demonstrator for Cuisinart back when they made highest-quality appliances . They 've really lost their way .	-1
Got this on sale . Thought it would be a good one.Cone filters not the best.Hard to add water to.Pot drips when pouring no matter what when it is 3/4+ full.Never kept the coffee very hot.Today , after 4 years it started popping and then smoking . My wife unplugged it before it caught on fire ... Never overly impressed by it . But now that it potentially tried to burn my house down I would say it is not well engineered or made.We have had other Cuisinart products in the last decade and have to say they do n't seem to be holding up nearly as well as Cuisinart products prior.Avoid	-1
I received this as a gift . The best thing I can say about it is that it makes wonderful tasting coffee . I owned a Gavalia coffee maker for about six years that made great coffee . ( The reviews for the current models are n't good though . ) After it went out , I bought one from WalMart than had to be returned because the coffee tasted awful.I have three main issues with this Cuisinart . The lid is really difficult to get on and off . I had an idea this morning to put some cooking oil on it so I 'll try that later . Also , it makes strange clicking sounds while brewing and warming . I had read that in other reviews and after reading about some starting on fire , I wonder if this is related . Because of this I do n't use the warmer and only brew when I 'm nearby . Lastly , I ca n't grab a cup while brewing without some dripping on the hotplate.The glass carafe does seem too thin and I can see why other reviewers have had them break . If I run it through the dishwasher , I 'm sure to not let other glassware touch it and surround it with the other plastic pieces to keep it from shaking around . Also , the measuring steps inside are useless . It 's so dark you ca n't even see past an inch . And , remember it 's not stainless steel . It some kind of brushed metal . The knobs are really nice and the programmable features work perfectly . I love the 1-4 cup feature . I tested with and without using it and it really does make the coffee stronger.My three main issues are very frustrating BUT since the taste is so good , I 'll deal with the issues .	-1
I bought this coffee maker with high expectations after seeing it ranked number 1 in consumer reports . I disagree with their ratings on several makers , having used the BUNN unit and the KitchenAid Pro-line for many years ( as well as Mr Coffee ) . This particular unit has the following cons ( to me ) :1 . ) The cone filters can not be filled on the counter and dropped in the pot , it 's a bit of a pain to add and remove coffee grounds unless the maker is at the leading edge of the counter . This goes double for pouring the water into the skinny region at top rear 1/5th of the unit.2 . ) The unit is too light , it moves about if you use anything but delicate force to add/remove the pot.3 . ) Brewed coffee not as hot as Kitchen aid pro-line , but equal to the BUNN . I like my coffee hot so I can take my time enjoying it . Warming plate function does n't help much on high.4 . ) The thing is noisy like all the other cheap models . BUNN and KitchenAid are completely silent.5 . ) No indicator as to how long the coffee has been sitting there ( nice but unique feature of KitchenAid ) .6 . ) Clock/program display is LCD . Acceptable but worst display technology of many choices that could have been made.7 . ) The lid on the carafe is a joke . It requires careful alignment to snap in place.I have issues with the BUNN and KitchenAid , but they both are very superior to this . On the plus side , I made the following observations:1 . ) Cone filters produce better results than basket filters due to water coverage especially with smaller brews . The resulting coffee is good.2 . ) The unit is nicely compact , has a nice small footprint.3 . ) The carafe is designed well , except the lid . The BUNN and Mr. Coffee carafes are the best I 've used . The KitchenAid carafe is the worst.Overall this Cuisinart is in the league of the Mr. Coffee coffee makers . The BUNN and KitchenAid Pro-line are far better units though they have their own small issues . I regret this purchase .	-1
Loved the coffee but ... first machine stopped working after a couple years . Bought a new one June 2009 and by the end of July 2010 once again the machine stops working . We faithfully cleaned it and used it only once a day . No more Cuisinart for me .	-1
OK . I had the coffee maker about 15 months before it died . I 'm really disappointed in the overall functioning of this coffee maker . Here are the cons , in addition to its short life span.1 . The clock is so hard to read that I had to use a flashlight to see it.2 . After every brewing , the inside lid would be covered with grounds and would have to be cleaned off . The littles holes in the lid would be clogged with grounds.3 . There is no water scale that can be read on the outside of the coffee maker , itself , to show how much water has been added . The only way I could measure the water was by the markings on the carafe . The scale on the inside of the reservoir is hard to read.4 . The lid on the carafe has to be removed to add water to it . Other coffee makers allow the lid to open without removing it.Overall , I would not buy this coffee maker again . I replaced it with a Mr. Coffee . It , too , may not last that long , but I only paid $ 44.00 for it , it has a nice appearance , I can read the clock , it has a water scale that can be read on the outside of the reservoir , and the lid does n't have to be removed each time I fill the carafe with water.My biggest regret is that I bought the same Cuisinart for my daughter . I hope hers lasts longer than mine .	-1
This is a beautiful coffee pot and the brew was terrific . No complaints there . My problem was with the design and layout of the clock . When the coffee was brewing , excessive steam would rise and completely disable the clock . The steam would get inside the mechanism which could only shorten the life of the timer I so desperately needed . It would take an hour to regain visibility and after a week , I returned it as defective . The second pot did exactly the same thing and I decided there must be better out there . I ca n't recommend this great looking coffee pot , even though it made a really good cup of coffee .	-1
I bought this for my wife thinking that it would be a great coffeemaker for her to use after I took back a Mr Coffee machine firstI reasoned that I would be spending more money to get a better coffeemakerWRONG ! ... ..How in the world could Cusinart charge so much for a coffeemaker that does not have the simplest most elemental feature that even $ 12 Coffeemakers have ? Namely ... there is NO outside water level indicator on itHaving used many coffeemakers for many years ... .I know this is an essential component to have in as much as the water level of the coffeemaker does not always match or equal the water reading on the carafeCusinart missed the boat big time in this oneEDIT - less than one week after it was used ... ..this model started leaking badlyI 'm taking this back and I bought another Mr Coffee machine	-1
For half the money you get a better Mr. Coffee . Here are the problems with this one : a ) Coffee taste the same or lower than Mr. Coffee 's thermal carafe machine.b ) If you remove the carafe on this one , it always drips - always . You 'll hear and see the drops and you will have to clean them.c ) It brews `` too fast '' - and then the coffee keeps being heated , until it starts having a burned taste . You have to serve it fast or use a thermos.d ) Strange taste from the charcoal filter - I had to remove it and clean the machine with vinegar twice ( it had bad taste when it arrived , and the filter made it worse ) .e ) You will probably spill a lot of water while trying to fill the water tank - the opening is narrow . It 'll probably spill on cables or wall plugs - that 's because the power cable of this machine is very short , which means it will be really close to the wall plug . A bit hazardous.It looks high tech but the coffee does n't taste well , the filter drips when you remove the carafe , the carafe will spill most of the time while serving , the power cord is too short which means that spilling water while trying to fill the narrow opening of the water tank will make it hazardous .	-1
I loved this coffee maker when it was working fine , but after minimal use , it became stuck in a `` cleaning '' mode and took up to an hour to make a full pot . I should have bought a warranty , but I never considered CUISINART would make such a crappy product , especially considering their prices . After reading other reviews of people who experienced the same thing , I would not buy a Cuisinart maker again . Thanks for REVIEWS ! ( should have read them ! )	-1
I 'm not a picky coffee drinker . If it 's warmish and coffeeish , I 'm happy . So this coffeemaker worked for me . And then , one morning , after a couple of years of use , it died . Cuisinart refuses to support their product ( wo n't repair or replace ) and I 'm not happy . I mean -- is this all we can expect from our appliances now ? My parents have a toaster from the 1950s that -- wait for it -- STILL WORKS ! But this is not how modern-day Cuisinart runs its show , evidently . Two years and this coffeemaker is yet another piece of overpriced rubbish headed for the landfill . I wo n't be buying another appliance from this brand , that 's for sure.Update : I called the company seeking support and they gave me instructions to clean the coffee maker with vinegar and then `` reset the computer '' by unplugging the machine for an hour . They told me that if I followed these steps and the coffeemaker still did n't work , they would send me a replacement coffeemaker for the price of shipping . The steps did n't work . I called back to obtain the replacement coffeemaker and the company refused to send one as the product was `` out of warranty . '' I asked to speak to a supervisor and the individual on the phone said she would have a supervisor call me within 24 hours . Now two weeks later , I have yet to receive a call . BIG SURPRISE .	-1
I had this coffee machine for two years . One day it just let out a puff of smoke and it was all done . It 's important to make sure the basket is seated all the way with a click . If not the coffee with grounds will overflow . It 's a pain in the neck to clean the grounds out of the bottom of the reservoir .	-1
We bought this coffeemaker to replace our Mr. Coffee machine and we thought we were buying an `` upgrade '' . This machine was more expensive , and made by Cuisinart , but we were disappointed when we received it . We thought we would give it a shot since it was expensive ; however , we were still unhappy with it . We could n't easily tell how much water we had added and if the coffee pot was not 100 % in the correct position , it clogged the filter and ended up getting coffee and coffee grinds everywhere . This was not a one time occurrence , this happened several times . We finally gave up and repurchased another Mr. Coffee .	-1
this would have totally matched my kitchen ... .which is Apricot with copper backing in some places . I love the looks ; at least in the pictures . I did n't care that this color was the most expensive . It has all the features I am looking for . I read a couple reviews ; and ordered based on the description and the color . Before it arrived and after it was shipped ; I was excited and read almost all the reviews ! UT OH ! Big issue ! It is a fire hazard accord to quite a few reviews . As we have a Hamilton Beach Brew Station right now ; and leave it on for 4 hours ; well ... .I did n't even want to chance it . So instead , I ordered the number one on Amazon : A Mr Coffee with all the features this one has . Does n't look as nice ; but read reviews ; and hopefully it will work as great as everyone says it does : I have not had much luck with cheap Mr Coffee in the past . So this one did n't even get opened because I did n't want to be 'wowed ' on how great it looks ... just did n't want to chance a fire in my home ... .So I gave it 2 stars : only based on quite a few other reviews ... not sure why it is n't on a recall list ...	-1
Quit working as soon as the warranty expired . You need reading glasses to read the fine print on the front of the control panel . This is my fourth Cuisinart coffee maker to fail . Moving on to another brand .	-1
When we decided to spend so much on this pot , we expected it to last a for quite awhile , as well as brew us some wonderful coffee . It is barely a year old and inexplicably just stopped working ? Would have expected more based on name brand and pricing . Will not be buying a replacement like this ... sticking with the cheaper brands from now on ! & # 11088 ; & # 11088 ; & # 11088 ; & # 11088 ; & # 11088 ; PS - as it turns out , our experience was mild compared to others who have posted here . We just thought it smelled too hot one day and then would n't work at all the next . From the smell of hot wires to having the coffee actually boil and burn ... HORRIBLE , UNSAFE product . We will NEVER be buying a Cuisinart product again . They know , or should have known , about this design defect and continue to sell these fire hazards to unsuspecting consumers ... SHAME ON YOU CUISINART ! ! !	-1
this coffee maker just ca n't make the coffee hot . This is my second one , thinking the first one was broken . The machine produces luke warm coffee - YUCK !	-1
We purchased a Cuisinart DCC-1200 in June 2010 . It made great coffee and had good design features like adjustable warming plate temperature and time to auto-shut-off . The water reservoir fill process was cumbersome but manageable . However , in August 2012 the unit failed spectacularly . I had made a pot of coffee which was on the warming plate . Suddenly , I heard sizzling noises and smelled and saw fumes coming from the unit . By the time I got the unit unplugged the smell of burning electrical components had filled the kitchen . I started checking out prices of a like replacement unit from Amazon and noticed a few other reviewers had similar experiences ( check all the reviews ) . Then I checked the Consumer Product Safety Commission website at SaferProducts.gov - specifically this URL : [ ... ] Check the reports on that website . The manufacturer , Conair , claims that there is no cause for concern and that the noise and fumes come from the safety device on the unit that triggers when the unit fails and overheats.I definitely recommend that buyers steer clear of this coffeemaker.Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker , Black/Brushed Metal	-1
Extremely disappointed in this poor quality , yet expensive , coffee maker . I purchased this last February 2013 and within just 6 months the power-on toggle has already stopped working . I have had better performance from coffee makers that cost 1/4 the price of this piece of crap ! I do not recommend anyone purchase this expensive , poor-quality coffee maker . Will attempt contacting Cuisinart for a replacement .	-1
My DCC 1200 lasted less than 6 months before it started dripping water all over the counter/floor and I pitched it . Decided it was a fluke and bought another Cuisinart ... DCC 1100 this time , and after just TWO months encountered the same problem ! ! I decided to remove the bottom of the coffee maker this time to see just what was causing the problem and found a hairline crack in the hose leading from the heating element to the basket water feed . BAD HOSES , and this seems a common problem if you read the reviews ( leaking ) for all the Cuisinart models.I had no problems with the coffee taste or function of the machine , but a leak after just a couple of months on two separate machines is not a lark ! I do n't mind paying for a good coffee maker , but I expect it to last at least a year ! No more Cuisinarts for me ...	-1
I literally do not understand how you simply shove hot water through grinds and produce a beverage so lousy ! We were coming off a two year old perfect Melitta perc , that had no brew or hot plate adjustment , but made a perfect pot each and every day till its switch died . Melitta discontinues everything as soon as they put it out there like idiots so I could not have bought another even a few weeks after the purchase of this one and only or I would have gladly.The coffee from this Cuisinart comes out cloudy.Not hot . Hottest hot plate setting means nothing.Not even the fragrance of coffee exudes unless you skip the paper filter.The Double Heated water feature for 1-4 cups is simply nonsense.The only compliments I can give this junk is Auto On works , Auto Off works . The clock with ni backlighting keeps excellent time despite earlier reviews saying it doesn't.Did I mention , the coffee is grey when you add cream or milk or both and tastes horrid . I prepp 'd it right . I do n't have water issues and tried different brands of grinds and varying amounts of coffee.I took the advice of reviewers who bought the newer 2600 models that stated this older one was better . I wish I had not .	-1
UPDATE 5/22/13 : This machine started smoking and burning itself up . If I had not been near the kitchen to smell the acrid smoke there would have been a fire . I unplugged it just as my smoke detector went off . I 've had this less than 2 years used mostly on weekends . This thing is going to start a fire and kill someone . What if had been on a timer and I was asleep ? If you have one , unplug it and send it back to the MFG . Never leave it unattended EVER ! ! Looks like others have had this problem too .	-1
Addendum : September 2013 . While I wo n't increase my rating for the original product ( which failed in a matter of months ) , I wanted to make it known that the replacement product I received from Cuisinart is going on 2 years without a hitch . ( Perhaps I should find some wood about now ) .Addendum : October 2011 ( rating downgraded to 2 stars ) : It worked fine a couple of days ago , but did not pump water nor did the hot pad warm up . We attempted to reset the electronics ( 1 hour unplugged ) , but no joy . The unit has a 3-year warranty and the company will ship us a new ( not refurbished ) one , but obtaining warranty service requires we pay for shipping it ( $ 10 ) and the one we return ( $ 17 ) . Apparently the problem we have is not uncommon ; it is potentially a fuse that is soldered in and requires Torx wrenches to access . Bottom line : The $ 70 pot is now effectively $ 97 in cost . Not such a good value any more.Original review : March 2011 ( original rating was 4 stars ) : We purchased the black chrome version of the Cuisinart DCC-1200 after our 15 year old Krups died about a month ago . This coffee pot has a somewhat unusual finish in that the shiny chrome is replaced by a blackened silver that blends in well with stainless or black appliances . While the finish does show fingerprints , these are easily removed with a damp cloth.The carafe is a clean , modern design and is very attractive.Our pot came with a re-usable gold filter , but we prefer paper filters ( which are the readily-available # 4 type ) .The pot makes good coffee ... not quite as good as our old Krups , though . It does much better than the Krups in keeping the coffee at uniform temperature without it losing much flavor , even after 2+ hours . Both the temperature and length of `` on '' time are adjustable.Our only complaints are with the price and difficulty of finding the charcoal filters locally , and the fact that condensation from the plastic lid drips onto the hot plate when the filter is removed . This is a minor inconvenience on an otherwise excellent product .	-1
You read the title correctly : I purchased this in Used -- Like New condition for $ 17 . And the icing on the cake ? Amazon knocked another $ 5 off the price because the coffeemaker arrived without the filters . This is one of the little blessings of checking the price listings carefully before purchasing . Anything offered as Used -- Good or better is usually worth a close look , and if you go with an Amazon Warehouse offering , then you even get Prime delivery in two business days.Otherwise , this is a superlative coffeemaker , by far the best that I have owned . Some high points:1 . The filter helps to produce some of the smoothest tasting coffee I 've ever had.2 . Set up is much simpler than other coffeemakers with filters . The filter is at the bottom of the tank and does n't need to be removed to put ground coffee in the basket.3 . The semi-permanent gold straining basket is much easier to clean than I had expected.4 . The controls are very easy to use , even for a senior with poor eyesight.5 . The retro look is even more attractive than I had expected.UPDATE : This appliance failed completely after less than two years of light use .	-1
This is the second one of these bought within three years . The first one Costco warranted within their two year window.I was getting ready to trash this one and had even bought a replacement Mr Coffee from Costco ( stainless 12 cup programmable for $ 29 ) when a neighbor told me his Cuisinart had failed and they replaced it.I started some internet correspondence with the factory.Below is the final outcome after three back and forths and two weeks . `` Yeah right.I pay shipping to you . Probably $ 20.I pay you $ 10 for sending a rebuilt one back.Thanks for nothing.I bought a Mr Coffee that I have not opened yet thinking you might be a class outfit and do the right thing . This deal is a joke . How about I charge you $ 60 an hour for my time which would be two hours and $ 20 for gas to and from town ? In summary ... ... ... .Your pot goes in the dumpster , out comes Mr Coffee.I did buy a frying pan , by the way ... .a Presto.No more Cuisinart product for me.Thanks anyhow. > From : cservepop @ conair.com > Subject : More Chinese Junk > > Valued Customer , > > Thank you for your inquiry .

My husband bought this coffee pot after I suffered some burns using a French press coffee pot early in the morning before I was fully awake . I have two complaints about this coffee pot : 1 ) it leaks all over the counter and 2 ) it does n't make 12 cups of coffee at the strength I prefer because if I load enough coffee into basket to get the taste we like , it backs up into the water reserve.I will give it one star because I do like the taste of the coffee I get using the maximum amount of coffee with eight cups of water .	-1
This is the most expensive coffee maker I even owned and for two years is gave me great coffee . I changed the water filters , did the cleaning process , and took great care of the appliance but this morning it just died . No warning . Did my usual routine of setting it up for my morning brew and returned to find the pot empty . Checked all the buttons and dials and switches and all were fine . The light was on but no brewing happened . Nothing . I checked the manual . No troubleshooting section . Duh ? Is that arrogance on their part ? Nothing ever goes wrong ? No help in sight . I 'm going back to Mr. Coffee . My cheap Mr. Coffee lasted me a dozen years without problems and was a fraction of the cost of this disappointment . Hey , Cuisinart ! ! Wake up and smell the coffee ! ! That is , unless you 're using one of your coffeemakers .	-1
Made frozen and fresh pizzas taste DRY . Tried frozen appetizers as well - they were okay . I felt the heating was inefficient . It was fun to watch and have at the table but in the end , it just was n't fast enough either . Plus , hated that I could n't simply stop it . The timer had to finish in order for the heating to stop ( how terrible ! ) so I ended up having to unplug the whole thing . Last but not least , the tray/pan was wobbly . It has to be pizza or evenly weighted food , else the tray rotates tilted.Because of the entertainment factor , I gave it one more star than I originally planned .	-1
For the money I guess it 's not that bad but I found the popcorn to come out tough and hard to chew . I 've used Orville Reddenbacker kernals , which I think is a very good quality . After using it two weeks I 'm now in the market for an electric air popper .	-1
We were looking for a healthier alternative and cheaper way of having our favorite snack without sacrificing taste . This product is as close to the convenience of microwave popcorn you are going to get . On our first try , it popped 97 % of the kernels . We were apprehensive about buying this because the picture made it look like it was pretty tall and our microwave is that Sharp Microwave Drawer that is very shallow and does not accommodate many tall bowls . Also our microwave has no carousel and this device still work remarkable well . Here are my pros and cons : Pros : - design encourages kernels to make their way back to bottom if unpopped- Popper can double as bowl to eat from to avoid dirtying another vessel- Height is low enough to fit in a shallow microwave.- Vented lid so when you lift the lid you wo n't be in danger of vaporizing your corneas- designed to pop corn with or without oil.- Easy to clean- Compared to microwave popcorn , you can enjoy better , healthier popcorn for pennies on the dollar.Cons : - Requires use of consumable they call heat concentrator . These discs are reusable 12 to 24 times . They come in a pack of 8 , so conceivably you can pop a max of 192 times with one package . If you use oil , you will be closer to the 12 times per disc . Amazon sells each pack of 8 for $ 5 with free shipping.- A major design flaw that will frustrate you to no end is the lid handle . This thing is very hot when you remove from the oven . It is steaming along with an oily layer from the steam . So when you try to lift the lid , the handles are way too slippery and small to get a grip . The handle is also shaped for failure . They slant outward as it travels towards the lid , so when you try to grip it , you are basically pinching yourself away from the handle . The lid edges are also countersunk on the bowl so you ca n't even grab it from there . Use this thing once and in no time you see what I mean and will do what I have to do , and that is use a butter knife to poke the lid through one of the vents to lift it out . This flaw is very bad and a major safety issue.- It is a unitasker , so it is for popcorn only- It is mostly plastic and the kind that is supseptable to cracking from impacts , so be careful .	-1
The bad things , it gets very hot , needs the power concentrator s to useit , and it caused a hole to burn in the ceiling if my LG microwave , the good things are when you figure out the right mount of time for your microwave I pops all the corn , and that is good . I had to replace my 3 month old built in microwave so I returned it and would use caution .	-1
We used this KSM2 grinder for 3 years for spices only . Used it for about 20 grinds per year , or total of 60 times . When it stopped working the other day , I took it apart and discovered the problem . The micro switch extends about 5 inches into an area where is it secured by a very flimsy plastic part . This is , of course , the part that broke and the switch was rendered useless.I will admit that the grinder did a very good job with spices . However , 60 uses does not qualify as a well made product.For all the other reviewers who primarily use blade grinders for coffee beans and complain about dust and timing issues , I would highly recommend a burr-type coffee mill . Once you use one , you will never go back to a blade grinder .	-1
I have had a number of Braun coffee makers . This is the first unit that was not up to Braun 's typically high standards . The unit is lighter weight and not as well designed compared to Braun units I have previously owned . One of the prongs that hold the lid on broke after a few months normal use and it is awkward to get the carafe centered over the heating plate - the carafe wants to slide off to one side . I normally love Braun products , but would not recommend this one other than for occassional use - such as at a beach or mountain house where it does n't have to meet the rigors of every day use .	-1
We purchased this coffeemaker based on a Consumer Reports recommendation . CR clearly did n't test it for very long . Within 60 days , the basket holding the coffee grounds would n't close without lifting the flow control valve that allows you to remove the carafe before brewing was finished . Eventually the valve broke and it 's obvious why . The valve is a spring loaded arm which pushes a rubber ball into an opening at the bottom of the basket . The arm narrows to a small piece of plastic before it widens into a larger part of the arm that is raised by the carafe to drop the ball and let the coffee drip into the carafe . Over time , the plastic is weakened by the heat of the coffee and the pressure of the spring that forces the ball to close when the carafe is removed . Eventually the arm0 snaps at its narrowest point . While the coffee tastes great ( much better than my old Mr. Coffee ) the basket dribbles coffee over the hot plate when you remove the carafe after it stops brewing . There are 4 prongs that hold the lid on the carafe . They are very small and 3 of the 4 are now broken . It 's almost impossible to pour water into the holding tank without spilling it over the side and onto the countertop . I 've only had this for 90 days , but it 's going into the trash as soon as I get another brand to replace it . We had our Mr. Coffee machine for years and never broke anything on it .	-1
as others have written , works great for a year , then only speed 3 works . The mini food processor bowl cracked under that speed . Too bad one ca n't get in the thing to replace the switch easily.dawg !	-1
I felt this was an excellent buy . After about 6 months ofuse , I am looking for another set since the wood split on each one.Split wood on cutting boards can be dangerous since it can trap germs .	-1
I got these in mid-August 2006 . Yesterday - December 18 , 2006 - the large board split in half . It warped very quickly despite my attempts to dry it and properly store it . It was *always* hand washed too.Do n't buy these .	-1
bought it as a gift and very upset when i was told that two of them split one split while using other was split when they checked it in the morning seemed to be very badly gluec	-1
The two smaller ones are really only useful if you have a tiny galley-kitchen . I threw them out and only kept the big one . Unfortunately , it stains very easily ( beet juice ) and it does n't wash off . I expect to be replacing this one shortly .	-1
One of these boards has started to crack along the line where the wooden slats are bonded together ( it really does n't hold up to any soaking/wet environment ) . There are a number of `` splintery '' spots . The small is too small to be practical for much . Still , the medium gets the job done ( mostly ) .These are not especially hard boards . I would recommend either a harder wood , or just going with plastic .	-1
Fast shipping was nice , and I was excited to used this product , but when I washed the biggest cutting board it cracked in half and is no longer usable ; I had to throw it away .	-1
If this seems like a ridiculous deal for three hardwood cutting boards , well it is . Only problem is two of the boards have split since I bought the set six months ago . I do n't know if the wood is not cured correctly or what , but I have certainly not abused these cutting boards , nor have I subjected them to extreme temps or soaked them in water.If I had it to do over again , I would get one good cutting board that would last , as these will have to be replace as they continue to split . [ added 4/3/07 ] Just wanted to update with a note that for $ 10 I bought a huge heavy-duty wooden cutting board at a certain Swedish superstore . Buy the mineral oil that comes with it and treat it once a year- have n't had any issues with it .	-1
This is a good , very useful type of cutting board . The sizes provided are handy . However , in the set I received , the largest board was substantially defective : the color is irregular in places , and the thickness in inconsistent . The board is thicker near the edges than it is in the middle , which is a serious flaw since the knife needs to contact the board throughout the cut.I 've owned several cutting boards , and never had one with a defect . It 's an extremely simple product , and almost all types are flawless . To receive one with two separate , easily noticeable flaws is very disappointing . I can not recommend this product .	-1
I bought these with the intention of gifting them . I was n't looking for high end cutlery , just a cheap but well made set of knives . I would be embarrassed to present these to someone . You could pick up knives of comparable quality at the dollar store.These knives are shoddy , and should n't be sold for more than $ [ ... ] . The handles are made of cheap plastic , are uncomfortable , and poorly balanced . The blades are too thin , too flexible , and they are all serrated ( fine if you want to tear rather than cut your food I guess ) .For the price you can do a lot better . I immediately returned this item when I saw the poor quality . Henckel should be ashamed to put their name on this garbage.I picked up a set of Cooks brand cutlery from J.C. Penny for about the same price with full tang riveted handles , fairly balanced , and smooth bladed .	-1
This item worked twice . The third time the sensor kept beeping indicating that the lid was open . It was clicked shut . The sensors were touching . There was no reason for it to do this . So of course it would not grind or brew coffee . Had to unplug it several times , reset the clock , reprogrammed it , no amount of work would get it to perform as the book said it should . Aside from that it was easy to use and clean but it is not attractive enough to just be a kitchen knick knack .	-1
I still have n't found one of these mini-choppers that really does that job right , so do n't expect that this is simply a mini version of a real Cuisinart food processor.I had an even cheesier version of one of these , a noname brand from Walmart , and I 'd hoped that the Cuisinart brand was going to be a big improvement . Unfortunately , while better , it still suffers from some of the same problems : the blade dulled quickly and food tends to twirl around inside the bowl without falling down onto the blades as in a full-size food processor . The dull blades mostly just beat up the food , and you 'll have a helluva time acheiving fine mincing . And because the two switches are not latching types , you have to hold down the switch for the entire ( excessive ) time needed to fully process the food.On the plus side , the top fits tightly while processing and the unit is fairly easy to clean . But do n't expect it to fully mince 3 cloves of garlic ...	-1
The fryer is very small , so as you cook subsequent batches , the previous batches gets cold . It 's very basic : no temperature control , no indicator light for when it has reached the correct temperature , no basket ( just a wide slotted spoon ) and no insulation , so you do have to be careful around it . That would have all been OK for the occasional deep fryer user like myself except for something so basic , you would think there would n't be much that could go wrong with it . However I only used it about 10 times before it stopped working completely .	-1
Have n't had a deep fryer for a very long time and decided to buy one for fish fries and fried desserts . Just assumed a thermostat would be included on any model purchased , however , this particular model did not have one . Never really knew if it was too hot or too cold for the particular item we were frying . Would not recommend .	-1
It is a lot smaller than I expected it to be.I have to do double or triple batches of food.It is only good for one serving .	-1
It will fry , but : you have find a lid to cover itthere is nothing that will tell you that you 're ready to frythe bottom gets very hot	-1
THE POT IS TOO HOT NO WAY CAN CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE CAUSE FOOD GETS BURN INSIDE OF IT BUT OUTSIDE IS BROWN AS FAST . IT IS SO HARD FOR DEEP FRY IN THIS POT . I RETURN IT . THE STYLE IS NICE AND SIZE IS CUTE . I DO NOT LIKE IT .	-1
The handle is big , bulky and heavier than need be . It 's like picking up a hammer .	-1
The design of this spoon is terrible and KitchenAid dropped the ball on this one . The 'cupped ' part is extremely thick - WAY TOO thick ! I was going to use it as a basting spoon and a soup serving spoon but ca n't because the thick sides ca n't scoop up enough liquid for basting and odors of soup seasonings ( especially garlic ) linger on it . I can even smell the dishwasher detergent on it after it 's been throughly washed . I wanted to send this back soon after it arrived from looking at it , but all that trouble for an $ 11.00 spoon ? ? ? NOOOO ! I 'll figure out something it will be useful for after my suspicions ( plus even more problems ) proved to be right . Maybe I 'll scoop dry cat food with it . Would n't matter if it took up that smell , or ... .maybe I 'll loan it out to women that say they only eat a 'spoonfull ' of this food or that food on their diets . HA ! ! !	-1
I loved mine for a year that it worked . After about 6 uses and just less than a year , while making a cake the handle finally broke ! I was thinking of replacing it with another Kitchen Aid $ 10 spatula , but why should a spatula last only 1 year and cost $ 10 ? They look super cool with the silver trim , but they do n't seem to be well-made . I will have to research a NON-KitchenAid spatula because this one does not make the grade ! I am moving on to another brand .	-1
I researched for a long time before I finally decided to purchase this KitchenAid Mixer Spatula . I used it about 6 times , less than a year old , and when I was using it , the handle broke ! I love this spatula , especially the curved edge that lets you get all the good stuff out of the mixing bowl . I can not see myself paying $ 10 for another spatula that will last about 1 year . They look super cool with the silver trim , but they do n't seem to be well-made . I will have to research a NON-KitchenAid spatula because this one does not make the grade !	-1
KitchenAid Stainless Steel Utility TongsThese tongs do not grip the food with security . Not good when you are trying to remove hot food from grease . The holes in the blades do help prevent hot liquids from running down the channel and out the top near the locking device . That is the only redeeming quality about these tongs . Am searching for someone I dislike so I can give these tongs to them .	-1
I was thrilled with this product when I first received it : '' Nice and big ... does n't get lost in the kitchen drawer ... big , sturdy handles to hold onto , nice big knob for easy turning . No more fumbling and sore hands from puny knobs , and skinny handles . `` Unfortunately in less than a years time span it went the way of similar can openers , trembling in fear at the sight of a can and refusing to cut through or half cut through any can it came across . For as well made as it seemed to be , I 've had cheaper can openers that lasted far longer.After it 's demise it was replaced with a Zyliss safe-edge can opener , which after over 3 years of daily use is still going strong .	-1
Bought this about a year ago . It opened cans for only a couple of months . Now it only opens half the can no matter how many times you go over it . You also have to squeeze super hard to get it to work even that good ! I thought Kitchenaid was supposed to be good stuff . Based on my experience with this , I 'll be very hesitant to purchase anything with this brand name on it again .	-1
This opener feels great in the hand . It 's very sturdy and has nice heft . It did a good job of cutting-at first . After a few uses , it is now useless . It no longer grips the cans . It slips constantly and no longer cuts . I replaced it with a Kuhn-Rikon safety opener . An award-winning opener that works every time . It 's a bit pricey , but well worth it . I wish I had known about it before I bought this piece of garbage . I think kitchenaid should stick to countertop appliances .	-1
I have many Kitchenaid items , and when I went through two can openers in 2 months , I decided to spend more and buy a Kitchenaid , thinking it would last longer . I was wrong . I am only 2 months into using it , and it is headed for the trash . I am only using it for home use , not industrial , so there is no reason it should stop working this quickly . Apparently by the other reviews , I am not the only one who has had problems with this ! I will be trying another can opener , based on reviews this time !	-1
Like many other reviewers , I have been sorely disappointed in my KitchenAid can opener . I thought it was just me at first - I thought I knew how to use a can opener , but this one just plain does n't work . I have to try 3-4-5 times EVERY time I use this thing . Leaves uncut gaps in the lid -shreds the paper off the can and makes a mess on the counter . Keep your money & look elsewhere - this product is not up to the standards you normally associate with the name KitchenAid . I 'm looking for a new one .	-1
I received this as a gift in August . I tried using it several times and the bread always came out burnt on the outside and uncooked on the inside . I have a full-size breadmaker and have never had trouble with it , so I read the instructions carefully , bought and tested new yeast , followed their recommendations for each of the two problems , etc . I contacted West Bend and they suggested that I try their bread mixes that are designed just for this product . I ordered some , waited a few weeks for them to be delivered , and tried them . Same problems . At this point , the Amazon warranty was expired . I contacted West Bend again and was told that they could not help me , as their 90-day warranty on it HAD JUST expired . This after I ordered the special bread mix and waited weeks for it per their suggestion ! This is going in the garbage and I wo n't purchase another product from West Bend again .	-1
I purchased this because of the brand ( Krups ) but it turned out to be one of those not so great items . Cooked the eggs OK but just not good enough to keep . Too many other egg cookers for the same or less money which are probably better .	-1
No timer . No second tray . Hard to clean . What you 've got is a thing that boils eggs -- no sound to alert you when the eggs are done and it just keeps cooking , no automatic shut off . A complete waste , now I 'm trying to figure out what to replace it with .	-1
I bought this primarily for poached eggs and very occasional hard-boiled eggs . My first two attempts at softly poached eggs resulted in raw eggs because the unit buzzed ( obnoxiously ) after less than two minutes . The third try resulted in over-cooked poached eggs because the unit NEVER buzzed and I finally stopped it at 5 minutes . ( There is no auto shut-off , so the thing keeps cooking until you shut if off , buzzer or not ) . The last attempt resulted in medium-hard poached eggs . I used the same measurements etc for each attempt and yet every result was different , and incorrect . It is necessary ( per the directions ) to wait at least 30 minutes between attempts or the buzzer sounds as soon as you turn it on and it will not start . After all these poaching failures ( with the required 30-min waits ) this morning , I finally ate some Cheerios , AT NOON . It is possible the particular unit I received is a lemon ; I gave the same Krups model to my mother for Christmas , and she likes it . She made poached eggs in it for me ( in the same manner and measurements I used with mine ) , and hers were perfect . She also likes it for hard-boiled eggs because the shells peel right off no matter how fresh the eggs are . However , I am not going to take a chance on a replacement . The performance of my machine deserves zero stars . I can prepare perfect softly poached eggs in my little silicone egg cups and a small saucepan , and the clean-up and storage are far easier than with this silly egg cooker . I usually avoid gadgets and dumb appliances , and this experience reminded me why . Waste of money , lesson learned .	-1
I am writing a new product review for this Krups panini maker in that my unit recently broke after 1.5 years . I thought it was a great panini maker which I used probably 2X a week . It appears that the unit somehow burned itself out last week . Of course it only comes with a 1 year warranty so I can not get it replaced.As I said in my other review , there really is no reason to pay the premium for the Krups maker when there are many other generic brands that make panini grills just as well for half the price . I will be purchasing a cheaper unit because unlike pots and pans , if you pay more it does not necessarily mean that it will last longer .	-1
Worked very well through perhaps 25 to 30 sandwich-making evolutions . Pulled it out of the cupboard one day to make a toasted cheese sandwich , plugged it in -- nothing happened . The grill was completely dead -- no lights , no heat , no nothing ! Turns out this device contains a thermal fuse . Once it blows , the grill is only good for a doorstop . I contacted Krups and was informed the fault is not repairable . If it was still within warranty ( it was n't ) they would replace it . Otherwise , I should just junk it . What a colossal waste ! A 50 cent part fails , and Krups says , chuck it into the land-fill . This appliance is NOT RECOMMENDED !	-1
This will make a panini but that 's about it . There is only one heat setting and it is pretty high . Also , this is pretty difficult to clean . I do n't recommend this if there are other options .	-1
I purchased this chopper primarily for pureeing tomatoes , chopping onions , and other simple stuff like that . I used it twice , and when I got it out the third time , it would n't work . The problem is the built-in safety lock . You have to lock the cannister onto the base , and the lid onto the cannister in order for the unit to turn on . Well there seems to be a problem in the mix , because the cannister/lid combination wo n't depress the safety button far enough . Unfortunately , I 've had it for 60 days , so I 'm beyond Amazon 's return/exchange policy . I tried calling KitchenAid warranty service , but have n't yet been able to get through.I 'm a big fan of my KitchenAid stand mixer , but everything else I 've ever bought from them ( this , a blender , and some kitchen utensils ) has failed . All seem to be quality control issues .	-1
What a piece of junk this is ! -- - My wife bought this and used it for exactly one month to chop up soft food for baby food . Sounds like a tough job , huh ? -- - Well it was for this piece of garbage which stopped working one month after my wife had purchased this . Although she had subsequently discarded the box and sales receipt ; I called Kitchen Aid who did not even want to hear about my plight or even examine this defective unit which cosmetically looked like it was just taken out of the box . I think my wife used this perhaps a dozen times before it died completely . I buried it in the trash where it belongs . I will never again buy a Kitchen Aid product like this at any price.BEWARE ! ! ! ! - Now I see what everybody meant about a `` bad button `` ! -- - I experienced the same problem that many other people did . This model obviously IS a real lemon ! ! ! With all of these similar complaints you KNOW Kitchen Aid is aware of this `` bad button `` problem but has obviously chosen to ignore it and look the other way.I wish I had read about the `` bad button `` BEFORE I purchased this hunk of junk ... ... ... You 'd think after all of these complaints and bad reviews about the `` bad button `` on this machine that Kitchen Aid would wise up and either recall , offer to repair or just manufacture a new model with an `` operative button `` that wo n't die after one month .	-1
After one month of limited use the safety latch or pulse button will not allow the product to operate . I am returning this item .	-1
Why are the reviews so good ? This is all plastic . The lid , the bowl , the unit . I can see it now , the first time it 's used , the plastic snapping . Kitchenaid ... ..I 'm really disappointed .	-1
I owned a Little Oscar for years and loved it . My friend gave me this Kitchenaid a year ago and it does n't chop anything in consistant pieces . I 've chopped nuts , celery , onions , carrots , etc with every variety of chop produced ... from mush to totally unchopped pieces , all in one bowl . This chopper is just not worth the $ 40 . price tag ! Not only that , but I put the plastic cup in the microwave and a small metal piec in the handle ( I did n't notice ) , melted the handle so the lid wo n't lock on the bowl . I have been unable to purchase a replacement bowl , even from Kitchenaide themselves .	-1
I have to cut the pieces so small to fit I might as well just finish it myself . Now if you like baby food this is good . My chop wizard is hard to clean but is more useful then this . This is for people who want mash food . If you want nice looking food get a chop wizard cuts the food no mash it .	-1
PROSI used this almost daily.SIZE , EASY TO CLEAN AND DISHWASHER SAFE- In comparison to my big huge food processor , which takes up a lot of time to clean , the small chopper fit blade and all , right into the dishwasher and took up very little space.EVENLY CHOPPED FOOD- It produced evenly chopped garlic , fresh herbs , nuts , and pureed just about anything.APPEARANCE- It looks great on against the marbled black/brown granite counter and has a small footprint . However , I like the look of the Cuisinart Elite Collection 4-Cup Chopper/Grinder over the KitchenAid ( both black ) .Cuisinart CH-4DC Elite Collection 4-Cup Chopper/Grinder , Die CastCONSMOTOR- Three motors that burned up in two years ... Wo n't buy a KitchenAid chopper again . Replaced with the Cuisinart Elite Collection 4-Cup Chopper/Grinder which has had no motor problems in the past year+ .	-1
one arrived broken ( same as the smaller red one I reviewed ) and they weigh a LOT , more than is comfortable for carrying into a room and eating off your lap . Might be OK for a serving bowl ?	-1
As with other reviewers , my replacement beater began to chip lately . My Mother 's 50 yr. old model did not have such problems ! I thought if i took care of this beater and hand washed it right after using it and hand dried it ( instead of letting it soak ) the white nylon or enamel would not chip off . It did not last a year before pieces of white starting to come off . Disappointed . As for the mixer ? 30 years of steady use and still going strong !	-1
I 'm replacing the original- on which the enamel chipped after 2 years light use . No metal or hard objects came in contact and I am very unhappy with the Kitchen Aid quality . However , this is the only choice now . It would be better if they made the dough hook from stainless steel.I have the Artisan stand mixer , but next time would purchase a different brand . This hook is difficult to remove from mixer head and no fun to clean .	-1
BEWARE THIS WHISK CAN NOT GO IN THE DISHWASHER ! Ok , so here 's a baffling corporate decision ; KitchenAid designs and builds a high cost , high quality , premium mixer that becomes an industry icon ; then in their infinite wisdom decides it would be a good idea to cheap out on accessory components and create a wire whisk attachment that you can not use in the dishwasher.You see KitchenAid decided to instead of stainless steel , cheap out and use soft non-anodized billeted aluminum for the part that attaches the wire whip to the mixer pin . ( Note , it appears they did once use stainless steel ) . Because of this poor cost cutting decision , you can not put the whisk in the dishwasher , and it must be hand cleaned.In fact the reason we had to buy a new whisk in the first place , is because we accidentally put the original in the dishwasher , and the connector became black and corroded and would leak into what every we were mixing.Bottom line , KitchenAid cost cutters ruined a perfectly good accessory , and consumers have no choice but to use it , unless they want to purchase another brand of stand mixer.Boo KitchenAid !	-1
This is my second one . It is now bent . Making Nutella cookies , very dry and hard , it is very frustrating . This is Kitchen Aid right ?	-1
If I had rated this product during the first season , I 'd have said it was great . However , a few months is all you get . I have gone thru 2 of them now , both with the same result . It works great for a couple months , and then it wo n't stay lit . I tried customer service , and they were convinced I must have a herd of spiders inside it , and all I 'd have to do was clean it out . Tried that , no luck . So with the new one , I covered the opening after every use . Same result . Plan on getting a few months out of it .	-1
I purchased this heater and it was a problem from day one . Out of about one hundred attempts to light , it has only worked three times ! The pilot light ignites without problem , but it refuses to work beyond this point . Two out of the three times it worked , it went out when I tried to turn the control from high to low . I have since purchased three butane heaters that work flawlessly . I would not recommend this unit .	-1
While seeing this pasta bowl on sale for $ 4.99 , I did n't think twice to purchase several of them will all kind of color availalbe 2 weeks ago . What a great price ! I was so excited and waiting on the door on the schedule delivery day . The packing is nice and secure . The color was so vivid at the first sight , but ... . after I took a hard look , almost half of the bowls are defective ! ! Un-colored white spot , un-glazed bubble holes , black dots/stain inside of the bowl . Even defective spots are tiny , but they are so obvious . They just do n't look good with those flaws on them ! I was so ... .disappointed and frustrated as I went through all the 21 bowls I ordered . By the way , the BLACK bowl have no name or mark of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowl . I will say those are probably the factory-secondary products . It turned out I have to return almost half of the bowls and keep those bowls with bearable defectiveness , such as vague stamp of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowls . Of course , all the black ones are returned since they are no-name with the bad quality . No one will even believe they are Fiestaware ! !	-1
Nice unit but it holds 10 oz max , not 24 which is 3 cups . If you want a large cup of coffee - just one - you 'll have to load this thing twice . It fits 8 oz comfortably , no more.A real drag as they say 3 cups !	-1
I just received this Boden Chambord 3 cup , 12 oz coffee press . 3 cups maybe if you are playing with your daughters Barbie Doll set . OMG , it does not provide 12oz of coffee . At best it will fill a standard coffee cup ( 8oz ) with slightly over 4oz . That 's half a cup of coffee ! ! ! ! What incredibly misleading advertising.The Boden glass press , empty , might hold a full 12oz of water without the coffee grounds , if you fill it to the brim . But if you are making a cup of coffee you will find this impossible . You can only fill it to the top ring of the holder , so that the press will fit onto the pot .	-1
It looks nice.It does n't press coffee all the way into the bottom , thus leaving the brew a bit weak and wasteful of ground coffee.It is over rated considering the high price .	-1
It 's important when ordering to note that `` 3 cups '' = 12 ounces = 3 tea cup sized cups . What a disappointment to receive this tiny French press since I failed to notice the fine print when ordering . See the image I uploaded . Realistically you could n't get 3 cups out of this once you allow for the space grounds take and space at the top to avoid overflow .	-1
I did n't read all the print on the box . Being old school I thought a CUP was 8 ounces . My coffee cup holds 5 ounces . Bodum is pretending a CUP is 4 ounces to give their product more value.Being a marketing guy myself I resent this misleading statement and I will likely send a Bodum complaint to the FTC.Sure it 's only $ 35 misspent but am I the only person who saw their lead statement on the box saying `` 3 Cup Coffee Maker '' and took it to mean an actual cup ... .Yes , if I had purchased in a store it would have been obvious that it is a one cup item with some left over , you cant make 12 ounces with the course ground coffee in the bottom of the container.Good product for single normal cup or two small cups . Prestigious brand name to impress guests but ALL French press coffee makers produce the same fine brew .	-1
No question that this makes a good cup ( not cups , one cup ) of coffee . But when I tried to dislodge the grounds from the bottom with a light tap , the carafe shattered . I would n't consider buying another , because if I have to soak it for a long time , dump the grounds into my sink , and then empty the sink strainer into the garbage ( after every single cup of coffee ! ) , there 's no way it 's worth the effort .	-1
When it arrived , the metal legs did not all sit evenly on the counter -- it was slightly warped . Undeterred , I pressed on . However , after just three uses the glass cracked.I 've used a french press for most of my coffee for the last decade or so , and this is the first time I 've ever had this happen . Very poor experience . Not recommended .	-1
I grind my own coffee bean using eight'o'clock french roast . Placed 5 tablespoons of coffee and 20 oz of cooled down boiled water . Let it sit for 5 minutes , press the filter down and poured it out into a cup . First thing I noticed is there is not a nice aroma coming from my cup . Even my keurig has a stronger coffee aroma coming from it ! Why would I waste time using this and cleaning it when a keurig is quicker and tastes better ? It doesnt make any sense . If I could I would return it .	-1
I bought my first Bodum french press in 1981 and still have it along with another purchased in 2006 . The only noticeable difference in the second one was that they had replaced the wood handle with a melamine like plastic , not a bad thing as the wood tended to loosen with use . Both units were made in Germany even though Bodum was , and is , a Danish company . After breaking the glass beaker in the newer one ( my fault entirely ) I was a little shocked to find the going price for a replacement was anywhere from $ 25 to $ 30 . Instead , for less than $ 20 more , I ordered a brand new unit planning on having a `` spare parts kit '' for my originals.Unfortunately , the unit I received was made in Portugal and just about everything about it had been cheapened in the seven years since I purchased my last one . The chromed brass frame is about half as thick as my first two ( 5.6 oz . vs. 10.55 oz . ) , they replaced the little wooden top knob with a molded plastic ball , and the kitchy melamine handle is now a cheap feeling molded plastic that removes much of the bistro charm . But the worst `` improvement '' is a totally unnecessary plastic sheath that blocks off the lip of the beaker when depressing the plunger and then requires the user to turn the top to the `` open '' position . Like the frame , the new top weighs less than half what the original did and is now fitted with plastic grommets rather than the stainless steel nut and washer . I can only presume this is some lame safety feature that their lawyers thought was a good idea because we were all too stupid to read the instructions . Besides insulting the intelligence of every purchaser it adds another piece of soon to fail cheap plastic that compromises the simple , hassle free charm of the original french press.Initially it may work fine because the Bodum filter assembly is superior to other presses I 've tried . But if you value material and workmanship you 're likely to be disappointed with this latest example . For daily use I 'd recommend looking at other Bodum presses . This model always justified it 's higher price by having superior workmanship and materials , but you now mightl find a better value that 's just as functional in some of their other styles . I returned this unit and ordered a replacement beaker as I had originally intended ; sadder but wiser .	-1
Slowly but surely my French Press has replaced my regular coffee maker . I have a Keurig that sits on the counter top , but simply takes up space . I 'm considering giving it to my brother because we never use it . The French Press makes far superior coffee and it never malfunctions . I never have to worry about pumps that wo n't prime or K-Cups not being available . In short , this coffee press puts out what the Keurig never could - coffee - and it does it without hesitation . **Like everything in life things change and I discovered the way of making real coffee . I went through I phase where I really loved the french press , but at the same time I spent every day search the Internet looking for the best method to brew coffee ( how bizzarre is that ? ) . I was getting grounds in my cup and that drove me insane ! Finally I found theChemex Six Cup Glass Coffee Maker with Glass Handle - 6 Cup Coffee Makerand my cure for the coffee blahs were over . I gave my french press to Goodwill and did n't look back .	-1
We only had the Bodum Chambord maybe two weeks and had a couple of issues with it : the screw that holds the top together came loose and we could have easily lost the screw but it popped out and landed where we could spot it . No easy feat to rethread and line up the screw . The metal holder that the carafe sets in is not a tight fit so the glass carafe easily slips out and if you are not careful when you tip an empty carafe , the glass will slip out and break ( which it did with us when we were emptying out a few stray coffee grounds into the sink . We used to have a smaller Bodum and that glass carafe seemed stronger and thicker . The recent ones seem fragile.So , we are switching to the stainless steel French presses made by another company . But I was a die-hard Bodum fan so I even reordered a Bodum Chambord since the glass carafe for a 51 oz was not available . I came to my senses ; it 's time for a change.Good service by Amazon and good return policy .	-1
DO NOT BUY ANY BODUM COFFEE OR TEA PRESS THAT CONTAINS GLASS . BODUM USES A SPECIAL GLASS THAT IS EXTRAORDINARILY FRAGILE AND BREAKS FOR NO APPARENT REASON.I love Bodum Coffee Presses . But I would NEVER recommend anyone buy one with a glass beaker . You will need to replace the beaker frequently , since the special glass Bodum uses is extremely fragile , and breaks repeatedly for no apparent reason at all . I replaced four beakers , two glass tea presses , and several beakers from milk frothers in short order before giving up . Make no mistake , you do not have to bang the glass against anything for it to break . It simply cracks spontaneously for no apparent reasonBodum has come out with some presses with a LEXAN clear plastic beaker.These do not break . I assume they came out with the LEXAN product because of problems with the glass . Be warned.Bodum Chambord 8-Cup Coffee PressBodum Chambord 12-Ounce Coffee Press	-1
Leaks on my shirt when I drink from it , even with the o-ring I added . Maybe mine is missing something ?	-1
I waited over a month to get this and was really looking forward to it . I 've used it for 3 days now and the seal between the inner and outer walls ( it 's double-walled for insulation ) is broken - there 's moisture in there and brown droplets of coffee . I only washed it by hand and it 's been carefully handled . Too bad , because it 's a great idea and it makes good coffee .	-1
funnel paper filter makes much better coffee . This press will let grinds pass through into your cup and it 's a struggle just to clean this contraption . funnel filter is a much better choice .	-1
Since writing the review below , the Bodum Logo Travel Press has begun to leak around the seal where the top connects to the cup . This is the single biggest failing in any travel mug , as it virtually ensures that you will spill coffee on EVERYTHING , including your papers , your shirt , your tie and your hands . I 've only been using the travel press for three weeks , and I would hardly call usage very vigorous ... I use it on the way to work , use it throughout the day at work , wash it and then carry it back home in my bag . The combination of the garish logos and catch phrases and the leaking seal make this travel press a total failure and a waste of money . I only wish there was an option for zero stars . But then , I also wish there was the option of going back in time and not buying this piece of junk in the first place.Here were my initial comments , prior to the start of the leaking : Some grounds sneak past the edge of the press and wind up in your mouth , but I wo n't blame the cup as much as my own ignorance in buying fine-ground coffee when even a drunken babboon knows you are only supposed to use coarse ground coffee in a french press.My main problem with this cup is that it has two red `` bodum '' labels as well as the obnoxious phrase `` give up bad coffee for good '' written on it in large white script ( the better to stand out against the dark coffee inside ) . This transforms you into a mobile Bodum advertising unit . The effect is that it feels rather like you are carrying around a cup you picked up for free at a product fair or something and not like you actually paid money for the thing . Since I have almost no shame , I still use it all the time , and just try to hide the most egregious of the writing with my hand . So , even though the cup works and has been good enough to use every day , I am only giving it two stars because I resent paying for the privilege to advertise for a company .	-1
I love loose leaf tea and drink a lot of it . When I began my loose tea adventure , I was delighted to come across this pitcher . What a great idea ! I can make a whole pitcher of tea in one go ! Do n't let the looks or the idea get the better of you . The holes in the diffuser are quite large , and the broken bits of leaf escape , resulting in what I call Debris Tea . Of course , that is really only an aesthetic problem.What makes this product so confounding and disappointing is the long , long narrow shape of the infuser . Wait till you try to clean it . The leaves stubbornly stick inside . I 've tried inverting it and smacking it against my hand - leaves stuck . I 've tried poking a meat fork and long-handled spoons in it . Ca n't get all the leaves out . So of course , I tried rinsing , and rinsing and rinsing . I figured those big holes that let the tea out while it 's brewing would facilitate rinsing the leaves away . I was wrong . I 've tried using small amounts of leaves with the same results . It 's just impossible to clean the infuser . It 's like a Hotel California for tea leaves.Do n't waste a nickel on this nightmare of a product . Bodum does make other teaware that performs satisfactorily , some items quite well .	-1
Do n't buy cordless ! It just does not have enought power to pickup all the dirts . Brought many poor vacuums like Dirt Devil , it was too noise and pickup is very poor .	-1
There is no way the potatoes are having the same crispeness or flavor like the fried ones.And besides the most annoying fact is that , the nonstick coating came off on different places , exposing the aluminum under , and that happend the 4th time after I cleaned it.And I always used my plastic sponge made for cleaning nonstick surfaces.Now , I have to throw it away because of that cheap coating is mixing with the food and might be dangerous.4 batches of potatoe for $ 25 , that is how much I paid for the bakeware.Stupid ! .	-1
After several weeks of use , I 've also found that these sheets tend to burn dough on the bottom long before you see any hint of any browning around the edges . This has caused us problems on several established recipes and the sheets do n't seem to allow for any workaround , i.e . lower oven temperature and/or shorter bake time.Like all Calphalon , they clean up very easily but what 's the point if you ca n't trust them with your food in the first place ? PROS* Extremely reliable nonstick surfaces and durable construction as you 'd expect from CalphalongCONS* Uneven baking results will leave you with lots of `` surprise '' burnt items .	-1
I bought this coffee maker yesterday ... Soon as we got home I read the instruction manual and made a pot of great coffee . My husband was thrilled as the coffee was very hot & he is tired of always having to heat his Capresso made coffee in the microwave.All was well for about 1/2 hour when I noticed the light was off in the bottom of the pot & the on/off display which previously was set with the time was now blank . It just died for no reason.Thought maybe I did something wrong , so I tried to make another pot this morning & the whole unit is dead ... .back it goes , not getting another one either .	-1
Striking looking and unique in design , I had heard from a freind that this unit made really good coffee , so when my old pot died I ordered this one . On the first use it just sat there and boiled the water in the lower pot until my wife used both hands to push down on the upper funnel part . Then on the very first usage the cover for the lower pot broke off and fell to the floor . I find the thing to be really messy to clean . Emptying the grounds is very messy ... I found the solution ( if you can call it that ) to wipe the grounds out with a paper towel . This still leaves some grounds around the filter in the bottom of the funnel and when you pull out the filter to complete cleaning it pops and grounds fly all over . The lower pot is difficult to clean and it 's nearly impossible to wipe out it 's interior . It does have a couple of clever features , but the jury is still out on whether it makes coffee that is better in any way than a conventional pot . It seems like it uses less coffee than other pots , and my coffee so far is too strong and has a murky quality about it that Bodum tells me is better than what I 'm used to . I 'm not quite convinced .	-1
I have had this coffee maker for 3 years . It have problem some time , like brew cold coffee , not working and do n't drip coffee from filter . I am about to say bye to it .	-1
I bought two of these and they were both warped.Here 's why the warp matters ... If you lay it warp up , juices run off of it . If you lay it warp down so juices do n't run off , the rubber ends do n't contact the counter and it just slips and spins.I would say buying one and expecting it to be made right is a gamble .	-1
After entirely TOO much time spent researching which knives to go with ( Wustof or Henckels ) , I went with Wustof on recommendation from a Williams-Sonoma staff person . While the blade cuts nicely and does its job , the construction left a lot to be desired . I had the knife thru two washings and saw rust building up between the handle and full tang of the blade . Now , it 's possible I have a lemon , but when I 'm spending $ 50 per knife , I do n't want to see anything really wrong with it . I do n't want to be responsible for poisoning any dinner guests with rust ! I bought the single knife to test whether I 'd want the whole set , and well , it does n't look like I 'll be splurging .	-1
I have owned this unit for over a year now . It 's useless , the motor is too weak and the battery life is very short . Half the time it ca n't open a can even when it is plug directly into it charger . I have to pull the can out and use a hand opener .	-1
I got this can opener as a gift . On one hand I like the way it takes less space by wall mounting and giving me more space on my countertop . I did n't really like using it that much , it was messy . If you let it cut completely around the can , the lid would pop up and sauces or whativer would splatter , or the lid would fall into the can . We kept the opener on the charger and so never really lost the charge . However , after less than a year the can opener seems charged but does n't have enough power to cut the can after it pierces it - just does n't move . Take it off the can and it seems like it has full power.I would n't recommend it . I got my old electric opener back out .	-1
My brother has one of these and thinks it 's great . After reading the reviews , I was concerned about the battery life , but bought one anyway.The device is a little difficult to get started on a can . My wife , a technophobe , gave up and went back to a manual opener after one try.That would have been bad enough , but the battery , which I tried to keep charged , refused to take a charge after about six months . That was the last straw . The opener and mount went in the trash.Even if it were the best can opener ever ( which it 's not ) , the short battery life makes this a non-starter . Save your money .	-1
I bought a similar product to this about 18 years ago , when my daughter was a baby ; I used it to make baby food . It worked splendidly ! My family used that little food processor for way longer than we expected . However the plastic food canister finally cracked after 18 years of being put through a dishwasher , and I had to say good-bye . I replaced it with this Black and Decker Food Chopper , and after just a few months I got so fed up with design , that I just tossed it in the trash.My issue is n't with the way it chops food , that much it did well . The thing that I could n't deal with was the clean up . The top of the food canister is also the bottom of the motor housing , and whatever it is you are processing gets all over and into these little crevasses . Since this is part of the motorized unit , it is not submersible , and this makes it very difficult to clean.Would not recommend this small appliance .	-1
The design with top controls cumbersome and non-ergonomic to say the least . While it probably chops as well as most mini choppers out there , the difficulties with cleaning outweigh that benefit . The center pin under the blades keeps coming out and if you are not watchful you 'll lose it rendering the machine useless . While it ca n't be compared to full size food processor , I find it can only handle small amounts at a time and chops unevenly at that . My prior Kitchen Aid mini was superior .	-1
I was surprised at how well this chopper does its task , given the low price . I did n't expect it to be quite SO marvelous.I had the little Kitchenaid mini-chopper for many years , but it finally gave out . I got by for a while with the smaller bowl on my big food processor , but that got to be such a bother , what with hauling it out and having to wash the whole big thing . I almost ordered a new chopper from KA , but at half the price , I thought I 'd give this a try.Glad I did . It chops quite a bit better than the more expensive KA chopper . Nice fine pieces , bigger pieces , it 's all under your control with the pulse buttons . KA only had one speed ... .on.This is good and sturdy , easy to clean , easy to store . It chops up a potato so nicely for pan fried taters . Do n't hesitate ! Update 10/10/2013 : Ahh , bowl devolved a crack across the bottom It was still usable for a while , but today a big chip broke off of the spindle holder . Can not recommend any longer . Did n't even last a year . Buying something a little better this time ...	-1
I cut an onion into quarters and dropped it in . The bottom 1/8'th of an inch got pureed , nothing else got touched . You have to chop contents into 1/4 '' bits before you put it in the choppper . When you have to cut things down that small , what 's the point of a machine ?	-1
The description of this chopper clearly states that it has a & # 34 ; safely locking lid & # 34 ; . However , the lid only 'locks ' while you are holding it down and using the chopper . This may be adequate for most people , but I have a disability that makes me very clumsy , and it simply is n't good enough for me . I just think they should be more clear in their description , I hate having to return things , and this was the second chopper I had to return for the same reason !	-1
there 's nothing `` wrong '' with this product , but i 'll tell ya ... it 's small , too small for most uses . and it 's not really any more convenient or easier to clean than a full-sized food processor .	-1
It 's too late to send this back ! ! ( fume ! ! ) This chopper arrived exactly as amazon promised , but I 'd bought it earlier than I needed , as I 'd bought it to puree and chop homemade baby food for my grandson , he is just at the right age now , so I decided to give this chopper it 's first practice run yesterday to chop a few walnut halves to go into the scones I was making ... .first buzz was fine ... ... there was NO second , third or any other buzz ... ..THE WHOLE CHOPPER IS KAPUT , DEAD , DOES NOT WORK AT ALL ! ! ! ! DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ! ! ! !	-1
I was pretty excited when I saw this little processor was available . On the third use of grating cheese , it went silent . I 'm terribly disappointed . I 'll now look for a substitute , but I feel a bit jaded .	-1
I bought this based on excellent reviews . I bought it to chop up chunks of vegetable waste to use in my worm composting bin . I threw in bits of bell peppers , carrots , cabbage , etc . Sometimes it works great , but often times the larger chunks would get caught on the blade instead of being sliced clean through . Then I 'd have to remove the blade , pull the chunk off , and start over.I know some people might blame me for not pre-chopping the bits up small enough , etc , but I also have a Cuisinart mini food-prep processor and it has NO TROUBLE chopping through the same thing . Compared to the Cuisinart , this chopper has less power , the blade is duller , and the chopper ca n't go backwards . I ca n't tell you how handy it is for the blade to go backwards until you get food stuck on a blade and you have to disassemble the thing.The only nice thing I 'd say about this unit is that it has a nice concept -- liquids do n't leak out through the spindle like most other food processors.It is also fairly easy to clean .	-1
I got this because it seemed like it would fit my lifestyle . I 'm a young , single , urban dweller . In other words when I cook it 's generally small portions and I do n't have a McMansion with tons of room for a full sized food processor . In this regard it was a great purchase . It 's got a nice , compact size that does n't take up a ton of space.When I used it , it worked as expected . It chops stuff pretty well . So far so good , right ? But then it broke . The clear container has a little spindle in the bottom center that the blades rest upon . Container cracked , spindle fell out and now the unit is headed for the trash . I 've uploaded a picture so you can see what I 'm talking about . As you 'll see from pics and reviews others experienced this issues as well so this does n't seem to be a stroke of bad luck and does seem to be a design flaw.Why 2 Stars ? I yes , it worked well while it lasted . But I estimate I only got 15 uses out of this making this one very expensive mini food processor . B & D ; does offer a warranty but my unit is out of warranty since it spent most of it 's life sitting in my cabinet .	-1
It is not at all a so called 'chopper ' . Soft food items get pureed and hard ones stay untouched . The picture of vegetables chopped evenly is utterly misleading . The design makes washing this thing a nightmare . The time it takes for cleaning this thing is at least 10 times more than the time taken for chopping vegetables by hand . What a waste ! I could n't even return it because it looked so messy right after first use .	-1
I do n't know why I keep buying Black and Decker stuff . Yes , this coffee maker only cost me $ 17 on sale at Target , but it only lasted about a month . It just stopped working . Push the button , and nothing . I bought another 1 cupper from Brookstone that cost $ 40 , but in the long run it was cheaper because it still works after 6 months and I expect it will last several years.Oh yeah , one more thing . Never use those permanent screen type filters . They make the coffee taste like crap . It is not a filter , but just a device to keep the grounds out of your coffee . To make good coffee , use a natural brown paper filter , like the Melitta # 1 , which fits this and all other 1 cup coffee makers that use cone filters.Update 10/4/2013 : Well , my Brookstone 1 cupper is still working fine . In the long run , it was more of a bargain than the Black and Decker .	-1
I recently stayed in a hotel for a month in which there was a Black & Decker single cup coffee maker . It was great -- this one ( the DCM18 ) is not . The DCM18 produces coffee that is hot , but not VERY hot and I like it VERY hot . So that it is a problem from the start . The DCM is made so that the hot water has to travel through three chambers before dripping into the cup . That means three pieces have to be cleaned -- this is pretty ridiculous . The permanent filter works OK and I 've not found a replacement for this size so I guess when it wears out ( which will not take long as it is plastic mesh ) I 'll have to use # 1 cone paper filters . Another negative is that this maker ( as most of the cheap ones these days ) has the pump connected to the lid so that if the lid is raised it pumps the hot water out onto YOU . None of these negatives existed with the unit in the hotel and my guess is that consumers ca n't buy that unit . It was solid as a rock ( this one is not ) . The DCM also expels a lot of steam at the end of the pumping ( which I know is normal ) . The engeering could have been improved by allowing a place for the steam to escape rather that it simpling blowing out around the edge of the lid causing water to drip down on the counter.So , there are my thoughts . I do n't know that there 's a unit any better than this one that is available to consumers , but I feel this one could be improved with no added manufacturing expense to B & D . ; Think I 'll go have a cup now .	-1
I have used Black & Decker single cup machines for years . I am not a big coffee drinker , and the machines are inexpensive , so I did n't mind having to replace them often because the start switch breaks regularly . However , after repeated switch breakage , I 've reached my limit and am searching for another brand and a switch that is not the press downward , springloaded type . I think it must be the internal spring that breaks . Since this has happened to me for years ( 10+ ) , I ca n't imagine that Black & Decker is n't aware of it , so I suppose they do n't care .	-1
I 've tried different grinds from very fine to very course and they all back up into the coffee maker.Makes a great cup of hot water or perhaps if you use the coffee pods .	-1
It sure sounds like a good idea ! But ... . the lid does n't fit the cup very well , and the coffee drips and sputters everywhere while brewing . I would not buy again	-1
Coffee maker was nice and small , but mug does not close all the way and can spill easily .	-1
I bought this thinking the cup would be bigger , and it would be a great way to make one cup at a time . Normal cups do not fit under the drip portion . Do not like the travel mug .	-1
The mug is lined with plastic , is too small , and is a strange shape that does n't fit my car cup holders . You ca n't use your own larger mug with it .	-1
The thing stinks . It leaves coffee grinds that get into the water holder so you have to clean it all the time . And the grinds get caught and clog where it dispenses the water into the cup so the coffee ca n't get into the cup.I was past the return date so I threw the junk out . Its cheap and ya pay for what you get . It stinks .	-1
Owned one of these for over ten years , worked great . The one I bought last year , terrible ... Not stable , does n't sit flat . Coffee grounds overflow into water reservoir and back up into holes where water drips down into filter.update 4-9-2014 ... being offered a replacement/refund by manufacturer ( ? ) , opted for refund ... like I said , loved the one I had years ago , maybe this one came from a defective batch	-1
I purchased the version with the plastic mug back in 2007 and used it on average two or three times a day for years without a single problem so when contractors working on my home dropped a cabinet on my poor little Brew 'n Go and crushed it I did n't hesitate to order another -- this time with the stainless steel mug which was n't available when I ordered my first one . Imagine my disappointment when , after three weeks of use , the plastic interior of the stainless steel thermal mug cracked allowing liquid to seep into the space between the plastic and stainless steel walls . Since I assume this also means that liquid that has been between the walls for some period of time can also seep back into the cup where my beverage would be -- along with whatever has been growing in there -- I tossed the cup . Apparently the cup was not designed for you to brew a hot beverage into it , although that is its stated purpose . I never dropped the cup and always washed it by hand so it was n't misuse that caused the problem.I continued to use the coffee maker with my old plastic mug from my previous Brew 'n Go and then three months later ( 4 months total use ) the coffee maker stopped working . I filled it with water one morning , pushed down on the on switch and ... nothing ; no light , no heat , nobody home.Even though this product worked fine for a few weeks and then worked without the included mug for a few more months and it was n't really expensive I certainly expected it to work for more than four months total and even if I had registered the product and saved my warranty card I 'm not sure it would be worth my time and trouble to return it for a replacement . I do n't know what changed at Black & Decker since I bought my trusty Brew 'n Go back in 2007 but it ca n't have been good.I recently bought a Melita plastic cone that sits on top of a mug through which one pours not-quite boiling water through coffee grounds and a filter . No more coffee makers for me .	-1
Thought this would be a good idea for a single person , but its just a badly designed product that B & D knows is junk and will not do anything about it . I have the same probelm with coffee grounds spilling over the top of the coffee basket and getting into the coffee cup , the water holder , etc . Instead of just cleaning out the basket each day , you must unplug the entire unit and wash it out under the sink as coffee grounds are everywhere . Contacted B & D and they sent a new filter , but the problem is the filter needs to be redesigned to solve the situation . SAVE YOUR MONEY , YOU WILL JUST END UP THROWING THIS OUT OR NOT USING IT .	-1
As I am the only one who drinks regular coffee in my family , I bought this for my cup of joe to take to work . Although it brewed an okay cup of coffee and kept it warm for a fairly long period of time , the machine quit functioning less than 30 days after I bought it . I was tempted to buy another one because of the low price , but I decided against doing so for fear that I would need to replace it again in three weeks .	-1
I bought this for the mornings when I 'm the only one drinking coffee , and I only need one cup , which happens frequently at my house.I am extremely dissappointed in this coffee maker . The filter basket is way too small . I like strong coffee , but I ca n't add more than one tablespoon of coffee grounds or it will overflow and I end up with coffee grounds in my cup . Also the coffee I buy is very finely ground and with the filter some of the grounds always end up in the cup even if it does not overflow . When it overflows the grounds end up being stuck on the lid of the coffee maker and sometimes even end up in the water reservoir . It is a pain to clean.The only thing I find this works well for is if I need hot water for a cup of tea or some hot chocolate . This is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one . Still disappointing though since that 's not what I bought it for.If you do n't drink strong coffee and your coffee grounds are fairly coarse then this may work for you . For me it was a complete waste of money and sits in the pantry most of the time .	-1
The coffeemaker continues to drip at a steady rate after you think it 's done brewing . The grounds are a mess to clean up and I ca n't seem to get a strong cup of coffee from it , so I reverted back to doing a pour over . My electric water kettle heats in seconds and the process is actually faster than this Black and Decker Brew 'n Go . I could not recommend this product .	-1
I bought this little coffee maker to keep at my sister 's house when I 'm visiting . Since they do n't drink coffee , they do n't have/need one ... plus I wanted to keep a small footprint.Simply put , the mug was worthless and would n't keep my coffee warm for more than a few minutes . The entire thing felt cheaply made and it took forever to make a cup of coffee.I 'll admit that maybe my expectations of this product were unrealistic due to being used to my Keurig , but I simply was n't happy with this product .	-1
I , as my wife says , am a coffee snob . I wanted something that I could use for travel . The concept is great . I like the fact that it brews directly into a mug for you . The mug , however , is not insulated . Kind of a down fall . The coffee maker is pretty fast , which can be great for someone who is in a hurry , however I prefer the & # 34 ; Bold & # 34 ; setting on my Cuisinart at home . With the bold feature , the water drips in slower than regular setting . This may be the down fall for this coffee maker . I have yet to have a cup of coffee out of this machine that did n't have significant amounts of coffee grounds . I always have a little sediment in the bottom of my pot at home due to the way I like my grind , however this was actual coffee grounds . I finally took a big gulp of grinds last weekend , and that was it for me . I immediately ordered an 8 cup Bodum French Press and an electric kettle . I should have just did this in the beginning . Oh well.I 'm not one to bash a product like some you see on here . This does have it 's purpose , however for someone who 's traveling and wants a nice consistent cup of coffee , this is not it . I 've tried less grounds , coarser grinds , you name it and it does n't seem to help . I tried to send it back but it 's now too late . Oh well . On the positive side , it was only $ 18 and change so I 'm not at a huge loss by any means .	-1
Oh yes it worked great for about 3 months . Now it wo n't open anything . its fully charged and runs fine with no cans . but latch it on to a can and it does nothing . Waste of money-do n't get this can opener , tons of others out there .	-1
I have this can opener and it is a real disappointment . It does n't pierce the cans reliably and often stops halfway around . It works , most of the time , but it 's terribly annoying . And it 's even difficult to get it straight in the base so it will recharge -- plus the base is very light weight so it tips over . I had a different model of walk-around-the-can opener from GE ( which became Black and Decker ) before -- it wore out eventually -- which worked a whole lot better . I do n't open a lot of cans , but when you need a can opener it should work . It 's not brain surgery .	-1
I am now on my third of these can-openers . I am trying to resist buying another . All three of mine have had the same problem . The cutter/lid holder piece has cracked on all three . The last one lasted longer than the others at 2 years but I really do n't feel you should have to replace a can-opener every 1-2 years . I had no trouble at all with anything else about the opener.Guess I 'll try the Krups someone suggested .	-1
to anyone who may have bought this piece of junk based on my previous review.Why it 's junk:1 . Quit working after very light use after only 3 months2 . Poorly designed charging unit . Must line up METICULOUSLY with charger unit to recharge.3 . Unit does n't easily fit to open ANY can . Must DIDDLE with it constantly.4 . Cutting head falls off if you even look at it.5 . When opener does engage to open a can , the opener is under powered.6 . Makes regular cans top heavy when on can . Can falls over . Must constantly hold everything . Not necessary when I used & quot ; conventional & quot ; counter top can openers.7 . Cordless can openers are just a gimick . They do n't work better , nor offer any advantage over conventional old style openers . That may change when some thought is applied to the disign so that it may work correctly.Again , not withstanding losing helpful votes , I felt it necessary to apologize for my earlier review that may have encouraged others to buy this item.John Row	-1
This is the latest in a series of lousy electric can openers in my kitchen , and will probably be my last . The battery on this unit allows you to open about four cans before needing a recharge . Just forget about opening anything large like a coffee can or a # 10 can.One good thing about it is that it is easy to clean . The blade assembly , like on many other units , can be placed in the dishwasher .	-1
I 'm not sure if Black & amp ; Decker ever tested this Can Opener because it does n't work . The blade is spring loaded and 1/2 the time it will not puncture the can , regardless of the type of can . We previously had a under-cabinet Black & amp ; Decker and it worked just fine and that 's what we are going back to .	-1
We bought one a few months ago and it seems to be slowly dying already and wo n't hold a charge . I already have to replace it . Most of the other can openers we have bought in the past lasted for years , not just a few months .	-1
The can does n't sit flush against the can opener so you have to force it by pushing the can around . It 's pretty much crap .	-1
I initially gave this product 4 out of 5 stars , as it arrived elegant and a mini-copy of the larger sturdy bartender 's openers.Well , I now change this review to only 2 stars . After months , but only about 12 cans actually opened , the flimsy plastic handle guard ( plastic ) broke and now you must depress the broken handle to engage the opener . This is not safe and not usable.SO , however nice looking and affordable the opener is , I would only buy it for very occasional use . If you want it , like most of us , for a kitchen , or even a wet bar , there are other better opener choices on Amazon . Look for as much metal as you can , because the opener design requires the user to depress , with force , the handle to puncture the can before it is opened.After 70 years , you 'd think they 'd have a push button can opener for us ... you would think ...	-1
Inexpensive ? Yes . Cheap ? Yes . Cheaply manufactured ? Yes . The cutting assembly continually falls off . Be careful when pressing down on the cutting lever or the assembly will fall off . If you 're careful and it does n't fall off , but you apply too much pressure , the 'cheap ' plastic lever will break . Tall cans do n't fit . You get what you pay for . My advice is to spend a couple of extra bucks and get a larger , better built unit .	-1
I purchased this to replace my older model of this same brand since the magnetic thing broke . This can opener is much shorter , very difficult to place the can under the blade ( must constantly fiddle to make it fit ) and it makes the most horrible noise as if the motor is loose . I am glad that I did n't throw my other one away because I doubt this will last but only a few months.UPDATE Feb 2014 : Yes , I threw this awful machine in the trash a few weeks ago and dug out my older model . What a waste of money ! ! It could barely open any can without me having to push the can around and the blade was so dull that even that did n't always work . Thank goodness I had the good sense to keep my older model- I will live without the magnet just fine . I would not recommend this piece of junk to anyone for any purpose.Also , the quality of my older machine is so much better . It is solid , heavy and does n't feel like a cheap piece of plastic with lots of air and loose motor parts inside of it .	-1
The can would not open automatically , so I had to stand and hold it down for it to cut all the way around , when it finally worked.My old Hamilton Beach worked great for 9 years , but the cutter broke . Unfortunately , not the same cutter , so I ca n't switch.I did hunt around the web and found another Hamilton Beach , same model , so I ordered that .	-1
I can not seem to get a can to go on this thing without a struggle . No matter the can , the size the weight ... there is just something that does not make it easy to use ! And that was my very PURPOSE for buying an electric one finally . I have RA/Lupus and other bad issues with my hands , thus I thought this would solve my problems opening cans . No most of the time , it is just too much aggravation so I use the old hand crank one . I thought about just going and buying a new one of those and be done with it . I am usually NOT ONE to complain , rarely , very , rarely , but this is just not good .	-1
I have owned a Proctor Silex can opener for several years and the 2 weeks ago the magnetic lid holder broke off . Actually this item does not get a lot of use as I open just one can of cat food with it in the basement every day . Other times I use the flip off covers for feeding . Anyway I wanted a replacement and ordered this item . Upon setting up I tested it with a can of cat food and immediately ran into problems . It would not open the can automatically instead I had to hold the lever down to get the can open and on top of that even after removing the can the motor continued to run . I am returning it . It is almost not worth buying anything in this day and age .	-1
I can not get the can where it is supposed to cut the lid . even my husband tried to position the can correctly and could n't either . all my husband and i could do with this opener is shred the paper on the can . I donated it to the veterans administration in a pick up with other things donated .	-1
I canceled the order after reading some of the reviews , it didnt seem like a good one after i read about it .	-1
The large glasses are ridiculously large so they are not functional . One of the large and one of the small glasses in my shipment were factory defective . The large glass has a defect on the drinking rim which looks like a chip only it is n't sharp . The small glass looks like it was n't trimmed and polished from being molded . There is a thin sharp extended piece on the bottom . I like the shape of the glasses and they are pretty but with 2 defective out of 16 glasses , quality control is not what it should be .	-1
These are a bit too fragile for those who rush around in the kitchen or have teens . I bought these for my son to set up his first kitchen . He says the bottom of the glass is not smoothly flat so does n't set well . He has broken a few .	-1
I love Fiesta dishes and have a lot ! I ordered 2 of these thinking they would be great for a small pie . Well they are the size of a soup bowl and way to small for a pie . I returned both , if I want to make a pie this size I will use my soup bowl for pot pies . The quality was good it was just the size that did not work for what I wanted .	-1
I bought this maker because I had a very similar one that was just perfect and incredibly durable . Same model , more or less . First , none of the enclosed literature or box says anything about automatic 2 hour shut-off . I have n't tested it ( for reasons I 'll describe below ) , but I 'm not sure this actually has that feature , which is one of the most important ones to me.The brewed coffee is very very hot . The warming plate is very very hot . If you do n't get your cup immediately , it 's burned burned burned.I hate this so much I 'm going to literally throw it away . I would n't give it to anyone or sell at a garage sale .	-1
There was the occasional pot of very good , very hot coffee . That kept me trying for a long time . But there were more bad pots than good . I really tried to time it carefully and follow the directions exactly and frankly was baffled that the outcomes were not consistent . Eventually I decided it was too iffy and too much work , particularly when caffeine-deprived at the crack of dawn . Back to my aero-press .	-1
I should have known this coffee pot would be no good just by the photo . Tea pots I have bought have the same fatal flaw . It 's the design-they have designed it to be two piece for no good reason that I can think of . Pots are one piece-so , I know the steel can be shaped as one piece.I have been drinking instant coffee-tased good to me . Actually , my daughter after tasting the instant coffee was surprised at how good it tasted-as my brother . But , I started to mull over the healthiness of instant coffee . I decided brewed coffee might be healthier and tastier.So , I went out and bought organic coffee-pre ground and proceeded to find a method to brew that would be reasonably priced and still be healthy.I 'd thrown out my mr. coffee machine , because it was plastic a while ago-ca n't be healthy.I 'd read reviewers stating the cap of the farberware pot was not actually glass but plastic-so , i bought the glass top seperately , even though the attachment base was aluminum-which causes altzheimers.I could hardly contain myself when the coffee pot came in and followed directions-washed all the items with soapy water , changed the plastic cap , added the coffee & water , etc . It did n't smell like I thought the coffee should but ok-I tasted it and it was awful.Angry at myself , at the pot , etc . I repacked it and having prime , it would cost me nothing to return it but the labor.But , it bothered me-why was it so awful-then it dawned on me , the awful design.There is a bubble on the bottom of the pot . I took the coffee pot out and examined it . Saw the bubbled out bottom and used a Q-tip to reach into that small space on the bottom rim . Wiped the Q-tip round part of the rim and LO and behold , it was filthy , The entire bubbled out rim was filthy.They must polish the steel but not the indentation or the polishing residue ends up there . I was actually expecting rust to be there , as some of the teapots had.The Q-tip sort of worked but even if it did , I could not see what was in there-so , I repacked it.But it bothered me , so , I showed it to someone else to get there opinion-I really wanted the coffee pot.I changed the cap , again-added the coffee and water-am standing by the pot after the gas is lit and wait for it to boil.The pot starts to drip dirty water from the bottom seam.It was that charcoal gray stuff-2 large drops went on the white ceramic of the stove . Inside the water seemed clear.Pretty unbelievable , even my cheap teakettles did not drip -let alone filthy gray water.The water drip cleared up , after i changed the water and tried , again . It still leaked once i lit the gas stove , a bit -it boilled on the side.I am blaming the designer ( s ) of these two piece coffe and tea kettles , not the manufacturers.There lousy design is poisening us . Maybe , the designers and manufacturers are one and the same.For $ 19. , I should still get a non poisenous , working coffee pot but I would pay more.How much can it cost to make it a one piece unit-like a normal pot ? How much more can it cost to have a glass top with stainless steel instead of aluminum base attachment to hold it in place , and not a small plastic top ?	-1
I purchased this pot because the one I used was my Moms and was so old that the handle crumbled off . I was so used to using that pot that I did n't think I could find another one I liked as much . I have been looking around for quite some time and have n't found one . I purchased this one because of the reviews it got . I do n't like it . The actual pot is nice . But there are some things I do n't like at all . The inside of the pot where you put the coffee , the basket part . Too deep and narrow . Everytime I spoon the coffee in if I do n't really go slow and pay attention it goes right in the hole . I also do n't like the spring . I never used a spring ever all the years I have made coffee and I do n't like it . What if you loose that little spring ? you ca n't make coffee ? I am still going to use it until I find one that I like . I really want one with a larger wider basket .	-1
This caused a huge mess on my electric range ! I cleaned it the moment I received it and followed the instructions to make some coffee and then went to do other things when I started hearing some strange noises & smelling a weird smell I went to check on it and it was leaking BIG TIME ! ! ! I contacted Amazon & returned it for a refund .	-1
For some reason , the handle was wrapped separately from the pot . There 's a screw in the handle , but no hole in the pot for a screw so I can actually attach it . Am I supposed to drill a hole and hope the screw is long enough ? Do n't think so -- this item will be returned tomorrow .	-1
After about two weeks of use , there is rust clearly showing on the bottom side of the lid , which supposedly is made of `` stainless steel '' , as the entire percolator allegedly is.Also a note that did not affect my rating of this product , but did affect my overall satisfaction with this purchase . The `` $ 20 Rebate Available '' , as shown on the product page at the time of my purchase , as well as at the time of this writing , is a scam . No rebate comes in with the shipment and after inquiring about it thorugh the Amazon.com Customer Service , I was directed to a website , where there is a $ 20 rebate coupon available for those who buy $ 150 worth of Faberware products . In other words , NO REBATE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PrODUCT ! IT 'S AN ADVERTISING SCAM ! It did not affect my rating , since I am unable to prove that this is a Faberware 's scam . It could be retailers ' - either Amazon 's or Target 's fault . Otherwise , my whole satisfaction with this transaction is zero .	-1
I bought this percolator because the reviews were excellent , but I was unhappy with the unattractive/bulky look and the several parts that I had to take apart to wash every time I used it . Needless to say , I 'm getting rid of it and getting myself a french presser instead .	-1
This kettle is a hand-me-down from my brother . It was barely used and had been in storage for several years . After one use , I knew why my brother abandoned it . It should 've been thrown into the recycling bin immediately . The first thing I noticed after washing it down thoroughly inside and out was the presence of a strange black goo clinging to the whistle hole . I poked out the slime with a chopstick , then filled the kettle with new water to see if there was more of the stuff . After shaking around the pot , I noticed more strings of goo . The goo was definitely not dust , but some kind of residue from the manufacturing process . Maybe some kind of sealant.My mom boiled some water with it and complained that the handle got very hot . The lid was also improperly secured and fell off when she tried to pour , scorching herself with steam . Other kettles I 've used are filled through the spot , with no removable lids , which I prefer because of safety.The trigger-styled lid opening mechanism is ok , but not as easy or intuitive to use , but that 's a minor consideration considering the fatal defect of the handle heating up . Avoid this kettle . It 's dangerous and very poorly designed . Made in Thailand .	-1
I really like Farberware products . The tea kettles pull handle would stick..making it very hard to use . It is a large kettle , very heavy duty . Will last someone a life time . It would be an ideal kettle if the pull handle worked easily . It may be I just received a defective one . The return was easy .	-1
I really expected this to be a quality item but I am very much disappointed . It makes a funny noise the moment I turn on the heat to boil water and it ROARS and sputters water if I allow it to whistle , no matter how much water I put in it . There is a lip around the bottom of the kettle that collects black 'crud ' and has to be cleaned on a regular basis . I would not recommend this kettle even though it has a nice appearance .	-1
This kettle was the worst kettle we ever owned . The handle got super hot . The plastic broke . The biggest thing is this kettle took for ever to heat up . In the morning you want to get out the door . This kettle would start to boil by the time you got to work . One thing , get a kettle with a copper bottom I 'm not going to name any products in this review but Paul Revere was a great hero of mine . I love tea . For those that do n't really understand copper is a great conductor , thats why its in the wire in your home . Heat and electricity are both forms of energy what would you want boiling your tea stainless steel ... HA ! No Way !	-1
Do not buy this poacher ! ! There has to be something better than this out there . I bought mine at Bed , Bath , & Beyond . Similar price.Cons : -Handle is not insulated - so you need an oven mit to touch it-Knob on top of pan is not insulated - so you need an oven mit to touch it-Egg cups are plastic so it takes WAY longer to cook eggs than with metal cups-Egg cups have small diameter making the eggs to small to fit on typical english muffins.-Pan is super cheap metal and super thin . I 'd never use it to cook any real food because of its thinness-Water collects in the cup - maybe dripping off top of lid ? Not sure how it 's getting in there.Pros : Ca n't think of any.This is the most poorly thought out egg poacher I 've ever used . I used to use my mom 's all the time . Very similar design - so I thought . Hers has metal cups the same diameter as an english muffin . It would take about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes to make two eggs . I 've tried 4 minutes , 6 minutes and 7 minutes with this one so far - all times made eggs too runny . I had to use just as much butter with these plastic cups to keep the eggs from sticking as my mom 's 40+ year old model that is not non-stick.Burned my fingers taking lid off - who puts metals knobs on pans these days ? ? ? Ca n't get little plastic cups out of pan with oven mit on . They are too hot for bare fingers . I do n't have tongs yet . So frustrating ! ! More than a table spoon of water comes out of the cup when you try to tip it onto your english muffin ( Yuck ! ) Takes FOREVER for eggs to cook . In the end they are too tall and not wide enough to sit on an english muffin and go sliding off the muffin . ( Sometimes it will slip off the muffin and plate if you try to carry your breakfest on a tray somewhere . It 's NOT fun cleaning runny egg off a carpet ! ! ) DO NOT BUY THIS - any of the other models I 've looked at on Amazon appear to be better thought out . I should have looked here first .	-1
I wish I had read these reviews before buying this . They 're pretty much on the money . The cup frame is very thin and flimsy . The cups are small , but at least they 're a bit deeper than most other poachers . And it 's those cups where this really fails . All the metal is non-stick , but the parts that NEED to be non-stick , the cups , are plastic . If you do n't oil them , you will NOT be able to get the eggs out in one piece . Another problem is that the cups do n't transfer heat very well . The tops of the eggs will cook firm ( from the steam captured by the lid ) but the bottom of the eggs are still liquid . My old all-metal poacher cooked eggs just the way I like them in 3 min , 30 secs . After 6 minutes , the bottom of the eggs were still liquid , which I had to sop up off the place with a paper towel . My old poacher is a second-hand Fagor , and the cups ' non-stick coating was damaged by the original owner , so I 've been trying out replacements . This is n't it .	-1
This one of the most difficult non-stick items I 've ever encountered - even when treated with cooking spray . I must say it heats up nicely , but I HATE cleaning it . It will be yard sale item soon .	-1
Mine warped within a year . Very light , shifted over my burners while I was trying to cook - drove me crazy . Easy clean up , however , the worst part is - it 's coated aluminum . I would recommend a cast iron griddle . I bought one and love it .	-1
I bought this grill few years ago and figured it would work out great to cook meat . But it always left hard to remove stuck on food to surface . It also can not be scrubbed hard without removing non stick coating but to remove coating even though the coating did not help . It also turned brown and dicolored by the 2nd use . I returned product figuring it was defect in coating but next one did exact same . I would say pass on this product . Go for the lodge cast iron grill sold on amazon . Unlike this alum coated grill its a good hard surface that a good steel wool cleaning pad would clean off without hurting surface easy plus cast iron is a better heatig surface to cook on.I learned my lesson as I see others have commented as I have . Dont you be one to learn our lessons .	-1
Absolutely everything sticks to this griddle no matter what we use to grease the surface , and no matter what temperature we use . What 's worse is that the oil/butter/spray/etc . we added actually bonded to the griddle , so a sticky residue developed around the edges , even after soaking it to clean it . In a surprisingly short period of time , the finish began to flake off into the food . Convinced that surely DH or I had done something to cause the failure , I trashed the first one , and replaced it with exactly the same item - Shame on me ! I babied the second one , but it was just as awful , and in less time than the first , the finish ( which never was non-stick ) started flaking . We have never gotten a good batch of pancakes ( or anything else ) from this piece of Nordic Ware.Finally , I wised up and purchased a Lodge cast iron grill-griddle ( preseasoned ) . With proper seasoning and care , the iron is absolutely non-stick , and so easy to clean . I am very happy with the Lodge griddle . But this one is REALLY AWFUL ! PLEASE LEARN FROM MY PURCHASING MISTAKES AND AVOID THIS ITEM ; IT IS NOT NON-STICK	-1
I washed the griddle prior to using it to fry an egg . I used some olive oil on the griddle . The coating stuck to the egg when I turned the egg over . The coating is not non-stick . After several uses there are four spots where the coating has `` ripped '' off . I used the grill to cook hamburgers once and I will go back to using my contact grill . Cooking the burgers is not as quick or easy as the contact grill is . To top off my disappoitment when put on the stove today I found that it had become warped . When I want to cook pancakes next time I will use my 50+ year old cast iron griddle .	-1
and it warps even at medium low heat for 5 minutes . Always hard to clean . I have had it for 5 years now and now I realize I should have bought a new one , this time , I am getting Lodge .	-1
Use it the first time to grill some steak . I put vegetable oil all over and food stuck to the coating like hell and it looks worser than my 20 year old charcoal grill . This is not non-stick even the product say it is . What a rip off . Read some of the comments here that it can only be used on low heat and need to soak overnight to clean . Am I reading this wrong , a stove top grill plate that can only use on low heat ? What a piece of junk . My $ 10 non stick saute pan work better than that and it cleans off easily . I am throwing this junk away . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT . IT IS A RIP OFF . WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE .	-1
spend your precious cash elsewhere . this item will languish for 99 % of it 's life . get a nice french press or stovetop espresso maker instead . looks fancy , coffee is mediocre . not worth the money .	-1
I have to take it to have it repaired everytime I use it.It works great , when it works.I was told to run a whole tank of water thru it to make sure the water lines stayed clean for the next use but it did n't help.The very first time I used it the belt broke within 5 minutes . I have had nothing but trouble with it . Very disappointed !	-1
This machine worked very nice the first two times I used it . Then , like so many other customers , my unit quit spaying . Sure enough , I took mine apart like those before me , and the heater was plugged up with lime and calcium . Terrible design flaw . Rather than attempting to fix it , I bypassed the heater with a piece of my own tubing . It works great now , minus the `` extra-hot '' water . If you buy this , use ONLY distilled water in the one gallon tank . The manufacturer should have thought of this . One nice thing I will say about the 1699. . . it IS powerful and picks up a lot of deep down dirt .	-1
I agree with many of the other reviews -- when this machine works , it does the job fairly well . However , it is not well-built and mine failed just after the warranty ran out , after only 4 uses . Repair is $ 50 per hour in our area and I do n't want to invest more in a machine that I think is not well-engineered or well-made . Consumer Reports rates the Hoover ahead of the Bissell , but just slightly . I 'm not sure they have perfected this technology !	-1
The first thing I noticed was that the unit is almost completely made out of plastic . For durability reasons , I do n't like a whole lot of plastic . Plastic things break easily.Also , my little brother moved the steam machine ( he 's not the most careful person ) , but regardless , the thing that you step on to release the top part of the unit so you can push the unit ( the little step bar ) was screwed up and now it does n't work . I 've tried to take it apart to fix it , but I think it would need to be done at a service center . It was made out of cheap plastic.This unit uses a ton of cleaning fluid and the water reservoir is n't that great . It is a smart tank ( the clean water goes into a plastic membrane . The dirty water goes back into the container but on the outside of the membrane . Great idea to save space , but I wish there were 2 separate compartments that could hold more stuff.The cleaning power of the machine is average . I believe a shampooer will get deeper into the fibers of the carpet . Also , those machines you can rent from the grocery store are a lot more powerful . They do n't heat the water up , but what 's the use of using very hot water when the machine does n't clean that great ? By the way , the carpets that we cleaned are heavy traffic areas . The rental machines do a much better job . For the people who rated this machine highly , their carpets must not be that dirty.If you are looking for a steam cleaner , I would recommend that you do not buy this one or any other one for that matter unless you are willing to spend [ price ] and get a commercial grade cleaner . You figure it only costs [ price ] a pop to rent a machine . I doubt you will steam clean your carpets more than once a year so I think the rentals will suffice .	-1
I 've had my Orek since 1998 without any problems . I bought the Hoover Windtunnel Ultra Self-Propelled ( on the recommendation of my sister and sister-in-law ) 2 years ago , and this is the third time it needs to be serviced . The first two times it was under warranty -- the first time was because the carpet-height tabs broke off ( which I was then told happens frequently ) ; and then because the vacuum was n't picking up . Not sure how they fixed it -- it may have been a belt.Now the Embedded dirt light is not working -- it 's staying on red/dirty . It may be a gimmick-type feature , but I 'd prefer that it work.Maybe the Orek has lasted so long because there are n't so many features . In any case , it 's dependable , easy to use and light weight . The Hoover Windtunnel is VERY heavy -- if you 're not using the self-propelled feature.One thing I will say ... when it works , it does seem to work well .	-1
Does a great job at heating and frothing but it is very difficult to keep clean and was way too big on the counter . It broke eventually and I bought a different kind of frother .	-1
I bought my first Smoothie Pro at the end of October . At the end of January , the inside blades quit turning . We sent it back to the company . After nearly six weeks , several emails and phone calls , we received a replacement . Yeah ! We 've had it for exactly three weeks today . It died last night . Hit the & quot ; mix & quot ; button -- nothing . Completely dead , ca n't revive it . And then the flip on the spigot broke while we were washing it . We 've used it maybe 8 or 9 times.I hope I get my money back .	-1
This blender blended the smoothies very well . However , the vibrations of the machine caused the jar to shake itself off the gear assembly , causing the plastic gears on the top of the machine and at the bottom of the jar to wear down until it became unusable . It lasted about 2 months ( 60 smoothies ) and ended in the trash since the repairs would be about the same , or more than a new one . It would be a great little machine if the plastic was replaced with metal parts . But alas , manufacturers want you to go out and buy another one . I have refused to buy any blender with plastic parts , and when someone makes one I will pay gladly their asking price .	-1
The whisk was describes as an 8 inch whisk but it is not . It looked smaller so I measures it and it turned out to only be 6 3/4 inches with a 1/2 inch hanger on the end of handle . The actual whisk part is not tall enough ( only 3 inches ) . I was looking for something taller as one would expect for an 8 inch whisk . Disappointed customer	-1
You can watch ads on tv a chef using a similar one and praising it because he does n't have to get out a mixer.Well you still have to get out your mixer .In my case I broke 2 eggs and put them in a small bowl , then started pushing up and down .Unlike the tv ads , I had to move my wrist around like I was using a fork .What an ungodly mess , some of the yolk wound up on the side of the bowl just sticking there , so I lost some of the egg.Folks when I tell you it would be easier to use a fork or better yet a whisk .Final analysis , a fancy gadget with lots of promise but delivers nothing , a total waste of money and for what , frustration ? .I 'm sending it back , my wife does n't want it in the kitchen , because it just takes space and does nothing .I had just given this 2 stars and feel guilty about that , I just changed it to 1 star.1/6/2012Update , god forbid you have to return it these scumbags , they make it painful for you .First I had to pay $ 4.55 shipping and then they knocked off another $ 4 + for what I do n't know .First they put out a crappy product and penalize you 3 times .Buy at your risk.However Amazon is coming through for me making sure I 'm not out of any money.They are so bad.1/11/2014Be forewarned these parasites may offer easy returns , but they are not easy , in fact they are nothing short than a swindle , like heads we win tails we also win .Either way you get screwed .Why do I say this , I paid these skunks $ 14 , they made me pay $ 4 to reimburse them for that free shipping which turned up to not be free.I had to pay $ 4 to ship it back to them , and they paid me back $ 10 .So for a $ 14 item I only got a net refund of $ 6 .I say to you stay away from them.Not only do they sell shoddy goods , they take you to the cleaners if you need to return the item.This product is useless , save yourself the aggravation dealing with them .	-1
but I do n't think this spatula is worth the $ 14.99 I paid for it . It is not `` non stick '' for me , even my eggs stick to it . It 's not the right angle for me - the little lip at the front is annoying and I just found a spatula shaped exactly the same at target and they called it a `` fish turner . '' Anyhow , I 'm still on the search for a spatula I love as much as my old one ... that they do n't make anymore , of course ! I would not buy this spatula .	-1
Not long enough for what I wanted . We use them for deep fry . This one was way to short and could n't do the job .	-1
I got it for my wife , it was too shallow and did n't hold much , so she did n't want to use it.It looks nice and might be OK for some other uses , but she mostly would have used it forscooping out bowls of soup , and it would have just held far too little.We sent it back . ( We means me ! ; & # 62 ; )	-1
This is a pain to use . If you tighten it , it 's hard to use and makes unpleasant , squeaky noises . If you loosen it , it seems to loosen itself further . There 's one position of the top nut where it seems to minimally function , and it 's a constant battle to find that place . I do n't recommend it , but I 'm using it until I can find something else .	-1
I am usually a big fan of OXO products and have many of their other cooking/baking utensils . I was thrilled to see that OXO made a rolling pin . It 's something that I have n't had much use for previously , but since I wanted to make large batches of cookies for friends and family this Christmas , I decided I should invest in one.The biggest things that gravitated me toward this product was that it was made by OXO and that it was a non-stick , heavy rolling pin . However , once I used it with multiple batches of various cookie dough , I was a saddened to experience the dough would often stick to the pin , making rolling an unpleasant and frustrating experience.It should be noted that I put flour on the dough and on the pin ( although , since it 's a non-stick surface , the flour did n't really stick to the pin ) . Maybe I am just a bad `` dough-roller '' ? In any case , this does n't sway me away from OXO products in the future , but I think I 'll need to get a different rolling pin for future rolling endeavors .	-1
Sure , flour never stuck to this rolling pin , but do you know what did ? Everything I was ever rolling out ! Pie crust , cookie dough , biscuits , cinnamon bun dough , you name it ! This was the first rolling pin I ever bought . I decided on it because it was nonstick ( how could anything stick to something nonstick ) , dishwasher safe , and I had a Bed Bath and Beyond coupon ( a motivating force behind goodness knows how many questionable kitchen purchases of mine ) . Well , yes , it is nonstick coated , and yes , I did save 20 % off the purchase price , but I would actively dread using this rolling pin . When Christmas started getting close , I would , no lie , think about how much I was going to hate rolling out cookies . The barrel filled with water in the dishwasher and took quite a while to dry out . It did not roll as smoothly as I would have liked , and I still had to really press into cold dough to get it to roll out properly ( only to have said dough stick to the rolling pin , so I guess it did n't matter ) . I also somehow managed to get a massive dent in it near the handle . Still not sure how that happened , but it made using it even more fun . Finally , I recently broke and bought a new wooden rolling pin , and my baking life has since dramatically improved . If your top priority is dishwasher-safeness , then yes , buy this rolling pin . If ease and pleasure in use is your top priority , look elsewhere .	-1
It looks good , feels heavy but does a terrible job of blending . I think the reason is due to the shape of the glass . The blender that this one replace was an Oster and its glass sides were sloped like a funnel channeling material down towards the blades . This one has a tube shape so you can sit there and blend for literally 5min , which is a long time , and still have chunks of ice cubes in your drink.Pass on this product . Look for something w/a funnel shaped glass container .	-1
I bought this blender primarily to make smoothies and occasional other uses . The first time I used it for a smoothie , it took and inordinate amount of time to make them -- 10 minutes maybe -- with me having to stop the blender every 10 seconds or so to push the ingredients back down to the bottom . So annoying and time consuming ! I read the manual to make sure I was n't doing something wrong -- I was n't . The second test was to chop chicken for chicken salad . It pulverized it -- practically liquefied it -- before it got around to chopping all the pieces . I could have done it much faster and with much less clean-up with a knife and cutting board . The third time I used it , for smoothies again , I decided to add less ingredients at a time to see if that would work better . I added about a cup and a half of frozen fruit and some milk , meanwhile mentioning to my husband that I was thinking of returning the blender because of its pathetic performance . About 20 seconds into chopping the fruit up , we heard a strange whirring noise . Checked the blender and the teeth had been chopped off . Annoying , but I 'm glad in a way because at least I wo n't have to deal with this aggravating blender anymore !	-1
The blender seems to be high quality when first inspected but upon using has major problems . There is a loud grinding sound . The jar assembly does not align correctly with the motor base . I 've been sent a new blade assembly and even a whole new unit to no avail . It 's powerful and heavy duty , too bad they skimped on design or manufacturing controls !	-1
I purchased this knife along with another Global sushi knife at the same time . Both blades chipped within 2 years of use.The balance and sharpness of this knife is great , but it just does n't survive over time . Little flakes of metal chip off the blade and give it a nasty serrated edge.I purchased Japanese bamboo-handle Nakiri and Santoku knives to replace the Global knives and am so much happier with them at a fraction of the price !	-1
These dishes , first of all , are just beautiful . The white looks so wonderful on the table and the presentation is just fabulous . That said , be prepared to buy and buy and buy these if you like the looks of them . They break horribly easily and the cleanup , well , we just wo n't go there . I 've had mine for 10 years and now I 'm down to just two of the serving pieces . They break very easily in the oven , in the cabinet , you name it , it 's gone . If you 're looking for a better one , go for the Le Creuset La Poterie line , or just grab a Longaberger one . They 're definitely worth it because you 'll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece . I hate trying to clean these after using them so I just do n't use them anymore for anything but to mix items . That way , nothing gets baked on them and I am not breaking nails scouring off the mess . I definitely recommend getting something else .	-1
First , physical weaknesses : The pitchers crack and warp slowly but steadily , so wo n't last forever . You can replace them for about ten bucks , but with shipping that 's half the cost of an entirely new unit . And you ca n't put them in the dishwasher , so you 'll probably want at least several up front anyway , so that you can clean them.Second , cleaning problems . Unlke the Hamilton Beach tea makers , the bags here go in the brewing housing , which has to be removed and cleaned separately from the pitcher . And if you forget to do that , you 'll have yucky ( even moldy ) tea bags the next time you go to make tea , even if that 's within two days.Hamilton Beach instead keeps the bags ' brewing area inside the pitcher itself , which you can refridgerate and prevent yuck and mold from occuring . Plus , the Mr Coffee station drips TEA on the counter as soon as you remove the pitcher , whereas the Hamilton Beach only drips WATER since the tea process is all contained in the pitcher itself.Further , the Mr Coffee series requires that the pitcher get very close to the brew housing station , with the tea just BARELY getting into the spout , or else you 'll get tea dripped on the counter WHILE brewing . That messiness increases as the pitcher begins to warp and crack . Hamilton Beach bests that both by including a pull-out tray that HOLDS the pitcher in the correct position , and by having the tea drip directly to the center of the pitcher rather than milimeters from the edge of the spout.Above all , the Hamilton Beach series simply makes better tea . It includes a dial that allows you to make weak , medium , or strong tea , and that 's all automated . The Mr Coffee series has no such setting , but requires you to `` close '' the brewing area for a period and then turn a dial to `` open '' before it starts putting tea in the pitcher . That manual step both slows down the tea production , and risks making quite the mess if you forget to go back and open the dial.Finally , the Mr Coffee pitcher is a large and obtrusive ROUND cylinder that takes up lots of space in the fridge , even when there 's only a glass or so left in the pitcher . The Hamilton Beach pitchers are instead elongated OVAL shapes , that fit in more places in the fridge , even in the fridge door , and are *shorter* so that you can put them on a shelf with a lower overhead.Mr . Coffee : bigger mess , more manual , more cleaning , more risk , lower longevity , and lamer tea.Hamilton Beach : no mess , no manual revisit , easy to clean , no risk , lasts longer , better tea , and more options when you make it.No contest !	-1
After first buying a cheap Sunbeam that did n't work at all , I decided to upgrade to the Oster , which I soon discovered was also made by Sunbeam . After burning several loaves of whole wheat bread , I carefully check and timed the cycles ( the cycle times are not in the manuel ) . I discovered that the only difference between white , whole wheat , etc . is the time it rises . All cooking cycles were 60 minutes . That is 20 minutes more than my old machine . Way too long for any type of bread that I know of .	-1
I bought this bread machine as a gift for my daughter , assuming that since it 's made by Oster it would be worth the purchase price ... WRONG ! Too bad she did n't want to hurt my feelings by telling me she could n't make a decent loaf of bread in it soon enough for me to return it . I exchanged my beautiful Panasonic ( that makes great bread ) with her for this piece of junk ! I can at least make an edible loaf of bread ( by using recipes that came with my old Rival Kitchenpro -- not the ones that came with this machine ) , but the bread is not the quality I got with either of my previous machines . Thumbs down on this product !	-1
The description of this breadmaker is misleading . According to the site this machine makes 1 , 1 1/2 , and 2 pound loaves of bread . The box states it makes 1 1/2 or 2 pound loaves . The manual is titled `` 2 pound breadmaker '' and did not include a model number . I did a lot of research before I bought this machine as I wanted one that would make 1 pound loaves . This seemed like a good machine and I could make 3 different size loaves . Some of the lower starred reviews complained about the quality of the bread it produced . Cooking is an art , baking is a science so I thought maybe they just measured incorrectly . The manual is not easy to follow , and after further research ( after I received the machine and read the manual ) a big complaint about this machine is the recipes in the manual do not produce good bread . The manual is copyrighted 1999 ! I contacted Oster about the ability of this machine to produce 1 pound loaves since this information is no where in the manual . The representative said `` yes , it will make 1 pound loaves , you just have to reduce the recipes by half '' . I mentioned that the copyright was 1999 and she laughed and said `` yeah , they do n't update the manuals very often '' . I told her about the recipe complaints and she said `` I ca n't really comment on that ; but they do n't update the manuals '' . Why would Oster produce a new breadmaker with an old , out of date , 10 year old manual ? It does not come with any measuring devices . Most of the included recipes are not suitable for the `` expressbake '' cycle.I did not try to make any bread in mine , I packed it up and returned it . I will buy a different machine .	-1
I can not imagine how this coffee grinder has such good reviews . Let me list the things that make this horrible : - Messy . No removable container means that you have to somehow move the ground coffee to your maker . You can try to turn it upside down and shake the ground coffee into the lid or shake it from the grinder . Either way you are looking at ground coffee spilling on your counter tops or floor . Cleanup is messy as well . If you do n't clean it , the lid will stick.- The grind : Powder . That 's pretty much what this coffee grinder is capable of producing . You can make coarser powder for drip coffee makers of fine powder for espresso . French Press ? No way . You 'll be drinking coffee powder in your liquid.- The cord is very short . This makes it very hard to work with plugged in . Of course , then you unplug it and have the cord flying all over as you attempt to get the coffee powder out.- NOT a grinder , but a chopper . Of course , this is minor as choppers can do an acceptable job as long as you are not picky.Do yourself a favor , spend a few more dollars to get a better quality blade chopper .	-1
Tired of throwing away these Chinese junk mixers on a yearly basis , I drove all the way to target to pick this up after seeing it on Target/Amazon as a Made in USA item . Sure enough , stamped right on the box is MADE IN CHINA . This may have beeen made in the US at one point but I promise you it no longer is . I picked it up and it felt like cheap junk ready to break in my hand.You might as well by a $ 6.99 one than drop $ 40 for the same junk that probably comes out of the same factory in China tainted with who knows what kind of carcinogenic chemicals . Thumbs down to target for LYING on their website ! Bottom line : DONT BUY THIS .	-1
I bought this cooker to replace my older Presto Options cooker that I absolutely loved . It was my favorite for stew , spaghetti sauce and any other dishes that need to simmer slowly . This piece of junk does n't seem to have any temperature below boil ! Trying to simmer something is a nightmare . If you want to simmer , you have to set the control to `` warm . '' And for some reason they changed the cord to a two part magnet thing that keeps coming off . The picture showed the old control that I had on my older Presto cooker but when it came , it had this new control . What happened to this great product ?	-1
After a frustrating experience using this cooker last night , I came to amazon looking looking for a replacement and now feel compelled to write a review.I wanted to get a fryer to use for light and infrequent kitchen deep frying . This unit seemed like a good deal since it also doubles as slow cooker so I took a chance . The first ( and last ) frying event did not go well . I tried to fry some breaded vegetables but the cooker could not keep up . In other words , I 'd add like 3 items to the pot and the cooker could not bring the temp . of the oil back up . Well , that 's ok , I 've still got a slow cooker right ? Wrong . I tried to slow cook some beans last night ... this thing can not maintain a simmer . Here 's the deal , the thing is made of aluminum ... just a terrible material to use for a slow cooker . Aluminum is an extremely responsive conductor but does not store heat so you are at the mercy of the cooker 's heating element cycle ; your cooker is always too hot or too cold to maintain a basic simmer.You set it at 200 and you get boiling so you turn the temp . down the tiniest amount possible and you get nothing ( because the element is now off . But just leave that temp . alone and wait a minute or two , that 's right ! it 'll start boiling again when the element cycles back ( for 20 seconds or so ) , then back to nothing . It will not simmer , only boil intermittently.So for all this things touted uses , you get a warming device that will boil your food for 20 seconds every 2 minutes and something that will boil water rather quickly . I recommend passing .	-1
Right out of the box , I prepared the Juiceman Jr to be used for the very first time . Much to my shock , THE UNIT BEGAN EATING THE CLEAR PLASTIC FEED TUBE AS SOON AS IT WAS TURNED ON ! There were bits of shreaded plastic in the blade and the screen ! The smell of plastic filled the kitchen . Apparently the tube is just a bit too long so it touches the spinning blade . Back in the box and back to the store it went.I read another review from someone who had the exact same experience.A company that makes something this bad does n't deserve a second chance with me . There 's too many other brands to choose from .	-1
This juicer is worthless . I used mine a total of 20 times or less before the on/off switch broke . Even for someone who wants to see if juicing is for them , something this cheaply made is n't even worth the relatively low cost .	-1
was not happy with this , i had to return , went to put it together and it was missing parts and it was purchased before or something because the packaging was not original	-1
I had this pot for about two months , using it once a week , when one handle , then another , cracked . The sides are too hot . It spits out the sides of the lids . Food burns to a crust on the sides . I have had larger , older , Rival pots last for years . Lately , I do n't know why they just feel cheap . I also had the bottom of the matching 5 quart size suddenly unravel while I was carrying a crock full of meatballs from the kitchen to the dining room and the crock fell to the ground with the heating element exposed . Always used pot holders , always filled up food to over halfway . Did all as expected , but the screws unravel or broke inside between the layers of the aluminum sides . Ca n't buy replacement parts easily . Ca n't reach a person at the Rival website .	-1
I 've read other reviews regarding this particular slow cooker . However , I ended up purchasing two of these at our local Target for our Labor Day BBQ . After just unpacking , washing preparing the first unit for use I noticed the ceramic crock pot itself failed to seat properly inside the heating chamber . Not only did the ceramic vessel rock back and fourth at the top rim , the ceramic insert/crock itself was n't long enough to even rest on the bottom of the interior of the heating chamber.I find both issues somewhat of a concern due to the fact of the heat being generated on the ceramic yet the vessel fails to have full support on the bottom or sides within the heating chamber.We own several other makes of slow cookers and do n't have any problems with the ceramic vessels not fitting securely inside the heating chamber . Needless to say both of these units are going to be returned.I 'd like to thank everyone for taking the time to submit a review on this item , as between the handle 's breaking , knob 's cracking and now my own concerns with the ceramic crock insert . This particular model appears to have several defects that could serious personal injuries.I hope my personal review is as helpful to others as well , prior to their purchasing this particular model slow cooker .	-1
The design of this ice cream maker leaves a lot to be desired . Only small cracked or shaved ice will fit around the tub and the plastic lid is already showing signs of wear .	-1
Got one of these 3-4 months ago . The first one broke within 2 weeks . The toaster switch would not stay on . So , I returned it to [ a local store ] for a replacement . Straight out of the box , the toaster switch did not work . Went back to [ a local store ] for the third one . Well , the toaster switch works most of the time.I am thinking of writing to B & D for a free upgrade . Black & Decker should recall this item . Do not buy this toaster/oven . It 's just not worth it .	-1
I cut my teeth on B & D tools and never had a problem , so I bought this B & D toaster oven five months ago . How about a half-done chicken breast ( 1/2 lb . not frozen ) after 45 minutes at 375* ? Or toast coming out burnt on the bottom and still white on top ? Or better yet , put in a second round of bread right after the first slices come out and the oven shuts off in less than 30 seconds and you have warm bread , not toast.The settings are bogus . No matter if the setting is 250* - 350* - 400* the oven never cycles -- just keeps running . The toaster switch needs the touch of a neurosurgeon to get it to work . I ca n't believe that B & D can manufacture a product like this and still stay in business . I wish the CEO and top B & D management were made to use this toaster oven for a month . My real rating is ZERO stars . Do n't buy this product .	-1
When I bought this toaster oven , I filled out that little card for the warranty . It was my first toaster oven , and I had good memories of the one my mother had for 15 years when I was a kid.This oven worked fine for about 8 months , then the broiler knob broke off . I am the only person who used it , and I treated it gently at all times . I thought I had perhaps bought a defective unit.I found the users manual and called customer service , only to be told that the warranty was for one year from the date of MANUFACTURE , not the date of purchase . Evidently they use a code stamped on the power cord to determine when it was made ... .who cares if it sat on a store shelf for 2 years before you bought it ! I argued with the woman for some time about how it should last longer than 8 months , but she would n't agree to a replacement , repair or refund . I finally asked to speak to a manager and was told they were all `` in a meeting . '' I left my phone number for a return call , which of course never came.I am done buying anything from Black & Decker - everything from my cordless vaccuum to this toaster oven has been a piece of junk and my loyalty to this company is gone ... I recently purchased a Kenmore toaster oven from Sears , which is bigger , sturdier , has more even heating , and cost the same as the defective B & D ; product .	-1
The toast function broken in 2 months . It always flamed up if baking the salmon fish . ( Scary and dangerous ! ! ) I called B & D Customer Service , and they said this item was NOT manufacturered by B & D ! ( Why use the brand B & D if B & D wo n't be responsible for this oven ? ) The warranty works like this : Within the 1st year from the date of purchase , you have to call the customer service , and they will direct you to another manufacturer phone number . After you call this number , they will ask you to cut the electric plug with wire about 5~7 inches and send it to some address along with a copy of the recipt and a $ 8.00 check to cover the S & H for the replacement unit . That 's not too much work , but very much frustrated ! Buyer has to pay for the shipping costs for the defective unit . ( I mean , the defective unit is manufacturer 's fault , why should I pay for it ? ! ) After you send your plug away before you receive your replacement unit , you have no oven to use ! That 's why I need a RELIABLE oven to rely on ! ! This toaster oven is not reliable , nor responsible !	-1
What can you say about a Company that has ` distribution ' as part of its name . You might guess that they do n't feel that strongly about actually manufacturing anymore . You might even guess that they are an umbrella company that just slaps their name on things made in a dozen different places ( which might explain the hit or miss success experience expressed by Amazon reviewers . ) But you would hardly guess that they would n't stand behind their products at all ! Guaranteed for 1 year after manufacture ? ? ( Not from the time of the sale ? ! ? Ridiculous ) Is their stuff so flimsy that it can break on the shelf ? Well if you look at the reviews ( 85 ) at the moment , you can see that buying B & D ; equipment is a *crab* shoot ( said euphemistically ) . Some people are happy ( 19 ) , most are not ( 66 ) .Of those 19 reviewers who were happy or content ( 3 to 5 star votes ) , only 10 were not ` generic ' enthusiast votes which can come from anywhere , including company shills . ( In any case , they carry less weight in my book . ) Add to this Consumer Reports rated-poor reviews of B & D ; 's toaster ovens ( in every price range ) and you can only conclude that they are not a guaranteed successful purchase . Buy at your own risk .	-1
All of my cleaning tools are DIRT DEVIL products . I ca n't say enough good things about them , however this appliance FAILS big time . I purchased it at Walmart for $ 34.99 . I had read many of the reviews on Amazon.com and decided to give it a try . I wanted a tool that I could use for small clean ups , and to get into areas where my Phantom Force ca n't reach and instead of hauling out my Dirt Devil Phantom Force Carpet Extractor to do spot cleaning . The bristles on the rotating brush are very soft and flatten out when trying to clean , holding the machine during operation is difficult due to it 's weight and awkward shape . Removing the tanks is not as smooth as it should be and you have to remove two screws before you can remove the part that the water is sucked up when you want to clean it . This machine would work better with a roller type brush with firmer bristles . If I thouhgt I could return it for a full refund I would .	-1
I purchased this product based on the reviews I saw on Amazon . I wanted it for removing cat throw-up from my carpet ( when my cat eats too fast ) . I do n't know how people could think this is an excellent product unless they are using it on a tan or dark colored rug ( that matches the color of the original stain ) ! I used it on my brand new , very expensive , WHITE carpet- and I can GUARANTEE you , it:1 ) Does NOT do a good or complete job of getting stains up2 ) Leaves A LOT of WATER ON THE RUG - which will delaminate yourcarpet . This is not good - ask any carpet professional.3 ) The machine does not rinse -it just puts soapy water down , scrubs it , then does a lousy job of vacuming up ( thus leaving ) whatever ( now diluted ) stain ( cat barf ) + carpet shampoo that was originally put down on your carpet by your cat , etc . - and now the machine.4 ) FYI , you need to use a phillips head screwdriver [ a local store ] . If you want something that really takes stains out , use OXI-CLEAN . You can get it at [ local stores ] and lots of other places . You still have to dry the carpet by hand ( like you do with the product I am returning ) - but at least when your 're done , the carpet is clean and sanitized ! ! ! And there is no machine to take apart afterwards.IF YOU DO DECIDE TO BUY ONE OF THESE , SAVE THE RECEIPT !	-1
Oh my gawd , I ca n't believe they 're still selling these . I 'm online shopping for a new one because I am so tired of being disgusted with this . I 've never used the spray or the wet features ( reviews had warned that sometimes it creates a messy leak ) but I bought this model thinking that it might be a little better than the very cheapest ones . I have a couple of parakeets . The BAGLESS AIR CHAMBER DESIGN is TOTALLY BOGUS ! My kids get a kick out of watching me use it because IT SHOOTS ALL THE FEATURES RIGHT OUT THE SIDE ! Hair & amp ; lint also peek out the exhaust vents , which means that anything smaller than a millet seed ( it has to be the perfect size & amp ; weight to get trapped in the dust bowl ) is getting spit right out ! As a cordless , which you 'd expect , it ca n't pick up anything much heavier than a staple either . Worst part is knowing anything smaller & amp ; lighter than what 's getting trapped is being blown right out the side or caught in the motor housing because there is no bag or filter .	-1
I had great hopes for this item though not especially high expectations . Nevertheless , straight out of the box , one of the hinges was pulled right out of the wood , several dowels used to assemble the pieces were clearly visible because the boards apparently are not long enough , several corners were chipped -- under the finish so it happened before assembly , two of the shelves were either terribly misaligned or warped so they did not seat correctly . Yes , it was an instant-assembly item . Yes , it is actually made out of real wood . Yes , the design is very nice . But , no , I 'm not keeping it because the thing was slapped together without consideration for quality control and I 'd be too wary of putting any weight on the shelves because half of them do n't seat properly ( or at all ) on their support pegs .	-1
I purchased FoodSaver canisters in a store in various sizes . Every one of them `` spider web '' cracked on the bottom in one or two uses . I give credit to Tilia . They replaced every canister . And every one of the replacements cracked in one or two uses . Now I use them without vacuum for sugar , flour , etc . FYI ... I hand washed them so it is not dishwasher caused as one service rep suggested.I love the idea of these canisters and I too wish Tilia would find materials that work .	-1
cracks in the bases of two of the three jars after just two uses . Get the mason lid adapters and use canning jars !	-1
The canister ( bottom ) part not dishwasher safe as advertised . Cracked after a few uses and no longer holds vacuum . Bags and rolls are great , but all the canister products and botle and jar seals are worthless . Do n't buy .	-1
I want to make it clear that for me the FoodSaverFoodSaver V3835 Vacuum Food Sealer with SmartSeal TechnologyFoodSaver 3-Piece Canister SetFoodSaver Continuous Roll Bag Material , 8-Inch by 22-Foot ( 2 Rolls ) FoodSaver Continuous Roll Bag Material , 11 Inch by 18 Feet ( 2 Rolls ) canisters are a complete waste of money . Not only do they crack but the larger canisters sold for bulk items do not hold their seal indefinitely at all . Inasmuch as the seal depends upon the vacuum , the containers are otherwise useless for any further storage since the lids simply sit on top without any form of securing . I returned several bulk container tops before realizing the company had no fix for the problem . When the things work they are wonderful but they are definitely unreliable and short lived . That is why I give them one star . If you buy bulk goods , you 're better off with food grade plastic buckets and nitrogen.Now , for the bags ... After vacuuming and placing the bags in the freezer for storage , one must take care not to handle the frozen bags too exuberantly when rummaging in the freezer . They can , and sometimes will , loose their vacuum . Having said that , I must admit I would not want to be without the FoodSaver . When I cook , I cook more than I need and freeze all manner of items for later consumption . I date all the food and it lasts for a long time . For fishing and hunting the vacuum bags are a wonderful way to store your raw meat or fish . I 'm able to produce any number of impromptu meals for myself or guests as a result of the ability of storing food in these vacuumed bags ; i.e . venison , stripped bass , blackfish etc . Cooked meals such as sliced corn beef ; pot roast and gravy ; meatballs , sausage , pork and spaghetti sauce ; soups and stews ; chicken breasts prepared for use in chicken salad or any number of dishes . I enjoy cooking but being single I do n't always have the time to do so . Having precooked , single serving vacuum packed meals ready to heat up , in my opinion , is far superior than heating up any frozen `` TV '' dinner.Sometimes I will purchase a `` managers special '' in the market such as steaks or chuck for stew , or any other beef , fish or chicken on sale . The bags are the best for storing raw food as well , whether or not you prep it for a particular dish for later ( as previously suggested ) . For these reasons I have to give the FoodSaver and bags 5 stars even though the bags loose their seal now and again if you 're not careful . It 's worth it . I have worn out my first one and now have two , one for the home and one for the camper .	-1
I too went ahead and bought these and a rectangular container set even though several reviewers said they cracked . They were great for a while , until they cracked for no apparent reason . I never even put them in the dishwasher . I love my Foodsaver , but I wish I never bought these canisters . Stick with the bags and the mason jar sealers -- they work great !	-1
FoodSaver 3-Piece Canister SetAll my Food Saver Cannisters cracked within one year . They were carefully handled by one adult , following all instructions of no dishwasher , freezer nor hot foods . I have all the clear and black models . Their center bottom seam gets hairline cracks , then fails to vacumn . They are expensive and useless . The unit works well with mylar bags or mason jars .	-1
I purchased four sets of these elsewhere and am seriously having buyers remorse . They break easy and if you slightly bump/touch the release valve , you have to start all over . They also do n't hold the vacuum and the release buttons pop out too easy . They are n't stackable so they really are n't helpful as a storage solution . I actually really hate mine and am currently looking for a square or rectangular version with flat stackable tops .	-1
I had high hopes for these containers . Of course , there are plenty of things you can do with them if they work . I initially noticed a problem whan I would come back to the container and the lid removed too easily - no vacuum . I did the ( marshmallow ) test and , sure enough , the container would attain the vacuum initially but , after an hour or so , it would lose the vacuum . Even though they were new , I did all of the tips and tricks posted on the Tilia web site ( cleaning around the rim , making sure there were no crumbs , etc . ) Nothing works . Really disappointed . I love the foodsaver and really wanted to utilize the canisters . They just do n't work .	-1
Had these for a couple of years . Treated them with care . Large container Cracked . The only answer I got from Customer Service was the Auto Reply of -- we received your email and will reply within 48 hours . Am still waiting . Really liked the canisters- until they cracked . Will not spend money to replace them .	-1
I have some of these I bought years ago and some larger that are smoked colored they do n't make anymore . I never had a problem with those buttttttttt . I bought three sets of these and have had one medium size actually implode at the bottom and one small one crack across the bottom . If you buy any be prepared for that to happen and possible food loss . That can become expensive plus renders the external port on a foodsaver useless except for sealing Ball or Mason jar lids on glass . Now for long term storage that works well but if you want fairly frequent access to the food does n't work well ( using a lot of lids ) . I was truly disappointed in these .	-1
Had the old ones for several years , but sometimes had to keep them going with glue or epoxy due to cracking . Because they lasted a few years , went ahead and bought some new ones . Just seems to me they could have found some plastic that would last longer.Update -- thought the new ones would be better . The old developed some cracks after several years . These new clear colored ones are junk . Started cracking after 3 uses . All those one star reviews wee justified . Amazon for some reason is reluctant to stand behind this crap . Should have read those one star reviews and paid attention . Guess I 'm out twenty bucks for nothing -- Larry	-1
As many other users here , I 've purchased a number of these canisters and they all seem to eventually get cracks . I 've tried to treat them with kid gloves , not putting them in the dishwasher , being careful not to overseal them , etc . Does n't matter , some crack even after just a few uses . I have one tall one that still seems to be okay , and the square marinator , but these round canisters are just very unreliable . With all the complaints , I 'm surprised there has n't been a class action suit against the company for knowingly continuing to sell such defective products ! I now generally use medium and large mason jars and seal them with the handheld unit and jar sealers . This works so much better , but has limited space of course , even with larger jars . It 's a shame Tilia ca n't get their act together and make canisters that will last .	-1
I bought this set directly from FoodSaver because they were running a promotion in which they were free with certain models of vacuum sealers . I used the big canister 3 times and when I opened it the third time , could n't figure out why the food inside was stale ... Until I washed it . As soon as I flipped it over , I saw the cracks in the bottom . I 'm really disappointed . We wanted these to store gluten-free goods which are already so much more expensive , but things like pretzels also go stale much faster . Not only did we lose the majority of a bag of pretzels , now we 're still back at square one for storing them and I 'm not sure the vacuum sealer itself was worth the expense . I hope that the smaller canisters hold out longer , as other reviewers mentioned . I will be LIVID if none of them last at least a year ! I have uploaded a photo so you can see the crack - it spans almos the entire diameter of the bottom of the container with another , smaller crack beginning to stem off .	-1
These canisters crack from the vacuum created , which means that the plastic does not hold up to what it 's supposed to do . I do NOT put them in the dishwasher and hardly use them , yet they have all cracked within a year 's use . Jardin will replace one cracked canister as a courtesy . When I asked what I was supposed to do with the others that had cracked , I was told that I could purchase an `` extra-durable '' set that would stand up to the suction pressure . What a joke !	-1
I 've used the Food Saver for several years . The Tilia quart bags are used the most ; they keep steaks fresh for up to a year in the freezer . I had such good luck with the plastic bags that I purchased a set of these canisters . After using them for a few months , I noticed that they would not hold a vaccuum . I further investigated the cause of the malfunction . I pumped out all of the air from an empty canister , placed it in a tub of water to determine where the leak occurred . Within a minute water entered the canister through spider cracks in the base . The injection mold process resulted in a flaw at the nipple where the canister left the manufacturing mold.I contacted the Customer Service Representative and was cordially offered a couple of the larger canisters that caused most of the problems . So far the replacements have acquired the same spider cracks in the base , but still hold a seal . Wish me luck that these will maintain a vaccuum much longer . I have n't had any trouble with the marinator canister -- but do n't use it as much either .	-1
Right out of the box the middle container would n't hold a seal . The large container held a seal but within one hour had leaked . Returned .	-1
We bought one for Christmas and love the food sealer . However , all the canisters have cracked . So far , still holding the seal , but they are getting progressively worse , so it 's just a matter of time . These are n't exactly cheap , so I think it 's safe to say that we should expect bettter.UPDATE : These reviews go back to March 2005 and I see other reviews as recent as August 2007 ... so why has n't this problem been fixed yet ? The sealer is an excellent product , but these cannisters are useless . None of my original canisters hold their seal .	-1
I would give it 0 stars if I could . Out of 4 of these that I own , only 1 still works after 3-6 months of use . They develop cracks and no longer hold a seal . Read other reviews about these canisters . They do have a one year warranty ( if you want to keep sendign them back ) but I do n't recommend this product at all . The company does not deserve to be making money charging people for these again and again when they constantly crack.P.S . I take very good care of my stuff . If it breaks for me , it will break for you .	-1
I was looking forward to getting this but in the few weeks that I 've owned it has proven to be one of the most worthless items in my kitchen .	-1
I purchased and returned this item . Way too heavy . I do not see why it needs to be 40 lbs . I would be hanging 40 lbs of cookware in addition . That is 80 pounds from only two points and the same joist at that . I do not believe it would fall if installed correctly , however , why 40 lbs ? In addition , it will sway and tilt with only two points attached . The grid , which is very flimsy is supported by four thin bolts ( 1/8th inch ) which are not welded to the frame but are loosely screwed in . I purchased a Rogar ( not from Amazon sadly ) for about 80 and it was 14lbs and very rigid . It looks great , supported by 4 chains ( no chains on the Old Dutch which is probably a plus for many ) and holds a large set of All Clad . Amazon has other merchants selling this but I purchased it from a company out of Mass . with free shipping . Amazon made the purchase and return quick . In a one week period I had it shipped to me , returned to Amazon and a credit ! This is why I am a Amazon Prime member .	-1
One of the pairs of holes on the middle struts which join the upper and lower parts together is off kilter so those pairs of screws in order for the holes to line up are at angle and rub up against each other instead of being parallel . The other screws are loose so it is not a problem with the lack of flexibility prior to full assembly . The holes are definitely off kilter . I am sending this back to Amazon . Also , the graphite is a powdery paint that came off and I was not rough with these parts at all . Rereading these glowing reviews , I went back to look at my stand and I have assembled plenty of deep discount metal , graphite looking pieces of furniture before and the holes on the stand are definitely off . It 's just as well . Despite the cheap price which I love , the design is really not my cup of tea .	-1
I love my turbo cooker and have used it at least 3 times a week for the past couple years . It makes pasta taste great because it absorbs the taste of the meats you are cooking . Chicken is so easy and fast in the cooker . I find that even the non-stick finish has lasted in my turbo cooker ( I only use plastic with it ) . I would give it five stars except for the vent knob on top . At first the screw that held it would not hold it tight anymore and finally stripped out . I tried everything to keep it on . Now the knob actually broke . I wish I could find someplace to just get a new knob because my pan is still in great shape . I also wish is was bigger for more family size meals.So , although I love it . I feel it is overpriced for the quality of the workmanship and size . But I will probably buy another , or if I can find something like it I will try it , because I miss my cooker.UPDATE : Do not use the Chef Randall website . They do not stand behind their products . They give no customer service and have promised to send me two small screws ( which they owed me ) for over a month . Today they told me , again , that they would be in the mail tomorrow . I do n't have a lot of hope .	-1
Collector 's Edition 8 Qt Multi-PotBTTOM LINE : Boil time was only minimally faster ( gas : 16 min vs 20 min in standard stainless ) . Food residue sticks to the fared rim . No lid vent created boil-overs . Too long to clean within warranty : a quick meal took 20 minutes at the sink.This set came with 4 pieces : SHORT STEAMER INSERT . With 2 opposite handles that swing down when steaming . Good concept . Very poor execution ! Can be dangerous and for sure , very awkward to use : Handles hang down and get extremely hot so be careful when trying to dig them out of your veggies . Best if you use a mitt , if you can grab both handles with a mitt . Forget asparagus unless you want to individually place and remove around the handles.Maybe they should be clip on handles.DEEP STEAMER . Works well as a steamer but the whole concept of an in-pot steamer w/ handles is over-rated . You have to take the twice-as-heavy pot with the steamer to the sink to strain , remove steamer to strain , find a spot to put it so you can pour out the boiling water . Think about it.The POT . Food residue collects by and in the inside rivots making it time consuming and difficult to clean within warranty.The LID . Nice glass but ... no vent so steam collects and water tends to boil over . Cleaning this puppy with its stainless rim is a chore to say the least.CLEANING . If you have hard water think twice as the rings are very difficult to remove within warranty . Pot is big too so it 's cumbersome to clean in the sink within warranty ( and who wants to be careful when cleaning ) . Special cleaners are required ( Barkeeper 's or similar ) .CALPHALON MAKES DIFFERENT GRADES OF STAINLESS . Be alert when shopping for Calphalon Stainless . This is 18/10 stainless , not all Tri-Ply . I thought this set was Tri-Ply . If it does n't say Tri-Ply , it 's not.CALPHALON CAN BE 'MADE IN CHINA ' . I did not know until this purhase , but Calphalon maufacturers both here in the U.S.A. and in China . This set is made in China , as was another hard-anodized piece that had to be returned . Might want to pay a little more and get the Made in U.S.A. pieces . This reviewer thinks it 's worth it ! BOTTOM LINE : 1 year after purchase , I no longer use this pot ; I use my new Farberware Copper Clad .	-1
I bought this kettle because I liked the modern design . That 's about all I like about it . It 's difficult to load with water , it 's started leaking from the seams after only a few months , the handle gets hot ... '' good grips '' this is not . I recommend staying far away from this kettle .	-1
I actually purchased two of these . The second was purchased when the whistle stopped working on the first ( I thought the broken whisle was my fault because it ran for a few minutes ) . Both lasted about a year . Here 's what 's not to like:1 ) Rubber handle splits along bottom seam2 ) Whistle stops working after a short while3 ) Hard to refill with water if hot , steam burns your hand4 ) Lid difficult to open/close5 ) `` Stainless steel '' mars easily , does not retain appearance6 ) Takes forever to boil contents7 ) Bottom seam leaksMany other reviews echo these same experiences . While it appears to be a nice unit from a company that normally has a good reputation , it is not . Be forewarned , do n't but this item .	-1
I wanted a Chef 's Choice sharpener because of the great reviews and `` endorsement '' from `` cook 's country '' , but that was a different model , the 120 . Usually , I do not give `` bad reviews '' , but this is the exception.I picked the model 300 up locally on sale for $ 36 plus tax . I brought it home , read the instructions ( as several reviews recommonded ) , and sharped one of my older knives.Took longer than expected and two tries to get a `` good edge '' but not the `` scary sharp '' that has been stated in some reviews . Also a lot of vibration . What I did not expect was `` scratch marks '' up and down the entire length of the blade ! The `` sharpened edge '' looks like someone took an old rat tail file with metal fragments in the file and sharpened it . I sharpened other less expensive knives with the same horrible results ! ! Furthermore , the `` grooves and valleys '' on the edge are places for bactria and germs to `` hide in '' . Knives came up too easily from the magnetic guide and are lower than the guide housing ; on two knives had to lift the knife to get them to go through , which left a `` ding '' or uneven `` notch '' on the blade where it had to be lifted to go pass the guide housing.My cousin that went to culinary ( chef 's ) school and taught me how to sharpen knives with sharpening stones ; so , I get a lot better results and a better edge , with some effort and time , using a set of good sharpening stones , which the ex 's friends stole , so that is why I tried the model 300.I am returning the model 300 and going to wait for a good sale on a better model , such as the 120 , 130 , etc , which can also sharpen serrated knives . ( The model 300 only sharpens straight edged knives such as chefs , carving , boning knives , etc . ) BTW go to Chef 's Choice website and there are comparison guides to help you choose which sharpener with the features you want , though you have to dig in a little to find the charts.In Summary , Chef 's Choice sharpener is a good brand , save your money for a better model , and the model 300 do not buy ... unless you do not care how blade edge looks !	-1
I bought one of these a couple of years ago and I have n't been able to get my knives properly sharp from using it , no matter how long I have spent carefully following the instructions . My partner could n't believe it would n't work and , thinking I might be too easily put off , tried it too , using as many alternative artful variations in technique as he could think of . It did n't work for him either . I ended up throwing it out.Now I use a simple sharpening stone , which is far more effective and environmentally friendly . Better for your arm muscles too .	-1
This blender is so loud I can not use it in the mornings to make smoothies - the reason I bought it . I read positive reviews on making green drinks , but it was not effective for me , left it very chunky . I do n't think is powerful enough . I ended up buying a Breville.I do not recomend	-1
i purchased this blender last year after my other Oster died , the old one lasted through several moves and we had it for about maybe four years , this one is another story . i do n't know if i just got a dud but this blender only lasted 8 months and the motor sounds like it 's on it 's last legs - actually it 's pretty scary sounding and its freaking me out so out it goes ! i will be replacing this with a vitamix ! This blender was not used recklessly and never went through a move so i 'm not sure why it pooped out so soon but i am done purchasing this brand and model.i would say it is good in a pinch but it is not the greatest at making smoothy-style shakes where crushing ice is required , it does not & # 34 ; blend & # 34 ; very well and the nutrient powders that i use always seem to cake and adhere to the sides regardless of what order i put my ingredients into the jar - i have tried every which way and every time i end up scraping the sides to get everything back into the mix , even then it all cakes at the blades which i do n't know until after i have poured everyone a serving , ugh ! - it also sometimes leaks and splashes me when in use so i have to make sure i 'm not wearing something i really like especially if i 'm making a smoothy with berries ( i often do ) and it does n't seem to make a difference how tightly i secure the bottom & # 8230 ; well , i hope this helps someone looking to purchase a blender , personally i would look elsewhere .	-1
All I wanted to do was make hummus : raw sesame seeds , oil and cooked chickpeas . As it turns out , the trick to achieving that great creamy consistency is to blend all the liquid ingredients well before adding the cooked chickpeas . A food processor wo n't do it easily.This blender was up to the task but struggled greatly and smelled of the motor burning . It did n't seem like it would be able to repeat the hummus-making process more than a few times .	-1
It 's loud , the bottom gear strips out and gets harder and harder to get it to catch . It does n't rotate food very well inside the blender jar because of the narrowing bottom . For something cheap , fine . If you want a good blender that will last this is n't it . This is n't the same Oster they used to make .	-1
I bought this when my Breadman pan broke and I could n't get a replacement . I was disappointed from the start.I had read all the glowing reviews about the Sandwich setting , etc. , but found that my model overcooked everything . Fiddling with the crust control did n't begin to solve the issue ( and there is no crust control in Sandwich mode , when the crust is supposed to be soft -- ha ! ) . And there are n't any custom cycles to program to cook the bread less , so I had to remember to be there 15 minutes before the cycle ended to take the bread out.I also do n't know why my bread always rose too much . No matter what yeast I used ( SAF , regular active dry , bread machine ) and how much I cut back , the loaf was too puffy . I could n't get the denser , moister bread my family likes.On the plus side , it is quieter than the Breadman , and the paddle seems to leave less gaping a hole in the bottom . And it makes dough just fine . But I 'm selling it and keeping the Breadman , now that , two years after I ordered the replacement pan , it finally showed up .	-1
I brought this breadmachine based on so many good reviews . This was fourth bread machine we had , and the only one has to send back for refund.I liked its capability to make 2.5lb bread . So the first bread I tried was a 2.5lb one . Use exactly the ingredients as the manual suggested . Setup everything was not hard . Push the start ... It started after half hour resting , then it started mixing the flour normally for about 5 minutes . It then had very strange noise , sounded like the belt was not turning from time to time . After about 15 minutes , it smelled like electronics burning . I opened the lid , noticed when the strange sound was sounding , if I pull up the wet muddy flour , machine would turning . If I let the flour go back to the pan , it would stop the machine , then the strange sound and burning elecrtonics smell came up.I think the machine is not powerful enough to work on 2.5lb bread with bread flour . It might work for all purpose flour , which has less gluten . But the manual came with the machine strongly recommended using bread flour ... .I sent it back to get Oster one , that one can only make 2lbs bread , but work well every time .	-1
I read many reviews of bread machines , and decided on the Panasonic because so many people bought one , I think more units of this than any other . Well , I read the instruction book , selected a recipe , and started the process . The first stage is a Rest , where the ingredients are gently warmed . That went fine . The next step is Kneading , and that went fine , the dough looked good . After that , the machine bakes it , but mine did not get hot , so no baking . I tried again , but the machine just quit the first time , no heating . Well , that was both a surprise and a disappointment , but I took the dough out and baked it separately . I thought the recipe was very good , I used a 7 Grain flour mix , but the machine had to be returned . I do n't feel too enthusiastic about ordering another one , I really did n't expect anything like this to happen .	-1
I had a blast with my Panasonic SD-YD250 bread maker -- until it stopped working 4 days before the warranty expired in early November 2009 . It would make dough , but not bake anything.I phoned Panasonic and that 's when the fun began . They transferred me to the Philippines where someone would help me find a repair center . After four phone calls and considerible language barrier issues they referred me to a repair center in New Jersey . ( I live in Virginia . ) I shipped my bread maker according to their `` detailed '' directions . I phoned the repair center after Thanksgiving ; they said the machine had arrived and everything was fine ; they 'd have it fixed and back to be in a few weeks . Well that did n't happen.Many more calls to the Philippines and New Jersey -- finally in January 2010 the repair center telephoned me . They wanted to know how I wanted to pay for the DENT in the machine that happened during shipping . Funny no one mentioned the dent in November or December . Of course they blamed it on the shipping carrier , which I did n't believe.More phone calls to the Philippines and New Jersey -- I told them to just fix it the darn thing and ship it back with the dent . Let me tell you the people in the Philippines were very rude and the people in New Jersey were even worse . The machine arrived here in February . It was FILTHY.After giving it a good cleaning , I made just a few loaves of bread and they never really came out quite correctly . My machine lost its luster , between the dent and all the cleaning it needed to get it useable.On Saturday 7/3/2010 I made bread again and the machine died . Today I gave it a good toss into the bin at our local recycle center.Panasonic people in the Philippines are rude , uncaring , and nasty . The `` authorized repair '' center in New Jersey should be shut down . There is only one authorized repair center in New Jersey , so if you are directed there , ask for a repair center in some other state.I give this product , Panasonic and the repair center in New Jersey a big thumb 's DOWN . If yours is working , count your blessings .	-1
I have wanted a Panasonic Bread maker and was attracted by the pricing from Warehouse Deals , Inc. , fulfilled by Amazon.This is the 2nd Panasonic Bread maker that I have purchased from this Warehouse Deals , Inc. , which does n't work and has to be returned ! The first arrived so poorly packaged that the base was broken . This arrived with a dented front . Then , after reading the manual & filling the mixing bowl with ingredients , it would not turn on . I called Panasonic customer service and after long discussions about what I had and had not done , I was provided with a case number and told to return the unit for service or exchange . Warehouse Deals represented that this unit was unused and did n't have any cosmetic blemishes , dents , etc . Warehouse Deals stated that the packaging had been damaged or something to that effect.Both of these purchases ended up taking a lot of my time and in this case , fresh ingredients and hours of time re-reading the manual and then calling tech . svce. , never mind repackaging & delivering to the UPS store .	-1
It seemed like a refurbished model , it was missing the protective film the instructions told you to remove before using , besides the packing seeming a bit sus .	-1
I was very impressed after reading the raves on amazon and decided to give it a try . So excited to open the box after couple days of waiting , I baked my first loaf the same day I received it.The bread was burned in the buttom but very good texture inside . Of course , the cycle was very long and preheating time alone was about 30-40minutes . I thought , maybe I need work on the precision of measurement . Then I noticed the cermaic piece holding heating coil was broken into two pieces , the heating element had nowhere to sit but resting on the botton of the unit . Then I took a look at my old Oster bread machine and found out the heating element was fixed securely to the side of the oster machine with cermaic insulator , nothing shaky and unstable like the heating coil in the panasonic unit . I have a small kid running around and curious about everything , if the heating coil sitting on the button and heat the whole unit , it becomes a fire hazard . I had no chice but return it.Disappointment is a understatement after reading so many great reviews on amazon and epinion . But the design of the cermaic piece is very unreliable and could turn this machine into a disaster.I did some research on the web and found out the ceramic piece has been a common complaint . if you turn the pages of review on amazon , you will see several reviews mentioning the same problem . But the most recent reviews did not note anything like it . Just want to let people know , the problem is still there , and please take into consideration .	-1
The kneading blade broke after 15 uses . When i contacted Panasonic for a replacement , they referred me to a `` service center '' instead of sending me a new blade . Just think about this : do they think I should take off a day from work to drop it off and a day to pick it up ? You must be kidding me ! This is likely the last Panasonic appliance or device I will ever buy.Update : the `` service center '' I was referred to does not even give you the option to speak to a human . Beware , you are buying an appliance essentially without warranty service option !	-1
I was impressed with this unit until I saw that Panasonic sells 2 even better models they do not offer Americans.It is impossible to give this unit any stars when it is KNOWN to be a bottom of barrel Panasonic option . I 'm not flying to London to buy the improved models but I am also not buying Panasonic American version of the bottom of the barrel option either . I purchased a Zojirushi who to my knowledge offer their Asian , European AND American customers the same excellent options.Amazon United Kingdom has the below unit . Does the American version have a fruit and nut dispenser and 11 modes ? Is this the same Panasonic unit that Amazon United Kingdom sells to Europeans ? ? Does this `` American version '' have the same options as the European model ? We can thank the EPA and the other government bureaucrats for the US consumer not getting the best products . It costs a fortune and takes forever for companies to cut through the red tape.GooglePanasonic SD-2501WXC Automatic Breadmaker with Nut & Raisin Dispenser & Gluten Free ProgramTechnical Details11 Bread & Dough ModesRaisin Nut DispenserJam and Compote Mode3 Different Loaf Sizes100 % Gluten Free Bread ModeBut even if you purchased a $ 30 transformer to run one , Amazon UK ships to around 30 countries but not to the USA .	-1
This pan is solid and attractive , and I love my other Le Creuset pots and pans . So , after reading these super-positive reviews along with that NYTimes article suggesting this pan as a non-toxic alternative to teflon and related coatings , I bought this , hoping to find something not too sticky with which to cook eggs ( fried eggs , fritattas , etc. ) . I religiously coated the bottom of the pan with oil and let it get hot before adding the food , but the food stuck to this like glue , making a tremendous mess and leaving me with a skillet very difficult to clean . I 've tried it since then several times , each time with more oil and no stirring or touching the eggs , and I 've varied the temperature in the hope of finding some way to make this work . But each time is still a total glue-y disaster -- really , it could hardly be worse . My plain stainless steel skillet works far better than this for eggs , and with only a light coating of oil . I have wasted my money , and quite a bit of it , too . Really bummed .	-1
The coating that Le Creuset applies to all of their black surfaced enameled pans sticks to food as it cooks . I mean really bad sticking to the point that the product requires almost full time attention . You are much better off buying a standard cast iron pan and conditioning it with oil the old fashioned way then buying any of these products . You will also save about 85 % on your purchase .	-1
My biggest issue with this pan is the inside finish . I wish it had the same finish as the other pans . Everything sticks and it is difficult to get clean . The option of a smaller size would be a plus .	-1
Concerned about non stick teflon surfaces I purchased this pan , along with the grill pan - this is the worst frying pan I have ever used ( caphalon , magnalite , cooks , revereware and various inexpensive teflon pans ) Everything sticks ! The heat does have uneven distribution in the pan , I 'm not sure why , and no matter the oil used eggs , fish , burgers , everything sticks . An expensive mistake , I ended up throwing it in the recycling bin . I will say that I have a few Le Crueset oval cooking dishes which are enameled on the interior and I love them , which is what encouraged me to try the fry pan . Take your money elsewhere .	-1
I 'm a huge fan of Le Cruest 's products and own a few well chosen pieces . Having said that , this new satin finish is a disappointment . I was given this a gift a year ago and was thrilled - until I used it.I really wish they 'd go back to their original smooth enamel finish . This must be an attempt to produce an interior more durable for using metal utensils with . An attempt that in my opinion is a failure . Things ( like eggs and hamburgers ) stick to this finish . You have to use a lot more fat to prevent sticking . It 's hard to get clean , takes quite a bit of scrubbing even after soaking . It does n't give the finish to grilled meats , etc that I want from a fry pan . Forget deglazing it to make a sauce . I find my All Clad 9 inch skillet to be a superior performer to this one.Since this is a 9 inch skillet , I have n't used it to saute onions , etc. , so I ca n't say how it performs with these items.I do use it to make cornbread and to roast small portions of meats or veg in the oven , with good results ( as long as I 'm not going to use the browned bits to make a sauce ) . This to me though , is not enough uses to justify buying it .	-1
Unfortunately needed a large flat bottomed non-stick pan to cook in fort the holidays . Well , I whipped out my new large pan and it would not set flat on my stove top . I almost got my meat mallet to pound in the bump in the middle of the pan , but went to the smaller one and had more success with that one . What you get is what you paid for , I guess . Farberware - you can do better than this !	-1
Ive had the pan a month or 2 its never been in the oven or the washer , nonstick works well , holds lots , but its warped , and I rarely use max heat on my ceramic top , but this pan is headed for the trash can . Would be great on gas or coil type range .	-1
Product arrived on time . The skillet was damaged.. looked like someone dropped the pan before it was put in the box . Had a large dent , could n't put a lid on it because of the dent . Out of the last 5 products I have ordered from Farberware this year , 3 of the 5 have arrived damaged . They have been great about replacing damaged products . Just frustrating to have to ship each item back and wait for the next one ... hoping it wo n't be damaged too . In general I really like Farberware pans . They need to work on better packaging , it would save them a lot of time and expense and the customers a lot of frustration . In spite of all this.. I would still order through them again if I am in need of a new pan , because their products are made to last a lifetime .	-1
These came with the air filter itself or I would not have bothered to purchase them.I really did n't notice any difference at all when I used the filter ... ..I purchased it for an occasional smoker and his ( clean , but still ) dogs . Not worth my money .	-1
I was all set to buy these . But a little voice inside said you better first take a look at them in person . Last night I went to look at these . I noticed that Kohls did n't display the sets but kept them in boxes . I now know why . They displayed all the individual bigger pieces instead . I broke open a box and took out the pieces . They were selling the 5 piece set with the smaller cup and saucer but the plates and the bowls are the same . It was shocking how small the bowl and salad plate was . I am glad I looked at these first . I would recommend you go find a Macy 's or Kohls or maybe a JCP and kick the tires on these first . JCP has just as good a price I think on these too and maybe better since you can return them to the store if you have problems.Kohls sold a bigger bowl separately and this thing was heavy and was 16.00 for the bowl ! Physically I would not want to hold these bowls with food in them . There was no Goldie Locks just right size with this line . Too small or too heavy . Loved the colors.Then I go check out Walmart 's Mainstay version of this . The price was right at 25.00 for 16 piece set or 45.00 for two sets . They sell the sets or you can buy all the pieces except the salad plate individually for so much less . For a bowl it was $ 2.00 . It is also Stoneware . They come in 7 colors too.The bowl can hold like two cups or 16 oz and was not too heavy either . Also the salad plate and dinner plate had high lips on it so no spilling and the silver ware stays put and does slide off the plate . When I microwaved the plates the higher sides did not heat up so it was easy to take out . The bowl is so deep that I do n't fill it up and when I microwaved it I was able to take it out with my fingers on the higher part of the lip area.The down side were the variety of colors but the more I thought about it the more I realized I can do many things with these colored sets . I bought the dark blue and will pickup the golden pond yellow one this weekend and a white one for a nauticle color theme . I can buy the apple green bowls or red ones and change it up very inexpensively . The more I thought about them the more sets I want ! I can see how addicting this can be . I do n't collect anything but I now can see how you get hooked on this . My husband likes the idea of seeing all those fun colors in the cabinet too.The reason I picked a white set to mix with is because I can then buy various brands of white colored serving pieces to finish off the set since Mainstay does not make matching serving pieces ... .yet . Or maybe I can find Fiesta serving dishes to go with this set too.If I break a piece I will not be too worried about the cost nor finding a replacement piece since I can go down to Walmart to get one easily and cheaply . But the reviews on these are very solid so I do n't expect chipping or breaking from normal use . I read all 75 reviews too.I have an older yellow Fiesta platter and was set on buying more Fiestaware but for fuctionality and price the Mainstay worked better for me . I did call Fiesta to ask questions and was left on hold indefinately and hung up and then followed up with email and no one got back to me . I think they need to improve their game with consumers on so many levels.Edit 1-22-13 Days later I did get an email from Fiestaware but it was too late I already bought other dinnerware . You snooze you lose . Well it turns out Walmart has this great stoneware alternative but does n't know how to manage their inventories of it . I wanted the Golden Pond yellow color and our store was out and local stores were out , online was out of stock . Could not for the life of me get a straight answer from Walmart about whether they were discontinuing this color or when they would be back in stock . I tried with the store two times , emailing customer service at least three times , calling customer service once and then calling and talking to their `` priority customer service '' . The head honchos at head office insulate themselves from the public so I went as high as they would allow me to go and they really do n't care either.They should n't be called customer service but The Vague Lame Excuse Dept . They sent me back to the store and said the store manager can make a `` special order '' . Basically they had no idea so dropped the problem in the lap of the store manager to track it down . He was great and I really feel sorry for these managers to be dumped on like this . His assistant found two sets and he drove all the way over to get them and it was quite a distance too and I had no idea . It is managers and assistants like this that keeps Walmart going . Priority customer service wanted to add my name to mailing list when or if it ever comes in and I was n't about to wait months on this since I see online other people looking for the same set in the midwest for a long time too . I would recommend you pick a color that is available and make sure you buy enough sets and not plan on finding them later or online . I still think they are a great deal . After so much hassle with Walmart I back tracked to see if there is another set I should buy instead and there really was n't . Fiestaware was either too small or too heavy . I like the high lips on the Mainstay for salad and dinner plates which keeps silverware and bowls and food juices from sliding off . The generous bowls and the fact I can hold them on the edges and take them out of microwave without mits . The mugs are big and I can put three fingers in the handle . The Golden Pond color is bright pretty color too.I am not too tied in with this dishwear and I think that is what I learned with both Fiestaware and Walmart . Niether of them care enough about us consumers and so I went with the best deal and maybe next time I will buy another brand since neither one of these companies impressed me , but that store manager did .	-1
We bought this vacuum a little over 2 years ago . AT FIRST I loved it . It is very heavy..but it did do a good job . Now that we have stairs to go up it made me not even want to vacuum because it was so heavy to carry up the steps and awkward to carry . We have a german shepard who sheds a lot and it just ca n't keep up with the fur . The handle doesnt release anymore easily . I have to literally bang it off the ground to get it to release and sometimes even that does n't work . Changing the bag does n't do anything for picking up the fur and nothing is clogged in the brushes . I am going to TRY to contact the customer service dept but I 'm sure we 're past the warranty period . But I just used those words last night to my husband that I hate this vacumm ! ! I bought a Kemore Quick Clean last night and I love it and it was half the price of this . Amazing on the pet hair . I ca n't believe what the eureka was leaving behind . Unbelievable ! Buy a kenmore instead and save ! !	-1
I do n't understand how this vacuum has such great reviews . Sure , it has a lot of metal parts . So what ? It still works terribly.My main gripe is that this vacuum can not clean hard floors . It will kick dirt and debris around all over the place though . Try vacuuming a hard floor bare footed and you will actually FEEL the debris hitting your feet as they are shot around.On carpet , this vacuum does better , but again , it will still kick dirt around.I want a vacuum that will suck dirt and debris up , not fling it around everywhere.Also , I 'm not sure if this is due to our having dogs in the house , but whenever I use this vacuum , it immediately disperses a terrible smell consisting of hair , dander , and dirt . I 'm not really experienced with different vacuums , but it seems to me that they should n't do this.I do not recommend buying this vacuum .	-1
VillaWare V5955 Grand Wrap Tortilla and Flatbread Makeris cheaply made . Does not make good product and broke on first use . Both hinges gone !	-1
i bought the utensil holder several years ago and it is long gone . i may have kept it for a year . it began to pit , rust , and corrode almost immediately . i loved the design because it is so contemporary but do not waste your money on this . i also think $ 99 is too much of a bargain for all these items . one is always best off buying fine utensils that are not in a `` set '' which often translates as poor quality lumped together for a presentation . i learned a long time ago that in cooking utensils and equipment , you pay for what you get and the high quality items are to be researched and purchased separately . i use equipment that is durable , efficient , and highly recommended by cooking professionals . this utensil holder ( and from what i have read , the utensils [ plastic spoons melted from the heat if left in the pan ! ! ! ] ) does not fall into the high quality category .	-1
I have had this 4 cup measuring cup for some time now , and have not been able to find a suitable replacement for it . It is horrible ! Do n't get me wrong , the concept is nice , but it does n't pour worth a darn ! I use it to put boiling water in my French Press , to make my coffee . Nearly every time , I have a fair portion spill out , and when you are working with boiling water , that is definitely NOT good ! I have the metal 2 cup version of this measuring cup , and it is excellent ! Why do n't they make the metal version of this one ? I would save my $ , and buy something else , were I you !	-1
This cup is cheap plastic . I would never pour hot liquid in it for fear of it breaking . The rubbery thing on the handle is just a place for mold/germs to hide and grow . The measuring gimmick is a good one but does n't overcome the downsides . I expect the red marking to soon disappear making it all but impossible to read too . Stay with the tried and true glass measuring cups . When you wash them , you know they are completely clean .	-1
The bottom line is these are polycarbonate measuring cups . The issues with polycarbonate besides the possible health concerns with BPA , is that it tends to crack with use . Definitely do n't use these in your dish washer as it will cause them to develop cracks . One of mine actually started leaking today and it is only a couple years old . I would expect a measuring cup to last a life time . I wo n't be buying these again.Pros : Easy to read measurements.Convenient sizesCons : Polycarbonate ( both BPA and can crack/leak ) Pouring can be a challenge , do n't go to fast or you will make a messBottom Line : Avoid these and get glass or a food safe BPA free plastic that will also be more durable .	-1
My cup blistered . The company rep told me that they are not to be used in the microwave or put in the dishwasher . They did replace it , but I noticed on the new cup that were no instructions regarding use .	-1
The markings along the side do n't even match those seen from above . Not that this matters , because both are inaccurate . To the point that it can ruin a recipe for baked goods.In short , it 's a great idea , but this measuring cup is so sloppily manufactured that it 's pretty much useless .	-1
Returned it just did n't meet the requirements we had . It was way too short n too wide not like the pic	-1
do n't know if it works or not ... ( see review on the Ball jar wide mouth half gallon jars with lidss )	-1
will not work on most wide mouth jars ... it is more trouble than it is worth	-1
I have tried to use this to seal & # 34 ; canning & # 34 ; jars . The sealer may work but the seal is so tight that it pulls the lids right back off of the jars , breaking the seal and letting air back in to them .	-1
I watched a bunch of videos of this product prior to purchasing . They all showed it working flawlessly , every time . My experience has been WAY different . Usually takes at least 8 to 10 attempts to get even a moderate seal . Most times , if it seals at all , the lid comes off with the sealer . Most of the rest of the time , the lid does n't seal at all.Very occasionally , I get a seal that survives removing the sealer . About half of the times that I do get it to seal , the lid is very easy to remove with just your fingers . No spoon needed to pry it off - obviously not a good seal.Save your money .	-1
I dont know what I am missing but ... there is a hole on top of the sealer . Once I suck all the air out of the jar then the air can just come right back in ... what is the point ?	-1
The wide mouth version works really wellBut the regular mouth version does n't work very well.It might be the sealer/vac pump I have is n't strong enough , but I find I have follow a very specific procedure to get the jars to stay sealed with any lowered pressure inside the jar.Also the rubber ring that helps preserve the seal comes off far too easily requiring that I often have to put the rubber ring back in place after every few jars . Wetting the outside of the ring before sealing helps though	-1
At first I had the problem with it not sealing the lid also . After some investigation , I notice that the pump is acutally holding the lid up and away from the jar during vacuuming . When the pump stopped , the air slowly flowed back around the lid and into the jar . ( Excuse me for I 'm about to go scientific here ) This slow movement of the air creates a pretty much equal pressure on both sides of the lid , therefore keeping the lid `` afloat '' . The solution is to create a greater pressue on the topside of the lid than the bottom side of the lid . However , the clear plastic tube that 's attached to the jar sealer has such a narrow channel that it wo n't allow the pressure to build up fast enough to `` press '' the lid down before air is leaked back into the jar.The trick is to remove the tube quickly from the jar sealer while holding the jar sealer down on the lid . The hole on the jar sealer itself is large enough to build up air pressure quickly , but you must do it fast or else you 'll let air back into the jar.This is exactly how I do it:1 ) Move the jar right next to the food saver2 ) Hold the jar sealer on top of the jar with the thumb and index finger while pressing the power button on the food saver with other fingers of the same hand . Not very easy at first , but with practice it should become second nature.3 ) With the other hand , hold the plug of the tube that 's attached to the jar sealer.4 ) Once the FoodSaver switches from vacuum to seal , quickly yank out the plug of the tube.Now the lid should be tightly sealed against the jar.I gave it 2 stars for bad engineering , but I do n't regret buying it .	-1
For whatever reason I can not get this to seal the regular mouth jars at all without having the lid come off every single time no matter how clean it is and how clean the jar rim is . I use the wide mouth sealer with no problems so I am not sure what the problem is . Maybe you will have better luck if you decide to purchase but , for me , I will stick with the wide mouth jars for sealing dry ingredients .	-1
My 12 year old could design a better unit ! In spite of what you read , I believe the compensation and tricks are n't worth it . I must admit that I do n't have a $ 150 Food Savor , ridiculous money to spend just to evacuate the jar ! This product has a major design flaw ; it only has only two points of contact inside the cap ( whereas the wide mouth one has 3 symmetrically placed spacers as opposed to just 2 ) ; thus allowing the lid to seal asymmetrically . I use a simple hand pump plus tubing to fit an enlarged hole AND the following modifications.SOLUTION : I USE an Actron CP7830 Hand Vacuum Pump to pump out the air from Bell jars ( which happen to be filled with chile powder + an adsorption bag ) . The solution comes in part from someone else in the comment blog who noticed that if you invert a 2nd jar lid , place it on top of the one to be sealed on the jar , and place the FoodSaver regular mouth over the stack , a vacuum can be achieved . This solution was messy because invariably one lid will end up not in alignment , and therefore , a vacuum ca n't be achieved . So , I decided to take silicone glue and put a blob of glue on each of the two standing ribs inside the Foodsaver cap and then place the lid upside down into place . The result is the 2nd lid , now , is held in place which makes it easier to carefully lower the cap assembly down on the jar with the sealing cap in place . You must achieve a perfect alignment with the cap centered over the jar , otherwise leakage will occur . I sealed 12 4oz . jars filled with chile powder w/o too many mistakes . Once in a while the blue rubber seal ring in the cap will come out as you pull off the assembly . You then should clean it and simply put it back . ( Gluing the blue rubber seal inside the cap is a possible solution ) .The second part of the solution involves the use of the Actron CP7830 Hand Vacuum Pump . Should you go this route , you will have to throw out everything , but the pump itself ; you then must buy 1-2 ' of 1/4 '' O.D . translucent white tubing from the hardware store plus a 1/4 '' drill bit . Hopefully you have a variable speed , hand power drill . You must use this drill to drill into , BUT NOT COMPLETELY through THE SMALLER HOLE ON BOTH THE SMALL AND LARGE FOODSAVER CAP . This makes it possible for you to twist/push the tubing into the cap ; the other end is pressed on the pumps male pipe.With the above modifications , I would have rated this at 3 stars.I think both large and small caps are poorly designed and should be retooled .	-1
If I could I would give this 1.5 stars . It does work , sort of . It certainly does not deliver the vacuum seal that I was lead to believe it would . It seals , but not enough that you would want to lay the bottle on its side again . Knowing what I know now , I would not buy this again and it was just not worth my effort to return it .	-1
This product is a waste of money . Like another reviewer , one of the four stoppers was torn on top . The pump & # 34 ; handle & # 34 ; came off on my first pump . Any suction created is immediately lost when I take the pump off the topper . This is a horrible product , did n't even work on one bottle for me . I tried pumping slow , fast , did n't matter , it never worked . As soon as I pull the pump off , the stopper lets all the air right back into the bottle . Save your money for a different product that actually works .	-1
IS this a joke ? This thing does not hold any suction whatsoever . Stop wasting peoples money on scam products . Garbage !	-1
This item was a disappointment . We have the older white version and the previous version of stoppers . We bought this as we needed more stoppers . They do not work . We tested the vacuum seal of the new stoppers against the older version and these new redesigned ones simply do not seal . Too bad , as we do prefer the sleek look of this black Vacu Vin version . Oh well , Item returned .	-1
The handle broke as soon as I started pumping . I was willing to overlook this as long as it vacuumed ( I pumped without the handle ) , but the stopper did not make a click noise as advertised . My wine did not stay fresh : (	-1
I 've been using the Vacu Vin for probably about as long as they 've been making them , and still had a good one with plenty of stoppers before I bought this `` Concerto '' model . I bought it because of the `` click '' the user is supposed to hear when the right amount of air has been pumped out of the wine bottle , for the obvious reason that I did n't want to keep pumping when there was no need to . The problem is that after using this model multiple times , I have yet to hear it click , so I might as well have just stayed with the older device I had . Since this thing is apparently clicking away for most reviewers , my case is probably just an isolated one ( or maybe in my advanced years I 'm just not robust enough to pump to the click -- though I 'm skeptical that that 's the problem ) .	-1
I could not get this to work for me . Would not fit any wine bottles . Looked around and found a better one .	-1
This was a great pan and one that we used everyday . It was a little on the small side for a family of 4 but was great for for most tasks . Then just a few weeks ago , I noticed that the nonstick coating was bubbling . Another week went by and an entire patch started coming off . I am now giving up on buying anything with a nonstick coating and am now going with stainless steel instead . Just seems like a waste of metal to have to replace these nonstick pans every two years .	-1
The coffeemaker states only in it 's manual that flavored coffee wo n't work in it 's grinder which necessitates a second stand alone grinder . $ [ ... ] bucks and it wo n't grind flavored coffee ! ! I get good coffee when I use the regular unflavored variety ..IF the grinder does n't grind the entire hopper of beans instead of the required amount . the design idea to keep the grinder away from the steam/water is smart but if you are the coffee drinker type that likes variety including flavored beans avoid this machine . note : you have no convenient way to empty the bean hopper if you want to change coffee to another type before you exhaust your current hopper supply	-1
I liked it for grinding up wheat grass in green Odwalla until the motor started spewing out black metallic powder and quit after about 3 months . Plan on using your warranty if any , if you go with this . The 600 watt Cuisanart best buy looks like the one I want to try next . That should be enough power and run longer than this one did .	-1
Got my Juiceman Blender for Christmas 2002 . Crushed some ice with it.. worked very well . I thought , & quot ; This is Great ! & quot ; . I was all excited.Next , I try to make some nut butter , following the directions in the booklet to the T. After blending for about 15 seconds , the motor blew . Now I have to send it back , and wait for a new model . Some Christmas gift ! I wo n't be able to use it again until February ! Now , why put a recipe for nut butter inside your booklet when the thing obviously ca n't handle it ? The same thing happened with my Juiceman Juicer when I tried to blend a frozen banana . It says it will come out like & quot ; Soft-Serve & quot ; ice cream , but the motor died.This blender has all the power in the world . It sounded like an airplane taking off when I turned it on high , but the motor gives out way too easily . I would have thought it was a fluke , but after reading others comments , I can see this machine is just poorly made .	-1
This popcorn maker is a joke . It is a novelty piece that is not functional . It pops half of your popcorn , or shall I say about a third of what you put in . It also pops out kernels everywhere and you can get burnt by one of the kernels if you are not careful . What a poorly designed popcorn maker . Ordered the Cuisinart one and that will be coming in a few days , will throw this one in the trash .	-1
We got about 6 pops total , over a few months , out of this junk before the thing went nuts and made a bunch of noise and then burned up inside . We got it unplugged quick enough before the outlet burned . Fire hazard !	-1
This is a really neat looking popper and when I got it out of the box I was very excited with the thought of all that wonderful popcorn . What a MAJOR disappointment . First of all , after carefully following the instructions , this popper began shooting out VERY HOT unpopped kernels . It did not matter how large a bowl I used or at what angle the bowl was placed ( the cute wheels get in the way ) , unpopped , and later in the cycle , popped corn shot out all over the place . The unpopped corn shot out with such velocity that they bounced off of the bowl and into my face , on the floor , on the counter , everywhere ! ! ! I used this popper 5 times and in every case less that half of the kernels were popped ( most exited at high velocity and with a few popping outside of the machine ! ) . Some of the hot kernels landed on the floor and damaged my floor covering leaving burnt marks ! I returned the popper for a refund.I recommend that you not waste your time or money on this popper ...	-1
Okay , this is absolutely adorable popcorn popper and I got mine from my neighbor , however , I can only pop small batches otherwise I get A LOT of unpopped kernels . I 've noticed my popcorn seems stale too , but I am not exactly sure if it is the popper or the popcorn itself .	-1
I boxed this up after two uses . It is rather large for the counter and it makes more noise than it is worth . I will try to sell it used .	-1
I received this popper as a gift , and while it looks nice , it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine . I have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn . Nothing worked . If I had the receipt it would already have been returned . Since I do n't , it is going in the garbage . Also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine . Stay away from this machine .	-1
After only 3 uses , the heating unit failed . What a piece of crap ! Do not waste your money .	-1
I read about this great two motor system and had to have it.So I went to Sears who was out of it ; but assured me there was a new model with the same features coming out.I then went back and discovered the changes . ( Red power reach piece of crap ) So I called Dirt Devil and was repeatedly reassured by a less then `` all here '' person that they were exactly the same.THEY ARE NOT THE SAME MACHINE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! So going on faith I decided to buy the machine thinking it was me not them.I then noticed the vacuun fan that uses the suction of the machine to turn the power nozzle.Assuming that I made a mistake I kept it . ( I have to learn to return things I do n't like . ) Now I read the reviews and realize that I was screwed too.Dirt Devil is a deceitful company.Of course as soon as you touch carpeting with any force the nozzle quits turning .	-1
We purchased this machine 4 years ago . We used it twice ( for a total of 12 hours , at the most ) and were pleased with the performance . However , the motor died 2 hours into the third use . We called Dirt Devil , but they would not compromise on the 2 year warranty .	-1
Nice packaging , convenient canister design is very easy to use adn lightweight , BUT:1 . You have to empty the canister about every 10 minutes in order to maintain decent suction,2 . Emptying it is a pain , you get covered in dust and practically have to use your fingers to get debris out of the filter.We resold ours and opted for a Dyson instead , which cost almost 4 times as much but worked like a dream !	-1
At first I beat 3 egg whites with the mixer . It went great and super fast . Second , I made two loafs of egg bread ( about a total of 7 cups of flour ) . I took my eyes off the machine for a moment and the dough had worked its way up over the dough hook to the head of the machine , which is impossible to clean . Needless to say , I am returning the machine . I have two boys at home that eat a lot and making bread dough , one bread at a time , is just not working for me . Also , it was not smooth at all at incorporating the dough . The dough just clung in one long lump on the hook and not much was happening . Very frustrating baking experience .	-1
Bought this device in Green , years ago.NOW the paint is peeling off and the bare metal looks like Hell .	-1
My mother had a KitchenAid Accolade that I absolutely loved . Unfortunately the Accolade was discontinued in 2006 . I purchased the Artisan because I wanted a tilt head stand mixer and it seem like the best alternative to the Accolade . I am extremely disappointed in this mixer it can barely handle one batch on cookies . Whenever I make cookies the mixer is very loud , it skips and jumps about a 1/4 inch off the counter . I wish I could give this mixer a higher review but I feel like it is not stable and may break soon .	-1
I really expected more from this device than it delivers.The motor is not strong , particularly when dealing with bread dough.Finicky and difficult to clean , I have a collection of scrubbers , bottle brushes and pokers to make sure that residue is not present after use.Attachments are good , but very , very expensive.Would not buy again	-1
I bought a kitchenAid stand mixer for light use at home to make cookies and now the machine is leaking oil . Apparently this is a common problem because if you search the internet about this machine leaking oil you will find several blogs where hundreds of people complain about it . Please do research about this machine before you buy it . By the way , my daughter just got one for xmast and hers is also leaking oil . Check out this site and you 'll see how common this problem is and how the Kitchenaid company refuses to fix this problem . [ ... ]	-1
I 've had a number of Mixmasters over the past 50 years and they 've always been built to last . I 'm not so sure about this one . I bought it to knead dough and the first time I used it I thought the top unit was going to come loose from the mixing stand . I do n't know whether it 's a quality or build issue , but it 's not as well built as my earlier ones . We 'll see .	-1
For All metal gears look hereKitchenAid KP26M1PSL Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer , SilverAll I wanted was a kitchenaid like my mothers . One that is still alive after 20+ years.I was given this one . Excited as I went off to the races mixing and beating and kneading.And then it started in the first 6 months . The locking didnt lock well , the gears began to grind , and the top began popping up and down . Further research showed me that these new artisans are NOT the same and have PLASTIC ( EDIT : NYLON ) gears that wear down and begin having issues . Mine is only getting worse with time . I have always followed their recommendations as to max amounts , especially with bread kneading but alas my gears still began to break down.KitchenAid customer service claimed to me this change was made for engineering purposes , however , I believe this is economic purposes.If Nylon pieces break down maybe they 're cheaper in the first place , or maybe the fact that some users will have to replace the entire mixer.Everyone I know with an old KitchenAid mixer from 20+ years ago still has theirs in perfect condition AND kneaded bread with them . So you do the math.Their customer service also claimed to me if I want all metal gear assembly to purchase a more expensive version.Their exact response to me as follows : '' Thank you for visiting the KitchenAid web site ! We appreciate the opportunity to respond to your inquiry . I apologize for any inconvenience.In response to your concern regarding the construction of the Stand Mixer gearbox and gears , KitchenAid has made the decision to change to an all metal gearbox on most of the larger mixers , the Pro 600 6 QT , not because of problems with the plastic transmission cover , but because KitchenAid is always looking for ways to try new materials and update all of our appliances , and this change was an engineering decision.I can assure you that both the plastic and the metal housings are extremely durable and should have a long life under normal use . The Artisan is produced with nylon and metal gearing . `` I 'm so dissapointed overall , especially considering these come with dough hooks ( ie should be able to handle the wear/tear ) AND I always followed manufacturer recommendations of use.My advice ? Spend the money the first time and go for the Pro 600 6 QT . I 've heard other ones in the pro series at 450watts or higher are all metal gears also . A MUST have for kneading bread or fast mixing .	-1
First , I want to make it clear that my one star is purely for the poor product and very disappointing experience of KitchenAid 's customer service . As far as my experience with Amazon goes , they deserve five stars - product arrived quickly and packed well - Amazon refunded my money promptly when I returned the mixer.I used the mixer just three times to make bread according to the recipe book included . From the beginning the mixer shook after just a minute of kneading the dough , then the locking mechanism worked loose and finally the top raised up in the middle of mixing making the whole machine unstable . Despite raising and lowering the beater according to the instructions , nothing worked to prevent this issue with the locking mechanism so I called KitchenAid who promised to send out a new mixer and email me the tracking number as soon as it was shipped.After four days there was still no email so I decided as I was now very close to Amazon 's deadline to return the mixer for a refund , I returned it to Amazon and called KitchenAid to cancel the replacement . I was told they had in fact shipped it already and when I asked why I did n't receive the tracking email I was told that they only 'sometimes email the tracking number ' . I asked for advice on how best to return it when it arrived since I no longer needed it . The agent was very unhelpful and initially told me I would likely have to return it at my own expense . I asked to speak to a supervisor since I would not have returned it to Amazon if I had received the shipping email as promised . The supervisor agreed to email return shipping labels but said I would now have to wait until it arrived at my home before calling back and requesting the labels . When I called to ask for the return labels I was then told it would take another 24 - 48 hours for them to be emailed . I felt I was getting the runaround with each phone call and having experienced their unhelpful customer service I have now decided not to buy another KitchenAid mixer but to look for an alternative brand.The best thing about this mixer ? The lovely red color - it looked perfect with my kitchen color scheme !	-1
I bought one of these ( in red ) several years ago -- it lasted a whopping 3 years , then died . Since the warranty is only 1 year , I was forced to buy another ( let 's face it , this is supposed to be the gold standard in kitchen mixers ) . I somewhat assumed it was a fluke that a nearly four hundred dollar mixer would crash in 3 years , so I bought a second one ( in black ) . Yet 2 years later , that one died to ( this week ) . The newer model died sooner than the old model ! And again , the warranty is only one year . How can Kitchen Aid expect consumers to pay so much for a mixer and only warranty it for a year ? Because they know the quality is nil . For fifty bucks , I can buy a new mixer by a different company every six months and still come out ahead than I did on my KitchenAid mixers . Too expensive , low quality , and no warranties to back up their products . Shame on you , Kitchen Aid .	-1
For anything that needs to mix for longer than a few seconds , the bowl gets stuck onto the stand . I contacted KitchenAid about this issue . The sent me a replacement piece for the metal base that the bowl nestles into . Was better the first few times I used it , but then the same problem kept occurring . It 's kind of useless when you ca n't get the bowl off the place to pour/scrape out the mixture .	-1
This mixer nearly burnt itself up and shook itself apart trying to knead a 5-cup , 2-loaf all-purpose flour bread recipe . It was rattling like a old Jeep off roading , and we were smelling smoke after 5 minutes of this thing running on low-medium ... It probably does OK on cakes and stuff that a hand mixer can handle , but really ... this thing should be able to handle a simple white bread recipe without blowing up . Its nothing like the rock solid , 25 year-old KitchenAid mixer I used to have . So sad that quality in this country is just gone.I returned it . One star for the mixer , one star extra for Amazon 's good return policy .	-1
The can opener stopped working within 3 weeks of purchasing it . I tried charging it but it still would not work . I would never buy this product again . I do n't blame the seller i blame the company that manufactures the item .	-1
It was kinda hard to use and after about 6 months it just stopped even though I always kept it charged . Since this is the type of product youmight take camping I do n't recommend it because it 's not reliable.I used it once or sometimes twice a day ... .no more so I really thinkit should have lasted longer .	-1
Walked right out of my kitchen . The idea was fine , but it was difficult to start and failed to get the job done .	-1
Cute little can opener that works well enough as long as it 's charged . Unfortunately it wo n't work with the power cord if the batteries are dead . You have to charge it up after every use or it might be dead the next time you use it . Because it requires charging and you have no idea how much juice is left in the batteries it 's kind of a hassle to get the charger cord out and deal with charging it up before putting it away.I would not recommend this device as the main can opener in the house . It might be useful on a camping trip if you have portable power that you can charge it up on later . Otherwise get a can opener that uses AC only and you 'll not have to deal with dead can openers .	-1
I bought this a few years ago because my Mom has arthritis in her fingers . Sorry but its not easy to use & its been stored in the closet for a long time now .	-1
Lasted about 1/2 year before getting so slow it was stoping every 1/2 of a inch . Not worst it . Junk	-1
Do not waste your money on this item . First time I used it the lever broke off . I put it back on and tried again . No luck . Fell off again . After 3 times I decided this was a piece of junk . Do not buy this item ! ! ! !	-1
When I received this item it was packaged with the wrong power cord , which did n't fit the unit . So I was n't even able to use this unit .	-1
First off , let me just start by saying that my one-star rating is not because of the product , nor Amazon.com . In fact , I never even used the product before I returned it . The 'problem ' with this electric skillet is its size -- it 's enormous . I ordered it because we 're cooking for six ( or more , at times ) , and I thought a 16 & quot ; skillet would be great . However , I failed to take into account the size of our dishwasher . The electric skillet does n't fit into our dishwasher , and wo n't fit into most standard dishwashers , at least none that I 've seen . That the skillet is fully submersible and dishwasher safe is one of its strong points . Not being able to stick it in the dishwasher was enough of a downside for me to return it . I 'll be purchasing its 12 & quot ; cousin as soon as I 'm credited for my 16 & quot ; skillet 's return .	-1
The blender had to be shipped back to Hamilton Beach for repairs . We had the blender expire while making cookies . This was only the third time we had used the blender . The previous complaints were avoid similar models and go with a more powerful blender such as the 64695 . I would have preferred just purchasing a kitchenaid to start with . Tech support is good - we are awaiting the replacement model .	-1
With such rave reviews on Amazon , decided it 's time for my old electric grill to retire and get a new Zojirushi.Not going to rewrite all the good parts , plenty of other reviews . Here 's the problems I encountered:1 . The electric cord that connects to the grill pan does not stay fixed . Just by lightly bumping or having a fan blowing on it loosed it and the grill had no power . This was the main reason why I was getting a new grill , my old 10yr old grill had that problem . Should not happen on a new $ 65 grill . Maybe it 's just a defect.2 . Slightly on the small side . Max 2 people , anymore than 2 = lot of waiting around.3 . Smoke free - Not sure how everyone else got it to be smoke free , the smoke was clearly visible when I used it indoors . Yes , it 's slightly better than my old one , but definitely can not qualify as smoke free.I 'm a big fan of Zojirushi products , got the 10cup induction rice cooker , hot water pot , hot pot cooker , this grill was going to complete the Zojirushi set , unfortunately have to return it and try another brand .	-1
I spent $ 39.99 on this coffeemaker . When I received it , I thought ... '' this thing is about $ 20-25 overpriced . '' Still , I tried it by running hot water through it as instructed . First , why is there an ON button ? ? It does n't depress and does n't work ! The unit came on as soon as I plugged it in . Trying hitting the ON button to shut it off and it still does n't work . Better have that cup under the unit before plugging it in . Second , I know that it is a compact unit , but it is SLOW . I can only imagine how it pumps once it is also going through coffee grounds . Since the unit is defective ( ON button ) and not up to my expectatations , this was returned.As I review this , I notice that the price has dropped to about $ 22 . Much better price , but still not worth it in my opinion .	-1
I seldom use this unless I have company.Yes , it is elegant looking , but if you do n't pour slowly , it drips . Very annoying .	-1
We had this less than 10 months and used only two of three Ultimate filters we purchased separately , that 's how little use this pitcher got . Started leaking everywhere one day and I could n't figure out what had happened . I thought I had n't put the innards back in right , after changing the filter , but in the end I decided either a seal or a seam failed.I 'm not the first person to report the leaking problem with minimal use , so I believe it is a design or manufacturing flaw . What a waste of a good $ 60 , with the additional three filters purchased.While it worked , we loved its sleek design , how much water it held and how great the water tasted . That 's why it gets the two stars I gave it . Too bad it turned out to be a piece of junk.I see the item is now not available here at Amazon and I guess that means someone monitored the returns or complaints about the product and made changes or pulled the item from sales rotation.What I want to know is when we will be notified by Pur about the problem , and given coupons or rebates because of it ; if you sent in your warranty card or registered the product online there is no reason Pur could n't offer somehting in exchange for their poorly designed item.Mine 's now in the trash where it belongs . Do n't buy one if you are considering it . Go with a good quality , faucet-mounted or under-sink mount filtering system and you will be glad you did , despite the more expensive price .	-1
I love water filters , this perhaps is my third , first was a Brita , gave to family member years ago and it is still in use , went on to faucet style but prefer pitchers , then to this Ultra . This pitcher leaks , I suspect it is the style , leak is not big-time , but pitcher will have to be replaced wayyyy too soon in a household where there is no rough treatment of kitchen items . I am NOT happy.Elaine	-1
I do n't know what it was but the container would keep leaking around the bottom . The company was nice enough to give me another one free but that one too leaked . I honestly think it a design flaw.The water seemed to be tasty enough , definitely better than Brita filters , but had to be changed too often for my taste . The best thing you could do is by a reverse osmosis filter for the home . I only have to change mine once a year and the water tastes great as I have technologically verified as more pure than the tap .	-1
Do n't buy it . It came broken the first time . Than I had to hound them to replace it and when I got the replacements They two were broken again . I gave up .	-1
$ 65/pair is a really ridiculous price for this item . Looks like Eleven Adar and a few other unscrupulous 3rd party merchants are taking advantage of the limited availability for these filters .	-1
Once a prestigious name in cutlry , Sabatier 's name is nowused by importer of cheap knives from eitherKorea or China , Neither country has learned thefineart of metalurgy and the blades , though stamped ( rather than forged ) from `` stainless steel are both too soft to hold a lasting edge , too coarse to even acquire a `` razor-sharp edge and rust resistance is questionable ( though handwashing and immediatedrying is always reccommended for finecutlery . ...	-1
These knives are terrible . The soft , poor quality of steel used will not hold a sharp edge for any length of time . I 'm not talking about if you put them in the dishwasher ( never put knives in a dishwasher ... ) , I 'm talking about if you actually cut anything with them , the blades immediately dull , and a dull knife is an accident waiting to happen . I bought some cheap Chefmate knives some years back which are getting ratty so I bought these to replace them , but the Chefmate ones blow these away . I ended up buying a couple of good quality knives individually because I could n't use these.The up side is that the block is ok , the scisors are handy and the steak knives are serrated , so do n't actually need to be sharp . If 4 steak knives , a wood block and a good pair of kitchen scisors are woth the price , then by all means go for it , and replace the other knives with something better .	-1
This set worked fine for a couple months then , the steak knives could only tear at meat . Save your money for a good set , I have n't found one yet .	-1
I am long time wustof user and have many sets of these . bought these and several cheaper sets . these are great knives but 3 times the cost of cheaper sets . nothing wrong with the knives but I now know what I pay for brand name.After washing these in dishwasher several times , I am getting rust on these knives . Since they are stainless , this amazed me . I found you have to prewash to get all the grease off or you will get rust . because of this I had to drop the rating to 1 star . Interestingly I have another full set of wustof on my butcher block . they do not get rusty so I think the metal quality in these can not be as good as their other knifeware.Update : Years after posting this review I am still getting comments from people telling me not to wash them in the dishwasher . Of course I knew this but I am too busy to spend my valuable time hand washing and drying knives . In addition , I have classic series Wusthof collections that go to the dishwasher and never rust . This started me thinking why . One other Amazon reviewer evidently researched the type of stainless steel used in the Gourmet series which is what I bought here . The issue could be lack of enough molybdenum in the stainless steel . Molybdenum is expensive and is getting more scarce . Research the web and you will find that you need molybdenum in your stainless steel to prevent corrosion . Another review on the web also states that the Gourmet series will rust . [ ... ] So my conclusion is that cheap stainless steel knives probably have cheap stainless steel in them and can be prone to rust . Spend your time hand cleaning them and you may not get rust . You get what you pay for so I should not complain too much .	-1
These were quite expensive and I thought I was treating myself to something lasting and of superior quality . I realize that they are supposed to come apart for better cleaning , but I found them coming apart whenever I tried to use them , which rather defeated the purpose . Back to the cheap ones for me !	-1
Since they detach for sharpening when I open them to cut they fly apart quite often . These have a difficult time cutting even the string off of my tea bags . Very disappointed , wish I had returned them .	-1
This knife is extremely sharp and the sealed plastic packaging is very difficult to open . I cut myself badly when I attempted to open the package and needed stitches to close the cut.Because of this , I have not used it and it stays at the side of the knife drawer unused .	-1
I had high hopes for this mandoline . However , it does a horrible job with slicing mushrooms . I have yet to try slicing anything else because I 'm so discouraged ...	-1
I read many of the rave reviews , but this was one Amazon purchase I have regretted . This is a precision German kitchen tool ( extremely sharp ! ) , no doubt about that . But in my opinion , it 's inappropriate for casual home use . First , there is a cumbersomeness to it when taking it in and out of its protective container - I thought I would accidentally cut myself so many times . The plastic pieces are meant to be easy to remove and put together , but they get jammed together , but leaving them out for convenience would mean danger . The pain of having to be this extra careful prohibits casual use ( i.e. , not worth using for slicing potatoes for only 4 people ) . I also did not want my four year old to be watching me use it , lest she try it on her own when I am not around ( you know children ) . I have decided to give it away today . To be fair , it 's a great product for a caterer or a small start up restaurant .	-1
junk , wish I could return it , there is no way to adjust slice settings , this is as old as the 1980 's ... a waste of money .	-1
Sliced tomato really nice ... but making fries out of a potato almost crushed the cheap plastic as I tried to get it through the slicer . Even with the guard it was horrid trying too pass the potato through . I felt I needed a whack with a hammer to push it through and I was afraid my hand would slip off the guard into the blades ... Very disappointedEnded up with the one made by OXO , because it was America 's Test Kitchen number one recommendation . I love it . It has four thickness levels to choice from ... more blades and it works . The blades are also super SHARP . It has rubber feet that hold it in place better . You can elevate it at one end . Most important , the plastic housing does n't feel like it will break , when pressure is applied while slicing fries . As for the one made in Germany , I had hoped it would be better , but it 's not . For a few dollars more , go with OXO . Hope this was helpful .	-1
I 've tried to slice a few things with this mandoline - potatoes , tomatoes , cucumbers , carrots . The plastic is too flexible to produce an even slice every time . It 's also not adjustable unless you consider the amount of pressure you apply to be that adjustment . Waste of money and space . Buy a good knife .	-1
I was replacing old Mandoline and this did not fulfill that . I returned this item . Blade was dull and hard to use with dull blade . I tried cutting a vegetable and not only was it difficult but it stained the surface of the Mandoline . This one not for me .	-1
Upon reading other reviews I placed order for this unit . When it arrived I was dismayed at what you get for this money . Upon using I became more dismayed as the unit is almost impossible to use . The food drags on the slide . Using the holder helps move the food but it only cuts about half way down and then you are left with the other half to cut by hand with a knife and cutting board . Kind of defeats the purpose . Plastic is flimsy and distorts when food is pushed through causing irregular cuts . For this much money much improvement is expected . I do n't recommend . In fact I returned this and got a Bron which is the original mandoline maker . Will see how that works when it arrives . A cutting board and knife would be faster and easier to clean than this plastic thing . I wonder if some of the other favorable reviews were placed on Amazon by the manufacturer .	-1
I just used this the other day to julienne some zucchini . The other reviewer was right ... That stupid holder is a piece of crap and useless . First of all ... it does not hold the food very well and second when I did get it to hold ( only by pressure ) it did not glide well on the board . Its just slippery all over the place . In the picture it looks like it has tracks of some sort to help it glide but no . I was tempted to just julienne by holding it with my hand but those blades look mighty sharp . After I used it there was so much of the zucchini left over it was a waste and I had to end up using a knife to finish the rest . Whats the point then ? I suppose this will be good to use if your using your hands and not the holder but I would n't recommend it .	-1
I know I am a minority here , but I just want to share w/ everyone my 2 cents . This gadget obviously does n't work for me . I bought it because of all the great reviews . I cook daily and I fequently julienne vegetables like carrots , zuchini , daikon turnips by hand and it 's not my favorate part of cooking . The first time I used the V-slicer I was trying to cut carrots into match-stick sizes ( juliennes ) . The red carot juice stained the white plastic board right away and despite immediately rinsing and washing w/ detergents it would n't come off . I did n't try bleach because I ca n't imaging using bleach on food related items . The blades are really sharp , but as I worked to process the veggies it made a huge mess - I had to use a giant bowl below to catch the `` debris '' , and I almost cut myself when I tried to wipe the little food pieces off the board surface . I tried it a second time with some other vegetables and although the cuts looked good I just did n't think it 's worth the time and effort to use it and clean up later ( I cook for myself , so it 's not very time consuming to do everything by hand ) . When I have company , I take out my food processor for large volumn processing . To me , the cleaning trouble is about the same for my food processor and the V-slicer . A good sharp knife is obviously the best investment if you have a very small family to feed .	-1
The & # 34 ; Ambidextrous Food Safety holder & # 34 ; does not work . The prongs that are supposed to hold food the food are way too long , so that half the food remains unsliced - assuming that they hold the food in the first place , which they usually do n't . Even then , it is not very ergonomic - it 's just difficult to use . So , you end up hold the food with your hands , and nearly slice your finger off . Well , that was my experience anyway .	-1
I bought this for slicing sweet potatoes for dog treats . It works well ; however , it takes some getting used to and is very awkward at first -- which is every time I use it . I do n't slice frequently -- just large lots at a time . I do like that I can get nice thick slices and that it stores together easily.UPDATE : Six months later , three pins fell out of the safety holder and now the mandolin is useless until I get a new safety holder . I contacted customer service and was told where to buy another safety holder ( another $ 10 ) , as well as given suggestion to wet potato before slicing ... . No longer satisfied with product as it does n't perform as expected .	-1
I just could not afford this mandoline . These Swiss mandolines seem to be very good but they are also much more expensive ... than I have the money for .	-1
This looked like such a great little Christmas gift to give to my husband who is gaining interest in loose teas . Fortunately for me , I was curious to see how it looked because `` teaball '' tells me `` round object , '' and the picture looked like it 's of half the teaball ... Anyway , I tried to open the teaball , and it would n't even move ! ! ! ! I 'm glad I did n't give a defective gift . You may want to consider a different product .	-1
We find this toaster to have all the features two people like us would use . The Bagel feature is outstanding . The controls are easy to use and everything toasts evenly.Another fine product from KitchenAid.WELL , THAT WAS THEN AND NOW WE HAVE FOUND IT TO BE OF VERY POOR QUALITY . AFTER A FEW USES IT NO LONGER WILL BROWN THE BREAD WHEN SET ON HIGH , ONLY LIGHTLY . THE WARRANTY IS WORTHLESS AND THERE IS NOT OBVIOUS WAY TO ADJUST IT .	-1
I purchased this toaster after reading about it in Consumer Reports , it was rated # 2or # 3 , It performs terrible , the toast levels are nonexistent you have to move the lever all the way to the `` dark '' side to get minimully toasted color . Directions say the moisture content of the bread will cause the toast to come out different , i found that that was of no consequence to the outcome . I would love to return it to Amazon ; however we discarded the box by mistake with the Christmas wrappings .	-1
I bought this 13 months ago and just recently realised how painful it is to use on my rugs . My entire flat has hardwood floors except for the area rug in the living room and a runner down the hallway . I 've been vacuuming with a push broom for 13 months.If I remember right , it seemed to work ok at first , but it 's become a struggle to get it to pick up dust , cat hair , and anything loose on the rugs since then . I tried it on bare floors but it is so loud that I do n't like to run it all over the flat . Besides , it wo n't pick up cat food , cat litter , or crumbs so I end up having to sweep anyways.It has an annoying high pitched sound and quite loud for a small , 6-amp unit . It seems louder than the full-sized I replaced it with . It also tends to tip and fall very easily.I ordered the full-sized 'Bissell 35766 Cleanview II Plus ' and received it a few days ago . I put it together and decided to give it a test run . I had just used the EasyVac 3 days earlier so I knew there was n't much to pick up -- or was there ? I ran through the full-size for a quick test run and went to wrap the cord up and was shocked to see the dust cup was completely full ! ! It was disgustingly full ! You do n't realize what the EasyVac does n't pick up , until you run a real vacuum after it . I may consider keeping it as a glorified hand vac , but it is not useful to me otherwise .	-1
The Bissell 3198 EasyVac Powerbrush does not have enough power to do large jobs and when you shut it off the dirt that is in the head falls out onto the surface you have just cleaned . It is OK for `` dust bunnies '' but does not have adequate power for sand or dirt .	-1
Waste of money . Double wall insulated thermos from Starbucks and David 's Tea are the absolute BEST ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
This mug leaks as much as a dog drools . The only way to manage this tumbler is not to travel with it . i would recommend the starbucks mugs since they leak a lot less and insulate your drink at least 50 % longer than this . maybe my hopes were too high for this mug ...	-1
When new , these mugs are really great . Keeps your coffee hot , more-or-less spill resistant if you get to it quickly enough . Definitely splash proof with the little snap-on lid.However ... after a couple of years , the rubber wears out and it becomes a dribble cup . Our cups have never seen the inside of a dishwasher . They have always been washed by hand . I have to hold a tissue or a paper towel in front of my cup to catch the dribbles that leak between the screw-on lid and the cup . Yes , it is screwed on properly and is tight . It just dribbles . It 's horribly embarrassing to have dribbles down the front of our shirts caused by these cups . And you should see the seat belt ! Yikes ! I just thought that with a name like Thermos , these cups would last longer than a couple of years.Going with Contigo this time . Dribble cups = trash time ! A few months after writing this review , I realized that the altitude may have something to do with the dribbling . I live at 7000 feet above sea level . I wonder ?	-1
At first I was pleased but now find the rubber piece on the bottom of two of mine have separated from the stainless base ! ! ! I took some high-powered glue and re-attached them but now I am buying the Nissan 18 ounce stainless `` hydration '' mug because there is no rubber base-ring at the bottom to separate , just to warn people this happened after having these for a few months . Otherwise keeps things warm or cold for a long time .	-1
They dont tell ya it 's leak-proof . Good thing too , because it 's not ! This thing leaks like crazy from the `` flip-top '' sip latch . The lid is also not insulated ( like the 14OZ version ) .With the aid of a little epoxy , I made the tumbler totally leak proof . However ; this defeated the flip-top , and turned it into a regular thermos.If you know your never going to lay this thing on it 's side , or slosh it around , no worries . Just dont expect to toss it in your back-pack or briefcase full of your favorite beverage ( like you can with the 14OZ version ) without getting soaked !	-1
I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it , though I think he had some trouble with the frother a few times . But after two years , it started leaking every time it was used -- coffee-colored water all over the counter . Looking at other reviewers ' experiences with the warranty process , I think I 'll just skip it and buy a new one . Probably better not to buy a coffee/espresso combo unit again , and definitely not a DeLonghi .	-1
this oven is junk - it will not turn off ( a slight fire hazzard ) .I am just holding on to it waiting for the product recall .	-1
A sun dial would be more use to us than the timer on this toaster oven . Jiggling helps but then it heats to the highest burning any bread we had hoped to toast.Calls to the manufacturer have been futile.The only thing retro about this item is the way it does n't work .	-1
I put mine in the freezer for at least 5 hours . Took it out placed my wine bottle in . When I opened the bottle one and a half hours later and the wine was n't chilled and the `` chiller '' part was n't cold anymore ? ! I will try it again after keeping the `` chiller '' in the freezer all night and see if that makes a difference . When I fill my ice trays they are frozen within 5 hours , so I 'm sure it was in the freezer long enough ... but I will give it one more chance . So far extremely disappointed ! UPDATE : No difference . I have actually thrown it away . It was a waste of money .	-1
I really have my doubts about this thing . I 've had it for a couple years and I keep it in the freezer but I 've not found it to be very fast ( 5 minutes ) chilling a bottle of wine . I 'd say more like at least 1/2 hour . I am also perplexed as to whether the liquid in the sleeve is supposed to stay in a liquid state or , after being in the freezer is it supposed to be more rigid and and solid . The liquid in mine stays liquid , no matter how long it is kept in the freezer . It did n't come with any explanation as to how it works or if the liquid is to become fairly solid when frozen . If it indeed is supposed to be more frozen or like an ice cube , mine is then defective . I doubt I 'd buy another one .	-1
this is a very large unit for a plugin . did not really help with eliminating odor from kitchen . i do n't think it has enough CFM or airflow	-1
This item is way too large . Far more than I expected for a plug in .	-1
I 'm in process of returning 2 sets of Scarlet just received today . Very disappointing.The red glazing is awful on the sets I received . AWFUL . There are large bare areas , especially around the rims of the bowls , saucers , and cups . This is not normal for Fiestaware . I already have 3 Scarlet place settings purchased locally just last month ; those 3 sets all look great & have 100 % color coverage.I think this is a quality control issue . These two sets should never have been released from their factory.I guess I will have to stalk the local stores waiting for more Scarlet colors to come in . At least then I can check each setting before buying .	-1
This is usable , but the instructions on the back are kind of sketchy & have to be referred to again & again . This is not so helpful when trying to open a bottle of wine . The first time I used my first Rabbit , I was surprized by how easy it was . Not this one . Flimsy material , too . Wonder how long it will last ? And it 's quite expensive for what it is , despite all the pieces . Same price as the one at the wine store that I passed up thinking that I could get it cheaper on Amazon .	-1
Do n't waste your time on this company.My first Rabbit had a plastic handle . When it broke after several years of use , I replaced it with a metal handle Rabbit because it had 10-year warrantee . ( I think the first one had a 2-year warrantee . ) The new Rabbit malfunctioned . A mission-critical piece of rubber tore , making the Rabbit useless . I sent the Rabbit to Metrokane per the package instructions . ( I paid the postage and also had to enclose a check to cover *their* mailing costs . ) A week or so later , my Rabbit was returned to me without any repairs . Their note said that they could n't find anything wrong with the thing . I phoned Metrokane to complain . They said that the rubber was not covered by the warrantee . I was told to get rubber glue to fix the thing . I checked the warrantee . Nowhere does it say that certain parts are not covered . Finally they agreed to replace it.The replacement was defective . The Metrokane rep. copped an attitude when I complained , saying that I was probably using it incorrectly . ( Remember , I 'd owned a Rabbit and had used it for years , so I 'm sure I knew how to use it . ) The company would n't send another Rabbit and I refused to spend more money to return the second defective product . I 'm using a $ 10 knock-off now . It works every time .	-1
You have to be a ninja to open and close the shower curtain without one of these falling off . Seriously super annoying .	-1
Who needs a shower curtain to get your day off to a frustrating start ? Not me ! These hooks jump off the rod with no provocation , and tangle together like wire coat hangers . ( Oh , NO ! ) Do n't buy 'em , no matter how pretty they are .	-1
These look very nice . However , you have to very gingerly move your shower curtain , as these will pop off the shower rod at the slightest provocation . I would n't recommend these , as they 're a pain .	-1
These filters are no difference than the cheaper ones , they just do n't fit the entire space , so buy the cheaper ones , or get a large one & cut it .	-1
These are about 3/4 & # 34 ; too small in both directions , so crud works its way past these prefilters right into the very expensive HEPA filter elements . Disappointing . I have a Holmes 3-filter style air filter and these are listed as the official replacement piece.Time to start buying the material in bulk and cutting it up myself I guess .	-1
This thing is so crappy and can not handle any type of weight on it . It bends and the doors are already falling off the hinges . Such a waste of money ...	-1
I have glass Snapware refrigerator containers and love them . The sizes in this canister set are good and I like the lids , however I am really disappointed at the very flimsy plastic used for the containers themselves ; 2-liter soda bottles are made of sturdier plastic ! This would be an excellent canister set if the containers were glass . This product does not do justice to the Snapware brand .	-1
I suggested better than this vacuum.1 . Buy balloons . ( balloons are much cheaper than this vacuum.2 . make round balloons on the carpet ( dust will be attached by balloon because of static electricity ) That 's it . this is more clean and much faster , and much cheaper .	-1
I bought this vacuum because of the rating it got in Consumer Reports . After having a Panasonic for the past 20 years , I found this vacuum to be awkard and clunky . The handle is too short , the release lever takes the force of a sledge hammer to activate . It vacuums carpets nicely but is hard to handle . Using tools is an altogether different matter . Using tools is a nightmare . The hose is too short and it is not worth the effort . To be honest , I took this vacuum back to the store for all the reasons noted above . I do n't know who is doing the ratings at Consumer Reports lately , but that orginization has lost credibility with me because of the vacuum ratings of late .	-1
The Eureka 4870 is consistently rated very highly by Consumer Reports . I am still scratching my head trying to understand why . There are certain vacuum cleaners that are brought in for repair that I can guess what the problem is before the customer tells me . This is one of those machines.This vacuum cleaner is our number 1 repair customer . The Eureka 4870 is brought in for repair MORE THEN ANY OTHER VACUUM CLEANER . The only reason I have given this vacuum 2 stars , is because when this vacuum is working , it actually does clean very well , however the number of times you will have to bring the vacuum in for service , outweighs how well it cleans . Let me first tell you about the Pros to the Eureka 4870 , as this can be summed up with a few sentences.Pros : The Eureka 4870 motor actually is a very high output motor , and creates a decent amount of suction power . The motor is the only metal component to the vacuum , and is the only part on this vacuum that I have never seen problems with , or had to replace.The vacuum has a nice selection of on-board attachments . Included is a nice on board hose , an extra wand for above the floor cleaning , a nice long crevice tool for those hard to reach nooks and crannies , a dusting brush , as well as an upholstery tool . The `` power paw '' ( as standard attachment on the 4870HZ ) attachment leaves a lot to be desired , as most of the time the rotating brush driven by suction stops as soon as you put it on upholstery , or stairs.The electrical cord on this vacuum is a nice long 30 foot cord , allowing you to be able to clean more square footage without having to go and unplug the machine from room to room . This feature will actually save you substantial time on vacuuming.The vacuum bag is a `` top fill '' bag . This means that the hole where the dirt goes into fills from the very top of the bag , allowing you to really jam pack the dirt in the bag , and filling the entire bag before there 's any suction loss . A lot of other vacuums have the hold on the side of the bag , which is really pointless , as you have to throw away the bag before it 's completely full.The price is probably the best feature on this vacuum . For right around $ 150 , the machine is very affordable , and feature packed for this price . You do get what you pay for in terms of quality.Cons : Weighing in at 25 pounds , this machine is VERY heavy . If you have multiple floors , and you have to take the vacuum up and down the stairs , you will surely hate this vacuum after the first few times of carrying it up and down stairs . The carrying handle is not very conveniently placed either , causing the customer to have to pick up the machine by the handle which makes it seem even more heavy.The Eureka R belt `` Extended Life Belt '' . The belt on this machine was a new design by Eureka . The belt is actually not made of rubber like most belts . It is actually a plastic belt . Eureka claims that this belt is `` Extended life '' however some of my customers are replacing this belt 3-4 times a year . If you vacuum anything that gets stuck in the roller brush while vacuuming , the belt usually stretches to a point where the brush will not spin , or if it does spin , it will spin very slowly , and sometimes even stop as soon as you put it on the carpet.The roller brush itself . A typical Eureka roller brush , this roller brush ( sometimes referred to as a `` beater bar '' ) has two PLASTIC bearing caps on each side . If something is vacuumed up into the brush while it 's spinning , a lot of the times , the brush bearing caps will actually melt ! Eureka does not sell these caps separately either , and you 'll have to purchase the entire roller brush assembly if this happens . Do not expect to get any more the 1 year out of the roller brush before some melting happens . The plastic bearing caps are not sealed either . If you have pets in the house , or females ( some males are also included ) that have very long hair , this hair will get inside the bearing of the roller brush shortening the life even more . One way to prevent this from happening is take the roller brush out , taking the bearing caps off , and remove the hair , thread , etc that has wrapped itself around the bearings . You should do this every 2 weeks for best results.The dreaded Carpet/Floor switch . Out of all the problems this machine has , this is by far the most common . Not only is the most common , it can also be the most expensive , as the amount of time and labor that it takes to replace the switch is very difficult , and you will have to take it in to a local repair shop to fix it . If you talk to any independent vacuum store , and ask them about this repair , 9 times out of 10 you they will tell you how difficult of a repair it really is . This is my least favorite repair to do out of ANY VACUUM CLEANER . You basically have to take the entire roller brush housing apart , and fight with a spring to fix it . The design on this switch is the problem . If a customer does decide to purchase this vacuum from me ( I certainly do n't recommend it ) I always open the machine , assemble it , and I always test the machine before the customer leaves my store . I have opened probably 10-15 of these machines brand new out of the box , only to test it , and find that the Carpet/Floor switch is broken . Brand new out of the box there should never be any problems.The last issue on this vacuum is the filtration . Eureka claims that this machine is `` True HEPA filtration '' vacuum . I have found this to be more like a `` False HEPA filtration '' vacuum . One of the many cool gadgets we have to diagnose and test vacuum cleaners is what 's called a Particle Scanner . This very expensive machine will actually measure with lasers how many fine dust particles are leaking from a vacuum per minute of use . I measured the Eureka 4870 like I do all vacuums I sell . This machine registered 25,000+ fine dust particles per minute of use being leaked out of this machine . Now this number is definitely lower then any bagless machine on the market , however for Eureka to claim that this machine will help allergy and asthma sufferers is just false . If you own this vacuum try vacuuming in the sunlight , and you can actually see some of the larger micron dust exhausting from the machine . This is only the larger particles you can see . The most damaging particles to humans are the ones that are not visible to the naked eye . If you or your family has any breathing issues such as Asthma , Emphysema , or allergies , please beware of this vacuum.You can kind of tell the quality of a vacuum cleaner by the warranty the manufacturer will give you . The Eureka 4870 has a 1 year parts and labor ( required by the government , I 'm sure they would give less if they could ) . Consumer Reports loves this vacuum , but as a vacuum repairman , I would tell anyone that asked me to STAY AWAY FROM THIS VACUUM CLEANER .	-1
This is a great bachelor oven . It can handle tv dinners , frozen fries , frozen flat chicken ... anything FLAT . If you need something with more than 2.5 inches in height to be cooked ... forget it . I looked at the dimensions in the description and they seemed fine , but what it does n't tell you is the rack is only at a center position . You WO N'T be baking a potato in this baby ... the potato is too tall.I did a small pan of cornbread . Top got nice and brown , then the instructions say to add a piece of foil to the top . Okay done . Well , what should have taken 30 minutes , took 45 ... so no 40 % less time there . It was goo in the middle for the longest time . I tried cookies , flattening them as suggested by other reviewers . I felt like the outside was burned while the inside was n't cooked through . Toast was n't a golden tan as I had anticipated , but brown around the edges , white in the center . Frozen pizza , the back half cooking faster than the front , had to turn it around half way through , and yes , I did read the instruction booklet that said to put pizza towards the back of the tray . My kid also likes a crunchy bottom on his pizza , well since the tray is REQUIRED for pizza , it was floppy pizza.The degrees are more designed for celsius , there is no God 's perfect ordained temperature of 350 F , but that 's okay.I had such high hopes for this item . With all the fantastic reviews , I thought I had found a toaster that could also cook small items ... my mistake . The power on/off button is not good for families with children . Nobody will turn it off . The idea is nice . I am thinking the interior cavity is so small that it is for a tiny home in Japan , or that the technology is too expensive to make larger ... not sure on that one . If they did make a large oven with this technology , I might be interested . I give it 2 stars for being a good idea ... .but needs work . I like that the rack moves forward when the door is opened . No burned fingers , and this oven is about as hot as Hades on all sides and top . Lastly , Gawd help the aesthetics ...	-1
Great toaster , but bakes unevenly , December 30 , 2006Reviewer : Susan Schayes `` suziesilverado '' ( Washington , D.C. ) - See all my reviewsNot sure what all the hype is about.Yes , it does make excellent toast . The appliance was designed to look unconventional , has interesting settings , and is a great size if you have limited counterspace , But it cooks unevenly . My pizza was burnt on the back edge and soft in the middle . Other high-cost toaster ovens include a baking grill in the box , which might have helped . A small baked potato had to be rotated to cook both sides without burning and still had some raw spots in the center.The high tech light feature is distracting . You ca n't look at it or leave the light on for an extended time since its connected to the heater . Lastly , cooking does n't stop automatically if you open the oven door , so there is a chance you can get burned .	-1
I received one of these for Christmas 9 months ago and have had to replace it twice already . The first one only baked half the waffle , and the hinge on the second one broke almost immediately.I 'm the only one who uses this at home , and I only use it about once a month , so for it to fall apart that quickly is just inexcusable . I wo n't be buying this brand again .	-1
I own this product but on choosing a waffle maker for my daughter , I did not consider purchasing another one . I have had it a year , using it about once a month . It sticks and the light does n't always work . It does make waffles but I will be purchasing a different one in the near furture .	-1
Black and Decker used to have an excellent reputation , but this one appliance could ruin that for good ! Cooked some good waffles once , cleaned it , put it away . When I went to get it out for a second time , this evening , the hinge broke . Pieces literally fell out on the counter . We still used it as I had the batter made and , actually , the waffles turned out fine . But we 'll not be keeping it as one with a hinge that works is definitely preferable .	-1
When I see the Black and Decker name , I think rugged , tough , and durable . I do n't think it 's something that 's going to fall apart doing the thing it was designed to do.And yet , that 's exactly what this waffle maker did for us.There was an upside - it made very tasty waffles . It made very tasty waffles twice , in fact ! Then the hinges cracked and fell off , rendering it unusable.We were n't throwing it around , mind you . Not playing catch with it or even trying to see who could smash more batter into it . Just trying to make plain old waffles , as we 've done with other waffle makers dozens of times before , and since.And yet , it broke . Not just a little broke , either . So broke that we could n't use it anymore . So broke that even MacGyver could n't have used it.So , yes , it makes waffles . It makes very good waffles . Twice . Then it 's done , and for the landfill . Our replacement waffle maker will be a different model.Black and Decker should stick to making power tools .	-1
This is the worst waffle maker I have ever owned ! ! I purchased it on 5/13/08 , paid $ 33.00 for it , and have been trying to make it work ever since . I just thought maybe it needed a break-in period , but I now know it is just a piece of junk.As per instructions , I am not to use spray oils , only liquid . OK , definitely inconvenient , but I did , and continue to do , as instructed . And the waffles stuck , and continue to stick , every single time unless we cook them so long they are nothing but a crunchy , broken , mess , and it is impossible to clean . I have tried different recipes and different cook times , all with the same result . This is just too much work for a waffle . I do not know what Black & Decker used for a surface , but it is horrible . I am frustrated every time I use it , and I ca n't believe with today 's technology they choose to make such an inferior product . There was a day when the Black & Decker name meant quality , but no longer . I absolutely detest spending money on a product that is bad , and I feel completely cheated by them for putting it out on the market . Plus , I am now angry over a stupid waffle maker . I did not even want to give it one star .	-1
This is the wonkiest piece of garbage . So flimsy right out of the box . The plates straight up just fall out of the holding tabs , of which there is only one per plate ; two definitely would have been better . The outside just feels cheap and thin . I can not believe for a brand that has been around as long as Black and Decker , this would ever pass any sort of quality control . Returned for a Krups . Much better only it does n't have the ability to remove the plates .	-1
How can nonstick be so sticky ? ! Plus my waffles do n't get very brown/crunchy on the outside like they 're supposed to . If I wanted floppy , pale waffles , I 'd eat pancakes !	-1
67 Year Old Male ; College Station , TexasI purchase this a couple of weeks prior to Christmas 2013 . I hate Belgian waffles , because they are too soft and mushy . I wanted an old fashioned waffle iron , like the one I grew up with , that makes the classic style waffles , which are crisp on the outside and soft in the middle . I have owned a few `` Black & Decker '' products in the past and for the most part , they met my expectations . However , when we removed this waffle iron from it 's packaging , my wife and I were very disappointed . We never even plugged it in . Like everything else that 's now made in China , it is very cheaply made , utilizing cheap materials . I had full intensions of returning it until I read Amazon 's or Black & Decker 's return policy , which states that the item must be unopened , so that ended that . I figured that it would be less expensive and not worth the time spent arguing with customer service to just give it away and try another brand . I do n't know how they expect you to know if you like something or not , without first opening it . Knowing that one of my sister-in-laws did n't have and had never had a waffle iron , I just gave it to her . I figured that a poor waffle iron was better than no waffle iron at all . Anyway , this thing is a piece of junk in my opinion.I would not recommend this waffle iron to anyone . Like I said , `` Do n't waste your money '' !	-1
Loved the idea of combining a waffle maker and a grill/griddle in one appliance . I 'm trying to unclutter my kitchen , and keep only things that serve a multi-purpose or will get used all of the time . This item seemed like the solution . It was , briefly . But like some of the other reviewers I had problems with having to crank it up to high , and the waffles still not being browned . I had problems with my waffles sticking ( yes , I tried oil , butter , cooking spray- none made a difference ) , so that when you opened the machine you had 1/2 a waffle on the top , 1/2 on the bottom . You then had to carefully peel both sides off and smoosh them back together to have a waffle . The final straw was when making pancakes on the grill , and the one side was so much hotter that they were burning , and the other side was taking double the time to cook . I had to keep switching the pancakes from side to side to try and even it out . And that was it ! ! ! It was too late to return , and I would n't wish it on the good folks at Good Will , so I consigned it to our township recycling heap . If you want crispy waffles- try the Villa Ware waffle maker . It 's excellent . If you want a grill/griddle , try the Cuisinart Griddler . It 's excellent .	-1
According to Amazon , I bought this back in June 2011 . The whole thing has gone off . It does n't heat evenly anymore , the plates are all warped and bubbled , and the thing is n't working anymore .	-1
Dented and it was a rickety mess . I returned it , but , it took a month to do it . The picture makes it look nice , it 's not .	-1
What a piece of junk . It was chipped not only around the edges but also on the grid . I ca n't comment on it other than that as I did't even get to use it .	-1
Having owned this product for 1.5 years , I have noticed a number of negatives:1 . Nonstick coating chips *very* easily , much more easily that other nonstick items I own . Even though I am careful not to use abrasives or metal utensils , it is now unusable as the coating flakes into food.2 . The upper griddle surface does not get as hot as the lower surface : this is fine when using the unit closed , but when using it open as a griddle the surfaces are not the same temperature.3 . Outside surfaces get very hot ; you must be very careful so as not to burn yourself .	-1
I have been using my Mom 's waffle iron for the last 20 years ( no exaggeration ) . I think it was almost as old as I am . The Teflon coating on the plates finally started peeling off , so it was time to replace it . We went with this waffle iron because it 's the modern version of my old one . However , it did not compare to my old one . When I made waffles there were definite hot spots . The waffles were almost burned in some places and barely brown in others . I was so disappointed.That said , I called Grady 's Online who is the vendor that was selling this through Amazon . The lady I spoke with was nice , pleasant , and helpful . When I explained what had happened she decided the waffle iron was n't working correctly and has already sent me a new one . I have n't had a chance to try the new one yet , but i 'll update this review if it 's significantly different . But I wanted to give a shout out to Grady 's Online customer service . They were great ! !	-1
In theory , great idea- I 'd love to have something i can grill meat on , and grill cheese sandwiches , as well as waffles . But I should have heeded the reviews about flimsiness . The metal clips used to hold the griddle plates do n't secure the plates very well , I was worried the top plate would fall off when opening the grill . I noticed on the box the clips were shaped differently , so they must have changed the design , and not for the better . Also , the temperature knob was very loose . I wondered how it passes UL Standards so I checked the box but did not see a UL logo . Black and Decker should pull these before they 're forced to recall them . I returned it immediately .	-1
The waffle iron plates did not fit properly in the waffle iron , kept popping out while cooking , and those releasing the heat . The waffle irons themselves our shallow making thin waffles . Disappointing .	-1
I bought this because I wanted to make classic non-Belgian buttermilk waffles . The removable ( and therefore easily-washable ) plates were a big selling point , and the griddle side was a greatly appreciated bonus . It was also very important to me that it made waffles in batches of four rather than two so that I could ( hypothetically ) get through a whole recipe of batter more quickly.The good : When I muster up the patience to use this machine , it makes very tasty waffles . Thin and crispy , just how I like them . And the griddle side makes good pancakes and grilled cheese.The nonstick coating has not given me any trouble . I seasoned it before first use , spray it with oil each time , and am careful not to scratch it with utensils or while washing.The bad : Firstly , the entire thing comes off as pretty flimsy . At first I let this go , as I figured some flexibility was required to allow the griddle side to cook things of various widths . But honestly , it still seems pretty shoddy.Secondly , the plates FALL OUT remarkably easily . When you leave it closed for a period of time , then open it , the chances of the top plate coming out is about 30 % in my experience . ( And I am very careful about putting them in correctly . ) Unfortunately , since you have to leave it closed in order for it to preheat , that means the extremely hot preheated plate is quite likely to fall out . Once when this happened it fell on to my wrist . I put it under cool water immediately but the burn was still bad enough that it took weeks to heal.Thirdly , the waffles take a very long time to get crispy . About 10 minutes per sheet of four . When I make a regularly sized batch of waffle batter ( 3-4 cups ) , it takes 40 to 60 minutes to get through the batch . This is incredibly tedious , so I almost never make them . Which was the main point of getting this thing.Finally , it is very difficult to clean . The nonstick plates themselves are easy to remove and clean , but if any batter , cheese , or anything else spills out while cooking , it finds itself lodged in twenty different nooks and crannies . The area around the dial and the grooves in the handle are challenging , but the seams where the plastic parts attach to the metal are the worst offenders . You would think these would be sealed , but food easily seeps under the plastic and becomes almost impossible to remove . I 've spent way too much time trying to dig gunk out with toothpicks and the like . I 've given up now , it 's just never going to be clean . So if you get this , be really careful not to let anything overflow.As soon as I find a better machine that makes THIN ( think toaster-oven width ) waffles , I 'll be all over it .	-1
I am not very impressed with this product.It is very light weight and cooks very unevenly.The single heating coil does not do the trick.This seemed to get good reviews and I am not pleased .	-1
I 've owned this coffee maker for about a year . I bought it based on reviews on this website . It was a disappointment . The carafe DOES NOT keep the coffee warm very long . I make a pot around 6:00 am . By 7:00 or so , I 'm having to heat my cup of coffee in the microwave to get it hot enough to drink . I would like it to keep the coffee a good hot drinking temperature for at least a couple of hours . This one does not.Also , after a years use , it has now started `` spitting '' steam on every brew . I 've cleaned it three times now and it has n't helped . I start out with 8 cups of water in the tank and wind up with about 7 cups of coffee , not to mention , it is very noisy when it 's hissing away all the steam.I will say , it brews a good cup of coffee . If it would just stay hot in the carafe .	-1
I have not used the product.I give it a low rating only to increase awareness about this `` minor '' detail.Product is advertised as Made in Germany , yet on the product itself label says made in China . I can buy Made in China anywhere if I do n't want to think about sweat shops and the workers there .	-1
Insamuch as I first liked this can opener , I absolutely do not recommend it because it stopped working after 2 years of light usage . There are many other reviews with the same issue - within first 2.5 years this can opener stops working . There is a lifetime manufacturer warranty in the USA for this product if purchased through their authorized dealer . Call 800-321-2226 and tell them you have a defective can opener . If their manager approves replacement , they will ask for you to mail yours to them for the exchange on a brand new one . Do n't rely on this warranty though if you buy this item on Amazon , Amazon is not an authorized dealer with them .	-1
Like other one star reviewers , I loved this product at first but it broke after opening a few hundred cans . This can be very frustrating when one is hurrying to prepare dinner for hungry teenagers . I had to channel my inner humanoid and hack the bean can open with a kitchen knife ! ARRRGGGHHH ... ... ... ... .EZ John	-1
The Good : - The handle 's pommel guard , which keeps the potatoes from stabbing back while they are being mashed.The Bad : - Mediocre results . Not much better than traditional thick wire mashers ; on a par with similar ( and much cheaper ) grid mashers , like WMF and Oxo.- Too short when mashing in a large bowl -- needs longer handle.- Pommel guard and long bars are not shaped for easy cleaning.- $ $ $ $ $ ! ! ! ! $ 45 is ridiculous !	-1
I try to buy top-notch kitchen products . The Rosle is overpriced , holds only a small clove of garlic , is NOT easy to squeeze , and is `` German design '' but made in China.The Oxco press that I already owned does a better job and was much less expensiveI sent it back . Bless Amazon for their easy return policy .	-1
Gave this slicer a chance but only lasted a few months before the wire broke . I could even live with that if Amazon carried the replacement wires . However the only place I found them was on the company 's website . I 've sinced purchased theNorpro Cheese Slicerand find that much easier to use and very sturdy .	-1
I guess I must have been using it wrong , but as soon I tried to tighten it during the first use , the wire snapped . Maybe if it had come with instructions telling me something that was n't obvious ( to me ) I would have done better ?	-1
The Rosle twirl whisk I received today says Made in China on the sticker . I 'm sure it performs like any other twirl whisk but that is n't the point . The description for this item is not accurate.I had several choices and I paid a premium for this brand because the description on Amazon states it is Made In Germany . Maybe it was at one time but that is n't the case any more . The sticker states plainly 18/10 s/s Made in China.I returned this one and purchased theKuhn Rikon 10-Inch Galaxy Spring Whiskinstead . I am very happy with the quality and performance of the less expensive whisk from Kuhn Rikon .	-1
I unpacked everything and it was not as described . One of the frying pans is like a square skillet and the smallest pot is way too small to use for anything . I sent it back within the week .	-1
I brought T-fal pans from my local Sam 's Club wearhouse , and initially , the pans worked great . this is my review after about 1.5 years of use:1. the handle on the lid ( plastic ) broke after about a year.2 . the non stick coating began to crack from regular use in about about 6 month , and it got so bad that i tossed the pan out in about a year and half.3 . the handle broke twice on me and for both time i super glued them back on . on the third time , i just tossed them out and got an expensive Anolon titanium non-stick set.4 . the pan is not made of aluminum and there are `` hot / cold '' spots on the pan . the hot / cold spot is caused by uneven distribution of heat . a good pan , generally with copper or aluminum core will evenly distribute heat . this pan does not.bottom line : do not use this pan in the oven eventhough the instruction said up to 400 degrees . the handle will and did crack on me for 3 times with occasional oven use.the pan is thin , and does not distribute heat well . and the worst : the non-stick coating is a joke.i found out that it 's actually cheaper to get a expensive set and use it for like 10 years instead of getting a cheap set for a third of the price and replace it every 2 years or less.not recommended .	-1
I love T-Fal and have used their products for many years . The problem I have had with this set is that within a week or so the handles started to loosen and get very jiggly . I tried to tighten the weird screws ( these are screws that can not be tightened with any type of household screwdriver ) I used a kitchen knife to get them as tight as I could but they were still very unstable . Within a few months the handles started to crack around the screws and would break off . This is very dangerous ! The last handle that broke off was a few weeks ago and it happened while I was about to drain pasta over the sink , thanks goodness that I was right over the sink when this happened or I would have really gotten hurt or burned or scalded . The same thing happened to another handle on the large frying pan . This is such a dangerous hazzard . Please never transfer from the stove to any surface without being very careful and make sure children are no where around while doing so . I need a new set now and I really love T-Fal but I 'm not sure I want to invest in a product that could eventually harm myself or my family . Please either add a tool for the handles that can make the pans safe !	-1
Price is low , but that just says the quality is poor . That 'non-stick coating is fragile and probably dangerous if overheated.The really big problem is customer service : that is totally non existent . I have asked the retailer , Hammacher Schlemmer and T-fal over and over to help me with a failed part and not one word from either party . Not one single response.Save your money and buy carefully , after studying the market and what others have experienced.There are few true bargains in this life , but they are there if you wish to study and investigate before buying.Yeah , heavy , but I hope I make my point .	-1
I bought a set of cookwear made by the same manufacturer of T-Fal about 10 years ago . At the time , I paid approx . $ 175 for the set . We have been fanatical about never using sharp objects with the teflon coating . As a result , the interior of the pans are in very good shape . My problem is with the anodized finish and handles which have not held up at all . While out shopping for new cookwear , I came across the new Wearever sets . Prominently displayed on their packaging is the `` Limited Lifetime Warranty . '' I went home and decided to call their customer service to see if my cookwear could be replaced under warranty . What happened from there was an excercise in poor customer service.The representaive on the phone proceeded to tell me all the things that would not be covered by their warranty , before I could even explain what the issue was with my pans . Suffice it to say the exclusions were so numerous and burdensome that I was given the impression that it would be a waste of time to even bother sending this cookware in because they would be looking for a reason to deny sending you a replacement.For example , he told me that they would not honor the warranty if the cookwear had been improperly washed or got too hot . Hmmmmm , I thought . What good is cookwear if you do n't heat food in it and wash it afterwards . He explained that it could n't be washed in the dishwasher . Fair enough , I thought . We always wash it by hand because of the space they take up , however , I can not say that a babysitter , housekeeper , mother in law etc.. has not run them through the dishwaser . If that will void the warranty , perhaps they should stamp `` NOT DISHWASHER SAFE '' on the bottom of these things . They could also print that on the outside of the carton that they sell them in.I called back and asked to speak with a supervisor , and pretty much got the same story and attitude . If you send your cookwear in , we will take 4-6 weeks to make a determination on whether or not we will replace it . We reserve the right to replace it with something else ( because we do n't make your style anymore ) . The long and short of it is : If you decide to buy Wearever cookware , do n't expect to ever have anything replaced under the warranty . If you are brave enough to send your cookware to them for replacement , plan on eating out at a resturant for a month and a half . These folks are apparently experts at dissuading consumers from exercising their rights under their warranty . Fool me once , shame on you ... I will avoid cookware made by Wearever , Mirro , T-Fal , and their other brands .	-1
Not so great pans and screws fall apart !	-1
I bought this salad spinner to replace a broken salad spinner . The one that broke was a crank style lever that you turned , like a jack-in-the-box . The lettuce always came out bone dry . The OXO one does n't get the lettuce very dry , hence the salad dressing does n't stick to the lettuce well . I think it has to do with the pump lever -- you can only go so fast when spinning the lettuce , unlike a hand-held turning lever which allows you to go much faster . I 've been using this OXO spinner for a few months , but I am going to replace it with a crank style one . Sick of having to pour twice as much dressing on my wet lettuce . I do n't recommend this product .	-1
Ok , I read the reviews that said the small is all you need . Well , maybe if you live alone or occasionally cook for 2 . It is too small for a family . I will keep it because functionally it is top notch , but the basket needs to hold more .	-1
The manufacturer has greatly cheapened a once durable product . The basket is now very thin transparent plastic , almost like cellophane , and the one-time solid , heavy-duty top is now a transparent plastic of poor quality . This still works ( our old one lasted 20 years ) , but this one will not last a year or more and spins very , very weakly .	-1
It is too big for my kitchen . Most of the time I am cooking for 2 to 4 persons . I returned it and purchased a 7 cup size .	-1
Really hate to be negative here , but this thing sucks . It 's impossible to actually clean the old coffee from between the grinding burrs and the container that holds the ground coffee . The grind is extremely inconsistent . It makes a huge mess . After using it for 2 months , it jammed on a coffee bean and the motor burned out on me.You get what you pay for !	-1
This coffee grinder essentially stopped working after a couple grinds . Even the finest ground was totally coarse to begin with , then it quit entirely . I sent for a free replacement of the grinder gear ( what supposedly was the initial problem ) , and with the replacement it limped along for a couple more months , still with very coarse grounds , then quit again . And , the countertop somehow always ended up a mess . I feel that you are better either getting a more expensive burr grinder , or go with a higher quality blade grinder for about the same price .	-1
I 've had this burr grinder for over two years now . I was very happy with it for a while , but it soon did n't grind evenly no matter what setting you used . And I soon found out I had to use twice as much coffee bean to make the perfect pot . I had difficulty removing the burr so my husband took the thing apart for me , and we found about a pound of coarsley unevenly ground coffee stuck in the back of the machine ! What a waste ! We have had unscrew and empty that wasted coffee twice so far . I am looking for a new grinder .	-1
Piece of junk.As others have said , forget the grinding settings - it grinds all the same , no matter the setting , for the most part.I put 8 cups of brewed coffee worth of beans through this thing every day . I prefer French Roast and other oily roasts , but the stupid thing clogged up every two or three days requiring a tedious cleaning . So , I went to the non-oily stuff - Breakfast Blends , etc . - and it still clogs about once every week or two.After about a year , the irrelevant grinding setting thing broke . Not that it mattered , since it never made a difference anyway , but still ... And now , after just about two years , it 's pretty well died utterly this week.Remember - you get what you paid for.If I was n't so cheap , I would have thrown this away and bought a good one a month after buying this one . In fact , I see by my wishlist , that I did indeed search through Amazon for a new one about a month after I bought this awful thing.Thankfully , from an environmental and stewardship standpoint , I was able to nurse this puppy along for two years instead of putting it in the landfill.But I should have been smart enough to know when I bought this one that it was so ridiculously cheap for a reason . Shame on me.Save yourself - buy a good coffee grinder .	-1
I have owned one of these burr grinders . Constantly plugged , hard to clean , messy to use , motor gave out quickly . Total waste of money . Melitta told me they were made for them by Salton ( badged for Melitta ) . I called them as well , they said call Melitta . In the end , I got a lot of runaround , but no refund or replacement .	-1
I have owned two of these . the first one worked fine for a year ( long enough for the price ) , so I decided to ignore the bad reivews and replace it with the same . The second one , even at the finest setting , does not work well enough to even grind coffee for a coffee press , much less my expresso machine . Some of the grounds are several millimeters across . Chunks of coffee bean , rather than grounds . I will not buy this one again .	-1
The set looked nice . As I was unpacking it , though , I thought I was missing a lid . I finally realized the lid given for the large pan just was n't even close to fitting . Unfortunately , that meant I had to repackage the whole thing and return it . If you order this product , unpack carefully , you may need to return it .	-1
Because of the size ( I make my yogurt two quarts at a time ) , I bought three of these . I thought they would be great , not plastic , at least not all plastic , and they would hold up . But the mesh is not fine enough . My homemade yogurt just runs right through the mesh . Admitedly , my homemade yogurt is not always really thick , but still , it strains fine in cheesecloth and an old plastic mesh strainer I have , so I expected it to work with these . But it did n't . After several tries , I gave up and am returning them . I 'm going to try the Euro Cuisine Greek Yogurt Maker instead . It holds up to two quarts of yogurt , which is great , but I did n't order it initially because of the reviews that said it fell apart after washing . I 'm hoping that 's no longer the case .	-1
I make my own , quite thick yogurt , and this does strain it , but it also lets a good amount of the yogurt through too . So to make a couple cups of greek style yogurt you have to strain about 4-6 cups of thick yogurt . Also you are not left with nice clear whey that can be used for making bread or other recipes , you end up with a half yogurt half whey , mess . I returned mine because I do n't wish to spend 2-3 days just to make a couple cups , nor do I like throwing half my yogurt away .	-1
Tried this several times and was just not able to make it work for me , and cleaning it was even more difficult . I 'm sure there are others that it works just fine for but not for me !	-1
For well over 10 years I have used Brita , up until 1 year ago . Sadly I can no longer recommend Brita.Brita once has silver particles in their filters to kill pathogens . No more . But the pathetic FDA can likely be blamed for that.The real problem with Brita and most other water filters is that they do not remove or even reduce the amount of fluoride in the water at all . As more and more American communities are being informed of the realities of Fluoride in our water , they are removing it from their water supply . Until your community stops putting fluoride in the water , your family is being poisoned by one of the most dangerous chemicals known to man , and the Brita leaves it all in the water . I now use one of the only filters that truly purifies , not filters , the water.So you thought fluoride helps your teeth ? Think again . Do some research ! It 's a deadly toxic poison IN THE FORM that 's in your water ! Sorry Brita , yes you have the best taste I have ever found , but unless you get rid of the one real poison in our water , I have to use something that will give me non-toxic water.Professional Perspectives on Water Fluoridation	-1
I had bought one of these and liked the way the fan worked but the switching mechanisms are of very very poor quality . I returned the first one for a replacement . Unfortunately , the switch on the replacement lasted a shorter amount of time so I am returning this one and not requesting a replacement.The inconvenience is way to much to pay nearly $ 50 that I was charged and I will avoiding all Holmes products .	-1
The fan itself is just `` OK '' . My old Lasko , which I paid under $ 20 for was built much sturdier and had 3 speeds with individual speed controls for each fan . This fan has only high and low and both fans must run at the same speed.The removable end piece is a very tight fit and the accordian end does not fit inside the window frame to stabilize the fan . I keep the fan in the top of a window , not in the bottom.Also , be advised the fan ( as other reviewers have noted ) ships in its own very flimsy box , which caused minor cosmetic damage to the fan during handling.If you can find an old Lasko , I 'd go with that instead.Editing this review to add the left fan rattles constantly on low speed when on exhaust , which is even more annoying at night when everything else is quiet .	-1
Returned this fan . kind of cheap . and at low speeds you can hear the fan blades knocking which kept me up at night . When the thermostat was set the fan would shut of for what seemed like a minute than came back on . And when they came back on they turned on at full blast and than came down to speed . Not like a soft start up where they would come on slow and build up to speed which also would wake me if I was n't in a deep deep sleep . eventually went with the bionare triple fan . and love it .	-1
My old fan just could compete with a breeze any longer so I got this fancy fan in the hopes that it could exhaust against breezes and low winds . No luck . If it 's sucking air out I ca n't tell . The curtains always billow away from it and my hand feels a strong intake on all sides of the fan blades . Super lame .	-1
I have two of these fans and bought a second one based on LOVING the first . Well , sadly the 2nd fan while it looks identical does n't not function the same . First off , the dimmable LED display while dimmable starts off super bright then dims down to moderately bright , on my old fan it is much more useful and dims to a level where it 's possible to use in a bedroom at night . Second , when the fans come on the old one just came on to the speed it was set at , this one comes on FULL speed then steps down . While this does n't sound like a big deal it is because you get a blast of wind and noise even at low speed rather than a gentle non invasive breeze . Such a shame that what was a great product has gone downhill .	-1
My fan must be refurbished . It came with a remote that does n't have batteries and the light does n't work . Busted ! I also have a large window , which I obviously knew would present a challenge , but they want $ 20 for two extra extenders ( they are super slim 1.5 in ) with S & H . Cray cray ! ! ! I should have gone with something else . Step up your QA Amazon !	-1
I posted this review for the Holmes HAWF3095-U last year . This year I tried the Bioaire BW2300 with the EXACT same result.I have windows that the inside of the channel is 2 inches from the screen . It is a modern manufactured window unit widely used in the building industry . This fan needs about 2 3/4 inches clearance , minimum . If I removed the screen , bugs would swarm in through the fan grates . If I leave the screen in , the fan sits on the sill and there is no clean way of attaching it.Another thing I noticed was that the electrical cord exits from the bottom and if I could have fit it in the window channel , it would have been inside it and would have to loop over the channel . Not a huge deal but further evidence of a strange design.Basically , fairly flat on the inside , bulbous on the outside . The opposite would have worked a lot better .	-1
This item JUST BARELY gets more than one star , because it *does* do a decent job of grinding your coffee , and if you 're not using a great coffee maker or if you 're using so-so beans , it may appear to work pretty well.However.THIS GRINDER BURNS YOUR BEANS . There 's no simpler way to put it . The tiny , flat burr has to work way too hard to grind the beans you put into it -- even relatively non-oily light roasts -- and heats them up in the process to the point where everything comes out tasting slightly of old cigarettes . I blamed the taste on other aspects of my brewing process for a while until this grinder died ( about 1 year of heavy use , cleaned frequently ) and I replaced it with a better model ( Solis Maestro ) . Wow ! Suddenly my coffee stopped tasting awful ! In conclusion , this grinder should never have been made . In fact , no small-flat-burr grinders should ever have been made . They just ca n't handle the task without too much heat buildup . The bottom line is that there is no price point worth mentioning in the grinder market between the cheap blade grinders ( & lt ; $ 20 ) and the conical burrs ( > $ 90 ) . Capresso made this model to fill the demand for a ~ $ 50 option , but it 's a total piece of marketing junk.Casual Users : save money and get a blade grinder . [ Aspiring ] Coffee Snobs : get a Capresso 560 or a Solis Maestro ( or a > $ 200 large-flat-burr grinder if you 're jumping all the way to Espresso Snob ) . Money *very* well spent .	-1
I bought this product , used the prduct by following the direction . The machine start making clicking sounds when it was time to send the mixture through the pasta dyes . Next thing I knew the tube that the pasta mixture goes through BROKE ! I was very upset about this product . I was going to order a the part for it but did n't want to invest more money on the machine . This machine meant well but it was a failure .	-1

Skip the tilt feature , it is not useful . The slicer slices ok , but it leaves a fairly large unslicable heel on the bottom of your piece of meat . Wastes a lot . It is also very hard to clean . There has got to be a better option .	-1
The thinness of the metal lid and sides of my new roaster oven surprised me , until I reread other reviews and found that the white roaster oven was formerly USA-made and much more substantial than Nesco 's other roaster ovens . My white roaster oven was made in China - and maybe that 's why it seems to be rather flimsy and have problems not reported in other reviews.I have n't tried anything but a few slow cooker recipes in my new oven roaster yet , since it was given to me to replace an aging slow cooker . Though it 's not clear in the pictures on the Amazon web site , this roaster oven has two holes in the lid , about 3/16 '' each , which allow way too much liquid to evaporate . Recipes that worked perfectly in other slow cookers I have owned come out dry and burned around the edges , and though lowering the heat and adding extra liquid is probably the answer to this , I could n't found the right combination . So the guy of the house ( whose gift the roaster oven was ) put an aluminum rivet through one of the holes . Now liquids do n't evaporate that quickly , but things still cook too rapidly - the heat settings seem to be high too.I also received a newWest Bend 84905 5-Quart Oblong-Shaped Slow Cookerfor Christmas , replacing one I 've had for 6 or 7 years which has a nonstick coating that 's beginning to flake off ( after heavy use ) . I loved my last West Bend slow cooker , expect to love this one , and though the plan was to take it to our summer cabin , I am still debating putting it out on the counter in place of the Westco roaster oven , which I could take to the cabin or retire to the shelves in the basement on which I keep little-used kitchen appliances until I feel like trying one of its other uses . It may work perfectly well for people doing other types of cooking and roasting ( though do keep an eye on the level of the liquids - the holes in the lid are big enough so that they evaporate fast ! ) . I 've been very happy using just a slow cooker for years , but who knows - maybe I 'll find a use for my Nesco roaster oven yet . Since it 's a gift , I 'm still working on getting it to work properly .	-1
I had high expectations for this device but have been very disappointed . It is slow to get to `` maximum steam '' ( not in 1 minute as they claim ) and the steam output is marginally higher than a hand steamer but not impressive . Granted this steamer has a larger head so the steamer makes a wider path but that is about it . More importantly the steam output is not sufficient to remove difficult wrinkles or wrinkles from heavy materials . The steamer is of average build quality but sadly the hangar rod comes in 3 , very difficult to store , pieces ( instead of a much more sensible and useful telescoping rod ) . It is claimed that the steam hose is 5.5 feet - maybe it is - but all I can say is that for someone of any height ( 6 ft. in my case ) it does not reach any height which makes steaming a comfortable process . They market a Steamboard which they clearly show attached to the top of a closet door . Putting aside the fact that you may not wish to ruin your closet door the hose on this machine would NEVER reach the top of any door ( except a dog door ) . Likewise the top of the rod does not allow you to hang an garment at a height you could steam without bending over . Moreover since the hose is not insulated you have to be careful when going through your toe-touching exercises , or when on your knees , to steam clothes that the hose does not come in contact with your skin.As best I can tell this is a machine for people who do n't want to keep refilling the hand models . With its reservoir tank there is adequate water storage for most any steaming session . Other than that it offers nothing - except a much higher price tag . It really is n't worth the moneyFollow-up : Spoke with company and they could not have been less helpful ; were ever so pleased with themselves and ; claimed they have been making this item `` since the 40 '' s and there have been no problems '' . ( The logic apparently being that as long as the product has been on the market for a long time then it must be a high quality item . I guess the makers of Spam could claim the same thing but like this product no one would really claim Spam to be a quality item . ) When I asked them why they show photos of people hanging things on door frames and using the machine which has only a 5.5 ft. cord the woman told me no one has any problem with that and she has done that for 15 years . So I guess everyone at Jiffy has door frames at 5.5 to 6 feet high .	-1
Thought this would eliminate or significantly reduce my time ironing after pulling clothes straight from the dryer . Unfortunately , that 's not the case . Especially for collars , and creases , you still need an iron . Very disappointed with this purchase .	-1
Really 2.5 stars . This kettle boils water very quickly . The pouring spout is poorly designed and dangerous . After a few months of daily use , the auto shut off feature stopped working . Now , it will just boil forever . I 'm looking to replace this soon .	-1
One of the very few disappointing purchases from Amazon . The auto shut off feature stopped working after a month . Now if I forget about my boiling water it will just cook away until there 's nothing left . Waste of money.UPDATE : Yesterday , not only did the boiling shutoff fail , but the emergency shutoff failed as well . I forgot about the boiling water ( which is what the emergency shutoff is FOR ) and smelled burning plastic . Went into the kitchen and there it was , the base completely melted and fused with the kettle . If I did n't smell the melted plastic and unplug it , it could 've easily started a fire . I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from this brand again .	-1
I was so excited about this kettle . It is attractive , and I was glad to read that there is no plastic touching the water , which is my main concern.Unfortunately , I had the same experience as a few other reviewers . The kettle had a horrible oily/chemical smell . I washed it with soapy water and then boiled and dumped several kettles full of water , but the smell persisted . I hoped that maybe something in the base was producing it that would burn off eventually , but I could taste something wrong with the water ( even through Earl Grey tea ) . I went upstairs for a moment , and when I came back down , I realized the smell had permeated the entire first floor.Also , the on/off switch was off-kilter . I worried that it would break eventually , and it is difficult to accept a cosmetic flaw in a $ 80 kettle.If I ever find another plastic-free kettle , I 'll update .	-1
I should have bought the other one for a few more dollars that folds up . This you could get at the dollar store . Would not buy again	-1
These seriously do not look like this picture . Close , but no cigar . I thought it was much more light weight than it looked and cheaply made . This will only be good for the lightest of items . I would n't even hang anything but a short short scarf on here or a sock . I did n't have trouble getting this on a rod though . Actually a shower curtain rod . So , I 'm baffled why people say it would n't go on their rods . Maybe mine are thinner than theirs . However , when I first tried to get it on a rod , it would n't go . If you turn the hanging latch to where it is directly beneath the roundness of the other one ... sort of where it looks like a & # 34 ; 3 & # 34 ; with the bottom one slight to the left of the upper one , it will go on a larger rod . When you take it off , you need to lift up and right to get it back off w/o having to fight with it . But these little snaps or ridiculously tiny , thin , cheapo ... would n't hold a 50 cent bag of chips together .	-1
OMG , , this knife rusted on me after only 2 months of use.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL ...	-1
I do n't even know how this thing broke , but it did . Its the 2nd one to break like that . I will never buy another brita pitcher w/ a flip lid . the shape of it is always weird and awkward too .	-1
The part holding on the plastic hinge broke before I even got to USE it ! I was taking it apart to wash it and it just snapped right off . And not just the hinge but the entire piece that attached it to the pitcher , so a 3 inch long break . Not made as sturdy as they used to be ( I was replacing my 8 year old original version which is still in great shape , but I wanted a space saver model ) .	-1
I bought this as a substitute to bottled water , however I was n't that thrilled with it . Since it is just me and my husband the filter timer is useless to us . It counts down weeks , not gallons used . Since it is just two of us we do n't use nearly as much water as a family of four would , so our filters should last longer . Also , the taste was n't all that great . I 'll be the first to admit that our tap water is pretty bad , but the filters did n't seem to improve it as much as I had hoped . We also had a hard time pouring water without the whole top lid falling off . The design is n't all that great . Overall I was n't that impressed with this pitcher . I got rid of it and have decided to try the Pur water dispenser instead . So far I like that much better .	-1
I have been using Brita pitchers for almost 15 years , and have used quite a few different ones . Recently I had to replace one ( which got dropped and cracked ) . There were only a couple of models available in our local Kroger store , so I ended up with this model . And I have been cursing Brita ever since . ( That 's after I wrote to them and got an idiotic non-sequitur response . ) Here are the main problems I have with it:1 . The lid is formed with two parts -- the part that opens up and the front part that is supposed to stay on the pitcher while one fills it up . Well , the front part does NOT stay on the pitcher . So every time I refill the pitcher , I have to attempt to snap the front part back in place . But the front part of the lid does not fit well with the filtering compartment , so it takes a couple of minutes ( of hating Brita ) to get the lid sort of back together.2 . The back portion of the lid -- the part that opens to allow faucet water to go in -- is difficult to open . I usually use two hands to press it in order to make it work . My children have stopped filling up the pitcher now -- they ca n't get the top to open ( although the front portion will willingly fall off at the most unexpected moment. ) 3 . This model may look sleek , but it is not the easiest to be picked up . Something does n't feel right with the balance between the handle and the reservoir . I think the upper portion of the pitcher curves out too much -- it is aesthetically pleasing , but ends up putting too much weight on the top-front of the pitcher , while the handle is designed in such a way that one ca n't comfortably hold the pitcher at a point on the handle to maintain a sense of balance . You can see , from the picture , the handle 's distance to the main body narrows down considerably as it gets to the top.The idiotic letter from Brita would not have mattered much , had I been able to find alternative models . After much searching online , it seems that Brita has pretty much abandoned all of its tried-and-true models in favor of the more aerodynamic-looking models ( except for the `` Classic '' round model ) . So perhaps Brita has gone the direction of HP ( the computer/printer company ) . I guess all good things must end somehow .	-1
I bought this at Walmart and was happy with it for 2 weeks . After 2 weeks it sounded like it was barely making it around each can . Than it got louder and sounded like it was moaning `` ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR gRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRg aRRRRRRRRRRRR '' and would only make it half way around the can . Finally it just died , well it still moans a little when you attempt to open a can , but it will no longer have anything to do with actually opening a can ... .it 's dead ... . What a piece of junk ... ..	-1
Did n't even plug the unit in . The lid is obviously not machined properly -- it 's not wide enough -- resulting in a gap which will allow heat and steam to escape . I suspect this lid is used on several different models and `` pretty much '' fits them all . ( The stoneware has four little grooves cut into its lip , which are designed to let out excessive steam . If the lid were about 1/4 inch wider , it would cover the pot nicely with the four little holes available for steam release . ) The lid also seems a bit light in weight and does n't sit perfectly flat on the lip of the pot . I can readily understand other reviewers ' complaints about overflow and splatter . Sorry , I 'm not willing to take a chance on this and will be returning it .	-1
I had one of these for 2 yrs and it was great . After the first year , the handle broke off the top . I contacted Rival and they said I could buy a new lid . Which I did . They send it and it is not the right size . Fortunately I was able to take the handle off the new one and put it on the old lid . Onto my next complaint ... the lid and handle get extremely hot.Well a few weeks ago I pull my crockpot out , pour in my ingredients , and plug it in . I hear a loud pop and see flames and sparks fly out of the bottom of the crockpot . My husband grabbed a potholder and unplugged it from the wall . Fortunately our circuit breakers popped themselves off when this happened . I took the ceramic dish out of the crockpot and turned the base over to see what happened . The cord was actually burned right off the base at the connection point ! ! Thankfully we were home when this happened.I immedietly called Rival since I have never gotten the base wet and always took care of the crockpot . They offered me a replacement crockpot , and to pay for the repairs from the fire on the counter . I did turn down the replacement product . I do NOT want another rival product in my house . Especially after finding out that this has happened to two other people I know ! ! I went out and bought a Hamilton Beach , and I never ever leave the crockpot on when we leave the house anymore.BE CAREFUL with RIVAL !	-1
This is a piece of garbage . We actually ended up cutting the cord off ( for safety reasons ) and use it as a pretend vacuum for the kids since it was comparable in price to toy vacuums . It does n't suck up a darn thing . It 's cheap , it 's flimsy . I do NOT recommend this vacuum .	-1
I read all the other reviews about how powerful this product is , but I have to go over and over a small tuft of rug fiber just to pick it up . I put my hand over the head and feel just a modest amount of suction , not the hurricane that I was expecting , and this is with a newly cleaned filter . I bet it works better with the brush running , but this can damage a rug so I have to leave it off . I gave an extra star as a mercy offering due to all the other high reviews , but so far I am under-impressed .	-1

This is kind of plastic-like . It is flimsy and it already broke . I will only get the real Rabbit from now on .	-1
This worked really well when I first got it , but it seems as though it gets harder and harder to use as time goes by , almost as if it 's wearing out . And it 's not when you insert the corkscrew into the wine , it 's when you try to pull the cork out - it 's almost impossible now . So , bottom line is - it will work for maybe a year or two but then you 'll need another , which to me is n't acceptable for the price I paid .	-1
This corkscrew worked very well . And it was well taken care of . It was n't dropped or thrown around.But after opening only two bottles of wine , the corkscrew portion itself , the part that moves up and down stopped doing that . It will now only push a cork into a bottle . I almost did that before I realized that it was n't going to work anymore.It just stopped turning the corkscrew.The idea is a good one but apparently you either have to spend more , or get a different brand.I may have gotten a dud , but , I remember thinking that the construction seemed a little loosey-goosey when I received it , but who knew .	-1
I bought over $ 600.00 worth of Fiesta , from the serving pieces to the tableware to the baking pieces and I did love them at first . I noticed lately that especially the dinnerware have not only SCRATCHES , but also BLACK KNIFE AND FORK LINES . I called the company and they said to use a copper cleaner and scrub them . I did and the black marks came off , BUT not the scratches . Also you have to continuously scrub them with the cleaner . I am thinking about selling them or at least the tableware at my next yard sale . Very disappointed .	-1
Pros : good price , convenient size , lightweightCons : very low suction , very short battery life ( a little more than 5 minutes maximum ) , relatively easy for particles to flow out of the vacuum	-1
It could n't hold a charge for long . Blew air in our faces . Did n't pick up well and after about a year stopped working . I threw it in the trash .	-1
i dont like this one , before i had the dirt devil extreme power hand vac with 15.6volts . it died and i chose this cheaper hand vac to replace it , but i would not choose it again nor over the DDE 15.6v.the B & D ; is compact which i do like . it is quietish . it is easy to unplug the charger cable.cons : doesnt pick up sesame street crackers , kix cereal , or objects of that size . the voltage is really low . not something you 'd use to vaccuum your car . does n't carry charge very long . awkward parts keep falling out.i had to sweep my entire floor surface into a pile , and even the vac ran out of juice before i finished vaccing up the pile . definitely dont recommend a vac with this low power.i dont understand the reviews where people say they vaccuumed phenomenally with this , and the real only good thing i could say about it is its charging cable is nice and simple and small .	-1
At my urging we purchased one of these for work to clean filters . And it works okay but like an earlier reviewer it could be better . It 's certainly not as good as some purport it to be . The cordless function is nice , but the attachments would be better if they snapped into place rather than fitting snugly only to pop out occasionally while in use , which is irritating . But suction power 's not too bad . On a scale of 1 to 5 for suction I 'd give it a 3 or 4 . It could be better but I would n't get this one if you plan on using it alot . For an occasional use it 's okay .	-1
It looks like I 'm not the only one with this problem . The sprayer clogs almost immediately . For me , it was the second time I used it . I cleaned the hose out , used it again , and it jammed again . I replaced the hose , and that jammed.So now , if it 's a carpet emergency , I just use a pitcher to pour hot water and cleaner onto the carpet , and suck it up with the Little Green . It 's better than a bunch of paper towels ... but way worse than an upright carpet cleaner !	-1
product does job well but after only 10 uses ( about 1 year ) hose cracked in half - apparently you must take to an authorized service center for hose replacement - in my case that was a round trip of significant miles .	-1
I bought this one after my 2nd Hoover SteamVac Jr. had a broken part . Granted , we have cats and an old dog in the house , so there is a lot of cleaning for the little Vac . Still , I was tired of having to replace the steam vac . So I decided to try the Little Green machine.Compared with the Hoover Jr ( which is by no means a super machine ) , this machine does a POOR job vaccumming up the liquid it sprays out . It leaves carpet and other surfaces practically wet . But that is not what bothers me most.This machine is designed in such a way that one is bound to spill the nasty yuck one vaccums up . Part of the reason is that the bottom of the dirty reservoir leaks . Then the dirty liquid reservoir is designed with an opening on top ( why ? ? ? ) and if one is not extra careful , that nasty stuff inside will spill out with the slightest tilt . It is exasperating how easy it is to spill the dirty liquid.This machine is not worth the trouble . I am going to get another Hoover SteamVac Jr .	-1
I at first thought the Hoover was great . It sucked up everything in sight and cleaned well . The attachments were generous , and could clean an array of areas.But as that hepa filter got clogged with that white powder it lost suction . I called the company and they said to replace the filter . $ 30 right there . So much for saving on filters.Even with only half our house having carpet , the filter needs to be banged out . About once a week I have to go out with a dust mask on and bang that white power out to avoid having to pay another $ 30 . Plus my wife ca n't lug it to the second floor of my house . Plus you need to empty the canister in the garage or something because when you do empty it , dust flies back into the air.The Hoover does not do my hardwood floors that well . So if you have any kind of hard floors , do n't expect this vacuum to do the job as well as models better designed for it.Plus , I do n't like to see my dirt . That 's kind of gross . If you need to be able to see your dirt to know you 're sucking it up , I think you have self-confidence issues .	-1
This was a nice skillet while it lasted . The finish eventually wears off and pan needs to be replaced . I am trying cast iron now .	-1
Something I cooked stuck on it and now I ca n't get it off by simple soap and sponge . I do n't want to scrub it otherwise all other coating will come off ! Not worth the price I paid.Now I use it to hit people !	-1
This one is a burn hazard . Following the directions , it states to place the first tortilla and then add ingredients & then place the 2nd tortilla and close.The problem is , the lid will not stay up . You need someone to hold it open for you . If it falls while you are trying to load the tortilla , it will burn you.Tried to prop the lid open with a wooden spoon , it badly scorch the end of it in the short time I used it to hold it open.Bad design .	-1
When I saw this , I thought it would be a good item for me because I make quesdillas for lunch most days . After using it ONE time ... . I discovered that I could make them faster and easier using a big frying pan on top of the stove . Since that is the way I made them before ... .. this was a total waste of money . The only reason I gave it 1 star is that it 's a great color . It is now just taking up cupboard room and will be thrown away or sold at a garage sale soon .	-1
I bought this Vornado heater from Amazon.com about 3 years ago . Within the first year , the thermostat went out ( producing too much heat ) so I paid ~ $ 25 shipping to return it to Vornado for repairs ( no local authorized repair dealer ) . Over the past year ( 3rd year we 've had it ) , we 've had to turn the knob more and more toward the low heat setting to keep it from overheating . We 've been using it on AF ( fan only ) for about 4 mos . now because it was overheating even when it was barely above AF . Last night , the smoke detector went off shortly after I turned the Vornado on in my daughter 's bedroom . The Vornado , still on AF , was making a burning smell and smoking . This thing is going in the trash.I have an older model Vornado heater from 1993 that has worked reliably since I first bought it , so the problem may just be with this particular model .	-1
We purchased a Vornado and it did n't work half as good as a heater we already had that cost 1/2 the price ! Sure it had switches and controls but what it did n't have was much heat . For the size I expected it would provide a lot of heat over a wide area but it did n't .	-1
This heater does n't heat . I had an older model Vornado that was great . Unfortunately , in the newer models the thermostat turns off at the highest setting even though the room is still quite cold . When the thermostat goes off the fan just circulates cold air . Freezing here ...	-1
I purchased 2 Henckel knives and this sharpner.The knives lost their sharpness almost immediately . It was fun using them while they were sharp.The sharpener simply does not work no matter how many times you run the knives through . It has also left marks on the knives.Rather than waste your money on this one , try to find sometthing that actually works .	-1
My discs on II were stuck and ruined my Zwilling chef knife edge . This was right after opening the package . The wheels do n't turn at all and still do n't turn after forcing them into a new position . And they are so stuck they do need to be forced . Its obvious as grey metal lines form on the discs in the same spot . Returning it and trying out a replacement . Hopefully the new one works . Pay attention to make sure your discs turn otherwise it will ruin your knives.If the wheels did turn I could see this working well .	-1
Does a ok job . Not very impressed . I now just pay the money and get my knives sharpened every six months or so .	-1
i have since learned that you should NEVER EVER EVER use any kind of soap on carpet , hence the reason there are so many & # 34 ; steam cleaning & # 34 ; businesses out there . though i do n't recall having any issues with this product , i do know it was always just a temporary clean before the stains resurfaced .	-1
I 've been using the 12 cup Santos for about two years now and love it . So I was very excited to try out the mini version for when it 's just me . But sadly , the machine was disfunctional . It spewed coffee grounds through the air vents all over the pot and my countertops . HUGE volcanic mess ! I made four pots of coffee , to make sure it was n't something I was doing , but this occured three out of the four times . And in that one time that it did n't explode , the coffee was week . Not as rich as with the 12 cup version , and I used the same ratio of coffee to water . I do n't think the brew time is as long as with the larger version , resulting in weaker coffee.I called Bodum to see what they had to say about the volcanic eruption , and they were n't helpful at all . They suggested I return the product to where I purchased it , or if I wanted to send it to them at my expense , they would fix it.I DO NOT recommend the MINI Santos , but I do recommend the 12 cup Santos .	-1
There is a much better version that has interchangeable grills and is much bigger . It 's okay for small things but not great .	-1
I USED SQUARE SANDWICH BREAD ( WHICH I BUTTERED ON THE OUTSIDE ) , SHARP CHEDDAR CHEESE WHICH WHEN IT HEATED CAME OUT ALL OVER THE SANDWICH MAKER . WHEN I CAME BACK AFTER IT WAS COOLED THE CHEESE WAS SO STUCK ALL OVER THE DAMN MACHING IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE SCRAPED OFF . THIS IS A JOKE AND NOT WORTH MY TIME .	-1
I make a lot of grilled sandwiches so I bought this thinking it would be easier than just doing them in a frying pan . I was very disappointed.First off , this thing is impossible to clean . The hinges in the back are very close together with seams which allow anything that seeps out ( cheese mostly ) to get stuck in there . There is no way to separate the top from the bottom and the space is too small to actually get in there and clean effectively so you get food stuck in there that you ca n't reach to clean.Another annoyance is your sandwich wo n't actually be separated as you would expect , you have to actually cut them with a knife ( pulling apart does n't work as the crease is n't even deep enough to allow you to do that ) Thirdly , the sandwiches I made did not taste that great . I tried using cooking spray and even some butter to see if that was the difference , but they still tasted slightly `` off '' . Not a bad taste , just something weird about it.I never used it to make omelets or french toast or anything like that ( just grilled sandwiches ) so I ca n't really comment on those but I 'd imagine you 'd have the same problem with clean up.There is no on and off switch , nor any temperature settings . If you want to cook something less or more well done you can not .I used this thing probably 5 or 6 times before I gave up and sent it back . I was hoping this would be more convenient to use but it was not at all .	-1
This piece does not make traditional pizzelles . Get a VillaWare or Cucinapro . They work better	-1
I followed the instructions to a tee and the Pizzelle stuck to the press 50 % of the time . So out of one recipe , half were n't usable . I sent it back to Amazon .	-1
I was the first my neighborhood to buy a Cuisinart 30 years ago . It served me very very well for all these years . Time to get a new one so I purchased this model . It was impossible to clean , very difficult to use , and died after 3 uses . Save yourself some grief .	-1
A normal coffee maker requires a quick rinse ; this machine requires a wash , rinse and a thorough drying of the grinding unit . You ca n't just rinse the grinding unit because the fine coffee grounds need to be washed out.If it was n't for the fact that we spent nearly $ 100 for this unit , I would throw it away.SAVE YOUR MONEY - DO N'T BUY IT	-1
I have owned two of the Cuisinart Grind and Brew Coffee Makers , the first one was actually better than the last , DGB500BK , it leaked all the time and ruined my tile countertop and had to have it completely regrouted . Made good coffee , but customer service was horried and parts expensive .	-1
This is the WORST piece of junk that I have ever used.I have owned this since Christmas 2003 . I just threw it in the trash after the 5th time the basket drawer opened during mid grind . Talk about a mess ! ! When you press the button to start , the grinder goes to work ... for WAY too long in my opinion ... and ... if you 're lucky enough to turn away ... and the basket drawer opens up ... you have a WORLD CLASS MESS to clean up ... all the grinds are thrown all over the place ... inside the entire unit ... all over the counter and floor ... ARRRRRRGH ! ! ! ! The grinder gets stuck , meaning you cant easily remove it because it 's STUCK ! ! ... and filthy every time ... expect a 15 minute clean up even if everything works ... every time you use it ... The one thing I can say that is positive about this unit is that I 'll NEVER have to use it again because I tore the basket holder in half trying to remove it to clean out the grounds from INSIDE ... so I threw it in the trash ... I 'm going to buy a cup of coffee at the coffee store ...	-1
I 've been meaning to write a review on this for over a year . My husband bought this for me , which I appreciate . However , the grinder is louder than a plane ! The Capresso is much quieter than this thing . Mine is a couple years old now , so maybe they 've improved it ? I agree with much of Neurotome 's review . When Cuisinart tells you to rinse and dry each component they MEAN it . If you do not , the condensation builds up in the grinder and it is full of water . You will not be able to make coffee the next day without drying it out , including the chute , because the grinds will stick . If you just choose to not use the loud grinder for a while , which I did , the moisture still builds up and you will get mildew . I learned this the hard way . I did not have any problem with the plastic parts warping , though , because I would never put plastic components in a dishwasher , since that would expose them to very high temperatures.Seriously , unless you are willing to remember that once the coffee is done to : open the top , take out the grinder , pull the lid off the grinder , rinse both , let them air dry , open the basket , empty it , dry basket and its lid ... do n't get this thing . You will have a loud mildew-fest .	-1
I think the idea is novel , but the cleanup is ridiculous ! It sends the water right through the coffee grinder making a huge mess . Also , in white , it gets filthy on the outside as well . I bought this for my husband as a father 's day present , and this year I bought him a machine we 'll actually enjoy .	-1
Like others who have submitted reviews , I loved this coffee maker at first , but quickly learned how fickle it can become in record time . In addition to the nightmare it is to clean , and the sludge that is created by steam leaking into the grinder section , my biggest problem has been the spillage issue . Countless mornings , I walk into the kitchen to find the majority of coffee all over the counter instead of in the carafe . First thinking this was `` operator error , '' I began routinely checking and double checking to be sure everything was firmly seated in place , but still have the problem nonetheless . This morning , I not only awoke to 2/3 of the pot pooled all over the counter , but also saw the glass had shattered just below the silver band on the carafe . It was fine when I assembled things last night , but this morning ? Disaster yet again . One year after purchasing this , I 'm headed to the trash can with the thing . What began as a dream machine quickly turned into a royal pain in the patoot .	-1
I purchased my first 500 in complete faith of the Cuisinart brand . I have three other kitchen products by that company and they work great . I should have known there was a reason why there are more than 50 negative reviews of this coffee maker.It is very poorly designed . I have had two go bad in less than three years - the length of the warranty . I will admit that Cuisinart has replaced the machine twice , but the last time was a real hassle.It is obvious that they know they have a disfunctional product . The lady who answered at customer service asked numerous questions about how I was using the machine , in an overt attempt to place the blame for their poor product on my use habits . When that failed , she tried to tell me the reason why my machine was no longer completing a grind and brew cycle , while spewing most of the water out on the countertop and steaming up the front of the machine , was because the `` cleaning cycle '' was not being reset by me.According to her , the coffee maker has a sensor in it that `` knows '' when I have decided to run a vinegar-water mixture through for decalcification and it is waiting for me to unplug the machine so it can `` reset '' its cycles . Give me a break . They have obviously given the cs folks a page of BS to read to those who call complaining about this particular device.Do n't bother spending your money on this badly designed hunk of junk . I will use the new one they sent me until it fails - I estimate 4 to 6 months , based on past experience - and then I 'll trash it for a better machine .	-1
The taste of the brewed coffee is adequate . However , I can not get past the lid on the carafe . It just will not pour . It dribbles . It drips . But does n't really pour . It 's almost like the lid is clogged . But I 've talked to others with this unit and they say their lid works the same way . So I guess I just do n't like a carafe that pours slowly and sloppily .	-1
I can not believe that anyone would give this machine a less than awesome review . It makes a superior cup of coffee to say the least , and I am a bit of a coffee snob as well . My fiance is addicted to Dunkin Donuts coffee and he would never drink coffee at home until we bought this machine ... now , he not only drinks coffee at home , but he also makes it himself because it 's such a cinch to use . Yes , it is true that there are some parts to clean - you have to remove the filter and run it under water and I also clean out the grinder part every time , all in all though , it takes less than a minute to clean and is well worth the effort . In fact , I 'm buying another one today as a gift ! Update 5/08 - we are still using the coffee maker and have encountered one problem that I believe other reviewers have complained about . The grinder basket gets stuck and you have to pull that out to be able to properly clean it . I emailed customer service and about a month ( yes , a month ! ) later they emailed me back and asked for a serial number . In the meantime we had already figured out the best way to handle the problem . We put vaseline on it and it has been sliding in and out of its spot without problem for the past couple of months . I find that cleaning the grinding mechanism and drying it ( very important ) really keeps the machine running well.So , I would still highly recommend this product , if you are willing to put in the time to properly clean it after each use ( which takes less than a minute with some hot water and a paper towel ) . Although clearly customer service is n't all that great , so be prepared to address any problems on your own or with the store you purchased it from.UPDATE 12/09 . Ah , my bad . Now I agree with many of the other reviewers , this thing is not built to last . Eventually the grinder basket wo n't come out at all and you just end up with crusted coffee grounds all over . Everyone I know who bought this machine ( sorry for the bad recommendation friends and family ! ) has experienced frustration after a couple of years . And customer service - does n't exist . It 's gone . Never again.If you are looking for a recommendation for a grind and brew , my sister has the Capresso machine and is a big fan .	-1
The Good of this is GREAT . It does require regular thorough cleaning each use , but that 's not as bad as everyone claims . I can now clean all food surface aspects of the machine ( grinder chamber , filter basket , etc . ) while the carafe fills with water for the next pot , but it also needs a one-a-week thorough scrub-down to ensure that ground coffee dust does n't build-up behind the filter basket and around the motor shaft . That adds about 4 minutes per week to your routine . We de-calcify and replace the internal water filter per Cuisinart 's instructions.BEST FEATURE : After using the thermal carafe , I ca n't understand why any glass carafes remain in this world.WORST FEATURE : DURABILITY.It is under-engineered and under-built . We 've bought FOUR of this model ( usually using 2 machines at a time at 1 pot per day each ) and one of the prior ( 1999 - white plastic with glass carafe ) model . Two were replaced under warranty , for a total of SEVEN using the same basic components and SIX being the DGB-600 model . All had the same electronics , grinder motor , bean chamber and filter-basket design.Usually , the failure is either the grinder motor ( 3 failures , 2 replaced under warranty ) or the fit of the bean chamber onto the grinder drive shaft ( they are using cheap plastic where metal is required ) . In one case , the system continues to work , but the grinder motor is SO LOUD that it ca n't be used in the kitchen , so it 's out of action . We have also had 2 failures of electronics.Cuisinart is very difficult to deal with : Hard to get a human on the phone and not at all helpful.In addition to these ( all bought new , one from J.C. Penney and the rest from Amazon ) , I was also stupid enough to buy one for my shop which was refurbished from Amazon . That one lasted just 3-1/2 months - just a week and a bit beyond the 90-day sellers ' warranty . Sure , I bought it for only $ 10 more than the cost of the thermal carafe , but with failure rate of these machines , who needs another eternal thermal carafe ? I suspect that , as with cell phones , warranty replacements are refurbs that have already failed once in somebody else 's hands , because these two did not last either.I wish Cuisinart would upgrade the engineering and durability features of this basic design . How about an electronics module which can be swapped out for $ 25 ? I 'd be happy to pay $ 50 more for a more durable product with an expected life of , say , 5 years instead of $ 110 +/- for 1-1/2 to 2 years.On the up side , we now have a lot of outstanding thermal carafes which will probably last forever ! Update : Another one failed - bad electronics again . The last two examples of this coffee maker barely lasted six months each !	-1
Here 's what you got ta do EVERY MORNING or night before bed if you want to make fresh ground coffee . First take out the grinder apparatus , there is a clear round disk with uniquely difficult to clean crevices caked with water-saturated coffee grounds . You ca n't get in there with your fingers so maybe a butter knife and a paper towel is best . Then there is the canal which is a curved tunnel full of crevices caked with partially ground beans and still more saturated coffee grounds . Then there is the grinding bowl with yes , even still more coffee grounds ( The bowel is round so it 's not difficult to clean - ie . you can just use your hand- no butter knife needed . The rest is just like making regular coffee.But here 's the thing about the mop : Imagine , it 's 5:30am you snooze anxiously because you can hear your trusty Grind and Brew preparing your coffee for you ... but instead of a nice pot of coffee ... `` NOT AGAIN ! '' the filter tray has once again popped out of place and instead of a pot full of coffee you have a counter-top and floor full of coffee . So get a mop , get a sponge , clean it all up and then repeat the first paragraph , wait 15 more minutes and `` ahhh '' that 's some good fresh coffee . You might throw travel mug in with your purchase , because you 're gon na lose about 25 minutes once or twice a month with this one .	-1
I purchased this coffee maker in preparation for a kitchen renovation . I had never owned an automatic coffee maker before and I always ground my own beans , so this seemed like a good choice . Truly , it was a mistake . First of all , the coffee was never hot enough when it was brewed . As a result , I had to boil water first so that it would be hot enough when brewed . Simply heating the inside of the carafe with hot water was not enough . Even then , the coffee was never really very hot . When the paper filter in the filter chamber was the tiniest bit askew , the coffee would flood out onto the counter . To solve this , I used a gold filter with a paper filter inside . The coffee was OK , but each day I had to wash the carafe and lid , the filter holder , the filter holder lid , the gold filter insert , and both parts of where the beans are placed to be ground . With my renovation beginning , and the only place to wash things being the bathroom sink or the basement laundry room sink , I gave up on this and bought a Keurig that has nothing to wash and for which I have read almost uniformly good reviews . We 'll see how that goes , but this one is going down to the basement until I figure out what to do with it .	-1
For convenience and fast brewing I give this two stars , but there 's where the good news ends . I live in a humid climate so the grinder requires constant servicing because the delivery chute clogs up constantly . Particularly if you like a dark or oily roast , this is not the machine for you . Also , to get a decent brew strength you have to set the machine to grind more beans than the actual cups you are making . Oh and I should mention , the grinder is so loud it will wake the dead ! For 6 cups set it for 8 , etc . Plus if you set it for 10-12 cups , expect the coffee grinds to overflow into your pot . Although the brew pot is big enough to accommodate 12 cups , the brew basket is NOT big enough to accommodate 12 cups worth of ground coffee . My biggest complaint however is the temperature . It is just warm at best . Does n't matter if you pre-warm the pot with hot water . The coffee is still just barely warm enough to drink . Eventually I just gave up and my routine involved microwaving the cup of coffee for 30 seconds to bring it up to drinking temperature . I put up with this for nearly a year until one day the kitchen clock fell off the wall and shattered the bean hopper lid . To my disdain , I found that Cuisinart does NOT sell a replacement lid for the bean hopper . After that I gave up and boughtCapresso 464.05 CoffeeTeam GS 10-Cup Digital Coffeemaker with Conical Burr Grinder . I may very well have found the perfect home coffee station in the Capresso ! It 's not quite as fast as the Cuisinart but it 's plenty fast enough , plus the coffee comes out HOT ( I 've scalded myself several times ) and the machine settings allow you to choose the brew strength without the `` number of cups '' issue the Cuisinart has . So far I 've had no grinder delivery chute clogs and no other problem whatsoever with the Capresso . Yes , I am a coffee snob and yes , I may well be in love with the Capresso . Goodbye forever , Cuisinart .	-1
We bought this coffee maker about 10 months ago . Yes , it is loud , but then it has to grind the beans and get the ground coffee into the filter . We can live with that . It has many parts that should be taken out and cleaned after each use , yep , can deal with that too.But , in less than a year we have had the spring and drip stop break off of the filter holder ( it stops the coffee from coming out if you remove the carafe ) and now the bottom part of the grinding cup is apparently getting wedged onto the post when it grinds . This makes the cup incredibly difficult to remove and a real pain in the butt . I 've written to the company twice in the past 10 days , using a form on the Cuisinart web site and have not had one response.So while it looks nice and the carafe does keep coffee warm for some time , we will probably be junking this and switching to a different coffee maker and probably separate grinder . And the new one wo n't be a Cuisinart . A company that does n't respond to their customers is n't worth supporting by purchasing their product .	-1
It looked like a great idea . I 'm a big coffee drinker and I love fresh ground coffee , so I plopped down the $ 125 ( approx . ) for what I thought was a well engineered and well thought out product . Shortly thereafter , I realized that it was a lot of work to brew a pot of coffee . When you start with a dry grinder and chute , it works great ! Put the beans and water in the night before , set the timer , and wake up to that wonderful sound of beans grinding . Fastforward to bedtime . You just want to plop down into bed , but you ca n't because you have to take the grinder apart , wash and dry it , wipe down the dispenser chute and all the coffee sludge that accumulates inside the top compartment . When it brews , the top compartment fills with steam and condensation , soaking the grinder and chute in the process . DESIGN FLAW ! Having to take apart , clean , and dry this thing every single day became such a pain in the rear that I threw the damned thing in the garbage . I would n't give that piece of crap to my worst enemy.I bought a Hamilton Beach Brewstation as a replacement . Now that 's a great coffee maker !	-1
Most of the reviewers of this piece of garbage have got it dead on . Mine is dead after less than 2 years of headaches . It finally belched smoke out the back & now I can burden our local landfill with its carcass . I have had every problem that the other reviewers are complaining about . I did n't mind cleaning the entire thing every morning . I did n't mind running vinegar through it & changing the filter so it actually functioned . I did mind getting 10 cups of coffee spewed all over my kitchen when the basket malfunctioned , I did mind the weak coffee & the need to stuff every last bean into the grinder so it made merely a half-crappy cup , and I did mind the cheaply made basket door which popped out or got stuck in . Misuse my a** , this is simply a crappy , overpriced gimmicky coffeemaker . And if you had to get warranty service , why do you love this coffeemaker so much ? I had a Black & Decker that still worked perfectly when I gave it to my daughter after about 7 years of faithful service . I thought heck , I will never need it again , I have a brand new gimmicky whiz-bang grind your own whoo-hoo fru-fru coffeemaker ! Boy was I wrong . Thanks Cuisinart , your products are garbage & I will never , ever buy another one , as long as I live , so help me God , etc . etc .	-1
This coffee brewer is a nightmare . It is very messy and impossible to clean . Always gets very nasty after every pot . The grinder is full of messy wet gunk after every brew.I hate this stupid thing ! I am ready to throw it out and have only had it since summer .	-1
I gave it a four stars almost a year and half ago . Today had to change it to 2 star as it simply stopped working . This is the first coffee maker I had so I do n't know how long a coffee maker is supposed to last . Still 3 years used only lightly - mostly at weekends , I 'd expect any kitchen utility shall survive longer than this. -- Below my original review -- -- -- -- -I 've had it for two years . It 's my first grind and brew so I had no comparison . However as a consumer I felt there should be better ones . I bought it because of its name Cuisinart . It looks very elegant in the kitchen . The biggest drawback is it is really hard to clean if you Grind coffee . Thermo Coffee pot does not really keep coffee hot/Warm . When coffee is ready , you better drink right away . But overall it does work . It makes coffee . It can grind . I set the timer before going to bed and when I wake up coffee is waiting for me . It is noisy when it grinds , but grinding supposed to be noisy , does n't it .	-1
I had the same experience as another reviewer in that the gear that attaches to the carafe sheared off - mine was n't melting , however , it just was n't up to the torque of the blender , which does have a nice big motor that makes all the lights in the house dim when it 's turned on ... the thing is , though , it does n't do that great a job . My old blender did just as well overall and better with small quantities ( it was the Braun with the triangular carafe ) ; this one does an awful job with anything less than about 2 cups . I replaced the gear piece but it still has other issues , the most annoying being that unless everything is seated absolutely perfectly when the carafe is assembled it leaks like a sieve , and it is nearly impossible to assemble precisely because of the stupid plastic collar , which is purely `` decorative '' . The same design flaw makes it huge pain to disassemble for cleaning - the grip is inside the silly collar thing and it 's hard to get good leverage , and the collar does n't have anything to hold onto . It also has `` decorative '' metal bands on the carafe which rust between the metal and the carafe , and are not removeable . I would highly recommend checking out other products .	-1
I am looking for a new blender . I 've had this Cuisenart for about three years , and just broke the jar . Usually I opt for the least expensive , most environmental solution , but in this case -- I really do n't like this blender . Reading other reviews , I now acknowledge that it IS loud . And even worse , it emits a burning smell when working hard . I make a lot of hummus , and have burned through several blenders . And while this one has lasted longer than most , I constantly worry and have to unplug the thing and watch for smoke , because it does emit the smell of burning rubber after it 's been on for even a short while . Today I was blending the ingredients for a cheesecake -- not nearly a thick a mixture as hummus -- and it still emitted the burning smell . Even though the blender does still have some life in it , it is not worth investing $ 25- $ 45 for a new jar.Oh yeah -- it also has that `` air pocket '' problem where pockets form around the blade and you have to shake and stir and battled the mixture to beat the ingredients back down to the blades . And it unscrews from the base even after short blends .	-1
We 've had our Cuisinart for over a year and use it infrequently . One of the reasons why it gets so little use is the size and the weight . This is a heavy , heavy blender . And while I normally equate heavy industrial kitchenware with quality , in this case , I 'm afraid Cuisinart has let us down . I never stress the motor on our model , yet even blending salad dressing , I get a faint whiff of burning rubber or ... There is also an issue with the actual glass , the lip of the blender is so wide that pouring liquids is a pain -- tons of spills . I have a feeling that Cuisinart 's best men/women were out to lunch the day this design was passed . Maybe we can blame it on the interns . And while pictures of the product look nice , seeing the thing sitting on my counter , well , it 's so large and bulky that that is exactly how it looks : Large and Bulky . No real elegance and it 's not funky cool the way KitchenAid mixers are . Seems to me we got more longevity and easier use out of my cheaper model that I tossed to make way for this one .	-1
We only used this blender to make drinks . Sometimes with ice , and sometimes with frozen fruit . It mixed okay , but always seemed clumsy . This blender is over priced and poorly designed . The blade mechanism just locked up and burned out the motor . As with so many Cuisinart products ; it looks great , but is too large for the function and poorly engineered ( their coffee maker is the same way . ) I do like the original Cuisinart food processor . I am switching to the Oster BCCG08-C 6-Cup 8-Speed Blender . It is about 1/2 the price . Hopefully I will have a better experience .	-1
Decent for flapjacks , but they cook much quicker on the right near the power connector.Does n't maintain high temp for serious browning though .	-1
I ordered these a while back to make cookies for my granddaughter . What I got was a GARISH collection of these that were FAR TOO UGLY to use on anything . I do not recommend these to anyone . They do not match up to the picture shown . Shame on Wilton for even making what they sent me .	-1
I 'm so disappointed about this product . I used it for chocolate making , on the first day it arrives , after like 5 rounds of 10 cavities squeezing , it all of sudden pours certain amount of chocolate fillings over my counter ! Then I found the tube mouth ( twist part ) is half way broke from the bottle , which caused the leakage . So disappointed , and seriously want a refund on it .	-1
I got this pan in 2003 , for $ 29.99 on amazon . I was surprised to see that they still have it in stock ( it 's since been discontinued in favor of Calphalon One ) given that it 's now 3 years later , and at the exact same price . I guess not many people like Calphalon hard anodized , otherwise at this price it should have sold out long ago . **CONS**This was my first Calphalon pan , and it will likely be my last . I just ca n't get the hang of cooking with it . It cooks very well with the lid on but I hate cooking any other way with it because the food inevitably sticks . No matter how low of a flame I put the pan on and heating the oil first and making sure the food is at room temperature etc. , it still sticks . Some reviewers claim that it 's supposed to stick and then it will release later at some magic moment `` right when it 's supposed to '' but for me , it just sticks and it rips a chunk out of my chicken which is n't very attractive when you serve it.As for all the `` clean up 's a breeze '' comments , in my experience that is true if you put the lid on and cook for a few hours on low heat , but everything sticks like crazy if you are cooking with the lid off . IMO it 's akin to cooking in a stainless steel pan -- it sticks a lot more than I want/need it to . The food does wash off with a bit of soaking , but after drying the pan I often notice there are weird stains on the pan which do not come off unless I use Bon Ami . I do n't like having food outlines on my pans because it makes me suspect that the pan 's not really clean . **PROS**The only thing I do like about the pan is the shape . The edges are low and sloped enough to be used like a saute pan or a griddle , but high enough that oil does n't spatter out all over and it can hold a good amount of liquid . The pan has a large surface area . The domed lid means you can fit something kind of high in and still cover the pan -- for example I could put two racks of babyback ribs in ( each cut in half ) . But all this does n't really make up for the hard anodized surface which I 've tried but just can not work with . **bottom line**If you 're buying this pan to do the sear-then-slow-cook-for-hours thing , it 's perfect for that . If you want to use it for stir fry 's and other regular stove top cooking , I hope you have better luck than I did . Or just forget it and buy something easier to use . I like my cast iron and Le Creuset ovens a WHOLE lot better for every conceivable purpose .	-1
Everyday pans are my favorite but I was so disappointed . With butter and low heat food sticks and is difficult to remove .	-1
I was very disappointed that the finish is easily scratched . The pan was in the sink waiting to be washed and I found it scratched pretty badly from I could n't figure out what . There was nothing there that should have done that . My husband researched the finishes and thinks the infused finish must be the better quality one . I got this pan on sale , but it was originally pretty expensive . I 'd say it was way too expensive for such poor a quality finish .	-1
This is the first Calphalon pan I have purchased . After hearing how wonderful Calphalon was , I could n't believe how poorly it preformed . It seems no matter what I prepare in this pan , it sticks and is diffcult to clean . I now rarely use it and know if it was easier to clean I would use it often . Very disappointed .	-1
Encouraged by the consumer reviews and great price , I got this pan . I used it only once for an omelette , and even soaking and scrubbing could n't remove the residue . I have been cooking for 30 years and have never had a pan this hard to clean . I was rather shocked and of course , disappointed.I figured it must have a defective finish . Even the cover had a dusty appearance , and if you ran your finger over the surface , there was a visible mark , like there was a light coating of dust.I sent it back about 3 weeks ago , and Amazon says they have n't received it yet . Not too happy about that . I want my refund !	-1
I do n't understand why Calphalon will claim this pan to be stick-resistant . It sticks even more easily than usual pans . EVERYTHING sticks even at low heat and a lot of oil .	-1
this is n't a user review because i mailed this garbage pan right back to amazon with two other calphalon pot/pans from the same line ( commercial hard-anodized ) . the good reviews written about this and other calphalon cookware pieces from this line are dated . all recent reviews for the most part are negative because the product is from china not u.s.a. and the quality is crap . you can clearly see machined grooves on the surface and the handles just do n't look like they are made good . i love amazon and have never returned anything to them before but honestly they should n't sell this line from calphalon . even calphalon does n't sell it on their site ( i wonder why ? ) . i opted for analon products and so far i am very pleased . they also have sales on their site which are better than some of amazon 's prices . if you want quality non-stick without breaking the bank then check out analon advanced cookware . hope this helps save some people the cost of return shipping .	-1
Arrived with a scratch right through the coating which looked paper thin . Based on another review ( item is now made in China ) I wonder if this is n't the same quality it used to be ?	-1
Maybe should 've given it more time and practice . But have moved on to other pans .	-1
THIS PAN HIT THE TRASH WITH A VERY LOUD THUD ! ! ! I did n't use metal utensils or submit it to trips in the dishwasher ( mostly because I do n't own one yet ) and I exclusively utilized Scotch No-Scratch scrubbers , on the spongy side only ! Yet here I am 10 months down the road with a useless pan . It 's as if the coating wore off . It was never overheated . Where did I go wrong ? ? In addition , the hard-anodized exterior leaves much to be desired . If you spill something over the side while cooking and you do n't immediately pull the pan off the burner and remove the spilled food item it will become `` cooked on '' before you 're done with whatever food you 're cooking and then becomes a permanent part of the pan -- UNSIGHTLY ! This pan lasted no longer than conventional Silverstone -- my $ 30.00 T-Fal lasted longer than this ! ! Where did I go wrong ? ? I 'll tell you where I went wrong : I paid $ 29.99 ( on a great sale ) for a pan with a supposedly `` lifetime warranty '' . The only thing I would really like to know now : whose lifetime ? Mine or the pans ' ? Good thing I did n't pay full retail . Mailing this heavy thing back would not improve it 's `` lifetime '' performance.There were 2 things it did have going for it , though . One was the size of the pan and the other was that it had only begun to turn dark colored in a small area of the inside surface before starting to peel , chip and/or flake . It actually looked as if the inside coating had begun to dissolve and melt away.I plan to purchase the newer Swiss Diamond pan to test out . At $ 69.99 it also comes with a lifetime warranty and you can use metal utensils in it . I figure if I keep using silicone utensils , just maybe I can get a few years use out of it . My Daddy always said you got what you paid for . I 'm finding that to be very true !	-1
We have had this pan for 2 years - and was one of our favorites . We used it very carefully , but the nonstick coating is coming off and we are throwing it away . Very disappointed !	-1
I bought the bookcase recently . because , it look pretty in picture . but , when I got it , I found it is very difficulty to assemble . do n't know what is next step -return it ( have to pay $ 37 return shipping fee ) . keep it . I need spend $ 100 to invite a handy man to help me even not sure he can make it or not . I do n't buy this kind of furniture future any more	-1
These are not working for me , they keep falling off the wall . I tried them on three different walls in different rooms and same result . I would not recommend these . I had to go get regular hooks that get nailed into the wall .	-1
The small pots are too small and you ca n't stir the food if you do n't want to mess up your kitchen . The big one is too big and it 's for making soup for 10 people . No medium size pot .	-1
The pan I received was damaged in a way that looked like it was a factory second or something . There appeared to be an attempt to cover-up the damage . I was looking forward to getting this pan and was very disappointed to have to return it . It is a very nice and cute pan but I will not start out with damaged goods .	-1
This item burnt on me the first time I used it . And its too small for the size of it anyway , max : 2 big eggs or 3 small eggs . Do n't recommend .	-1
I was disappointed with this glass lid.I bought this for my Lodge 12 & # 34 ; cast iron skillet and the fit was not that great , but the reason I am giving it a bad review is because the stainless steel ring around the glass was dented in two places.The dent on the bottom I was able to fix , but the dent on the top I could not do anything about.The lid came well protected by bubble wrap packing so I do n't think that it was damaged from FedEx but either Faberware quality control did not catch it or Amazon shipping did this , or maybe it was a returned item and they stuck me with it.Since I did n't pay very much for it , it 's not worth the hassle of returning it .	-1
This is a fine lid , if you happen to own a pot that it will fit . I bought it as a replacement for a Farberware pot which seems to have lost its lid along the way , and it does not fit . The diameter of this lid is 7 3/4 inches on the inner lip which fits inside the pot . Wish that the description would have stated that clearly and I could have saved myself the trouble of buying it and then sending it back .	-1
I agree with everyone else 's review about the plastic cracking on the tank . I cleaned my rugs three times before the plastic turned brittle and cracked . After researching online prices to replace the broken tank it made more sense to toss this one and buy a new one . I bought a Dirt Devil brand cleaner which so far has worked great . I would not recommend this carpet cleaner to anyone !	-1
I am another victim of the infamous leaking water tank . How very annoying to spend this much money on a piece of junk . Like many of you , my machine is past the warranty period and has begun to leak ... and I mean LEAK . The water runs out of the bottom of the clean tank faster than I can vacuum it up . GRRRRRRRR ! ! ! I would also add that the upholstery tool is attractive but USELESS . Take my advice and pass on this one ; it 's a loser . ( If there was a choice of ZERO stars that would be my rating . )	-1
I got online this morning to find out about replacing the clean fill tank on this machine since it cracked and leaked water on my third time using it -- past warranty . Luckily Google took me to this Amazon site and to the reviews that warn us about how chinsey this unit is made . Now I realize that although I could replace the tank , it will most likely crack again , and I will probably have to repair the brush assembly next , and that repair probably wo n't last . I speak as a person who usually has excellent luck with electronic products -- they usually last for me many years past the warranty . We all know that things are n't made to last anymore , but Hoover made a big mistake making a $ 300 product that has parts that only last through one or two uses . This product really is a piece of junk with parts that are not worth replacing because the parts will still be made of that same chinsey plastic and wo n't last .	-1
I bought this steam cleaner one year ago and have used it roughly 4 times . Each time I used it , I found I had to turn the rotating brush switch from off to on a couple of times to get the brushes turning . I did n't take it to get serviced , because Hoover wo n't cover the service charge , just the parts and labor . It worked great until the day after my warranty expired , which is today . The brushes wo n't turn at all and it will cost you about 75.00 to get the turbine replaced . And as an added bonus , the clean water tank has started leaking . A common problem , according to the repair guy . Save your money and get the Bissell steamvac . The service guy said by far he has had the least repairs on it .	-1
So I did n't expect this to be high quality for the price but I figured they would at least send two screws for installation .	-1
Well . . . . you ca n't get cheaper than this . I 've seen them in the stores , and they are the pourest quality you can find . I think you can pick-up something like this , or better , in one of those dollar stores for less than half the price.I should mention that it did come with two pieces of tape , and two screws.I bought this thing because it said it could be mounted with adhesive tape provided . I live in an apartment and I did n't want to make holes in the wall , or in my case , under the kitchen cabinet . Ok , so I 'll use the adhesive that this comes with , and stick it up under the cabinet . Low-and-behold , it comes with only two little pieces of double-sided foam tape about 3/4 x 1-1/2 inches . How am I going to stick it up with that ? I can hardly imagine it holding up a roll of paper towels for long , never mind me pulling on it . On top of that , and get this - - The back of the holder where you would put the tape is hollow . There 's basically nothing to stick the tape to . There 's just a couple of thin little edges of plastic that go around the holder . The only flat places to stick the tape to , is where the two screws go through , and they are only a little bigger than a pencil eraser . Imagine standing a 3 x 5 card on edge , and sticking foam tape to the top edge . Will it stick there ? Yes . But what 's going to happen if you pull on it a little ? It 's going to come right off . You ca n't expect the tape to hold that little edge.You really do n't want this thing . You definitely do n't want this thing if you plan on using the tape that came with it to mount it . The screws are very short . Too short to be put into drywall even with anchors . And there are no drywall anchors with this thing . The screws would be suitable for wood only.There are two half way decent things about this item . . . . no , one quarter way decent things . One - The arms hold the towel roll with enough pressure to allow one-hand tearing of towels . But , the 'hinge ' of the arms are such flimsy thin plastic , I do n't know how long they will last before they break . Two - I 'm going to get a roll of 3/4 inch double-sided foam tape , and line the whole edge of the holder all the way around . That , and a 7 inch piece of duct tape across the middle should hold this thing in place . At least that 's the plan . There goes another $ 3 to 7 bucks , depending on what length roll of tape I can find .	-1
I like this real well until it just would not stay stuck onto the surface I selected , after three weeks , where I could not use a screw on type . I actually threw it away . : (	-1
This works wonderfully . It 's small , light weight , and sticks perfectly to the inside of my cabinet . Took all of 30 seconds to install and the adhesive is nice and strong.Update : About two months in , the adhesive gave out . I tried re-sticking it a hundred times and it 's just done . It 's now in the recycling bin waiting to get thrown out .	-1
Now there is absolutely nothing wrong with the quality of this product . It lives up to the Presto name . However , this pressure cooker is SMALL . Yes , its box says 6 quarts as advertised but when you take it out of the box it is much smaller than its competitors . More like the size of a 4 quart ! ! I thought I must be missing something here so I went to a major brick and mortar store to investigate . Believe it or not , both the store brand and Mirro brand 6 quart pressure cookers were DEFINITELY larger in size ( and by all means of a 6 quart capacity ) . Unfortunately , they didnt have a 4 quart in stock or on display so I really cant truly compare its size with what I got.I am truly left scratching my head . Nevertheless , I sent the pressure cooker back and will get the Mirro instead.This may all sound a bit crazy but I am right there with you . Just thought I post this comment in case someone else has a similar experience : )	-1
very dangerous item , no problems with this one , great for peanuts and such , but could be harmful if steam released	-1
some of the other reviewers say this item has a weighted gauge . It does not , and moreover it will not accept one ( I called Presto customer service ) .Dial gauges are not reliable , and must be regularly checked by your county 's cooperative extension office to assure they are safe to use . Most are not safe out of the box . This means you could have improper/unsafe processing of your pressure canned foods.It 's not worth risking botulism . I 'm returning this canner .	-1
I have replaced the decanter twice in the last year . It is definitely fragile as just slight bump will create a crack . I have had Cusinart coffee maker for five years and the decanter never broke . At the rate of replacement I can buy myself a new coffee machine .	-1
The glass is so thin , and the whole unit looks and is so fragile . I have to replace a decanter every few months ( I am on my fourth one now ) , because it would chip or crack so easily with the slightest bump . I am not a clumsy person and do my best to take care of it . If you want this decanter to never break , put it up on a display shelf and never use it !	-1
After ordering , found that I could have purchased them much cheaper at my local grocery store . Wo n't make that mistake ever again .	-1
The product is fine - holds up , no bleach , easy to take one from the box . The problem is the pricing . I ordered a batch and when walking through Safeway got them for $ 3 . With tax they are way cheaper than from Amazon . They also have a store brand which is less and I 've tried those and they are the same - probably same factory .	-1
I must have had a senior moment when I purchased this item as this and the plastic coffeemakers are now collecting dust in my basement . If I have a choice , I choose not to have BPA and Polymer in my food and beverages . I thought about the entire process of piping hot water running through a plastic basket then sitting in a plastic pitcher , for days . I purchased a stainless steel percolator and make tea the old fashioned way with boiling water and use a glass pitcher .	-1
This egg cooker has too many variables ... ..to get close to a perfect egg you have to take into consideration the size of the egg , how much water you put in the cooker , whether the water is warm or cold . Too much work for just eggs . Easier to put it in a pan on the stove .	-1
When I was thinking about buying an egg cooker , I read about how the Oster egg cooker had a design flaw of a plastic lid being placed on a hot metal heating plate . But , there was only one entry that said they had a problem with it . I had no problem with this egg cooker for months . In fact it was a delight to use -- the eggs came out good every time . However , just today when I used it , I came back to find that for no obvious reason , the plastic lid was melted on the heating plate . It was so bad , I was not able to pry the plastic lid off . I had to throw the whole unit -- cooked eggs and all in the trash . There was no warning from previous use that this was going to happen . So , if you buy this appliance , be prepared at some unsuspecting time in the future to come back and find the plastic lid melted securely onto the heating plate . There was no way to save it .	-1
We have had an egg cooker for 15 years and it was time to replace it.I looked for and found the Oster 4716 egg cooker here at Amazon but failed to read all the reviews . Big mistake ! Someone else had already found out the Teflon coating in the poaching tray was at best a joke , if not defective . I would say we poach eggs 90 % of the time and the Teflon coating is important , if you want an easy clean up . Oster had a good name and so I took it on trust they would make a good product.The cooking method for boiled eggs in their shells with this cooker is fine ; I think any cooker on the market should be able to do that . Hence it got 2 starsWe prefer to poach eggs and that is the big disappointment with this unit . The Teflon coating on the poaching tray feels and looks like mat black paint and not Teflon . It is even rough to the feel and that was the first tell . The eggs vulcanized to this coating and even after 5 minuets of hard scrubbing with very hot water and dish soap , a thin film of egg white was still stuck to the tray . Teflon in the normal sense of the word , this is not ! I hate to give a negative review and I do so in the hope I can save someone the disappointment I now feel.Just very disappointed with this purchase , it was supposed to be easy clean up but turned out to be just an advertising myth . Take my advice and buy someone else 's product and read all the reviews before you buy . This is one egg cooker you do not need.Update , We have had this Egg cooker for 2 year now and as long as you do n't mind greasing the poaching plate with butter before you put the eggs in it , it then works as it was possibly designed . The eggs will slid out without any effort and the clean up is easy . I had hoped not to have to go through this ritual before each cooking but it is the only way to remove the eggs from the cooker and not have then vulcanize to the cooking tray . Get the water amount right by using the marked levels in the base and it will make good poaches eggs , every time .	-1
I wanted to like this blender and for the first smoothie I made I did like its power and figured out how to not use the high speeds if I actually wanted to get the fruit to blend.Then on about my fifth use of this blender , I had some unrefrigerated fruit and added 3 ice cubes and about 1/2 cup of water to make a crushed ice slurry to cool down the room temp fruit for a smoothie . It did a great job smashing the cubes at high speed along with the water to make a nice cold crushed ice and water base . I then added some peach slices ( no not the pit ) and a peeled banana , yogurt and protein powder and a bit more water . It blended up beautifully and I poured it all into a tall glass to enjoy.As I was savoring the cold , thick , not too sweet smoothie , I felt something hard and sharp hit my tongue . I pulled it out and it looked like a small shard of glass . I continued and hit another piece . I threw the rest of the smoothie down the drain carefully and discovered another piece in the glass and another in the container . Those pieces went down the drain but I managed to save the first two for the photos above ( assuming it gets published ) . After washing out the container I found numerous chips in small vertical plastic vanes on the inside . My daughter had drunk a smoothie the day before but did not notice any chip , but based on the number of places where the vane had been chipped this had apparently happened before I discovered it.My advice would be to not even consider this blender . Get one with an all glass container with smooth insides . I must admit I did pick this up a that box store with the bullseye because I needed it quick and it was a few dollars cheaper . They took it back , but fellow consumers need to know about this and Oster has to get the message , build better stuff !	-1
These same Bunn filters sell for around $ 2.00 for a box of 100 in several stores . The idea of charging $ 15.98 for a single box and offering free shipping is ridiculous . The product itself is absolutely wonderful , no arguement there . But shame on Amazon for the extreme overpricing of this item . I 'm very surprised . I have no other complaints with them other than this . Maybe it 's a mistake , but I just talked to a customer rep who said the price was this high because of the free shipping.That 's just not right .	-1
This machine comes with a 1/2 cup measurer which serves as the butter melting dish too . If you use less then the full 1/2 cup measure , it throws out lots of unpopped corn . Even with the full 1/2 cup , it throws out a several unpops before it starts popping . The butter melt cup is nice , but the time it takes to pop the corn is not enough time to melt the butter ... I even sliced it down to smaller pieces . Also there is no on/off switch . You have to plug it in to turn it on and unplug it to turn it off - that just seems antiquated to me . I do not recommend this popcorn maker .	-1
The plastic top of this thing melted and deformed because I has it was on for about 3 total minutes to melt the butter in the top cup . Since then I still use it to pop popcorn but do n't bother with the butter on top . Sure , it can blow hot air and pop popcorn . But the construction is what you expect for the price . I did n't bother returning it because for $ 20 its not worth it to find a shipping box to fit it in . It 's much larger then it looks in the picture .	-1
I had a presto on the shelf and my husband wanted to replace it for him to use . This one is a cheerful color , but the yellow plastic smells very strong so I put it in a bag with baking soda . So far , it still smells . Since he wanted to try it out , I unscrewed the old black plastic unit on to the new , they are exactly the same so no problemsthere . But the popcorn is chewy and not crispy as I have learned to enjoy from the stove-top popper I'veused most recently . My husband is not as particular so he wants to keep this new air popper . I think it 's a waste ofspace.I 've really enjoyed the Back to Basics stainless steel popper so much more . The popcorn is crispy and tasty , evenwhen not using much oil . I put olive oil in a misto sprayer and add in hints of taste in any finished batch whereless oil was used . This gives flavor without many calories.This Presto item is lacking as it has the very smelly plastic part , probably not good to use around heat and the popcorncomes out chewy . We made a full batch , put one bowl aside for 20 minutes and came back to an even chewier popcorn than thefirst bowl . When using the Back to Basics one , I set a bowl aside for several hours and it was crispy then as it was when fresh.Get something better than this .	-1
I put in the kernels and the thing just blew them right out . To get it to actually pop corn , I had to hold it tilted backwards at a 45-degree angle . And I was still having to pick up hot , unpopped kernels and throw them back in . `` Fewer unpopped kernels , '' HA ! Somewhere in the instructions it says you ca n't use small kernels . Maybe this is how they get customers to buy the ( larger kernel ) Orville Redenbacher brand.The thing has no power switch - instead , you have to plug it/unplug it . That in itself is enough of a pain in the patootie to dump the thing.Do n't buy this annoyance .	-1
Imaging popping a fresh microwavable bag ... .this machine does not provide the freshness.We stopped using microwavable popcorn due to the chemicals in the bags and tried this . Wish we would have skipped . The popcorn tastes stale as it was left out over night uncovered.SKIP this one ... ... not sure if all hot air poppers make the popcorn taste this way however this one does . We did use fresh popcorn.Last thing , the popcorn flies EVERYWHERE and makes a mess on the floor and counter.Waste of $	-1
I pop a lot of air popped popcorn for my pigs so when on of my Prestos burned out after just a few months , I decided to try this Presto `` Orville Redenbacher '' one since it was more expensive , maybe it was a little bit better . I have n't even used it a month , but since I did n't open it and use it right away , I ca n't return it , but it 's burned out too . I may as well save $ 5 and get the Presto one if they are n't going to last . I had one that lasted 5 years of continual use and the last few do n't last for nothing . I guess I 'm going to buy even more and rotate them , hope one of them lasts cause I do n't see another brand to buy . Very sad .	-1
did n't pop corn ... .air corn is nasty -- no taste -- salt wo n't stick to it . Just hated it . Put it in a yard sale after trying it several times . Do n't waste your money . Get the PRESTO 04830 PowerPop Microwave Popcorn popper instead -- that one is dynamite !	-1
We purchased this popcorn popper this week and I am returning it . It throws terribly hot unpopped kernals out of the chute .I have small kids and one of the kernals burned me so I would not have them anywhere near this . The popcorn is absolutely tasteless . We used Redenbacher corn . I 'd much rather have popcorn less often and have some that is much better tasting than this . If you do use this , have a very deep bowl to put underneath the chute . A large baking bowl will not do it . It also will not melt cool/cold butter..it has to be soft to begin with . This was not a fun thing to do or use , especially with kids . I 'd never let them use this . It may be healthier popcorn when it is popped with hot air , but other than that ... ... ..	-1
This popper works fine but I was n't expecting to have to plug it and unplug it each time I used it . There is no on-off button , so be prepared to use a GCFI outlet for safety .	-1
So many good reviews , but I was disapointed with this popcorn air popper.I bought organic popcorn from Trader Joe 's which is a great popcorn.But in this popper it looked good , but went flat when we started eating the popcorn ! It was Chewy , full of air , and did not have that crisp bite taste like the movie popcorn , orthe other type of popper that cooks on the stove.Soooo Chewy it stuck to our teeth ! I returned this Poplite air corn popper.I 'm now thinking of buying the one that I would put on the stove , and turn the handle thatAmazon sells .	-1
this pops corn . the plastic parts are horribly fragile and cheaply made , but I did not see any alternative . it came in good delivery time . But it is already somewhat broken and I have to put a saucer on top of it to keep it from blowing popcorn all over the room .	-1
I asked for this popper for Christmas based on all the good reviews it got . I have tried more than one brand of fresh , brand new kernels in this machine while following the directions to a `` T '' . Every batch comes out chewy , not crunchy or fresh as it should . Even the bagged popcorn tastes less stale than popcorn freshly popped in this popper . I was looking for an alternative to microwave popcorn because of the reports lately that the bags release some kind of chemical into the popcorn and also that the microwave bags emit a chemical into the air when popping that can cause something called `` popcorn lung '' -- there is actually a lawsuit pending over this against Con Agra foods . Anyway , this popper did not end my search for a quality popcorn popper . I will stick to organic pre-popped popcorn you can find in the chip isle until I find one worth its salt ( and butter ) . A real shame . We 'll be selling this popper at a charity garage sale in a couple weeks .	-1
It pops the popcorn but it takes a while to heat up and pop . Biggest issue it while it is popping a number of the kernels shoot out around the counter . The opening is too wide . They need a better design .	-1
When the Secret Santa gift exchange came around , I spotted this beauty and fought for it . I proudly claimed my prize and took it home . I 've wanted a popcorn maker of my own ever since my childhood when my family would pop the corn ourselves.I purchased the standard kernels . The first time was fantastic ! The reservoir on top is a bit awkward and gross to clean , but that might just be a way to deter me from using butter.The second time ? Just okay . The kernels got stuck in a way that the popped popcorn would n't come out and everything in the chamber began to burn . I made sure to clean it out thoroughly after that time.The third time ? It began to overheat . Then it began to smell like a burned motor . Then it started to smoke.This product cost me nothing , but I only got to use it 1.5 good times before it left me with a 1lb bag of unpacked kernels . It 's a fun toy but this product was not reliable in its output nor was it high quality . In the future , I 'll buy another popper of better quality .	-1
I 'm great at making popcorn on the stovetop , but as lazy as the next guy sometimes and liked the idea of popcorn with no added calories from oil . So I bought this popper.Unfortunately , all the points brought up in the negative reviews are true.1 . The top is not stable on the unit2 . The popcorn tends to spray about . I have tried using a giant bowl under it , but it was round , and having a curve against the popper meant there were gaps for the popcorn to slip through . My square dishes worked better for those kernels but were otherwise too small and also let kernels fly out somewhere else . ( How many deep square dishes do you have ? Mine are all shallow ) Either way , too much popcorn in too many places besides the bowl.3 . Unpopped kernels are very common4 . I 'll add that the unit is pretty loud5 . I 'll add that getting a bowl full , since there are so many unpopped kernels , takes long enough to be frustrating and long enough that your first popped kernels go cold6 . This popper produces the most dry popcorn I have ever eaten . The moisture is blown right out of the corn after it pops . I 'm not sure how this can be fixed because it is simply a design flaw.All in all , a distinct and very distant third amongst the ways I 've made popcorn , falling far behind stovetop and microwave popper . ( I never use the bags , but have tasted that popcorn -- meh , I say . ) This popper , after a lot of experimentation , got shelved and eventually thrown out . I would n't recommend it .	-1
Why on earth is there no on/off switch on this thing ? You turn it on and off by pulling the ungrounded plug out of the outlet.In my case , it came with sparks and flames.I 'm throwing this thing out and using a pot with oil on the stovetop from now on . This product is poorly designed and actually dangerous to use ... I ca n't believe all the rave reviews , but maybe they just like to live dangerously .	-1
You have to plug and unplug this in order to turn it on and off . LAME . I do n't want to wear out my kitchen outlets just to make popcorn . Also , if you have a kitchen emergency , or someone knocks at the door , or the phone rings , or whatever , you ca n't turn it off quickly ; you have to wrestle with the plug , or leave it unattended . And if you 're not there to physically unplug it immediately after the popcorn is finished , it very quickly gets hot enough to melt the lid ( within 5 minutes ) . I seriously do n't like the fact that this popper has no emergency cut off . It 'll just sit there heating and heating until the lid melts or your house burns down . In this day and age , they should be able to put an overheating sensor in there , or at LEAST an on/off button . Will it pop popcorn ? Yes . Is it something I like having in my kitchen ? Not really .	-1
I thought I 'd get healthy and try the air popper . The first time I fixed popcorn in this I thought the popcorn was old because it was so hard and chewy . So I went and brought some new popcorn and it still turned out chewy and stale . Not too mention I could n't even get popcorn salt to stick to the popcorn . It was like eating cardboard but I think cardboard would have more flavor ! So I went back to popping my popcorn in a heavy stainless steel pan on top of the stove in a little peanut oil and some popcorn seasoning oil and some popcorn salt added to it . Yum ! Not that 's popcorn ! ! !	-1
I bought this as a way to make bacon easily . We usually use the broiler or buy the precooked microwave bacon . I thought this would make things faster . When cooked as instructed , the bacon came out with a rubbery texture . If I cooked it a little longer , it bur n't quickly , while other pieces on the device were still rubbery . We buy organic bacon without nitrates so I do n't know of that changes how it microwaves , but I wo n't use this device regularly .	-1
This product is a complete failure in my opinion . The bacon is very difficult to get off after cooking and it does not cook evenly . Went in the trash !	-1
This an awful device that is difficult to assemble for use , and very greasy to clean up . Not a good product in my evaluation . Threw it away after using it the first time .	-1
The racks are too short to lay a piece of bacon on without looping over other rack.Everything falls apart when you try to pour out the grease.Greasy no matter how many times you wash it , so too slick to put back together without dropping at least twice . Bought it thinking it would make my life easier.It does not . I have kept it 8 months trying to give it a fair shake , but I trashed it this morning .	-1
This unit bogs down when running the blade through the unit with moderate pressure . A stronger motor is needed period .	-1
This electric sharpener nearly ruined my good knives . I followed the directions very carefully and after trying several times to get a good edge on my knives , realized that it was actually harming the blades rather than sharpening them . I took it and the knives to a professional for sharpening . We found that it had blunted the edges because one of its grinding stones was misshapen and out of alignment and could not be fixed . Fortunately , my knives could be saved.This is a really cheap sharpening instrument and you do n't know if you 're going to get one that 's been properly constructed or not . My advice is that is you value your knives and want an electric sharpener , pay up and get a really good one , or do as I do . I am now back to having my knives professionally sharpened and keeping the edge with a ceramic 'steel ' in between . Since I did n't want a replacement , I tossed this one . Regained some cupboard space and learned my lesson .	-1
Based on some of the reviews , I expected it to perform much better than it did . I ran my knife through , as directed , but I know how that knife cuts when it is sharp , and it did n't cut that way . I ran it through two more times , following the instructions of three times on each side , and the knife still felt dull . I am disappointed , but at least my grocery store offers free knife sharpening , so I guess I 'll just take them there .	-1
I bought this product for my husband for Christmas . I know that the product already works well so I knew it was a good deal . It finally came in the mail today , a day late and when I opened up the Amazon box everything was in great condition but the box to this product . And when I mean dented it looked like someone threw it around and stomped on it . I am so disappointed in the quality I received for a present .	-1
burns up after one use only	-1
I would not recommend this blender , I used it once and it stopped working . The only plus is when I contacted the seller they immediately credited my account and were very professional and nice to do business with . They offered to send me another blender and when I declined they refunded my money with no hassles . No to the blender , Yes to the company as far as being nice to deal with .	-1
did not chop evenly	-1
My friend talked great about this thing but I was n't a big fan . If you are looking to make salsa or dips then this is good but I wanted to chop things like a tomato or cucumber and this destroys it , it does n't chop certain foods well .	-1
crap	-1
After many years my prior grinder became unusable . Compared to this grinder my earlier one was much superior . Shipping and carton packing was just fine . The device has no control for time , fineness of grind and holds barely enough for 3 cups of brewed coffee.I have difficulty in timing the necessary grind that is not really visible with the clear cap on . The cap is small and barely holds beans sufficient for 3 cups of coffee . I believe that two folks would not appreciate using this tiny grinder for 4 or more cups . Though my wife suggested that I just do a second or third , etc . grind for guests . Also once the beans are ground it is nearly impossible to avoid ground coffee falling on the kitchen counter - - this is getting irritating having to clean up all of this mess . The wind up cord is a nice idea but silly for such a tiny device that is easily knocked over when this very tight cord is pulled . For a single coffee drinker who knows grinds and is willing to accept complicated bean grinding and willing to clean up-post grind residue -- it could become bearable for those folks . On the positive side the color white is nice for our kitchen .	-1
Worked pretty well for spices . I do n't think there 's a grinder made that will do a 100 % great job of grinding . Loved the retractable cord and loved the priced . Did n't like that it died in 5 months . Would n't recommend	-1
had it for 2 months . Used it once a week . Be careful overfilling it . Last night it started to make a half-muted sound while vibrating a lot . the blade slowed down and it smelled of burning . Not just-bought wearing in burning , this was an overload , too many beans , I had enough I ca n't take it anymore , the hell with this coffee-grinder life , I 'm out ! burning smell . Garbage . I 'm eyeballing my Proctor coffeepot right now . PS is cheap stuff folks .	-1
First let me get this out of the way - I loved this coffee grinder . I used it for grinding flax seeds every morning and it worked just great , for six or seven months anyway . And I loved the way the cord wound up inside of the unit.But mine stopped working so I called Proctor Silex and talked with both a customer service rep and her supervisor.Here 's the Proctor Silex warranty -- if this unit breaks for any reason , you must cut off the plug , go to the post office , mail Proctor Silex the plug ( estimated cost $ 1.50 to $ 2.00 ) along with a check or money order for $ 7.99 , and Proctor Silex will send you a new unit by regular mail . So you 'll be without a unit for two to three weeks and out of pocket ~ $ 9.50 to $ 10.00.I 'm a business guy so let me translate this Proctor Silex `` warranty '' for you . It costs Proctor Silex ~ $ 7.99 in manufacturing , overhead , and support costs to make this unit and they will graciously replace it at their cost if it breaks and if , and only if , you are willing to jump thru their hoops - cut off the plug , package it , go to the post office , mail the plug at your own expense along with a check or money order , wait a couple of weeks for Proctor Silex to receive the plug and your check and send you a replacement unit - all of which , by the way , is designed to discourage you in every possible way from exercising the so called `` warranty . `` Let 's see - a new unit is $ 13.99 and Amazon will have it to you freight free in two days . And several competitors have comparable units at similar prices.Well duh.Good product or no ( do n't forget , my unit only lasted seven months ) , are you willing to do business with a company that treats its customers this way ? ( Note that Hamilton Beach and Proctor Silex are the same company . ) You can be sure I wo n't be exercising this Proctor Silex `` warranty '' or purchasing any Proctor Silex or Hamilton Beach products anytime soon.Instead I 'll be voting with my pocketbook for another manufacturer that respects its customers .	-1
Yep , my postal worker thought he could walk away after handing my damaged box . I told him , `` Dude , the Postal Inspector 's Office is just a few blocks away , so you had better turn around and watch me inspect for damage '' . I proceeded to open my Amazon box and inspect the contents . My Proctor Silex E160BY Fresh Grind Coffee Grinder box did have a slight crease , but did not rattle . I removed it from the box and plugged in the outlet next to my door , it worked just fine . Even the Postal Worker noticed the word `` Durable '' printed on the box and smiled.Pro : Cheap and gets the job done.Con : Small capacity , but I only use it with my Aerobie Aeropress Coffee/Espresso maker . Does n't seem to have a long lifeSince it is a bladed grinder you will not get a consistent grind , but if you use no more than four tablespoons you can get a better quality grind.3/19/14 Update and Big Con : A few seconds after starting to grind my morning coffee , the Proctor Silex E160BY Fresh Grind Coffee Grinder started grinding at half speed . I quickly got my multimeter out and checked my kitchen outlet . 110 and 60 hertz , no problems . I then emptied th coffee grinder and looked for an obstruction , none . I put the grinds back in and plugged in the grinder , no luck.It is still running at half speed . I checked this out on my computers emergency universal power supply since it always puts out clean electricity , still half speed.I went back to the kitchen and resumed grinding my coffee . It no longer grinds espresso grind . At best , you can call it percolator grind . It now gets warm and emits a smell of ozone . So I had to run out to my hardware a few blocks away and buy a coffee grinder there . Yep , Home Depot sells Black and Decker coffee grinders there.For the price I paid , I am not even going to file a claim since shipping this bad grinder back would cost more than I paid for the grinder.3/21/2014 Update : I took it apart and found two major issues . The first one is that the shaft for the grinder is not sealed and allowed finely ground coffee to cover the motor . The second was that there were only two brushes on the motor that only had plastic as a base . That allowed them to become misaligned when the coffee grounds came in contact . They were throwing so many sparks that I am surprised a smoldering fire did not start.Lesson learned : Buy a hand powered coffee mill , you can always use the extra exercise .	-1
It works . It grinds the coffee beans . Id have to say I cant get as fine a grind as I could with my old grinder this replaced.The retractable cord is a good idea for those that put it away after each use ... ... I dont ... ... and a compromise of the retractable cord is that is a very short cord which is a bit of an annoyance as to the reach from the outlet . My biggest complaint is that when the grounds find their way between the clear top and the body , the top cant be pushed back on until the grounds are cleaned away ... ... this is a major annoyance . My old grinder top twisted on and I never had this problem .	-1
Having one through all the reviews , I 'd discovered why I feel so many people have given this hot pot 5 star reviews . Most of then are years old , stemming from 2003 , etc . The reviews that are more recent are from people saying that they 've had their Rival pot for years.It appears that many of the design problems are in more recent models ( from the past few years ) - the rust , the plastic taste , the leaking ... .It is entirely possible that this Rival pot used to be of amazing quality and incredibly durable , but you know what they say ... Some things ai n't what they used to be .	-1
I have had a West Bend hot pot for many years which died recently . I bouthg anther of the same and it was just horrible . I then ordered this one , and I am very happy with it . I have used it about 10 times . It has adjustable temperature , but seems to be pretty hot no matter what . I use it only to make tea , it gets hot quickly , then cools down a bit but stays hot enough to keep my tea hot as long as I want to . It spills when pouring but I just do n't pour as quickly and it is fine . I also do n't want it to automatically shut off and this one does n't shut off until I tell it to . Bonus for me.UPDATE : Have had for a few months and I 'm not thrilled . Often boils over even on the lowest setting , and I ca n't pour out water without spilling . Does the job but makes a mess .	-1
i wanted an electric kettle , but landed up ordering this as i thought this was multi-functional and could be used to boil eggs etc as well . While it is muli-functional ; 2 biggest irritatiosn are : - it has to be plugged out - i can not just press a button for it to stop heating . I literally has to be plugged out . That reduces the functionality and safety of this product . bit of an irritation in a busy kitchen.- it leaks ... within one week of using it , I noticed it leaks water while boiling and also leaks if there is any water left in it ... Cleaning mess adds to the list instead of reducing it ...	-1
The metal heating `` plate '' or heating element as some would call it is surrounded by plastic , this entire unit is plastic except for the heating element . first of all , plastic + heat= chemicals leaching out into your boiled water which some studies indicate it can lead to cancer . Also the heating element rusts and will eventually melt the plastic it is surrounded by.I actually owned one of these so I can tell you first hand about the terrible quality.Pro 's : +low price+heats water very quicklyCon 's : -not BPA free-cheap quality-will rust-melts the plastic if it gets too hot . you must unplug it immediately ! -lasted only 3 months of daily use	-1
This thing only lasted a couple of months . I only ever used it with water and took awesome care of it . It was never submerged or anything . Only boiling water in it , I did n't even need to clean it . Well , it no longer heats up and now occupies my trashcan awaiting trash day . I guess you get what you pay for .	-1
The motor is n't strong enough to make a smoothie with crushed ice without lumps and chunks .	-1
As you can probably tell from the title , this can not open Costco sized cans . I bought this thinking that it was just like the little white Sunbeam I had for 20 years before it broke , but this is not as powerful . It will puncture the can but not even start to move , and then it will make cracking sounds as if something is breaking inside the machine . This is with the entire weight of the can supported by my hand and not the can opener . I do not think that anything was wrong with the cans such as denting or an uneven lid . I was able to open them with a manual can opener , and I have arthritic fingers . If I can do it , this opener should be able to as well . It even starts to bog down on regular Campbell soup cans . It is also a little hard to line up the cans correctly in order to start opening . You have to line it up `` just so '' , or it will not run.If you are like me and do a great deal of large-batch cooking and canning , this is not the opener for you . My search for a good can opener continues !	-1
The product description says : & # 34 ; the steam point & # 34 ; It should say 180 degrees fahrenheit.For pourover coffee you want 195-205.I 'm returning this.Two stars because i supect 180 is hot enough for several use cases , just not mine .	-1
This could have been done better : I 'm not supposed to plug it in unless it has water in it ready to be heated . When I plugged it in the first time , sure enough the light came on and so if I did n't have water in it , it would have been `` bad '' .I bought it for my office so I can pout a cup of water in it , heat it , and make tea.Well , when I took it to my office and plugged it in , it came on automatically again . So the manual warining you not to plug it in without having water in it seems valid.I 'm afraid to leave it plugged-in after it 's off ( what if power gets interrupted and it turns itself back on and burn the place down ? ) .So instead of simply putting water in , getting hot water out . I have to plug it in , put water , start it , get water out unplug it.Why , why could n't they put a hard switch on it ( so it wo n't turn on unless you want it to ) . I bought it to make life simpler , not to wake up in the middle of the night worrying if I unplugged it and if my workplace has burned down ... I would n't buy it again .	-1
I generally do n't like to say all bad things about a product , I prefer to give the good and bad to the best of my ability . I 've most likely received a defective product which can happen with anything . But the grinder I received never worked quite right to begin with . First , the switch did n't work but only part of the time , and then there was the day I plugged it in and had a fireball go off in my hand . `` No damage , but a stinging sensation . '' I realized that there were sparks going off everywhere including on the inside of the unit where the coffee was being ground , and so , I do n't consider this item any too safe and will be replacing it with a different unit .	-1
Smells like burning electronics , leaks oil or some other kind of goo out the bottom , VERY loud , and it is hard to clean ( to my standard of clean anyway )	-1
Got this as a gift . If I had paid for it ( or had a receipt ) , I would have returned it.It 'll make toast ... sometimes ... if you watch it closely . If you do n't ? Good luck ! ( The only reason I 'm giving it a 2 is because it did , for a little while , actually make toast ) Ours worked for a couple of months ( seemingly normal ) , and then slowly began to deteriorate . It was always finicky about the setting from the beginning . Turn it to one setting , and it barely got any toasting . A smidgen to the right , and it was burned.The real problems started when the two sides started making very different products . One would have to be cranked over to the right to toast properly , and the other barely set at all . Then , later , one side stopped spitting out the toast consistently . If you left it , the toast would stay down as long as you left it ( this is bad ) . Then , the cord started getting very hot at times , leading me to question the safety . If you have this toaster , please watch it closely . If you do n't have it ... avoid it.And in case you 're wondering , we cleaned the toaster regularly , and made sure nothing was near it . We 're still looking for another 4 slice toaster ( it will NOT be a Toastmaster ) , and hopefully wo n't have another experience like this .	-1
My Brita SpaceSaver Pitcher is a daily hassle . I drink and otherwise use a lot of water , and was pleased with a different Brita pitcher that I broke . The SpaceSaver does in fact save space , but after that , it is nothing but trouble.It leaks.The entire top falls off , and water spills.Water flows into the handle.The flap falls off.The inside area where I first pour water is quick to grow mold.In short , even though mine still works , I will be replacing it and throwing this onw out . I would not even give my current one away . It will be used by the recycling plant . Maybe they can turn the plastic into grocery bags.Shame on Brita for selling faulty kitchen equipment.Anthony Trendl [ ... ]	-1
I have been using Brita pitcher 's for years , this is the worst design . The lid will not stay on , you must pour very slowly or the water will all dump out . The spout too with the its flip up style , hate it ! Back when I bought this there were only two styles available , now as you see on Amazon , there are many to select from . It is nice how this one is slim/narrow . If you do order it , be sure to test out the lid well before keeping it .	-1
First off , I bought this pitcher at Target- not that it matters.Problem one , the spout is pretty terrible . I often find myself wiping up water that has spilled all over the place . It is similar to when you are pouring something out of a bowl or a coffee mug where it does n't flow where you want it to . the second issue I have is the handle . Some genius thought it 'd be a good idea to make the handle that is hollow and can get water in it . To make it worse , part of the handle is removable so again I find myself with a mess of water . Problem 3 , the filter has a habit of coming out of place making it so you 're just pouring tap water into your cup that has n't even been filtered . The first 3 are a pain , but if the water is still filtered then the job is done . The 3rd problem just makes this a pain in the a** . I see a `` 30 day guarantee '' on the box , but have no idea how to initiate it , and I imagine the cost of shipping would not make it worth while for the 20 bucks I spent on it only to have it replaced with another crappy filter . In the past I 've used brita water filter pitchers and I thoroughly enjoyed them , so I 'm puzzled as to why this one is so bad.Maybe they changed ownership , or something in the area of manufacturing changing making this crap pitcher ? I 'm scared to try buying a different model.I hope Amazon will remove this model due to the overflowing complaints .	-1
While this pitcher does exactly what it 's supposed to do , which is filter tap water , everything else about it is just plain bad . The lid will not stay on no matter what - and if you try to pour with the lid on , it will fall off , hit your glass , and slosh water all over you . It does n't snap on , it just kind of sits on top . For some reason we 've kept it for about a year ( after throwing the lid in the garbage ) and this morning the white top part cracked and a large chunk fell off . I like Brita ; the filters are reasonably priced and they make your water taste great , but this particular pitcher is junk .	-1
So I just purchased this on sale , and I was so happy because I thought I 'd gotten a deal . Turns out , they should give them away curbside for free . The top will NOT stay on ! At first I thought I was doing something wrong until I read the other reviews . Next time I 'll check the reviews BEFORE purchasing anything ! Boo for Brita .	-1
I sent it back . Not happy with it .	-1
First of all , I really loved my perculator in the beginning and still would , except it has developed rust only in the heating ring element in the bottom of the coffee maker . It 's not coffee stains it 's rust . Otherwise it heats it perfectly and makes great coffee no matter the brand.Since I do n't know what the long term effects of using it with rust , I opt for a different brand .	-1
This thing leaks where the plug goes into the base . Overall the coffee maker is built well but I experienced the leak that some other people here have reported . I would not buy again ...	-1
I really wanted to love this . So many good reviews , but it spews coffee grounds into the coffee ( alot ) and does n't get the coffee as hot as my old percolater . Looks like I am going to buy my old one again .	-1
We love our coffee strong , quite strong as a matter of fact and this coffeemaker could not do it . We filled the basket to the brim with coffee and it came out as strong tea . This did not work for us so back to drip we go .	-1
We 've had our Presto 2811 coffee maker for about a year . All this time , it made great coffee and it stayed hot all day . This week , the warming element failed.So I called around in an attempt to get this $ 5 part to repair it and ran into a dead end . Presto says they do n't sell internal parts due to liability issues . They also do n't seem to sell this part to any appliance repair center . So next time you ca n't perform a simple repair on your Presto Perc , thank a lawyer.It seems amazing to me that we can buy parts for the brakes on our cars , but ca n't replace a warming element on our coffee pot because it might be too dangerous.They did offer to repair it at their repair center under warranty . If I 'm willing to pay shipping and wait a month or two , I can have hot coffee again.Because I am resourceful and unwilling to give in to bad service tactics , I have found the Farberware Coffee Percolator Urn Replacement Flexible Heating Element P04-050 which I am adapting to fit . ( it can warm their 4 , 8 or 12 cup versions , it will work for this ) Seems like there are some companies that still sell simple repair parts . There might be a lesson there.My coffee is cold , I 'm steamed and Presto wants my wife and I to go through caffeine withdrawal . Thank you , Presto , for your customer no service . I 'm sure you 'd be happy to sell me a replacement throw away coffee pot as well , would n't you ? March 2013 ... The Farberware `` keep hot '' heating element is installed and has been keeping my coffee hot for about a week now.I cut the old one out and opened the strain relief of the crimp , clipped the screw ends off of the new one , wrapped it into place and crimped it under the strain relief of the old one . 5 minute install , no soldering or welding .	-1
Presto 02811 12-Cup Stainless Steel CoffeemakerI 've given up on automatic drip coffee makers because they simply do not make the coffee hot enough for me , nor is the coffee that good tasting.This Presto brand 12 cup percolator is a very nice looking appliance , however the quality leaves much to be desired . Unfortunately , these are made in China , like everything else these days . They certainly know how to cut corners to save money and make a profit , but big deal ! I found that the stem that holds the basket would not fit in place or stand up . I returned the unit for credit , which Amazon handled very promptly.I ended up being the winning bidder on a vintage , Regal brand Poly Perk electric percolator on EBAY , made in the USA ! - I feel this is a far superior product , even if it is used . The Regal makes great HOT coffee .	-1
I was discouraged about the flavor of my morning coffee from my drip coffee pot . After trying several different brands of coffee beans decided I 'd try an old fashioned coffee pot . Was disappointed - does n't keep it hot enough and ca n't taste any improvement in the coffee flavor .	-1
I was so hoping for the good old percolator coffee maker . I do n't know if its the coffee or the maker , but too much grounds in the coffee from overflows . Tried every kind of filter , basket and even the container on its own . Still just too messy and it is n't easy to clean up . The coffee does stay hot and taste fine but it will now only be a backup to a new drip coffee maker .	-1
I put the same amount of water and grounds in this percolator as I usually use my drip coffee maker . The result was weak and tasteless coffee that was more like tea . I think it stops percolating too soon . It is all stainless steel except for the black plastic parts . The basket and tube are stainless steel . It seems to be really well made . It just does n't perc long enough .	-1
I bought this salad shooter expecting to save a lot of time and space but it actually wastes more time if you are washing it by hand and Ill explain why this unit does not slice onions , bell peppers it can only do that with hard veggies like carrots and such you cant do tomatoes all these soft veggies come out watery and mashed up , another thing you cant do with this salad shooter is shred greens such as basil dill etc , so if you need to slice some carrots or something of that nature than that 's fine but if you gon na wash it by hand you will waste more time washing it then it would take if you would just slice it by hand . I would not recommend this product get a food processor instead same money more functional .	-1
I am so disappointed with the salad shooter . After reading the glowing reviews I decided to order it as I love eating vetetables , but hate cutting them . It was great cutting the carrots , but the celery got stuck even though I peeled it first . I tried red pepper and the shooter sliced a few pieces and then the red pepper kept spinning in the blade instead of being cut nicely into the salad bowl . It is even worse with an onion . I am returning it for a refund .	-1
I bought this to shred cabbage . It does an extremely poor job , turns cabbage to mush . Very disappointed . I would not recommend this product .	-1
I bought one of these to replace my dying Chip Shot ( older model Presto SaladShooter ) . However , this one is tiny by comparison , and wo n't even fit a regular-sized potato in without cutting it into pieces . Very under powered for my needs . Luckily we recently upgraded to a good food processor , so I can cut my potatoes and shred my cheese much more easily . Would definitely not buy again .	-1
The place where the food chamber clicks into the unit is very flimsy . Every time I try to use it , the chamber pops out & the motor quits until I push it back in . It is VERY noisy . It is bulky to handle & use . It almost takes 4 hands to use it . I shredded 2 carrots for salads and the chamber popped out 4X 's . I wish I would have gone with my first instincts and bought a food processor instead . There is also a lot of food waste inside the shredder cone . Flimsy plastic material . Not happy at all with it .	-1
The Presto Saladshooter works well and cleans easily . I 'm only giving it a `` 2 '' because you have to buy more attachments that should have come with it at that price . Also the low rating is deserved because it is made in China , and I 'm sick to death of almost everything being made in China . We desperately need jobs in America , but the manufacturers are too cheap to pay decent wages and benefits to Americans.As is , this machine only slices and shreds in one size each . It should have been designed to aim the foods straight into the bowl or pan without making you buy a separate attachment . Also , I prefer finer size shreds for most foods , and would have to buy the fine-shred attachment for that . I 've seen manual machines that produce more shapes and sizes at much lower costs . My arm wo n't fall off if I turn a crank or slide a lever to achieve the results I want - instead of wasting electricity .	-1
This timer lasted a few years . The magnet is relatively strong , but it is quite possible to hit it by accident and have it fall off your fridge . When it finally died the timer made a weezing sound rather than the perky beeps it used to do.It was a pain to reset the date etc when the battery needed to be replaced , but these are the things you must do to have this feature.I do think this should have lasted longer . If it lasted longer I would have given it more stars , escalating according to the number of years it lasted .	-1
I 'm very disappointed in this timer . Sometimes the buttons do n't work and have to be pressed real hard . After setting the time and pressing START , I have to look really closely to see if it has actually started . About half the time , it hasn't.The other really bad thing is the numbers on the display are so light they 're practically invisible . The bottom half of the numbers are sometimes easier to see than the top half , but even so I still ca n't see what the time is set for or how much time is left . It 's not a matter of a weak battery : I 've changed it . Sometimes -- sometimes -- turning the timer upside down and smacking it into my palm will make the numbers appear , but even then only briefly . This was done as a last resort , so I know it did n't cause the problem , which existed long before I resorted to smacking it.I can not recommend this . Pay more for a better one.UPDATE : 6/26New problem is now the timer just stops arbitrarily sometimes . I almost did n't notice it had stopped because of the problem trying to see the numbers , as I described above.Maybe I just got a bad unit : I see other buyers are happy with theirs . I still ca n't recommend it , because this is really a waste of money for me .	-1
This is difficult to use . I will admit I have n't read the instructions but I ca n't think of the last time I had to read instructions on an alarm clock or timer . It 's small which is nice but the magnet does n't stick that well to the fridge . Just okay .	-1
This timer is okay but I really would rather have just a simple , easy to operate timer . This is not easy to operate but I should have read reviews a little closer . My mistake !	-1
Although the Rival slicers work OK and are inexpensive in the short run , their plastic gears break frequently . When this happened to my first one , I made the mistake of replacing it with another Rival slicer . Even though not frequently used , and only to slice soft lunch meat , the replacement Rival 's gears broke shortly after the unit was out of warranty . I am replacing it with an EdgeCraft 610 slicer , which does not cost that much more but has great reviews .	-1
With a big house and lots of little kids , I depend on some trusty and reliable space heaters in a few rooms to get us through a few months we experience winter in Austin . I own a few heaters from DeLonghi , which we 've owned forever and love . These Holmes heaters were cheap and small and well rated , so I bought two of them ( in addition to some others ) this year . First I 'll say that 1 of the 2 does n't work at all . The red power light is on , but when you push any buttons , you can hear the fan/motor start up for about 1-2 seconds and it shuts itself off . There is simply something wrong , mechanically with the product , and I will have to return it . We have a chaotic household and i 'm a little peeved I 've got to go out of my way to box this , ship it and pay to return it to warranty - only to receive a refurbished one to replace it . It does n't seem worth it for $ 20 . That one , i 'm hoping was a fluke and not a common problem ( ? ) We have n't had that issue with the other one and it works *okay* but it is n't something I 'd recommend and if I had it to do over , I definately would n't purchase it . All of our heaters are small in size , but this does n't have much get-up-and-go to it . I think it puts out very little air and it does n't get terribly warm . I guess its just really wimpy . I was n't expecting something supurb for $ 20 , but we find we do n't even bother to pull it out.Additionally , the design is such , that it is much easier for things ( fingers and other foreign objects 2-6 year olds dream up to stick places ) to stick right through and into the fan blades . Again , my expectations are not extraordinary . Small children should n't really be near *anything* with a fan/motor/heating element ( not to mention foreign objects ; ) ) but our other heaters are designed much better , such that JUST in CASE a pencil or cat tail were to be inserted between the plastic shield over the fan makes it VERY challenging to hurt anything . In fact they 've either long-since given up or just never bothered . ( i do n't think i 'm allowed to mention the one we LOOVVE ) This would certainly work for someone that had small , simple needs for a very small space and noone in the household that would be inclined to put things places they do n't belong.Again , the other one never working , i 'm sure is a manuf/warranty issue . Just another problem I did n't need ; (	-1
This product works just fine , but has broken and my husband has repair it at least 10 times . The middle brush , essential for picking up the bits on the carpet , falls out constantly , and I am not rough with it . Maybe I simply got a dud , but I would n't purchase this again .	-1
I bought this really hoping it would work , but it 's horrible . it just drags stuff around and pushes it but does n't pick it up . It seems to work fine on my rug , but on hardwood ... . no . It would be great if we had all carpet but a total waste since we only have 1 area rug . Waste of $ $ !	-1
These are not good quality bags . The cardboard part comes apart from the bag when both attempting to attach the bag to the vacuum cleaner and/or removing it.Some of the reviewers have stated that these bags were hard to find . I had some older Dirt Devil bags that looked similar . I used those , and they worked perfectly . I do n't think it 's imperative that one uses these bags with the Bissell . You just need to get the bags that are shaped similarly . The Dirt Devil bags are constructed better and were easier to find .	-1
I purchased these belts for my Bissell Cyclone vacuum because I could n't find anything in any local stores . Really frustrating especially since they break so quickly . I got to use the first one a whole 3 times before it broke . Good thing they come in a package of 2 so I had a spare . If the 2nd one breaks that quickly , I 'll be buying belts every week . And , since I ca n't find them in any local stores , and Amazon does n't sell them as an individual item..you have to group them with something else..so they 're harder to get , I 'll be up creek without a paddle very soon again .	-1
I had to send back because the bed was to noisy . Kept waking up my grandson . They should have put the soft stuff on the top . I have a queen size air bed and it works great . I wanted the smaller one for overnights with just him and did not work .	-1
This waffle maker looks good and works fair at making waffles , but has many problems . The temperature and timing numbers wear off in just a couple of months . The plastic parts broke and separated also in a couple months and had to be super glued back on . The only redeeming qualities are it makes fair waffles if you remember where to put the temperature dial . I am dissapointed that a high class company like Cuisinart makes such a poor quality product . I can not recommend this waffle maker	-1
We purchased this on Jan 29 , 2014 . Now less than 5 months later the teflon coating is coming off in our baked waffles . We use it every day and care for it per Cuisinart 's instructions . I 'm nursing a 3 month old baby , and I ca n't be eating teflon unknowlingly . No one should be ! I 'm going to try and post pictures . In addition to the obvious product flaw , this waffle maker gets extremely hot steam ( burn worthy ) that pours forth from where the handle attaches between the iron plates . The iron plates get hotter in the middle and so the waffles do n't cook evenly . They get darker in the middle and the edges are still soft . But my major complaint is the peeling teflon .	-1
This machine does n't get hot enough to create truly crisp waffles . Using an infrared thermometer , I read the surface temperature to be only about 400 degrees Fahrenheit on the highest setting . My 20 year old Toastmaster reaches almost 600 degrees when I select `` dark '' . These waffles come out much crisper and darker than those from the Cuisinart .	-1
Donated this piece of junk to the thrift store after cleaning it thoroughly , which took too long given how much anti-stick spray I unloaded on the thing before adding the waffle batter . I read the manual carefully , followed the instructions , added the batter , and lost too much of my waffle to the & # 34 ; non-stick & # 34 ; surface of the plates . Read my review of the Calphalon No-Peek Waffle Iron . It 's worth paying the extra money to get something functional and hassle-free . Do n't buy this product .	-1
This is , hands down , the most frustrating product I 've ever owned in my life . When it first arrived , I was a little put off by the looseness of the hinge in the back because it wobbles every time you move the lid . I actually almost returned it , but after seeing another reviewer said the same thing , I figured they were probably all like that . The first couple uses , were fine . I have n't used it much at all in the last month and a half that I 've owned it . But , after the initial couple uses , every single waffle I 've made has stuck . To the point where all my waffles split in half and I have to dig them out . And yes , I do put oil in my waffle batter . The description says it is NON STICK , I should n't have to put cooking oil . I am furious with this product , which is now ruined and I have to throw it away now because it is beyond the point of being cleaned and uses . Essentially , I there $ 40 down the drain and my kids , who love waffles , are going to be devastated .	-1
I guess a & # 34 ; respected & # 34 ; company like Cuisinart may be on its last legs when they start selling products this cheaply made . Wow . Everything about this waffle maker screams cheap -- flimsy controls , a hinge that does n't even keep the upper & lower halves aligned , etc . Also , you MUST spray the surfaces with cooking spray or your waffles WILL stick to this & # 34 ; non-stick & # 34 ; waffle iron . I do not recommend this product . This is just the kind of product that causes American brands to go out of business due to poor quality .	-1
I was very hopeful that this waffle iron would make old fashioned waffles , but the texture is too soggy , more like a pancake with waffle indentations . I used it about ten times with three different recipes . Waffles turned out limp and soggy , no matter the recipe or the number setting I 've made them on . The number slider is loose and the whole thing feels just flimsy and junky . The plastic seems very cheap , low-quality . Like an appliance you 'd find at Big Lots or something with a brand name you 've never heard of before . Then it dropped off of a low shelf ( about 7-inch drop ) onto linoleum and broke beyond repair . This is n't like other Cuisinart products I 've owned . I 'm not impressed at all . Definitely not worth $ 30 . Into the trash it goes .	-1
I like light waffles , so when researching waffle irons I knew I would need one with an adjustable thermostat . I tried this model and was disappointed when there was little differentiation between the first couple of settings and even the lowest produced a waffle that was too dark for my taste . I thought that perhaps it was just my particular waffle iron , so I exchanged it for the same model and ended up with the same result . I returned it and I ended up purchasing the more expensive VillaWare Classic Round Waffle Maker from Williams-Sonoma . It works perfectly .	-1
Even though I had read some of the other bad reviews , I figured I could make this waffle maker work for me . The price was right . Well , I was wrong . Waffles stick to the surface and it does not heat evenly . I returned it and will not try to go `` cheap '' on my next waffle maker . What a disappointment from Cuisinart - makes me not want to purchase their other products .	-1
Well , you get what you pay for.. I sent this back after unpacking it . It just seemed flimsy to me .	-1
Do n't buy this vacuum cleaner ! It 's impossible to find replacement bags for it -- I 've tried everywhere . Even the online Panasonic store does n't sell them . Plus it does n't come with a dust-brush attachment .	-1
First I receive the item without the accessories , so I ca n't put it together . Wrote to Vanns , got no reply . Requested a return though Amazon ... Amazon replies , but Vanns does not.Ok ... so I write to Sanus ... I got a reply and they shipped out the parts . Still took the better part of a week to get the accessories.Put the unit together . Oops . the long pieces that connect the base to the top platform are split while inserting the long screws . Either the screws supplied are too long or they are too fat . While the synthetic material that these stands are made of does look nice , it is obviously not able to withstand the screws that are supplied with these stands.The spikes wo n't fit easily within the holes at the underside of the bases.Sadly , this is just a poorly implemented product .	-1
These are almost the perfect size for the Pioneer SP-BS22-LR surround speakers I have . Too bad they used such poor materials in the manufacturing process . They are not even a dense wood composite , but rather that lightly compressed cardboard stuff . The are & # 34 ; FRAGILE & # 34 ; .I think the main reason so many people are splitting when screwing together is that the stuff is so soft you can easily miss the pilot holes . I managed to get mine together ok without splitting as I noticed this issue in time . I did have to force the uprights into position as they were n't parallel after mounting to the base . I am surprised that did n't cause them to split . I ca n't image they are going to hold up over time with speaker vibrations.Bottom line : Cheap is just nowhere near a strong enough word to describe these . Perhaps crap is more appropriate . I would advise spending twice the money on something four times better . I am keeping these , but will probably run by the lumber yard and get a 1x4 to make new uprights .	-1
I bought this speaker stand for price and ( assumed ) strength . There was no mention in the advertising about the supported speaker weight . However , on the box it states only 20 pounds for a speaker . My main speakers were measured to my ear level and they needed about 23 inches of elevation . The main speakers are fairly large and heavy . I can not imagine very many uses for this stand for a bookshelf speaker due to the minimal height.The finish is just a low sheen black paint on mdf . Do not expect furniture grade finish.While the price is good be aware that they will deduct about half the price for their shipping the product to you and then you get to pay for the return shipping . This makes the shipping costs more than the product cost so , essentially you do not have a viable return policy !	-1
I own over a dozen Lodge Cast item pieces that I 've happily used for many years and recently purchased this one to add to my collection . Immediately , I noticed this pan seemed thinner and `` cheaper '' made , than in the past . On the first use before heating , I noticed the pan bottom was warped upward in the center allowing oil and food to run to the edge . After 3-4 uses , I noticed the bottom center seemed to be deteriorating . After 5 uses , I noticed what seems to be a crack forming . Now it will be thrown away . I 've NEVER had a problem with Lodge cast iron until now . Very disappointed !	-1
The 3.5 inch seems to be the top diameter rather than the bottom diameter . It 's an amusing novelty , and I 've toasted spices in it , but apart from gratuitous cuteness , or maybe creative serving ideas , there 's no reason to bother with a skillet this small .	-1
We wanted to move away from the nonstick skillets and their potential detrimental long term effects . We had heard that the treated surface may have harmful substances.Well anyway . We decided to got for an iron skillet like grandma used to use . Yes we read the details on how to keep it properly seasoned . And how to reseason . How to slowly heat . How to clean.I just have to admit I just ca n't get the hang of using this thing . Eggs and pancakes stick to it 's grainy surface . They say not to scrub it but tiny foodstuff particles get struck in the sandy surface areas . Whe you fry anything breaded , the breading sticks to the sandy surface ( no matter how much butter you use ) . And when I do give it a good scrubbing cause I ca n't stand the idea of cooking while there 's old food bits still imbedded in the cooking surface , then I must reseason it.Ok Ok bacon should be a safe bet . Right ? Whoa ... ... it stuck to that like flypaper . Ok Ok keep it dry so it does n't rust ... .Yea right . It does n't look rusted until you look at it with a magnifying glass in direct sunlight . It has a Martian landscape of micro-rust.I must admit we gave it a wholehearted attempt and really wanted to transition to iron , but it did n't work out at all .	-1
This is a big heavy skillet . Great size.I seasoned this Castiron skillet 4 times , at 400 degrees , for a hour each time.I still was not happy with it.Two times with bacon grease . Two times with organic Coconut oil.I guess I was expecting it to be like my old Griswold castiron.To me , it will never be like the old skillets.I saut & eacute ; ed/fried sliced potatoes with coconut oil , and they stucked . I tried a egg , which wasa big mistake also.I find this pan very heavy compared to my old Castiron pans . Although with thehelper handle it did help . It is also a thicker castiron then the old skillets , which are not as heavy.Maybe I did something wrong , but the pan said it was pre-seasoned , and I seasoned it.The in side is very lumpy , and I could not get it smooth.. I did NOT wash it with soap.I really did not like this pan , and sent it back .	-1
I could not get this pan to stop from rusting & # 8230 ; I actually bought two of these and had the same problem till I call it quits .	-1
Do n't make the mistake i made and buy this cheap cast iron skillet . The pan does n't heat consistently , the surface is uneven ( meaning vegetable oil will go to one side , and everything sticks to it . And to top that off it creates a hot spot right in the middle and the edges of the pan are cold . You need to basically fill the pan up with enough oil so your frying your food . I bought this pan because it was rated pretty good , but trust me this pan is garbage .	-1
I own a well seasoned steel Wok , 2 cast iron griddles and one small # 3 Wagner cast iron skillet . I do not have to pamper these treasures . Just some coarse kosher salt and cold or hot water removes any oils or sticky sauces.The box that contained the Lodge skillet felt light . The factory packed inner box had a label that said 12 . '' However , when I opened it my concern was realized . There was a 10 '' pan inside . The replacement came quickly and I am supposed to get a credit for my shipping costs.I augmented the alleged `` pre-seasoned '' lodge skillet in the manner I was shown by a chef who was trained by the renowned French chef Escoffier . The technique is simple . Moderate heat and Crisco solid shortening applied with bunched wax paper . The wax may even abet the Crisco but the reason it is used is that no cellulose fibers will be incorporated into the shortening patina . Using a paper napkin or towel or cotton cloth will place fibers in the patina and they will create a place for food to adhere to.A teaspoon of Canola ( Rapeseed ) oil was put in the hot pan and then an egg followed . The egg stuck better than Crazy Glue and this did not surprise me , as I was suspicious of the pan when I saw it had a surface that looked like it had actually been cast in sand ( which is still a way to cast iron . ) My old , above mentioned , treasures all have surfaces as smooth as a baby 's bottom . They are a joy to work with . This pan is a joke . After the abyssmal performance I felt I had nothing to loose by messing with the surface so I tried to smooth out the pebbled ( sand cast ) surface but gave it up as I lack the proper materials to do so.Nonetheless , I think I may have abraded the so-called pre-seasoned surface enough to lay down my own patina that may smooth out with constant use . Otherwise , I will just use the skillet for frying things other than eggs or pancakes , etc . I saw a similar pan in large chain retailer for less money.A few days after posting my 1 star review I scrubbed the surface and seasoned the pan in a manner similar to that used by an earlier poster . I added Crisco and put in a hot oven . My wife got hot under her collar when the house was full of oily fumes.So I did not cure it for the full 40 minutes.I put the pan in my outdoors gas barbeque grill upside down and closed the cover . A hard patina formed . After a few times of gently warming on the gas stove using a diffuser I gave it a whirl with another egg . This time the pan was not very hot . After flipping the egg over on its yoke I was able to to slide it around like a hockey puck on ice . I had spread almost 1 teaspoon of Canola oil followed by a pat of butter.I am now a happy camper . I recommend this pan even though the cooking surface is not evenly flat and mine had a crease in it as well.I purchased my first Teflon pan in 1970 and it performed awesomely for almost 10 years . This was inexpensive and you could fry an egg without any oil . I gave it up after a good deal of the coating had peeled away . I have never seen a coated pan that performed as well as the first one I purchased . I am sure that companies stopped using that specific very smooth coating by 1980 . I just tossed a coated Calphalon skillet that started to stick after 3 years of careful use . My wife would not let me use anything but a special plastic spatula or wooden spoon so it was not abused.Ken BatesBoston	-1
After 3 months of light use , some kind of flaw in the bottom of the pan exploded while it was on an electric burner . The little explosion blew an eighth-inch deep divot out of the bottom of the pan , which was powerful enough to also damage the electric heating element.If it had happened in the top surface of the pan instead of the bottom , the user could have been seriously harmed.I have several Lodge pans that are 30 or more years old , and this is the first time I have ever experienced this.Has Lodge reduced its quality control lately ? I will not replace the damaged pan with another Lodge product . I am going to eBay to buy an antique for 3 times the price.I guess the only way I can get quality now is from the past .	-1
I have read a number of positive reviews and decided to buy this pan ( the first cast-iron pan i my life ) . Unfortunately , I was not lucky with my purchase . Even with a good care of the pan ( I followed the instructions of care ) , it got rust after being used for a week . I have never used soap or a dishwasher ! It is really hard to clean because food stick to it .	-1
I ordered this item from Amazon.com in the expectation that it would arrive promptly and in good shape . It did come as quickly as I could have hoped but it was shoddily packed and the shipping container , flimsy cardboard , had obviously endured great abuse somewhere on its journey . When I opened the box I found that the skillet was loosely padded with two small wads of what looked like butcher-shop paper and the small handle had broken off the skillet in transit ( I suppose ) . Since this is quite a heavy item , weighing about thirteen pounds , it needs two hands to lift it on and off the stove : without the small handle , that was impossible.I had no choice but to return it , both pieces , with regret . I remonstrated with Amazon about their poor packaging and was simply told that they were grateful for my feedback . My two star rating is not about the skillet , which I never used , but about Amazon 's inferior shipping container that could not protect even a piece of cast iron from terminal damage.Lodge Logic L14SK3 15-Inch Pre-Seasoned Cast-Iron Skillet	-1
This is a great skillet , especially for the price . It is not too heavy and it is a nice size for a single person or couple , but probably not ideal for a larger family . I seasoned the skillet a couple times myself with olive oil at 500 F for an hour and have had great performance so far . It is my first cast iron pan , so I did my research ... DO NOT USE SOAP ! Only hot water and maybe salt if you need an abrasive . After using it , I think everyone should have a good old handy cast iron skillet in their kitchen.***UPDATE***So ... a couple years later and this skillet has not held up . The fake `` seasoning '' is peeling and weird and is now unsuitable for cooking . Maybe I can scrap it all off and re-season the cast iron . Unfortunate , since it was a good price . Changed the rating from 5 to 2 stars .	-1
I bought this hoping to get it well seasoned so that I could use it without non stick spray or oil . Even after using it repeatedly , it never got seasoned enough , and it also started to develop rust spots . Maybe I was doing something wrong with the care , but I was disappointed , and I ended up giving it away .	-1
I love the idea of cast iron skillets , especially when I see them used in cookbooks , but maybe it 's because I 'm not Southern , but I ca n't seem to maintain a cast iron skillet , pre-seasoned or not . You have to keep it oiled often and even the tiniest drop of water will cause rust . Once something rusts , I get way too nervous to even consider using it . If you are up for the challenge of maintaining , I think it looks very nice and heats well , especially on a bbq or gas flame .	-1
I got this because I need more iron , and I eat a lot of eggs . I found the surface too rough to cook eggs and get them out of the pan . You would have to float them on butter or oil to get them out of this pan . Back to my non stick pan ... I would take it camping , if I ever went camping .	-1
It tastes great - but the top three ingredients listed on the product label are water , glucose syrup , and propylene glycol . The last four are vanilla extract , alcohol , artificial flavors , and caramel color . I will toss this out and buy a more natural product .	-1
I have wanted one of these forever and made a gift of this to myself . Imagine my surprise when it arrived rusted ! The box was in excellent shape so I 'm ot sure how it happened . It 's not a small place , but half of the side . As this is n't my first time with cast iron ( I 've owned 4 other skillets for 20 + years ) I 'll keep it as I know I can fix it . Point is I should n't have to . Beware of this possibility before you buy .	-1
What a waste . I have used this pot 3 times before I realized it was flaking in my food . I contacted the seller and I had no response . Then when I left a bad review of the item , only then did I get a email . Quite quickly . Now I have tried e-mailing them and I still got nothing . I even checked my spam after they blamed it on me for not checking there . Do n't waste your money .	-1
But ... the instructions are difficult to follow and for a timer it 's counter intuitive . I also had mine for 24 hours and the little plastic tabs that hold the cover on broke off leaving me with what looks like a broken calculator . No one from the company returned my emails , so I guess it goes in the drawer with the junk .	-1
As a `` multi-national '' often attempting to follow a recipe in different lands with different measures , I thought this would help.Calculated Industries KitchenCalc 8300 Recipe Calculator with Digital Timer . Unfortunately , it is FAR too complicated to revise an entire recipe and after using it just a few times , the display conked out . It was n't batteries as I was forced to purchase a new set to check . The cost to repair it ( it was just out of warranty ) exceeded the cost of a new one ! Be careful before you spend for this .	-1

I went through three of these in 6 months . Very unhappy with this product . Just a short amount of heat and they fail . Do not leave in meat in an oven or BBQ . They fail miserably , EVERY time . Zero stars . Taylor probe link here : [ ... ]	-1
After some years of satisfactory use the probe with my Polder thermometer/timer would occasionally not read the temperature so I purchased a replacement . Using it to caramelise sugar I found a deep color when the thermometer read only 260F . Switching quickly to the old probe it read 350F ! ! - about what I expected from the color.Had I been using this probe to heat oil I would not have a color change to warn me and I believe it would have reached the flash point and caught fire before it registered a typical frying temperature.DO NOT USE a replacement probe before you have at least checked its reading in boiling water when it should read 212F . This replacement probe was deceptive because it read fairly accurately at room temperature but in boiling water it read only 179F - already 33F low .	-1
These probe thermometers are a great idea and we all want them to work but the fact is they really dont . I have a four year old Polder that has failed after about eight uses ( Thanksgiving turkey and Christmas Eve prime rib ) . Because of the poor reliability ratings I have babied it all its life by storing it in a remote cupboard in a Crown Royal bag . These low liftimes are really unaceptable and we should protest by not buying them . I suggest everyone go back to a good instant read thermometer and send the manufacturers a message they can undersand.Dan	-1
This works with one of the polder models listed but does not work with a different Polder that I have . Also does not work accurately with thermoworks or one of my Taylors . Reads several degrees off with those units and I know the base units work accurately with the right probes from the manufacturers . Also , I got two of these . One works great with my polder and is STILL WORKING months later . The other one stopped working during the first use and I 'm pretty careful . I realize they can be damaged by heat . I would give this probe 4 stars but I think it is not described correctly and it was recommended for use with other thermometers , which is a crap shoot .	-1
Thanks to all who wrote about it being unreliable & breaking fairly quickly . We almost ordered this remembering that we had one a long time ago - FORGETTING that we did not have it long . Appreciate it & do n't buy this one !	-1
This electronic device has some very nice features such as a probe which keeps tabs on the oven temperature as well as the internal temperature of the roast . However , it has one major flaw : the alarm is very weak . You might not hear it even in the kitchen if there is much background noise , and you almost certainly will not hear it in another room .	-1
Though it worked well on a few occasions , it stopped giving correct readings after just a matter of months . I was n't sure I needed to spend $ 50 or so on a probe thermometer , but apparently I was wrong , because this $ 30 `` deal '' definitely turned out to be a dud . There 's a newer Polder model that has received excellent reviews and seems to be a much better buy .	-1
I found this product to be much cheaper in quality than I expected for the high price . It was n't terrible , but I thought I was getting a 'high end ' product , and it was n't even as strong as a basic Rubbermaid dish drainer sold everywhere for MUCH less . And the more you `` expand '' it in a bigger sink , the weaker it gets.It was way too shallow - it would hold hardly any dishes at all , and full-size dinner plates would flop over in it ! ( I suppose it would be OK with Corelle or plastic plates . ) Also , since it 's not very deep , your kitchen faucet wo n't be able to clear it when there are any dishes in it . I returned it.My recommendation ? Keep looking . : - )	-1
If you strain beans or seeds they tend to get stuck underneath the rim when you try and dump them out . I ended up getting rid of it for an easier to maintain strainer .	-1
I bought this a long time ago . I do n't remember what the problem with it was , but I either threw it out or sent it back . However , I have bought the black version of this and gave it 5 stars . I have since increased my morning coffee to 3 cups and use a Black and Decker 5 cup brewer with a timer function that starts brewing while you are in bed.I have decided to add the following to all my reviews : Beware ! Some & # 34 ; reviewers & # 34 ; will trash a product for no reason simply because they are paid to do so or because they sell competitive products . Other & # 34 ; reviewers & # 34 ; will give products - that they have never seen and never used - glowing 5 star ratings - for a fee . Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb . And the biggest of companies have been fined for hiring an army of & # 8220 ; reviewers & # 8221 ; to review their products .	-1
I am extremely disappointed in performance of this water filter considering previous reviews.The filter lasts for just about 10 days . After a week the water pressure coming out of the filter is so low that it takes +2hrs to fill a 1/2th Gallon pitcher .	-1
We have normal water flow or pressure and this cartridge Restricts the flow so that it takes for ever to fill a glass with water . Returned it . I might add if you tighten this unit too tightly it leaks .	-1
I was researching water purifiers and was most interested in the Culligan , until I noticed that the filter is made of polypropylene , which is itself a suspected health hazard ( liver and respiratory ) . I would recommend reading more from the Environmental Working Group or other scientific literature readily found online before purchasing something that may pose its own risks while protecting from other contaminants . I do n't know if there are safer alternatives ( still looking ) , and maybe this is the same for other brands , but thought this is worth mentioning .	-1
We have tried everything to keep this from leaking . Nothing works . We are going back to our old brand of faucet filter . I expected more from a product from Culligan . Would not recommend this .	-1
I want to preface this review by letting the read know that I have not purchased this product , however I have recently become educated in water filtration and have an opinion you may find valuable when considering your families health.This filter , which is probably a great filter for certain intentions , may not filter all VOC 's ( volatile organic carbon contaminates ) . I 'm basing this assumption on the design of the filtration system in comparison to that of slightly higher grade systems . Most importantly tho , you 're not going to get any fluorine filtration out of it , which may cause some irreversible deterioration of health in some constant consumers . Not enough bottled water products , basic filtration products and under the sink products are providing distilled , fluorine free products , or , at the very least are providing customers with a full palette of water filtration knowledge for the health of their families . The best water purification method for kitchen use is , more often than not , a home distiller . There are other filtration methods that will eliminate fluoride , such as counter top methods ( easily found here on amazon ) , which may work just fine , but personally I would go with a distiller . You can find some reasonably priced distillers ( 100-200 dollars ) , and some with payment plans , all over the internet . Take a gander at h2olabs.com , or stay in the neighborhood and browse amazon.. whatever suits you best . Please though , utilize the internet and gather information on fluoride and its affects on health . You do n't need it in any of your products . It 's okay to rid your home of consumer co-dependency and begin making products and home , without fluoride or a middle man adding contaminants that may be harmful to your family . To reform your home into a more self sufficient , clean and eco friendly atmosphere , do your research . All it takes is 3 or 4 massive buys that will pay for themselves quicker than you can blink your eye , and will last for years on end with the exception of minor filter replacements here and there . My goal is to help the world feel less threatened by self sufficiency through product education , which I know you will find to be a very liberating feeling : ) .. Try getting a distiller , and from there google information on products that are predominantly sold with fluoride and learn how to make them naturally at home .	-1
Worked well for abour a year and quit . This model is not recommended because of price and length of useful life . Bought a more powerfull hand blender Cuisinart with several attachments that is very powerful and works great .	-1
I read the reviews and took a chance . I only used it twice and it no longer works . It shut off during the first use and would not come back on no matter what I tried but the power light was still on . Then after letting it cool and tipped upside down to see where it was made ( Puerto Rico ? ) , it began working again . I took a shower and when I got out , it was off again . This time the power LED light was off . Now the unit will not even power on at all.Next , the manual did not match the dials on the unit . I had to turn the dial to the `` fan '' mode to get it to blow harder and blow hot air . I think this unit was assembled very poorly.Last , it really did not heat up my bathroom like I thought . I could only feel it if I was a few feet in front but if I walked more than that away , I was immediately cold again.So disappointed and just threw away 15 bucks . I 'm not even going to waste my time with the company over that amount . Lesson learned . Do n't buy that cheap and I would stay away from this brand .	-1
I do not recommend this heater . It is quiet , but that reflects a weak fan resulting in poor airflow . The user manual is full of errors . For example , it states that the left knob has 4 settings ; fan , 2 , 1 and zero . In reality , it has 3 settings ; 2 , 1 and a little `` dot '' . User manual says that you turn the left knob to zero to turn off the heater . But there is no zero on the knob -- and you CAN NOT turn power off without unplugging the heater ( or switching off current to the socket , if it 's a switch-controlled socket ) . Pretty annoying to have to crawl around behind furniture every morning & night . Why not just leave it on ? Well , if the power remains on , the red light at the front is lit , and it is VERY bright in a dark room - hey , if you want a nightlight , buy this fire ! Also , I do n't much like the idea of leaving my house with a 1500 watt fire ready to turn itself on at any moment ( if the temperature falls low enough ) . And do n't even think about contacting DeLonghi customer service . They will just tell you that `` it is the correct user manual '' , despite my sending them photos of the fire to prove that the manual is choc-full of mistakes . Useless . I went to Target , bought a small `` Warm Fusion '' ceramic heater for $ 9.99 ( on sale ) - it is FAR superior - much warmer , and hey , you can turn the darn thing OFF ! !	-1
Mine cuts out before the room and I get warm ; it probably has a defective thermostat . So I have to buy another .	-1
Works great for a while but then has tendency to start slowing down . Ok I guess for small office area but not a reliable fan	-1
I do n't know why people have given so many good reviews for this iron but my experience for the past two weeks is that the iron has to be recharged four times to finish one cotton pants . Pain in the neck ! When it 's fully charged , it 's really great . Yet , iron is useless real quick . Once pressing for steam does n't work , that means iron is n't hot anymore . So , back to the base , again , and , again , and , again ! Then I have to turn the setting from Level 3 ( highest ) to Off and then back to Level 3 , again , so the iron would recharge . If I just leave it on the base to recharge , it does n't seem to be hot at all . Well , big plus to have it cordless , but , my iron time has more than double . I 'd recommend a Rowenta iron which I used to have . It was more effective and lasted over five years . In conclusion , this cordless Panasonic iron is good but not effective !	-1
This coffee makes good coffee but after a while the pot starts to leave a ring in the pot and the pot starts to discolor . No matter how hard you try it does not come out . This coffee pot is made of aluminum . After I got rid of this pot I got a stainless steel coffee pot which also makes good coffee but does not discolor .	-1
Scatters dust rather than picking it up ! Does a great job picking up nuts and bolts as the package photo indicates but ca n't do much for real dust bunnies on the floors ! And it is so loud that you need ear plugs ! : (	-1
I saw this product advertised on television and read reviews and thought it would be great . Out of the box I charged the battery for 20+ hours before trying it . On the commercial it would pick up bolts off the floor but it failed to pick up dog food bits off of my floor . It seemed to perform a little better on carpet but it 's really hard to roll on deep pile carpet . For me it was n't worth the money .	-1
I am now on my 3rd Cordless Shark . The first one melted the battery charger , and the 2nd one broke the gear that spins the edge brush . The 3rd one just broke the same gear ! It 's a shame , because the vacuum works well , is easy to clean , is lightweight . It just does n't hold together well.I am going to try the Eureka 570B .	-1
Worked ok - while it worked . After not many uses the battery would n't charge even though the light showed it was charging . Now there is no light at all so I 'm having one last try to see if it will charge . Then I 'll throw it out .	-1
This vacuum , does not , repeat , not vacuum well , because the battery life is very short , about a couple of minutes , even after charging . The lights blink after a little dirt is in the collection bin , cup , whatever , it sucks ( and not in the way it should ) . I had a Shark canister vacuum , that was not bad , given its small size , but it wore out . I bought this one to get in tight areas , that 's about the only thing I can say is that it maneuvers well , otherwise , I 'd never have another again . If I had the bucks to buy one , I 'd by some kind of & # 34 ; Dyson & # 34 ; equivalent , assuming they 're as good as they say that they are , and it 's not all hype , since they 're not cheap . I have a regular old & # 34 ; Hoover & # 34 ; Corded model that works better . I & # 34 ; m definitely up for a different brand than this one , if anyone 's got any suggestions , within about the $ 45.00 to $ 60.00 range , I figure that 's about the lowest one can pay for a really good one , with a decently long lasting battery .	-1
Ended up giving mine away to a thrift shop did n't hold up to my expectations.Went back to my vacuum cleaner this just did n't do it for me , a lesson in life learned .	-1
This feels likes it 's going to fall apart in your hands as you 're using it . You have to go over crumbs and dirt multiple times before it actually picks it up . The battery life is short -- like 5 - 10 minutes and then it dies.It made of cheap plastic especially the handle . It 's wobbly . The handle feels like a piece of junk . AVOID .	-1
I have been through at least 10 small sweepers before finally keeping this Shark.REVISIONS : I : After several months , I demote the rating of this product from 5 to 3 stars . After a while , the gears do whine at certain angles , and the efficiency of pickup deteriorates . I only use this one or twice a week , and any heavier use would compromise the flimsy design.I no longer can recommend it seriously.IISecond Revision ( 1/04 ) : Now the battery does not hold a charge.This is a very bad product .	-1
defective plastic handle do not buy unless you want to replace the handle M18804513 every other time you use it at $ 15 a pop	-1
Can not give any kudos to Fagor for sturdiness or support for this product and would rate a zero if it were possible . Had a 'Splendid ' model cooker that gave performance problems with the upper handle not performing well and after warranty period had expired , discovered that the pressure sensing button was defective . Could find no way to get just the button , which should have been a 50 cent item , and had to order a complete upper handle assembly to get the button ( $ 26 including shipping and their 800 number never responds ) . After receiving the new handle with all it 's parts , when taking the shipping tape off of the handle , the locking slider fell off . It was broken before being packed and taped to the handle to keep it there until delivered . Called the Fagor 800 number and got a message to leave a name and number and they would call me back within 48 Hrs . After 4 days with no call back , sent them an email through their web site explaining the problem and requesting a new part . Now 1 week later and no call back , no email answer and no replacement part.I had seen reviews describing Fagor 's lack of support over things like this and did n't believe that a company this big could be so lacking in support of their customer base . I 've had enough of this company and am switching to Magafesa or an American manufacturer to see if their support is any better . It certainly ca n't be any worse ! ! !	-1
I have one of these . It has a number of issues . One is that it is difficult and awkward to put the lid in place . It does n't seem like it ought to be , but it is a lot fussier than it looks . Next , the steam pressure regulator valve allows a steady stream of hot steam to escape . That is OK , except that it directs this flow exactly at the grip on the opposite side of the pot from the handle . Stupid design ! But the real issue is this : I was surprised the first time I used it that a a lot of steam and water escaped from under the handle atop the lid , not through the pressure valves mind you , but from under the handle.However , once the pressure built up this seemed to stop . So it apparently it relies on internal pressure to make all the seals tight . Fair enough ... BUT about the thrid time I used it , after it had come up to pressure , I turned the burner down to medium ( usually enough to keep things going along nicely ) and went about other business . It seems that the pot came off the hard boil and in doing so the seal was compromised ( I think that low internal pressure caused this . ) The compromised seal meant that the pot was still `` steaming '' away , but not under high pressure . This permitted all the liquid to evaporate out of the pot far faster than it should have , and so it badly scorched the bottom of the pot.I was dumbfounded when my my wife happened to walk into the kitchen and smell the burning after only 20 minuts for a recipie that I know by actual first-hand experience should take an hour , and still wind up with about a pint of liquid in the pot . Luckily a major disaster was averted.. but I no longer trust this device and I wo n't use it.As I read other reviews I see that a lot of them have had similar burning/scorching/sealing failures . I believe it is a design flaw of the pot . It needs high pressure to seal . If the pressure drops you are in a heap of trouble . You are no longer pressure cooking , you are just blindly boiling away the liquid ! I did clean it up , ( it took power tools in my shop , scrapers , and wire buffing wheels ) but it 's ultimate fate is the dumpster . It ca n't be trusted unless you watch it constantly , and it is too much at risk if it screws up again . The down side is n't just a ruined diner , it is a ruined kitchen.I wo n't give up pressure cooking , but I will give up this pressure cooker.Peter	-1
I have to rate this purchase very low because this lid is advertised to fit `` all Fagor pressure cookers '' but it does n't fit the 10 quart that I have . Disappointed when I got it ? Yes ! ! It appears to be a good quality lid , and it fits my father 's 4 quart cooker just fine ( the only reason I 'm not giving a rating of 1 star ) , but I feel I 've been deceived .	-1
I thought this extra cube would allow me to send my dearly beloved Mint into two separate rooms . That , apparently , is not the case unless at some point Mint can see both of the cubes . I live in a mid-century house with small bedrooms off a central hallway . There 's no way I can get the cubes to communicate . The second cube was a waste of money , but I still LOVE the Mint . Best thing that ever happened to wood and tile floors .	-1
This is my second Bucky Baxter Lumbar Pillow and it is not the same as the first one even though the pictures look the same . First , it has a weird chemical smell . I 'm hanging it in the sun so maybe the smell will dissipate . Second , it 's a bit bulkier than the first one and it 's blue not black . I love the first one I got and am going to try to order the same product again which is listed as : Columbia Women 's Rambling Rhodie Rain Jacket , Seminole , LargeThe misprint has been online for a month now and I 'm surprised that someone from the company has n't noticed it .	-1
Other reviewers who said this gets TOO HOT are either insanely sensitive to heat or work for the makers of this foot warmer.Ours heated up to around 85 degrees . Yes , 85 degrees is a fairly-warm day , but that 's about as warm as the side of a coffee that 's been sitting out for 25 minutes . This did not provide enough heat to justify keeping it or dealing with the smell of chemicals.Makers of this product : please include an adjustable heating element that ranges from barely-on to VERY-warm ( 140 degrees ) . Otherwise people will send it back .	-1
The power cord was destroyed by jostling around during shipping . I was going to order a replacement , but on second thought it 's such a terrible design flaw that I 'm getting something else instead.I 'm sure it 'd be alright if it worked , but it does n't . Worse , the whole thing is probably going to the dump because of this overlooked bit.Fix your product , Indus-Tool .	-1
This was a total waste of $ 36 . Maybe in bare feet this would be **slightly** warm but even if I put my bare hand on it after it has been `` warming '' for several hours I still ca n't feel much heat.Go find some other product to buy if you really want your feet warmed , this is useless for that purpose .	-1
not for inside use , IMHO . It stinks , like a skunk . but outside , to melt the ice on a front step , it 's great	-1
First it weighs a ton . You must be physically fit to carry it upstairs . Second the filter clogs in two weeks , not six months . Third it loses suction at the drop of a pin . Fourth it makes a horrible racket if it does n't like the thinness of the rug you are vacuuming . I have a cleaner by Hoover that cost a third the price and does ten times the job with minimal maintenance . I estimate I spend two hours a month at least trying to get my Dyson Animal to suck up a little dirt . Ugh . Do n't buy it.UPDATE : After years of fiddling with this piece of over-designed , under-engineered junk , I put it on the street . Honestly , I felt guilty doing that to some innocent scavenger but I was mad as hell and I just could n't take it anymore .	-1
I go thru around 3 vacuum cleaners per year because I have two saint bernards and a pug . I have tried so many different vacuums that its pathetic . I finally found a dyson dc07 for $ 219 that was labeled refurbished because the box was damaged in shipping . The vacuum looks new with no marks or scratches ect . Anyhow , I vacuumed my wall to wall carpet with my bissel before i used this dyson . YES , the dyson still sucked up a lot of dirt that the bissel didnt . My carpets looked new until i got down on my knees and looked closer , there is still a layer of pet hair on the carpet . The dyson doesnt suck as powerfull as all the hype says it does . However , it is a nice vacuum . Its not heavy , and it does great for dirt . So if you do not have a zoo like I do , I think the dyson all floors will do just fine , and for me well , I am getting my saints shaved because I have found that NO vacuum picks up the hair and I have tried many top brands and models : (	-1
I had this vacuum for about 4 years , and I loved it at first , but the more I used it , the more disenchanted I became . It seemed to only clean a 3-4-inch wide strip at a time , so I had to go over the same spot multiple times , and even then it was n't clean . When I had my carpet replaced , it would n't even pick up the smallest pieces of loose carpet fibers . The only part I liked about the machine was the long-reaching wand . We junked the machine a few months ago and moved on to a machine that seems to work much better .	-1
The Dyson is very heavy and is a strain to carry up/down stairs ( and I am young and physically fit ) , even though it is called `` light and easy to maneuver . `` It is cumbersome to change attachments or to pull out the extending wand , even though it is called the `` quick draw hose . '' I also would think that for an older person or someone with limited dexterity , it would be difficult to find and be able to push in the release/lock button on the extending hose and other attachments.It 's not possible to get the full reach of the hose because the machine will tip over or roll toward the hose and into whatever is in its path.The crevice tool on the front of the wand/hose is positioned so that it is in the way and can easily nick furniture if you 're reaching behind something , such as a table leg.It is difficult to move from one surface to another : we have a modest threshold of less than half an inch between rooms , and I have to pick up the machine because the vacuum wo n't roll over it.The motor housing/body is so high that the machine will not allow getting even a few inches under many pieces of furniture-and the prospect of changing to the low-reach tool is not appealing because it 's a hassle and does n't work well anyway.I received the Dyson DC07 low reach as a gift so I must use it , but I would never buy another . Yes , it is kind of neat to see all the dirt that it collects in the bagless canister , but you can get the same thrill with any other good bagless style . Yes , it 's funky and glitzy , but aside from its touted suction power , it 's a terribly designed , expensive product . Trust Consumer Reports .	-1
Good Points : Long extension cord you can actually get around the house with . Nice color . Easy waste dispenser . Picks up fairly well.Bad Points : Heavy and no belt so hard to push ( and carry ) . Attachments go on handle so if vacuum not positioned properly when not using utensils , the air suction is in your face . No lever in back to position head - you must instead step on front . Head angles low but bulky so difficult to get under things anyway . Also does not angle up high enough to go from carpet to floor to carpet- you can not raise front high enough to get onto carpet . The bristles make an awful sound going from floor to carpet ( especially if you have fringed area rugs ) as if seizing up . You have to clean the bristles after each use because of so much accumulation getting caught when dealing with pet hair . Only two postions- carpet or floor.Wish I had done my homework . This is definitely the ` cheaper model ' .	-1
The advertising did n't mention that the components are PLASTIC . The friend who 'd raved to me about it warned me not to buy it after all . But it was too late . She 's been through several of them ; I 've gone back to Hoover .	-1
This is probably a very good can opener , I tried to remove the blister packaging , gave up and threw that damn thing in the trash .	-1
There may be people who find this easy to use or who think it 's worth the effort to get the kind of edge this produces . For me , it was as the British say & # 34 ; too clever by half & # 34 ; -- you have to hold it exactly right to make it work and keep it going . I got a cheaper one that works a lot better .	-1
When we received this opener , we loved it . It worked great , and was easy on the hands . We were sick of the `` rechargeable '' batteries in the battery-operated openers lasting only so long , which is why we changed to this human-powered model . We also liked the no-sharp-edges result . It lasted exactly one year , then it began skipping as it wound around the can until it was no longer usable . The warranty is n't as great as it sounds since because of the cost to ship this item back to Oxo ; we 'll put the money towards a new ( and different ) opener .	-1
It is difficult to get the can opener into the correct position on the can . You can not tell when the cutting circle has been completed . The lid must be pryed off with a knife or now-non-existent fingernails . The $ 2.00 can openers are better than this one .	-1
Like many other reviewers , I purchased one of these newfangled ( I just turned 40 so I have to use words like that ) : ) openers . It was great ! ! ! ! at first ... ... . Eventually it starts to lose its cutting ability and can no longer open effectively . Now , I have to go around several times and then grab the edge of the lid with the built-in grabber and peel/bend the lid up slowly . This actually takes a good deal of strength and one day I 'm certain something is going to go flying across the room and I may get accused of attempting to donkey punch my girlfriend from afar ( I would never do such a thing , probably ! ) At the very least , I am going to re-decorate my kitchen in black bean ( thats probably a real color somewhere ) .so as it stands , I am torn - I dont know if I should invest in another one . They are much superior to the old school method but do n't last ( hmmmm ... a common theme these days ) . I will contact OXO and see what they say . For a company that has a premium marketing strategy ( and cost along with it ) , I certainly hope they have customer service that matches . I hope they figure out the problem . Great concept .	-1
I bought this because of the large turning handle as I thought it might make it easier to get the lids off of cans , but it was n't any easier to use than an older style . I 've since bought an electric one that cuts the tops of the cans of from Hamilton Beach . It works great !	-1
Am I asking for too much ? I love the safe edge concept and was happy for a while . Bought it a couple of years ago -- If I pay $ 20 or so for a can opener I expect it to last until I do n't remember buying it . Like my microplane graters which are going strong after 10 years ... On this one , the cutting blade fell off , and for the last six months or so , the opener had been skipping or not cutting through without two passes . Will try the zyliss version this time for a replacement .	-1
This can opener opens the can just fine and turns without much effort . My problem with it is this : After completing the opening process , I ca n't get the lid to come off the can easily . Sometimes I have to use a knife and insert it between the lid and edge of the can to pry it open . The edges are safe as the review says but I hate using it for the stated reason .	-1
After years of an Oxo hand can opener , and a kitchen full of their stuff we decided it was time for a new one . This one should not have been it . Hard to turn . Everyone who picks it up needs instruction in how it works ( and they invariably ask why we bought it ) . We wanted the safe edge aspect for the grandkids ... but we 'll look elsewhere . Watch for this baby on Woot .	-1
I brought this can opener because my mother highly recomended it . I have owned it for two years now and have decided this is the worse can opener I have ever owned . Most of the time I have to go around twice to get the can opened . Some cans it does n't open at all . I own many Oxo products and am very satisfied with them but this one you can keep .	-1
I rarely use a can opener . This thing broke after very few uses ... no longer works . Even tho I have had it a while only used such a few times that for a family who uses it daily ... wo n't last .	-1
I decided to get rid of my electric can opener to reduce my carbon footprint and bought this product . I have never been accused of being good with my hands or particulartly coordinated , but this product has been much harder to use than I thought . You have to get just the right angle . I usually have to try several times to get it started . Once it does get going it opens the can really easily .	-1
These racks are very poor quality . The rods and wall attachments are made from very lightweight , thin metal , and almost feel like cheap plastic . The hooks themselves are also cheaply made , and sit unevenly on the rod.I sent these racks back for a refund , and made my own rack out of copper pipe and copper wire for the hooks . I 'm glad I did .	-1
Up until now I 've had good luck with Oxo products -- thought I 'd like this initially , easy to get the bulb on and off , great cleaning with that brush . BUT . The tip drips much worse than basters I 've used in past , the bulb pops off occasionally when using -- there 's a mess . Today is the worst : using it to siphon off fat from roasting short ribs , THE PLASTIC TUBE STARTED MELTING . The clear plastic part actually started to curve , and the tip melted together almost shut . Had to throw it away . Just ordered the Tovolo here , which had good reviews .	-1
The OXO Good Grips Baster is poorly designed and likely subject to wide manufacturing standards . Mine disassembled and assembled easily when following the instructions ( to ease in cleaning ) , but the bulb does not fit snugly enough to prevent air from entering the top of the unit . Even with the collar snapped into place air leaked in and allowed liquid to drip out . ( The size of the hole is normal and is not the problem as reported by another reviewer . ) Loose manufacturing tolerances probably allows for some to come through without significant air leakage . Do you feel lucky ? I replaced it with a $ 1.69 supermarket baster which works great . Exceptfor its cleaning brush I threw the OXO out .	-1
I like OXO products for their generally well-designed traits . Unfortunately , this oven thermometer is the exception to OXO quality and design . The thermometer is fairly accurate in its temperature reading , and the temperature numbers on the dial are easy to read when backlit by the oven lightbulb ( if you have one ) . What makes the product totally flawed and worse than useless is the ridiculously idiotic mounting mechanism -- two metal clips on each side of the device , which are so short , they wo n't even lock onto my oven rack , and keep making the thermometer fall off the rack . It 's the essence of stupid design , just plain stupid . Also , when the thermometer is in place ( assuming that you can actually get it to stay in place ) , it takes up several inches of space on the rack , preventing you from sliding an oven pan all the way towards the back of the oven.Go with a hanging thermometer instead and save yourself a lot of frustration .	-1
This thermometer is junk . Yes it is easy to read because of the clear dial , however , it does not register the temperature for at least 30 minutes ! You will be baking for half the day just waiting to see the thermometer register the correct temp . Do not buy it . Instead buy a probe thermometer with dual functions ( one for oven temp and one for meat temp ) . I can not express enough my disappointment with this product . This one is junk .	-1
Purchased this thermometer based on past good experiences with OXO brand.While this unit has some nice features such as large numbers and translucent glass to allow oven lightto illuminate numbers without opening oven door , it has some `` issues '' that will cause me to purchaseanother brand.The first time I used it I noticed that is was very slow to react to the oven temperature.I set the oven to 400 and 15 minutes later the thermometer was only up to just past 200.I found the clip/mount was difficult to set up on my grates and allowed the thermometer tofall to the bottom of the oven with the slightest bump from a cookie sheet.I tried bending the hook to make it fit tighter and I also had to bend the mount to view the facewith the door closed . ( when hanging from the grate , the face was angled down ) This helped a bit with the drop problem , but pans still bump the hook when you slide them in or out of the oven.I wish they made one that reacted quicker and mounted with a strong magnet instead of that stupid , flimsy hookI going to be looking for another unit because the slow response and mount issue is too much of a painto deal with . I hope the OXO designers are reading these reviews because this unit is harming their reputation ,	-1
Two issues:1 . Takes forever to show the actual oven temp , even after pre-heating the oven ... say 10 minutes , or more.2 . After using mine for about two years it is impossible to read the temp due to the clouded over dial.There are better choices . Normally OXO products are excellent but not this one .	-1
Does n't show temperature correctly . Does n't stand or hang easily . Do n't be fooled by Oxo 's good reputation . Do not buy this !	-1
Thermometer did n't last too long . It was supposed to be mounted on the grill to monitor the temperature at the cooking surface . It immediately was covered in black grime from the charcoal smoke . The thing is done as I ca n't get it clean enough to read the hand or the numbers !	-1
I do n't know why the other reviewers keep saying the `` Teflon is flaking off '' . There *is* no Teflon . As far as I can tell , they just spray painted regular pans with black paint . Everything sticks to it . These pans are worthless , save your money .	-1
This is stupid- I bought it because Amazon had it in the recommendation bar when I ordered my convection oven . I assumed it was the correct size to go with it , but it 's for the little toaster ovens- the pans are TINY . I did n't bother returning them as they were cheap- I just gave them to the thrift store . Lesson learned- whoever does those suggestions does n't necessarily care whether they work with your other purchase- they 're just trying to increase the sale .	-1
Although this may be of use for an individual it is not big enought for an entire family or even two people .	-1
I have this set , and in less than a month the teflon began flaking off.I do not use scrubbies just a sponge and dish liquid . As soon as the teflon began to flak off the product started to rust.I received this as a gift and felt so bad when the person that gave them to me saw what had happened . He felt very bad . Shame on Nordic Ware they usually have a fair product for the money.Bella	-1
Very poor teflon quality-flaked from the first time I used them . The weight of the pan and design are nice though ; too bad they did n't put a few more cents worth into the teflon coating !	-1
Ok , first of all , my set was light gold in color and did not seem to have any nonstick surface to it ! The pans are so thin and lightweight that they bend easily . The tray has already warped after the first use . They are soooo cheap looking and feeling . As I was washing the deeper pan , it was bending and popping all over the place . This set is a HUGE disappointment . You might as well just go buy the disposable aluminum foil pans.The rack was inside the deeper pan during shipping and it made scratches and black/grey marks on the pan that did not come off.I saw that people have said the Teflon is coming off of their pans after the first use , but mine do not seem to have any Teflon or any other type of coating . It is like a raw , gritty finish on my set.I do not recommend this set unless you can get it under 5 bucks , you have low expectations , and want a more disposable set .	-1
I bought this set for our toaster oven . I reviewed the size before I ordered it . When I got it it turned out to be very , very tiny . It appeared as if we could only fit 1 piece of bread or 1 piece of chicken on this and that 's it . It may good for a family of 1 , but not for a family of 3 . I returned it .	-1
We previously had a Krups and then a Braun espresso machine . Each lasted ten ... yes , 10 ... years . When the Braun went kaput , I purchased the Capresso . I did n't want anything fancy but something that would hold up to our daily use . The machine was very simple and perfect for a beginner . Unfortunately , it died one year and one month after purchase . Go figure ... one month after the warranty was up . Things that make you go ... hmmmm . I wo n't be buying another .	-1
I am a big fan of espresso and espresso drinks but needed to save money so I bought this to make it at home . Making espresso is easy enough if you follow the instructions ( I did n't watch the video ) . The frother even works well . The problem I had was with the flavor . The manual suggests making two or four shots of espresso at a time , but when making four shots the espresso was badly burned by the time it was finished brewing . I had best results making just over one shot at a time , but the flavor was still burned and flat . In the end , I used the machine for a couple months but eventually put it away and went back to my regular drip coffee maker .	-1
Many years ago I purchased a two pair set of Henckels scissors that I love , not only because they perform beautifully , but because they are crafted with durable materials and are comfortable to use . This set is NOTHING like my original set . This set is cheaply made , uncomfortable in the hand , and the plastic is characteristic of the cheapest of the cheap craft scissors you can buy at a discount store . Do yourself a favor and buy something else . These scissors should n't even carry the Henckels name , its a disgrace to this great brand name .	-1
I bought this blender because Consumer Reports rated it a Best Buy . It was supposed to perform beautifully and was inexpensive . When I used it , it leaked & quot ; smoothie & quot ; all over the counter . The top would n't even hold water . After the first time I washed the parts , it stopped working . Totally . I had trouble figuring out how to disassemble and reassemble it . The instructions were inadequate ( lousy ) . When I took it to an authorized repair dealer , I was told it had bad brushes ( whatever that is ) . It 's back on my counter again , working but still leaking .	-1
I really liked the price and the features of this blender , and I love the Krups brand name ! This blender worked great the first four times I used it . The fifth time I used it is leaked . After two more uses it simply stopped working and I had to return it.I will be purchasing a new blender made for heavier use ... this worked fine when it did work , but the leaking that started made it too messy to use . ( I make smoothies a few times a week . I tried to save money by settling for this , a cheaper blender , and I now realize I am going to need to put out a bit more for a heavier-duty blender . ) The blender 's overall design made it difficult to clean as well.I do n't recommend this blender to anyone , not even at a low or clearance price . I do n't know how Krup 's let this blender become part of their product line .	-1
It replaced the original item which worked great , but the machine could not get any water flow from this unit , and I could get no coffee until I removed it . Waste of money -- tossed it . I use filtered water anyhow .	-1
Thinking that perhaps I had something of a `` steal '' on my hands because of the price , I decided to forego any pessimistic thoughts and pick up the Sabiat Perfect Grip Set as a gift to myself . Personally , I thought I could showcase these pretty nifty little items near my newly acquired George Foreman grill , using it to heave my diet into the right realms of wonderment and keep me from sliding down that slippery slope that would once again be considered unhealthy eating after I had recently upgraded it to `` so-so . `` Now , to understand my mindset , I was wanting something that sliced and diced , that would basically stay sharp no matter what I put it through , and that would n't give me any problems . Well , it began failing me on all fronts soon after I picked it up.The first woe I had was when my lovely wooden block began to split for absolutely no reason , making me wonder if perhaps its synthetically constructed wooden texture were defective orif i had stored something wrong . It actually did it in two places and without my forceful aid which , sometimes , comes out without my knowledge and tries to thwart newly acquired items . Had it stopped there , I would have written it off with an annoying `` o well '' and continued on my merry way . Still , it didn't.The next thing I discovered was that my cutting board , a piece of wondrous plastic that should n't give these beasts a problem , was actually dulling their edges rather quickly . I , being the lazy person that I am , thought that this was perhaps normal and that knives did this ( I do n't cook often , so you see my understanding of the product beforehand and my dilemma ) until a friend of mine told me otherwise . They informed me that only cheap knives do this and that I had perhaps the wonders of a rather faulty set . They then went on to point out the cracking in the block I had already found , fueling the fires of reviewing that were building in my belly.The last straw , however , was when my largest knife decided to quite suddenly come loose from its `` ergonomic polymer handle for easy grip '' while I was struggling with its use against some rather formitable prey , cutting through pieces of sealed pork lion that should n't have been tough save for the dullness of my knife . It simply went shooting off , flying through the air in slow motion in front of my horrified gaze , and I knew it would hit me on its random acrobatic descent ( which it did n't , thanks to my panic and the moving fetal position I 've learned to adopt ) . It was then , amidst an angry rain of words , I swore I would review these beasts and worn everyone that cost effective cutlery is a mistake of epic proportions .	-1
The Item Pictured shows the Carbon , and is not what you will get.The description says `` 3 standard HEPASilent filter of polypropylene ( traps particles ) and activated carbon ( removes odors and gases ) . `` You are not getting any carbon here , I should have paid attention to the other review.If it sounds too good to be true ... ..	-1
The Box shown clearly shows a `` Eureka '' product . What was sent was a zip-top bag containing a non-branded generic replacement filter . The `` Eureka '' unit I have found since returning this one is better made ( cost more ) and clearly labeled as the real item .	-1
I ordered these belts because it said `` GENUINE EUREKA '' . It is NOT Eureka . It is made by Flexaust . The seller claims Flexaust makes Eureka 's belts so its the same thing . FALSE . It should NOT be listed as Genuine part.Just because Flexaust makes Eureka belts does not mean it is Genuine . First of all Eureka discontinued the `` rubber only belt '' for the heavy duty belt that has reinforcing mesh/cords ; similar to the higher end radiator hoses . These belts are just plain rubber . Also , Eureka most likely requires a certain type of rubber with specified hardness and wear characteristics . I deal with things like this at work and I call out the specifications in documents so that the companies who make our parts make them the way we need them.About a year ago , when our Eureka Airspeed was new my children accidently went over a sock that was pulled into the brush and `` burned up the belt '' . I went to the store a bought a generic to hold me over and went on line and found two belts that fit the vacuum . I called Eureka tech support . They told me that both fit and the reinforced one that cost a little bit more is a better belt and lasts longer . He also said the Eureka was discontinuing the plain rubber belt.Tech support was correct , the reinforced belt has survived several socks , shirts , towels , etc and `` not burned up '' ... though there was burnt odor and we turned off the vacuum immedately ; then pulled out the item that jammed the roller . I installed the other spare belt about 4 months ago in our second Airspeed vacuum and wanted to have belts to replace these belts because belt age even when properly used.Granted the belt on the second vacuum lasted around 7 months . If you are really good about not accidently vacuuming the sofa cover edge , socks , etc , this belt will work for you , but it is NOT a `` genuine '' Eureka belt . That is why I gave this part and seller only 1 star .	-1
At first I was skeptical because this product has many GOOD reviews but it also has many BAD and very bad reviews.Sadly I 'm going to be another one of the bad ones.I 'll make it quick and painless1 . This thing is loud as F* & # -- even on the lowest setting.. on the lowest setting it can be heard from the opposite side of the house and it 's still louder then the stand up model Honeywell I have . At the highest setting this thing sounds like an aircraft carrier taking off.. no joke -- I ca n't even hear the other air purifiers I have at the opposite end of the house when I 'm sitting right next to them when this thing is blowing air in another room ... It 's LOUD- You can hear it through 2 closed doors like it 's nothing ... 2 . The pre-filter / filter itself smell like rubber / manufacturing -- the smell is n't horrible .. but it 's strong enough that when the thing is blowing you can smell it.. it almost has a musty smell ... it does n't make the air smell fresh .. it makes it smell like a manufacturing plant.3 . If you are going to buy a replacement filter for the thing which they recommend you have to buy 3 to fit the 1 that it comes with . They do not sell an exact replacement they have split it into three parts -- and each one costs 80 bucks ... so it 's going to cost you more than the cost of a new unit to get replacement filters ( which they recommend you replace every year ... -- yes you can buy the third party / aftermarket ones here on amazon for about 80-90 bucks but if I 'm buying a product I expect the replacement parts to be OEM ... maybe that 's just me ... 4 . The power usage on this bad boy is just downright ridiculous . It makes sense judging from the amount of sound it makes ... but this thing on high pulls the same amount as a toaster or as my vacuum cleaner -- I recorded it on high to use about 800 WPS ( watts per second ) at medium about 500 and on low about 300 -- This all adds up when you keep this thing running all year long which you are going to need to do . My honeywell standup model uses 80 WPS on high 50 on medium and 30 on low and kicks out plenty of air . ( ( I 'm not going to get into the math on transferring WPS into cost per year as it all depends on how long you are running it for and I have a long spreadsheet of every item in my house and how much it uses but just know that this thing is power hungry and you 're going to be paying at least another 30-40 bucks on your electricity bill if you run this thing on high all month.Overall I 'm very disappointed in this product ... if you are deaf or do n't mind the sound of living in a wind tunnel .. then by all means .. by this ... but if you 're like me and you prefer to be able to hear things in your house ( especially when the wife is calling ... find something else ) ... . then again .. maybe some of you would n't mind something to cover up the wife 's / husbands calls ... food for thought ... : P	-1
For purifying such a small space - it sounds like a Jet Engine . And it 's HUGE . I sent it back .	-1
Even on the lowest setting my wife and I ca n't sleep because of the fan noise so the unit is useless . It seems to clean the air but we need to find a Purifier that is quiet .	-1
I can not belive they sell this thing ! I dont see how a sane person would choose be in the same room room while it is on . I can not belive this unit had so many good reviews .	-1
I purchased this for my daughters bedroom but even on low , it 's way too loud . Thinking of returning it for another Winix . Reviews on this one are a little misleading . I can hear this thing running two rooms over on low . Very powerful but the noise is just too much .	-1
much thinner and more plastic looking than the photo . pay a little more to get a little more . i would not buy this again , i 'm going to throw it away .	-1
The Waring Pro does not perform as adverised , either in the Waring ads or in the customer reviews online . The container on top does not `` seat '' itself firmly on the base ; it does not lock into place for safety ; and it does not pulverize a tray of ice cubes at all , much less in 3 seconds , as was one person 's experience . Thinking I had gotten a defective machine , I called Waring only to be told that none of their blenders lock into place and one is supposed to hold the top down on the base while blending ! The tray of ice cubes stuck in the blender without blending , and the personal chef I had in my kitchen at the time and who was watching my personal demonstration said , `` No , no , that 's not ok . Send it back ! '' And so I will .	-1
Direction of use would have helped . My system 's probably slower , but guess at least it works .	-1
Cuisinart used to be THE name in kitchen appliances , but they have hit rock bottom with this . It takes numerous tries to get the can seated just right to be pierced and start cutting , then it skips areas along the way . so I have to get out the manual opener to finish the job . A friend gave it to me thinking it would ease the arthritic pain in my fingers from using a hand crank one . Well , my fingers feel better , but my frame of mind is n't so hot . Everytime I use this piece of junk I swear I 'm going to throw it in the trash . This time I did . Also , I ordered a Cuisinart single serve K-cup style coffee maker . It worked slowly from the start , and then after a couple of weeks it did n't work at all . What has happened with this company ? ? ?	-1
Horrible quality product , and made in the USA too ! My first one sounded like a rock crusher or cement mixer so KitchenAid replaced it . The replacement is not much better . The quality is not what I expected of KitchenAid and you probably need to go up to the Pro line in order to get anything worthy of this once great brand . It may look cheap , but you are honestly getting what you are paying for , and no more .	-1
This does not fit the 5.5 qt purchased from Costco . The quality seems fine , but if you have the 5.5 or 6 qt , pass on it .	-1
I 've had this mixer cover for a few years , and use it to cover my tilt-head 5-quart Artisan mixer ( as pretty as the mixer is , my house gets dusty with boys running around ) . It had a generous fit until I washed it . Now it 's wrinkled and barely fits over the mixer ! I am not amused . However , even before then , it fit weirdly because it 's not the same shape as the mixer , and the handle on the bowl makes it stick out oddly on one side . Before it shrank , though , that was n't a big deal and looked pretty much like it does in the product photo , but now it looks deformed on my counter ! Also , the pocket for the attachments does not fit the whip without gaping open ( never did ) , which is both unattractive and a good way to get the whip dusty , which defeats the purpose . I have to leave the whip in the bowl or stored away and only put the flat paddle in the pocket . It would be nice if the pocket had a fold-over flap or snap to keep it covered or closed.I 'll have to look for one of the cheaper alternatives for a replacement ...	-1
The quality is fine , however , this cover is about 2 inches shorter than my Kitchenaid stand mixer . It is a Kitchenaid product so it was very disappointing .	-1
I wanted to purchase a few items for my pro 600 kitchenaid ... .this was one of of them . I was shocked to find the cover postively does not cover the unit . Another reviewer mentioned if you turn the cover to the side instead of pocket being in front as should be twist so pocket is on side of mixer . Although gives a little more give in length pulls cover so tightly making it look horrible.. Can not believe this was designed for kitchen aid mixers without stating would only fit smaller kitchenaid smaller mixers . Feel as though I was decieved..False advertising ! ! !	-1
I received a new Kitchenaid Professional 600 series stand mixer . I read the reviews about this cover being too short for the 600 series . I called Kitchenaid and one person said it would fit and gave me a model # to order . I read the reviews for this model # and found it was also reported too short for the 600 series . I called Kitchenaid again and the gentleman said that they only wanted to sell one size for all stand mixers to avoid the confusion of different size covers for different mixers . They knew that it was 2 inches too short . This is ridiculous . So , I ended up ordering from another company . Their cover is nice and fits to the counter but has no pockets -- -I did not care as I put the accessory items in the bowl . I ordered it from The Cover Store ( Model Z13.BK2 ) . I do miss that the cover I bought is not tapered ( it is a box shape , but it does fit properly . Kitchenaid needs to produce a cover that fits the Pro 600 series . I would prefer the tapered look ; but a box shape is better than a too short tapered look in my opinion .	-1
Due to very compact kitchen I always store the bowl and splash guard on mixer . This cover will not come down over the splash guard ; when splash guard removed covers the mixer and bowl very tightly , does not look good to me . Will return this and use the one I made myself again . Please note this is very well made , good quality material and sewing .	-1
I have the same rice cooker ( except with induction heating ) and wanted to purchase this item as a wedding gift . Well , when I get this item , I notice the box seems a little less than new . I notice that the rice measuring cup is missing , the manual is worn and there is the scent of rice in the machine . IT WAS A USED ITEM . Note that the item is not sealed but Amazon should have known . Very disappointed , especially for an item this expensive .	-1
I do n't know how this siphon has such good reviews on Amazon . It looks nice , but I was never able to get a high quality carbonation . I tried all the tricks : 1 ) I tried using multiple chargers ( the emergency valve just lets off the extra pressure on the second charger ) 2 ) I waited a long time after charging for the carbonation to form and 3 ) I made sure I kept everything really cold . I never got a results anywhere near as good as bottled soda water . Finally , the disposable chargers are so expensive it would n't make sense to use the soda siphon even if it worked well . It 's capable of creating some very low carbonation soda water , so I give this 2 stars instead of 1 . My sense is that all siphons of this style have the same fundamental issues . I think there 's a reason most people do n't have soda siphons.My later experiments to carbonate stuff other than water also all failed , but I do n't blame the siphon since they were `` off-label '' uses.In the end , I finally got a good carbonation by just buying a 5LB tank of CO2 and using it with a soda bottle adapter ( I spent the same amount of money as on this siphon and I can get make 1,000+ bottles of soda on one refill of my co2 tank ) . I 'm still trying to find someone who will take my old isi soda siphon away as a gift but no one wants this piece of junk .	-1
The bottle never empties completely out . It is awkward to hold and takes a lot of room in the refrigerator . Stream is strong but not as fizzy as I would like .	-1
As my title says , all failed very soon after purchase . Leaks . Little backup . No excuse for a product like this to fail within a few months . None.Maybe an American product will fill the void .	-1
One of the few Amazon purchases in the last six months that I regret . Calculator is big ( HUGE ! ! ) and I do n't find the operation to be at all intuitive . It never gets used and it takes up quite a bit of room in my kitchen drawer . I 'd probably throw it out , but then it would take up a bunch of space in a landfill instead of my kitchen . Absolutely my own fault for not fully understanding what I was buying . The KitchenCalc 8300 by the same company is much more compact and might have been a more appropriate choice , but I think there are even better options than that.If you have a smartphone ( Android or iPhone ) , iPad , or iPod touch then there are several cooking and unit conversion apps that offer much more flexibility and ease of use . To keep you electronics safe from bits of food you can slide them inside a ziploc bag - the touchscreen will work fine through the plastic.Edit 5/27/13 : Calculated Industries , the maker of this calculator , has released an iPhone App version of this calculator . No Android or Windows Mobile version as of this writing . More information at http : //www.calculated.com/64/prd345/KitchenCalc-for-iPhone.html	-1
I have this model and it is HUGE and expensive . great heat but I prefer the tiny one I WAS FORCED to replace with this monster much BETTER.I prefer QUARTZ heaters since they first came out . They heat 'objects ' meaning YOU and not just the air around you like ceramnic and radiant . Bravo for the technology but SHAME on the companies that are preventing replacement parts from being sold . Yes , I realize most people are not real bright but why cant I purchase replacement tubes even at places like appliance repair joints when I can buy parts for HEAD CRUSHING appliances and the like ? A stove can burst into flames and even explode a house but no problem getting parts for that ! ! ! Ditto for halogen lamps but good luck buying a NEW one of those in case you had n't noticed ... ..This unit uses the EXACT SAME tubes as in a 15yr old PRONTO heater of mine thatis 1/3 the size and horizontal ( preferred ) . So yea , for 15 years at least I have been trying to find replacement tubes.So sad that the entire internet can not give a proper answer to this unavailability issue . They would rather fill the landfills with these ENORMOUS heaters than sell us a couple of replacement parts . They are lucky I gave them one star . That is for the shear SIZE of this unit or maybe for the thermostat that does not work and never did . Matter of fact , I 've yet to see ONE heater that has a working thermostat that actually cycles on and off . Inside industry joke I 'm sure ... My recommendation ? move south if you can afford it .	-1
I bought my Roomba six months ago , and loved it for the first 3 months . It did just what it said it would , cleaning was easy , and the battery charges seemed pretty consistent . Around month 4 , I started noticing a SHARP decline in performance . My rugs were no dirtier than they had been -- if anything , I was vacuuming with the old-fashioned canister vacuum MORE often , not less . Battery charges started lasting much less time -- toward the end not even making it through one large room cycle.By month 5 , I was convinced it was a faulty motor . No amount of cleaning ( of the Roomba 's parts ) was doing any good , and the online FAQs had no help for me . On looking over the warranty information , though , I noticed one key thing I had n't paid attention to when I bought this machine : The warranty is only for 90 days.Based on that fact , I 'm guessing the Roomba folks are pretty clear on how long their machines will run reliably . So I 'm stuck with a useless little vacuum , plus the extra battery pack and rapid charger -- a hefty amount of money for 3 months of cleaning . If I ever consider a future Roomba model , I 'm going to check that warranty info very carefully .	-1

I did not like this pan very much . It is very light . I have used it for grilled sandwiches . The lid is too high and very inconvenient to store . I do not recommend this . I 'll probably use it to make omelettes .	-1
Very disappointed in this product . Such a shame for the Cuisinart name to have such defects in their product.My order arrived with deep manufacturing defects on the non-slotted spoon handle , quite an eyesore , as I am very picky how my kitchenware looks . Amazon immediately sent a replacement . The replacement set also had a defect in the non-slotted spoon . Again , I was very , very disappointed . I returned both sets for full credit.The weight of the set was nice . The set at first glance was very pleasing , but once I saw the spoon I was a very unhappy camper for the price I paid for this kitchen tool set . I will not buy another set .	-1
Did anybody notice that the pan holding the vegetables is actually not from that set ? Why would someone post a photo that actually is not a part of what is advertised , at best , it is unethical .	-1
I do n't like them . Hard to clean . Hate the heat constraints . Though I have been careful-they are tarnished and I keep them in a cabinet . Would have thought the cuisinart name stood for better	-1
I 'm afraid I did n't like this set of cookware . I purchased because it is Amazon 's top selling cookware , but I was sorely disappointed . After one use , one of the saucepans showed pitting and discoloration . I called the Cuisinart customer service and asked them about it . They recommended that I return to my place or purchase ... so I did , I returned them to Amazon . Amazon , as always , handled the return wonderfully . I then bought the Cuisinart Multiclad cookware . I 'm glad I made the switch .	-1
Between the brand name and the reviews here I bought this set . The saute and sauce pans work fine and are good looking . The frying pans - we use a gas range and can not get the heat low enough not to burn and stick . Does n't matter what we do , eggs stick and burn , sauteed peppers end up cinders , bacon sticks , and on and on . Of course I bought them to surprise my wife , and of course she had preferred to have some input . Guess who is the goat . So it goes .	-1
Its the first set of pots and pans I purchased after moving out on my own and I really wish I looked more into the negative reviews than the positive . I really do not know why these pans stain so easily ! I have only been using them for three weeks and there are stains as if I 've been using them for years . As others have said , just from boiling a pot of water , there are some spots on the bottom of the pot that just do not come off . No matter how much I scrub . I always soak the pots and pans immediately after use so it 's not like I 'm not properly caring for them.If I could do it all over again I would have spent more money and purchased a Calphalon set . I purchased a Kitchen Essentials Calphalon 5 quart Dutch Oven at Target last week to cook some soup ( since this set does not have a good medium sized pot for soups ) and I LOVE it . No stains , and it is much thicker and sturdier than these cheap pots . I also like how the Calphalon has glass lids instead of metal.. you can not see what is going on with your food ! Please do not buy this set . You will smack yourself in the face with regret once you start using it and can not return it after realizing how bad they are ... These pots look like they 're not going to last very long . Wasted my money !	-1
I am the owner of a B & B ; /Retreat in Southern California and I am also a professional chef for my boutique restaurant at the Retreat and I purchased these pans because our pans in the main cooking area were needing to be replaced . I thought QUALITY was a second name for any Cuisinart product ! WRONG ! ! This is truly a set of pans that I would advise you not to even buy for a child.I always use LOW temperature on all of our Caphalon and copper pans ... ..so I am no stranger to low temp cooking on quality cookware . However ... .even MINIMUM heat ... .the lowest heat source can be too much for these pans . I am unable to produce two sets of scrambled eggs in a row because the second set sticks in the middle ... on extremely low temp ! ! Trying to cook a small pan of popcorn for one of guests today produced burned or un-popped pop corn ... .something that has never happened with the Caphalon or the stainless pans I have used in the past.I will be returning these as quickly as I can . I do n't know what difference ... if any ... their next step up is in this line of cookware ... but I would HIGHLY ADVISE AGAINST PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT . A total waste of money and time.VERY UNHAPPY CHEF !	-1
When I received this pan it had rust spots throughout but I did n't send it back because I had already thrown the box away . This is not what I expected for a product that is supposed to last for a lifetime .	-1
I was looking for a 'taller ' 2 quart sauepan so I could use my immersion blender in the pot . From the picture , I thought this would work but it is a very shallow pan and I returned it . FYI ... buyer beware note : amazon made me pay for return shipping . this was a prime order so I thought the return would be okay but I had to pay . That was unexpected .	-1
I liked the look of these pots . I bought several 2 and 3qt pots mainly for boiling water for pasta , potatoes etc . The stainless steel used is very poor quality.After just over a month all of them have rust spots on the bottoms and where the handles meet the pot . After the first use I noticed small discolored spots on the inside bottoms , not your typical discoloration from heat , and they would not polish out with bar keepers friend . These spots are now where I see rust forming after each use . These are definitly no where near the quality of my all-clad and calphalon stainless steel cookware , but then again neither is the price.All said I would n't buy them again . Even cheap stainless steel pots and pans should n't rust with normal use . Even the free Cuisinart Santoku Knife I received is rusting and I 've only used it 3 times . I can not stress how bad the steel is ! As far as cooking goes , they work great . The aluminum core bottoms conduct the heat well . They also have a great look aside from the rusting .	-1
Too big . I wanted a large skillet to saute ' a whole chicken in ten parts . It will but you need a gas stove to have a burner or burners to heat it up . Its hard to handle , clean , and store . You need a pot rack to store this baby . Its just too much , I will never try this again , I 'm not out much money , I 'll caulk it up to & # 34 ; never again & # 34 ; .	-1
Cook an egg and it sticks ? Well , I 've spent a week trying to clean two frying pans with every possible 'fix ' I could find on the 'net . I have the full set and I do n't dare use the others . Very pretty out of the box and that 's all.I 'm furious . RUN AWAY !	-1
I bought this because I do n't use teflon or other non-stick surfaces . I thought it had a mirror finish inside , but the bottom is actually & # 34 ; ground & # 34 ; and you can see the milling ridges . No matter what I use to prevent sticking the eggs , rice or vegitable invariably stick to the bottom after sliding off the sides . It is a # @ % * $ to clean afterward too.In regards to balance ; the handle is too heavy and the pan tends to tip slightly toward the handle side . In some situations this could be dangerous . i have to keep an extra & # 34 ; ring & # 34 ; under it.Made in China ... so I should not be surprised at my disappointment .	-1
Did n't realize the pan was bent until too late to send back . Lid wo n't fit . : ( . Wish I 'd realized it sooner !	-1
Beautiful pan . Not good for use.Sold to my friend who loves this maker and she hated it too . Never again .	-1
Pots should n't stain after first use . Period . This one does . For this price and purported quality , that 's unacceptable . Enough said .	-1
I have a Dolce desk I bought at Target about 8 years ago . Needed another for our home office and was happy to find one on Amazon . This one has the same basic shape as the other , but other than that ? What a piece of junk . It 's a very deep espresso color , not the dark walnut . It 's about half an inch higher than the old one too . The drawer would be OK with me , but it is hard to slide open , and the know is nothing like the stylish one on the old desk - it 's a very tacky little flower - too cheap to stand . Also note that you need an adjustable chair if you are using this desk with a pc - the keyboard is very high on this desk , almost too high for comfort.Quality has declined substantially . The corner of my desk is a little smashed , and then stained and sealed over that . Has two chips in it too - very noticeable in this finish . I 'd send it back if it was n't so big and heavy - and frankly , that 's what I think the dealer 's strategy must be . They have to know these are garbage . For the price , I am very disappointed . I think I paid $ 20 for the original one at Target on clearance . I paid 5x as much for this one , and it 's not as nice .	-1
Terrible packaging , came all banged up and missing pieces . Pieces did n't line up correctly either and so I could n't even assemble it . Threw it out right away . One of the worst purchases I 've ever made .	-1
If you apply a good amount of pressure while grating the handle will snap , so if you buy this to add to your fabulous collection - BE GENTLE WITH IT- so it will last , same thing with the egg slicer , the wires will break unless you are gentle .	-1
I could not push this all the way down to cut into french fries.A regular apple cutter works much better because after slicing down the apple , you ca n't just push out , the whole frame comes out with the apple . Worthless appliance .	-1
This is junk . The blades tore through the plastic with the first potato I tried to slice . The apple slicer broke on the 4th apple . The blades are not sharp , and takes considerable force to get it to slice anything . The Julianne attachment would not slice a block of chedder , though I do think any attachment would be able to slice Brie , and if not that , then perhaps jello . Worst purchase I ever made with the name Kitchenaid on it .	-1
We bought this thinking that it would make food prep easier , especially french fries and salsa . It 's just not doing the trick effectively . Even my husband has a hard time getting the slicer to push down over a potato . It takes a lot of muscle and time , which is what it was meant to save . Delicate foods like tomatoes just get smashed , while hard foods are very difficult to push through .	-1
The big impressive handle is fine . However this gadget did not earn my cupboard space.However a closer look reveals dull nicked cutters that are attatched to hollow plastic holders or cutting dies.I tried making french fries . The potato just gets stuck half way through and I really pushed my weight onto it.Furthermore there is no chessboard like plastic pusher with grooves to mate with the cutter to finish pushing the potato through.Food gets into the hollow areas making cutters both fun to wash and dry.With only 1-3 grams of fat and some sodium , I 'm buying frozen fries from the grocery store . I will continue to use my tube shaped apple corer with handle .	-1
So the first thing about this is that it is too large . It also bends backward with a curve and makes it very very difficult to use on the edges of a pot . You need another tool to get ingredients from a soup from the edges of the pot . Skip this and go for something else .	-1
May shield heat a touch better than a kitchen glove . They are OK if you are going to use them on the cast iron handles for a few seconds at a time . Anything longer than that and they will get hot and so will your hands . So , unlike what a previous reviewer said , you can not leave them on while the pot is on the stove , unless you are not cooking long enough for the handles to get hot ( and in that case why even buy them ) , or if you want to get burned . The choice is yours . Hope this helps .	-1
I sent these back as soon as I got them . They are very thin and cheap . I needed a good one that I could use to keep from burning myself when taking a pot out of the oven .	-1
These are very attractive little `` mittens '' for your cast iron handles . I like how they look , but they are very thin and charred the first time I tried them.I believe they would work for cases where the pan is not on the stove , and is being used on the table to serve from . When they are used with a pan that is actively being heated , they just ca n't handle the heat .	-1
This is not the item described that I ordered . The one I ordered pictured a couple of stainless steel rods to stabilize this spatter screen . I have anther I purchased a few years ago and thought I was ordering the same screen . I had it in my `` Wish List '' and it looked the same as what I had before but during the time I added it to my list and when I actually ordered it the item changed to one that is flimsy and made in China . I could have done as well in the Dollar Store . Farberware now carries one like I wanted for just a few dollars more.I do n't recommend this one . First time I 've been letdown by Lodge ! ! I also sent an email to Lodge and received no response .	-1
I own several other pieces of Lodge cast iron and I was really shocked when this arrived . The shape and size are absolutely perfect but the interior of the pan is unbelievably rough . This is definitely going back ! I 'm really disappointed .	-1
I really wanted to love this griddle . I was really looking forward to making breakfast on it , but there were just too many annoyances to use it so I stick with a nice frying pan instead . # 1. it is SO FREAKING HEAVY . Just taking it out from the cabinet is a pain , let alone managing it when it is hot . # 2 . Not as easy to clean . With a frying pan , you can let it cool off and then run it under water , a little soap and a scrub , bada bing , you 're done . This requires special attention that neither myself nor my husband is willing to give it . # 3 . It does n't fit evenly over the burners ! You would think it could span two burners to evenly heat both sides ( or have both sides at different temps depending on what you are cooking ) -- not so much . I have lived in 3 apartments since owning this product , 2 with electric stoves and 1 with gas , and none of them have been a proper fit . It 's very disappointing , like I said - I wanted to love this product . I 'm going to stick with a quality ( All-Clad ) frying pan from now on .	-1
I 've had an iron frying pan for 30 years , and I know how to season it . It 's great , nothing sticks to it . But this grill/griddle is not working for me . Everything sticks . I 've tried oil , cooking spray , everything I can think of , ... .it does n't matter , it 's a mess . It 's bad enough to scrape and struggle with the griddle side - trying to clean the grill side is a huge ordeal . It 's one purchase I really regret.It is heavy and a decent size , so I gave it one star .	-1
how do i get this thing to stop smoking up my house ? i seasoned it yet it still smokes up the entire house .	-1
This thing rusted after the first use . It was almost as if it rusted while I was cooking on it ! I know how to season cast iron and figured I 'd just clean it up good and re-season it . However , the more I try to clean it up and get it dried off to re-season , the worse it seems to get . I ca n't seem to get the rust off of one side without the other side rusting up worse than when I started.This is unfortunate . I have many Lodge cast iron products and have had good luck with all of them . Based on my past experience with Lodge , I had no idea I could ever be this disappointed in one of their products .	-1
I have tried everything I can think of to use this grill without food sticking to it . I re-seasoned it , oiled it and used cooking spray , but nothing works and cleaning it is terrible . I am sorry I bought it and now that I have used it I can not return it .	-1
Disappointed with this griddle . It s somewhat unwiedly for an eldery person due to its weight , but the real problem is food that will not release like fried eggs and pancakes . The Lodge Logic fry pans I have work great but the griddle does n't .	-1
Its ok , I do n't love it . Its my first piece of cast iron pots . I read all about how to care for them and season them . One day a little water stayed in the pot after washing , and there was orange rust on it already the next day . I do n't like it . I season it , it seems sticky . The whole process even seems dirty , keep putting oil in it . I do n't like it . I prefer my stainless steel pots and pans . Or my calphalon pans . Not for everyone . It cooks evenly do n't get me wrong . I just do n't like how it feels either . And I would n't put it with my other pots and pans either .	-1
Product is bulky and takes up too much space . I was under the impression that the product opened cans as well as jars . I was wrong . It has already been passed to two other people who do n't want it .	-1
I purchase this jar opener to use when my husband was not around . I am small and have very small hands . This device was a disappointment because it does not fit large jars . That is all I have trouble opening ! Also , it is unsightly and bulky to store . Save your money . I have not taken it out since a few days after I purchased it .	-1
The rubber around the blade came off into my soup . It actually shredded itself into my soup . We did n't realize this into we were well into eating the soup . We ate lots of little pieces of grey rubber . This happened only the second time I used this blender . This is a defective and terrible product .	-1
This is the third one we have bought . We use it to make smoothies about four times a day . It always breaks within six months -- always something a little different . We are trying an Cuisinart next time .	-1
My mom gave me one of these several years ago . I have used it a total of maybe 10-15 times , most of these in the past year , and I was actually excited to be using it more frequently because I realized it was really a very handy tool for certain applications.Well , yesterday I was using it to aerate and blend some fudge I was making that had separated a bit when it just stopped . I thought maybe the outlet had failed and tried a different one but the blender still did n't work . It was rather warm to the touch , so I thought maybe it would start back up once it had cooled down . Nope , it 's officially dead.I am very disappointed in this product . So much promise ! It looks durable and very well made but apparently it does n't have the inner quality to match the appearance . I had thought it would be a useful addition to my KitchenAid arsenal , the newest member of which is an Architect 9-speed hand mixer , which I LOVE . Now I am a little worried that maybe that wo n't last either.I 'm posting this so that potential buyers will be forewarned . If you do buy this KitchenAid immersion hand blender , I recommend that you use it a LOT during the warranty period to make sure you do n't have one of the lemons !	-1
Rating : 5 stars for usefulness , 0 stars for support and repairability.Love this unit - incredibly useful and powerful . Do n't know how we lived without it . However , simple $ 0.25 part breaks and you have to throw it away.The plastic drive coupling failed - simple inch-long part that I was able to remove in 30 seconds . Whirlpool ( KitchenAid parent company ) does not sell repair parts for this unit . I ca n't fix it - have to throw it away.Pretty obvious that this is a likely part to fail , and the only option is to buy a whole new unit . Disgusting . If you want a long-term relationship , buy something else .	-1
I bought my KitchenAid KHB300 and loved it . Until one day after having a mild cases of food poisoning in a month I noticed the plastic disc between the blade and housing had a few food particles trapped in it . I set about trying to clean it . Try 1 : Ran the immersing head in boiling water . I was shocked at the residue that came out . Try 2 : Eventually after a lot of work popped the plastic disc & ran immersible head again very gently in more boiling water . Still had residue under loosened disc . Scrubbed with a small brush until I was satisfied with cleaning job . Try 3 : Disc would not snap back in place . Try 4 : I eventually removed the disc & was appalled at how much residue still remained.Cleaned unit added a dab of lithium grease to shaft , put it all back together & now it works wonderfully & is easy to clean . I contacted KitchenAid and they sent me an email back stating that they were sorry that I was unhappy about their product . No other comment from them.Do I love my KHB300 , yes . Is it worth buying , no . Why because I believe it is a health risk .	-1
I bought this a little over two years ago and although I used it quite sparingly rather than daily , let 's just say I was pretty much in love with the thing . I only ever used the whisk attachment a couple of times , but the blender and the chopper ? Invaluable in my kitchen for those times when nothing else will do . I used the chopper on several occasions to make Indian curry paste , whizzed up serrano and habanero peppers with garlic and ginger in the beaker to make hot sauce , and used the stick attachment right in the pan to turn cooked vegetables into soups and pasta sauces . I LOVED this thing . I still do , in fact , but a couple of weeks ago it just ceased functioning for no discernible reason . I turned it on and from what I can make out , the motor just blew . I was n't putting it through any even remotely arduous task when it happened ; far from it , I 'd immersed the end of the stick in a pan of cooked-down tomatoes etc ready to make sauce for my spaghetti , and ... ping ! No more hand blender . I am in mourning.I know it 's out of warranty , so there 's no point expecting anything from Kitchen Aid , but to say I am seriously disappointed is an understatement . Granted , this hand blender lasted much longer than the abysmally feeble Braun one I bought a few years back that kicked the bucket within weeks ( seriously ) , but when I spend this much money on an appliance from a company like Kitchen Aid and then pretty much treat it like it 's made of gold , I do NOT expect it to die on me after such a short amount of time when used quite sparingly . I would absolutely love to own another one of these , as when it works , it is worth its weight in the above-mentioned gold , but I just ca n't bring myself to spring for another one if it 's pretty much to be expected that it 'll just stop working for no good reason a couple of years later . Sigh . I got this model because ( after the bad experience with the Braun ) I did my research and came to the conclusion that the Kitchen Aid was the best one out there , so I guess I will just have to be hand-blenderless as I have no idea where to find a model that this wo n't happen with .	-1
This is the worst crock pot I have ever used ! It has been returned once because the first one cooked too hot ( just like the second one ) . You have to keep a constant eye on it because the liquid will bubble out ( due to the poor fitting lid ) because it cooks too hot ( even on the lowest setting ) . I have ruined several meals with this unit with the latest being 3 lbs of skirt steak . I have burned myself on it because the outside gets so hot as does the lid and do n't dare lift the lid while cooking because you will get a steam burn and cause more of the moisture to escape the crock pot . Buyer beware when purchasing this unit !	-1
After using this only a dozen times or so , the handle became so brittle from the excessive heat of the cooker that it disintegrated . The company says the lid and cooking pot are dishwasher safe , but I think that 's a `` crock '' also . I contacted Rival and was told that the item was out of warranty ( they go by time , not by how many uses ) . I figured that the handle could be replaced since it is attached only by a bolt through the lid . But no . Rival does not do that . You have to buy a new lid ... and the cost of a replacement lid is $ 10 plus shipping ... . that 's about half of what this model now sells for . So beware of this bargain product , because you wo n't even get what you pay for .	-1
Thanks to all who have provided feedback on this Crock-Pot slow cooker . I purchased this model about a year and a half ago to replace an old , manual slow cooker . I thought it was awesome - until I burned EVERY meal that I made in it . Up until today , I thought it was me ! I came across this model ( and these reviews ) because I am looking for a small ( 1-2 qt . ) slow cooker . I decided to check out the reviews upon seeing the poor rating . I am so very glad that I did . Crock-Pot is supposed to be the `` Kleenex '' of slow cookers , so you 'd think they 'd put out a better product ! In case anyone cares , I 've seen pretty good reviews for Hamilton-Beach and Cuisinart slow cookers .	-1
You may be one of the few lucky ones to get a unit that works as it is supposed to , or you may get one that the majority of us have received . Care to roll the dice ? I normally use these product reviews to assist me in selecting a product for purchase ( as well as other web sites such as consumer research and CNET ) . One usually has to mitigate the results or average the ratings a bit though . When a product has a goodly number of reviews you begin to see a normal distribution / bell curve of opinions . For this product , the mean is definitely in the `` low rated '' area of the continuum to which I will have to agree.The first unit I purchased smoked and emitted a burning plastic wire smell . That one was returned and I thought I would give the product another chance : Rival had a good idea in making this slow cooker programmable , ergo the 2 stars . I would have preferred more leeway in choosing my own heat , time , and temperature though . However , as mentioned in other reviews , the lid does leak steam/liquid regardless of the amount of liquid you put in which can be very messy when the unit is left unattended for a long period ( as you are supposed to be able to do ) . I have used as little as 1/2 to 3/4 cup of broth for a roast and end up having to add more several hours into the low cooking cycle or suffer a scorched crock . I have also used as much as 3 or more cups ( still plenty of distance between the liquid and the rim ) and almost had to add additional liquid because of the leakage - on low . The amount of liquid had no bearing on the leakage problem.In addition , the unit achieved a rolling boil on the low settng which seems to be just too hot for slow cooking . If you are in the market , reviews point toward the Hamilton Beach 33966 or 67 as a better engineered unit and a better buy .	-1
You ca n't leave anything on for too long or it will boil all the liquid out until the inside is a charred black mess . I do n't trust it to leave it on its own , but since I ca n't cook anything on low anyway , I guess it does n't matter . I own a Rival rice cooker that recently broke within a year of buying it . I am never going to buy a Rival product again .	-1
This crock-pot cooks to fast plain and simple ; do not leave this pot or you will come back to burnt food .	-1
Even on low this crock cooked everything too fast . And after having it for 7 months it burned itself out . I was very disappointed since I liked the size and shape . I will never buy another crock with smartpot since I bought another rival and it 's been fine without the smartpot feature . I am not sure if that 's what it was or not but I am not taking any chances !	-1
I tried using this thing a few times since I got it over 10 years ago and it has failed every time . The programmable feature is useless since it shuts itself off constantly while cooking and never has even made it to the keep warm setting . Most complaints here are about being too hot but mine never stayed hot long enough to complete the cooking process . I only use it at parties now to keep something warm by leaving it on low and turning it on again when it shuts down . Avoid this at all costs !	-1
I was given this hand blender as a gift ... It 's very handy in general to have an immersion blender to make pureed soups right from the pot vs transferring the blender . I used mine for several years 4/5+ and it just did n't hold up . The plastic part will melt if you have a very hot soup and a pot with the bottom still hot . Also , the whisk attachment is not very strong . It can whip together a light batter AFTER it 's been all mixed and incorporated , but it certainly can not cream butter and sugar , and I would n't dream of trying to whip cream with it . I just used it again the other day , and a little piece of the plastic ( which was already deformed from a past melting ) broke off into my soup . Soo , now I am off to find another immersion blender . One that lasts . Get this if you only need very light use . I used it in college as it had different attachments and I did n't have a hand mixer . It 's a very very basic entry level immersion blender , but if you actually want to puree some veggies into a nice soup , I 'd look elsewhere , because it just WO N'T last .	-1
This egg cooker did n't work properly - the buzzer sounded before 10 seconds had passed and then continued to sound about every 10 seconds after that.Needless to say , I returned it for a different brand .	-1
The only adjustment for eggs is soft or hard . So if the eggs do not come out the way you like , you need to add less water to make them softer , more to make them harder ; probably when the water is all gone , this causes the temperature of the heating element to rise and triggers the switch that activates the very loud alarm . You need normal or better vision and an eyedropper to fill the little plastic measuring cup to the correct level , or just keep spilling/filling/checking or getting your eye level with a dripping faucet . A few drops either way impact how the eggs come out.But really , this appliance failed after fewer than 10 uses ? This is beyond 'cheaply made ' , just say 'China ' . The reliability of China-made appliances is deplorable ! Returning to Amazon for refund .	-1
I bought this Cuisinart toaster oven because I 've had a Cuisinart coffee maker for years and thought that another appliance by Cuisinart would be a good product . I used this toaster oven barely four months when the top heating element shorted out , causing a sparking and gray smoke to come out of the top vents . I continued to use it , but without the two top heating elements working it 's basically useless . It 's a piece of junk , totally abysmal quality . I will continue my search for a good quality toaster oven that 's made in the USA ( if anyone reading this review has any brand suggestions I would welcome them ) , and needless to say I wasted my money on a Cuisinart toaster oven . I did n't want to rate this with any stars , but Amazon insisted on a rating , so one star it is .	-1
After reading all the reviews online , and realizing that there really is n't much selection when it comes to compact toaster ovens , I went on an purchased this locally ( at a store with a 30 day no-questions-asked return period ! ) . Initially I was pretty satisfied , though the toaster seemed to be burning everything on the top , but not heating up enough to cook things through ( i.e. , frozen garlic bread , small pizzas , etc . ) .I thought maybe it was just a problem with the thermostat , or with the tray being too close to the top heating element , so I moved the rack and tray down to the lowest setting , and bought an oven thermometer . Still , at exactly the right temperature , the tops were getting burned , and the bottoms were still semi-frozen . I tried lowering temperatures and adjusting cooking times , but I could n't even get a piece of toast to come out properly browned on both sides - one side , or part of one side , would be almost burnt , and the other side would still be soft and bready.Also , the `` dishwasher safe '' pan is totally not dishwasher safe . I washed it once on a normal cycle and all the non-stick stuff washed off , leaving me with this nasty aluminum that would n't seem to clean . So , it did n't blow up or start a fire in my kitchen or anything , but after 2 weeks I 've had more than enough . **UPDATE** I ended up purchasing a Black & Decker TRO620 from my local Target store ; I 've had it for about 5 days so far and it seems to be perfect . Great toast , bagels , cookies , etc . Perfect !	-1
Do n't buy and expect to bake in this . The top element goes on over 250o and burns food to a crisp . The bottom element is weak and does n't cook the food from below . This is not what I expected from this manufacturer . I guess broiling is the only use , I have n't tried toast yet . A terrible product.Also , after reading about this product catching on fire I might just get rid of it anyhow . Ca n't return , I purchased at linens n things closeout for just a fraction of retail .	-1
AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COST . IT IS CHEAPLY MADE AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS JUST AS BAD AS THE PRODUCT . I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AS A WEDDING GIFT A FEW MONTHS AGO AND IT DID N'T EVEN LAST 2 MONTHS AS THE BOTTOM BUTTON BROKE . NOW 1 MONTH LATER AND 2 SHIPMENTS OF THE WRONG SET OF BUTTONS LATER , I HAVE A TOASTER OVEN THAT CANT BE USED . I CALLED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND WAS HUNG UP ON TWICE BY TWO RUDE REPS THAT DID N'T WANT TO HELP ME IN REPLACING THE PRODUCT . THE THIRD REP INFORMED ME I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR SHIPPING TO RECEIVE THE NEW TOASTER OVEN AND WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP THE OLD ONE BACK . THE SHIPPING COSTS ARE NOT WORTH IT TO SEND THIS BACK AND GET A REPLACEMENT ITEM . I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH CUISINART IN THE PAST AND DID N'T WANT TO USE THIS TOASTER , BUT SINCE IT WAS A GIFT I FIGURED ID GIVE IT A SHOT . AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE TOASTER OVEN AND THE HORRIBLE , HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY OR USE ONE OF THESE CHEAP PRODUCTS FROM THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY . IF YOU PLAN TO USE THE TOASTER OVEN OFTEN AND WANT IT TO LAST , INVEST A LITTLE MORE AND GET A QUALITY ONE .

You have to watch this crock pot closely or it will start to boil your food , even on the LOW setting ! It does not slow cook , and recipes that require 6-8 hours of heat are done in under 4 hours . Not a good product if you want to be able to add your ingredients and actually leave the house . This slow cooker is a piece of junk .	-1
This is the December 6 , 2005 review I wrote for the SSC658 model : I got my Crock Pot the day after Thanksgiving for $ 30 and it came with a bonus divided insert . I was so excited because I 'd found out earlier in the week that Rival recalled the one I had been using.I must confess that I did n't read the reviews before purchase . I needed a new one , there was a sale ... how could I go wrong ? Well , you get what you pay for . I 'll start with the bad first . As almost every other reviwer has stated , this thing runs hot . I have made seafood gumbo , braised chicken and green beans . Each time I come back home to find it practically boiling on the `` keep warm '' setting . Each item was cooked on low . I contacted Rival 's customer service and they said there have been no compliants on this model ! They suggested I exchange mine at the place of purchase . Rival would take care of any problems after 90 days . I was leafing through Not Your Mother 's Slow Cooker Cookbook last night and I saw that the author did not that oval pots cook faster due to more surface area than rounds.This product does have two great features -- it 's large size and the countdown timer . I purchased a separate Smart Pot unit to convert my old pot to a Smart Pot . I was disappoined in that you had no flexibility with the time four or six hours on high or eight or 10 hours on low . The countdown timer on this model allows you to set the time on any of the three temperatures in 30-minute increments.To be fair , I have not made an actual Crock Pot recipe to test the product 's cooking time against the recipe 's time . I will try that this weekend and update my review . For $ 30 , I think I can make this work . I wish my experiences were as great as they were with earlier models .	-1
I have only had great results when using the floor tool . When I try to clean entire rooms , it looks as if nothing was cleaned . The floor tool constantly falls off the hook when using it for floors and the solution mixer says I run out of solution when it 's full , leading me to believe the solution does n't even get mixed in with the water when doing floor cleaning . The hand tool works fine and that 's all I can use it for now . Every time I shut the machine off , loads of water leaks from under the machine so I have to make sure it 's off the carpet before shutting it off . Next time I will buy the little green machine or spot lifter instead and rent the Rug Doctor when I need to clean the entire room .	-1
This is one of the biggest pieces of cheap junk that I have ever bought . I 'd rate it a 0 , but you have to give it at least 1 star . I followed the instructions too the letter . I used it 5 times in a little over a year on my living room ( 15 ' x 18 ' ) and the hall . Right after the guarantee was up it stopped spaying . I ended up having to pay to have it fixed and the repair man said , `` he gets 20 to 30 of these in every week to fix for the same thing '' . Now on the seventh time that I am using it the vacuum is going out and will not suck up the water . I 've sense know 2 other people that bought one of these and had the same problems . DO N'T waste your money on this pieces of cheap junk .	-1
I tried it on my sealed hardwood floors , as it suggests - it ruined the finish in spots . Perhaps it works on other surfaces but skip it for wood floors !	-1
You will be very annoyed every time you go to empty this thing . Really , on a bare floor a broom and a dustpan do a much better job . On household carpeting it is just OK , but there is still that emptying problem . What a mess ! I tried it on the carpet in my car , too , and it left a lot of particles because of the pickup unit being too wide . Not a good deal .	-1
I guess it sucks to some extent , but not as much as you would like , but then again it was cheap . I bought this for a mother in law that is in health care hospital type home . She it never happy with how clean her room is , and has no real space to store anything bigger . This gives her something to do , and makes her happy that she has a clean area .	-1
This vacuum has great suction . Unfortunately , the dirt/dust it sucks goes straight into the air . This thing actually set off my smoke alarms . What does n't make it into the air builds up inside the vacuum parts , not the dust bin . I have never seen such a poor performing vacuum before . The dust filter is pitiful and the dust bin does n't completely close tight , which adds to more dust in the air . The cord is also too short unless you 're planning to vacuum within 8 feet of an electrical outlet . Suction and price were better than expected but that means nothing when the dirt/dust goes into the air . Thankfully Amazon has an easy return policy .	-1
I bought a stick vacuum for two reasons ... 1 - our kitchen table is an indoor version of a picnic table with attached benches . The only way of cleaning up underneath it ( short of moving this solid oak item every night ) is to get on hands and knees and crawl under with the with the dust pan and broom . and2 - our entry way is totally flat carpet with one small sculpted style area rug ( barely a pile on this ) which naturally , is where the sand and tiny tiny pebbles are . My big upright just spits the sand and small pebbles out the back so I to use the hose only which is quite time consuming . I was looking for a way make these jobs easier.This one did n't work for me . Maybe I got a bad one from WalMart ? I tried , I really did , thinking it was just me . But it was barely adequate . It did suck up the small crumbs off the top of the tile , but did not have enough suction to get the crumbs out that were between the spaces between my tiles ( old tiles , old shifting house , rented , that 's why I 'm not replacing the kitchen floor ) . Once again , thinking it must be me , I checked to see if the crumbs were stuck . I really was n't expecting miracles . But nope , not stuck . Just not enough suction.There was some sand on the floor which it totally ignored . I had to go over each space a couple of times for this sand to get sucked up . This baffled me.I know one other poster said things like dog food got pushed around . I have to say things even smaller than that got pushed around rather than sucked up . It was pushing crumbs much smaller than a popcorn kernel . The floor nozzle is just too close to the floor.Then I tried it on the entry way ( I really figured it was me , the reviews were so good on this ) . It did a fair job on the flat carpeting , but again , it took alot of going over . I did n't save all that much time versus using the hose on my 12 amp big vacuum . The area rug is dark green and I could see the stuff on it . This machine did a terrible job . Picked up next to nothing.Edge cleaning with the floor nozzle on was a joke . I know it 's not going to get the stuff in the crevice , but it did n't touch a thing that was an inch or less from the wall . At this point I did n't even bother trying the crevice tool which I am sure would have worked.Emptying the dust cup is an absolute nightmare . The flter is right there and collected almost as much as the dust cup . I accidently hit it and had another two messes to clean up , the pile on the floor and the vacuum . In my other vacuum the filter is situated so that this kind of accident does n't happen.Possibly I am expecting too much from a $ 20.00 machine ( 19.88 at Walmart ) . Is it just that I got it at Walmart ? It is the same exact model number , but on the other hand , it would n't be the first time I wondered if Walmart sells refurbished or `` seconds '' ( items that do n't meet the manufacturer 's first quality standards ) .As luck would have it I found a Eureaka Boss Superlite ( it 's a model 411 which I believe is the same as Amazon 's model 410 ) in the paper when I came home from returning this . I spent $ 20.00 on it and am thrilled . It is a bit bigger machine , but I tried it out tonite and was quite pleased at how it accomplished what I needed a small vacuum to do . I 'll review it after I try it out more in the next day or two.So , while this may be right for some , if you are looking for a smaller vacuum for the same reasons I was , I think I would keep looking . If it is a case of me expecting miracles from this machine then I am sure the next reviewers will let you know !	-1
I guess I should n't have expected much for the price I paid . Thank goodness I did n't pay more . I 've seen this vacuum advertised for almost $ 40 . That said , I did expect it to pick up a little drywall dust that fell on our newly tiled bathroom floor when we installed the towel rod . It did n't do it . In the laundry room , I used it to clean up some cat litter , but even that was n't so easy . There just is n't enough power to do an efficient job . The only value it has to me is that I do n't have to drag out the Dyson all the time and it will convert to a handvac . If I had to do it all over again , I 'd invest my money in something better .	-1
I saw all of the positive reviews : They are WRONG . The fan is miniscule , the filter modest , and the efficacy is almost nil.I saw absolutely no improvement in air quality . Further , I have had six other makes ... .all were superior to this.Also , they do not make it clear that this does absolutely nothing for odors , since there is no carbon element .	-1
WARNING : Product being delivered is not the one pictured on this page ! ! Product being delivered is a cheap generic filter , not 3M Filtrete .	-1
I bought the air filter for my smoking , to clean the air.I figured it would at least last 2 months . But it only lasts for about a month and at $ 12.00 a piece , it gets expensive to keep replacing the filters.These are smaller , maybe 4X4 filters and I think they are over priced especially since they do n't last longer.They should be priced lower but I suppose they were made for non smokers .	-1
BEWARE - Allergy be Gone - sold wrong size filter than description then assured would send RMA by email and never did.NOT CORRECT PRODUCTNON-RESPONSIVE CUSTOMER SERVICETOTAL RIP OFF !	-1
I recently bought the Silpat from a local grocery store because I 've read good things about it . I used it twice and both times my cookies lifted up from the pan with no problem . My problem with this product is that it is very slippery and makes it hard to rinse off after washing . I like the whole idea of it , but it was n't for me .	-1
I have been extremely disappointed in mine . They were fairly expensive , and when baking cookies , the same dough cooked on parchment paper had much better results . They did n't spread out as much and had a better texture with the parchment paper .	-1
While theDeMarle 2406 Silpat 11-3/4-by-8-1/4-Inch Nonstick Silicone Baking Matis indeed non-stick , I prefer using parchment paper instead . My ultimate test was baking sugar and butter cookies on both surfaces . I used natural aluminum baking sheets ( not non-stick ) - which I have found to provide the best even baking . On the parchment-lined sheet , the cookies baked perfectly ( light golden brown on the bottom and cooked through ) . On the Silpat-lined sheet , the cookies were pale on the bottom and were over-baked by the time I was able to get light golden brown bottoms on them . Another bonus of parchment over the Silpat mats ( unless you have a few of them ) is that when you are baking in large quantities ( holiday , etc . ) , you can have your cookie dough set up on parchment , ready to bake . Just slide the baked cookies onto the cooling rack and the others right onto the pan and into the oven in one shot - no waiting ! You can save on the cost of parchment paper by buying it in bulk like they sell it here or at your local warehouse store . It is also reusable a few times during one baking session .	-1
Do n't exceed 300-350deg or you will get plumes of smoke that will burn your eyes and throat.Or use it as a fog machine - seriously there is that much smoke !	-1
This mat is a tiny mat . I 'm not sure what I 'd ever bake on it . It wo n't fit anything but a pan for a toaster oven ( which I happen to have so I 'm keeping it because its more expensive to send back ) . Though I have these in bigger sizes - and love them - and have even sent them as gifts - in the larger size , I could have purchased larger ones for better prices , I got caught on the & # 34 ; its only on sale for the next three hour & # 34 ; thing.Good marketing Amazon , lousy deal for your customer .	-1
i got this couple of months ago together with a matching size , classic , nordic ware , baker 's half sheet pan . i didnt need them immediately so i washed and dried both overnight and having read some of the reviewers recommending putting the mat in the pan for storage , proceeded to do exactly that all the while congratulating myself for my foresight in buying them before the holidays when i do the most baking . fast forward to yesterday - i took them out to do some baking and attempted to remove the mat only to find it stuck on several places to she sheet . i tried running some water over to gently separate the mat and pan but no luck . after very carefully peeling the mat off i found small balls of silicone ( or whatever the mat is made of ) stuck to the pan and matching pits on the mat : ( the silicone pieces that are stuck to the pan can not be removed - i tried washing , lightly scrubbing , not so lightly scrubbing , bar keepers friend , rubbing alcohol , fingernails ... so disappointed . now i have to throw out both the & # 34 ; guilty & # 34 ; mat and the & # 34 ; innocent & # 34 ; pan without even having used either ! what a waste of money .	-1
It 's an odd size . Does n't quite fit well on any pan and makes for wasted space .	-1
After watching a friend bake flawless cookies on his Silpat , I ordered one for myself . The very first time I used it I put it in the ( countertop electric ) oven at ~350-400F , it outgassed like crazy . The oven was SMOKING . The entire room smelled like chemicals . I threw it out .	-1
I gave a friend one , and she bakes cookies for the volunteers at the local animal shelter where I volunteer . And she said it took a lot longer to bake chocolate chip cookies than it did with a regular metal pan . Oh , did I mention to please adopt a pet if you are considering one ? : ) Today we had a mega adoption even where several agencies had adoptable pets and 325 pets were adopted today , and there 's still tomorrow . : )	-1
I purchased a silpat .. I pre-heated it to 350 and within a few minutes the silpat caught on fire . what a mess ! ! white/grey powder , smoke and flames . there is a white film all over my apartment and throughout my oven . i hate to think of what i breathed in , glass and silicone . I DO N'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE PRODUCT BECAUSE I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO USE IT BUT WOULD N'T BUY IT AGAIN . I 'M WRITING THIS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT OR WANT TO PURCHASE IT . BE CAREFUL IF YOU USE IT . I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD CATCH ON FIRE . IF YOU ARE BAKING , PLEASE DO N'T LEAVE IT UNATTENDED . I 'M LUCKY I WAS IN THE KITCHEN , AND IT HAPPENED WITHIN MINUTES OF TURNING ON THE OVEN . there should be better marked cautions on it because i do n't know why it happened . Maybe it is great for baking , but please be careful .	-1
Before I bought this , I used to use a regular spoon . I would leave rock hard ice cream on the counter to soften . More often than not , I would forget about it , and would return to an inedible soupy mess . This scoop can go right through rock hard ice cream , without much effort . Do n't want to know what the special chemical coating is , cause it sure works well . No rusty springs , no malfunctioning parts.POST SCRIPT 2011 - It is year three , and flakes of the special coating on the spoon part are coming off . It is scary . I am buying a different brand . Never again . I expected lifetime use . Was I naive .	-1
Had two . Current one just like the first one is seriously corroded . Scoop surface appears to be chrome but not . If it is aluminum the anodizing breaks down . A different brand that was aluminum had the same problem . My guess is anodized aluminum not suitable.Generally Zyliss makes quality kitchen tools . This has serious flaw . Wrote them and they offered a new one free if I sent the old one in . Not worth the time and cost . The corrosion is serious over time . Maybe a teflon coating ? Fourcents	-1
I used this item only a dozen times before a small piece broke off the inner surface of the scoop , revealing a darker rough surface beneath ( about 1 mm ) . I continued to use the scoop , and after another dozen uses ( very few ! ) further tiny holes began appearing on the inner ( convex ) curve of the scoop . I never used this scoop for anything unusual -- just good old fashioned ice cream . Admittedly , this was over the course of 2 years or so ; I 'm not a huge ice cream eater.This corrosion revealed that the surface ( which looked like a strong metal ) was just a spray-on thickness , a bit like chrome , except matte finish.Before I saw this corrosion , I loved the scoop ; the heft of it , the heat capacity ( ability to retain its temperature i.e . does n't freeze up ) , the comfort of the handle were exceptional , and I would have given it a 5 star rating.I 'd suggest most positive ratings you 'll see for this scoop were from people who rated it on initial feel and utility , but did n't use it long enough or give it time to corrode.I 'd suggest to anyone wishing to buy this ice cream scoop , `` move along , move along . ''	-1
I am still waiting to use this pizza cutter . Why am I writing a review now ? Because I want you to know how poorly this is packaged . There is a round sticker around the entire blade , and it does not come off easily . The blade does come out of the handle for cleaning . That has not helped me to get this sticker off . They must have used the strongest glue they could find to attach the sticker . The sticker does not peal off . Instead it tears , and comes off in tiny bits . I picked at it for over half an hour . I gave up for a while , and put the blade in the dishwasher . I hoped the hot water and steam would loosen the label . It did not . There is still glue and bits of paper that I am still picking off . Although the blade is not 'razor sharp ' , I have to work carefully so I do n't cut myself . So far this product has been a big disappointment . If I can ever get it clean enough to use , I 'll write another review .	-1
I sent them back & got a refund , they were too big for a toaster oven . I guess I did n't read the measurements right or the description , oops !	-1
Would like to remove the one star review . This pan is a fire hazard . Grease and fat do not drip into the under pan and can ignite . The grease splatters all over the inside of the oven . Do not buy this pan !	-1
I had one of these for years . It is the perfect size for fish , asparagus , and many other dishes for the microwave . Then I managed to break it , so I ordered another one in March of this year . Like a couple of others , my new one developed a crack and broke after only a couple of uses . I 'll try another brand the next time .	-1
I bought this pan in September of 2010 , and I 've been happy with its performance since then . However , I took it out to use it today , and I noticed that there are holes in the side . I 've taken care of it according to the directions , so I was surprised to see that it had those holes in it . It also has dark stains in it from cooking baked pasta in the pan ( at 350 F - no crazy high temperatures or anything ) . Since that did n't affect its performance , it was n't really an issue for me , but since I 'm reviewing the pan , I figured that I would note it . Overall , for the price , I would certainly expect to get more than a year and a half 's worth of use out of it , and I 'm sure I could go through a return or warranty process , but it 's still disappointing to have to do that .	-1
After serving the family for 20 years , we needed to replace our two battered covered 13X9 pans . Tried this one and within 3 uses , it was pitted and developed at least 1 pin hole . Just cooked our usual stuff - bought another brand to replace this one and so far so good with the different brand .	-1
I wanted a lid to fit myFagor Futuro 10-quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerso that I could use the pan as a stock pot . I searched and searched and decided to try this one . It fits my pressure cooker perfectly . Why the 1-star ? While my pressure cooker was manufactured in Spain and is exceptionally well made , this lid is manufactured in China out of cheap fragile materials.The lid was not damaged in shipping . The lid was intact when I removed it from the packaging . I picked the lid up by the knob and the knob wobbled . It was loose . I placed my hand underneath the lid and held the screw in place and attempted to finger tighten the knob ( I 've done this many times with various lids ) . The knob snapped off where the base of the knob sits on top of the glass . I barely applied pressure . Part of the plastic remained attached to the lid and the larger part that you would hold the lid by is the part that broke off.I 've ordered a couple of plastic replacement knobs . Hopefully one will fit ; if not , I will have to send the lid back .	-1
not sure what i am doing wrong , but expected world class pie and my pie came out soggy . IMHO this plate holds no magical properties	-1
June 25 , 2007 I at first LOVED this machine.I couldnt say enought about it.However within a year it started to dissintegrate before my eyes.The first part to go was the vaccuum head . It would work then not . Now its to the point i must unplug the unit to turn it off . Next came the release mechanism to use the pipe without the vaccuum head , the plastic release snapped off .. I am 40 not 4 and pamper my belongings . This unit was disappointing and now I need to purchase a new machine ... .	-1
I bought this vacuum for the first time over a year ago . I like the way it handled and it was fairly good at picking up dirt , but it died just under a year . I chalked it up to the fact that I have four cats . So , I bought another of the exact same model . This time it died within just two months . I took it into the Hoover suggested shop for repair , got it home and realized that it was still broken . Since I do n't feel like driving across town again twice in the hopes that it will actually be repaired , I 've decided to toss it and buy a different brand . What a waste of time and money !	-1
AT first use I loved this hoover easy to pick up and do stairs etc and picked up dust etc wonderfully . Then after a short while I found it didn't.I think the problem is the filter which is supposed to be washable . But it gets clogged up after one room and running it under the tap ( what you are supposed to do ) does n't cut it . I scrub it ( even in amongst the pleats and leave it to dry which takes a long time and when it is dry you can still see its not clean ) . When I put it back in , the light flashes that the canister needs emptied ( it does n't ) and it just does n't pick up and you can smell more dust after hoovering than before ! ( obviously once the dust gets to the filter it returns to the floor . ) The canister needs emptying after each room . And is very dusty when emptying ! Also after changing attachments I found when going back to the original one that it was 'loose ' and would only work when vacuuming backwards.I had an upright hoover bagged windtunnel before which I loved and only got this one as I thought I could save money on bags . But now it has cost me as I now have to go any buy another vacuum !	-1
If there was an option to choose 0 stars on this one I would . From day one , we saw problems with this vacuum.We have been servicing and selling vacuums for 35 + years . The first time I saw this vacuum in for service , a very nice woman brought us the vacuum in 4-5 pieces.I thought the vacuum had just made it back from Iraq ! I asked her what happened , and she told me that she had accidentally dropped the machine down the stairs while vacuuming her stairs.The main housing on this vacuum was so brittle , it broke multiple times , in multiple places . I asked her how long she had had the vacuum , and she told me a little over 1 year . This was out of the warranty period for the vacuum , and we had to charge her . The total repair was $ 120 . The main housing itself sold for $ 74.99 ! In my years of servicing vacuums , I have never seen such cheap , cheap plastic . You literally can break the plastic by squeezing the housing in your hands ! I would by lying if I said that was the only time we have seen this problem . I would say that in the two years this vacuum has been out there , we have serviced 15-20 units . The plastic is not the only problem though.The electric hose , has all the controls on the handle of the machine . Very convienent , however VERY problematic . We have replaced several of these hoses because of short circuits.The main problem we are having right now is , the main HEPA Filter : Hoover WindTunnel Bagless Canister Filter # 59134033 , is not available from Hoover . We have currently 30-40 of these on back order from JUNE ! This is the main filter for the vacuum , without replacing this filter , the motor will surely fail . Check around and see for yourself , this filter is NOT AVAILABLE PERIOD ! I expect to be replacing motors on this unit on a mass scale in the coming months . PLEASE , PLEASE stay away from this Hoover WindTunnel . You will be sorry.Hoover has sold their company 3 times in the last 4 years . The first sale was to Whirpool . Whirpool then sold out to Maytag . Maytag sold the Hoover company again in March to TTI Floorcare , the parent company of Dirt Devil , and Royal Vacuums . It is unfortunate to see such a good brand name at one point , fall like Hoover has .	-1
This is without a doubt the worst vacuum I 've ever owned . Cumbersome , not particularly powerful and unreliable . The power head was intermittently cutting out until it recently stopped working altogether , and oftentimes it would cause the vacuum to shut off completely . There are better choices and I recommend you take a pass on this horribly designed unit.What 's most disturbing is a previous review I left ( which I was going to amend to state the power head failed ) was deleted . I do n't know why or by whom , but its disturbing to think a consumer 's unbiased opinion could be erased . It makes me very suspicious of the review/rating process - especially with all the five start reviews left by people who have reviewed no other product but this .	-1
I have owned this machine for 3 years now and it has awesome suction . Even though it is cumbersome to navigate , I loved it for the suction . 3 years into it , and the suction was gone from the power nozzle . We realized that the belt had gone loose so we purchased new belts which worked great for 2 days . Now the belt keeps popping off , and its a pain to open the whole thing ( screws and all ) to pop it back on . I have n't heard back from Hoover after emailing them a few months ago so I guess I 'm going to have to buy a new vacuum after paying $ 250+ for this one.4/27 : I am updating this review and giving it one star instead of 2 because of Hoover 's customer service . I have tried email customer support but so far have gotten recommendations about which other hoover product to buy . I could n't believe it . Like i will ever buy another Hoover product after this fiasco . As of now , I am still emailing them , so will change review if they actually stand behind their product	-1
Bought this vacuum and was very impressed by it . Suction was super strong , motor was n't too loud , and the turbo hand tool was a plus for the stairs . However , only lasted about 2 years until the powerhead stopped working . Brought it to a Hoover store near me and powerhead would have to be replaced , at the same cost I paid for the whole vacuum ! I said to the guy `` well why would n't I just buy a whole new vacuum then ? '' and his response was `` I would n't recommend that one . They have a lot of electrical issues . '' This coming from a guy at a Hoover owned store . His answer sums it up perfectly . Buy something else .	-1
I bought this vacuum before I realized how easy it is to return things through Amazon . It never worked well , It was difficult to use and had poor suction . I finally gave it to a thrift store . I have since purchased a better Hoover , not bagless , twice the price , but it works great . You get what you pay for ! !	-1
I purchased this Hoover 10 months ago after reading many reviews , including Consumer Reports . In spite of reviews suggesting that the belt is a bit finicky , I purchased it confidently knowing that the machine could be sent to a factory service center within a year of purchase for repair or replacement . Hoover 's policy always has been that if a customer shipped one way , the company would pay for return shipping.I purchased it at Amazon for $ 190 shipped and was pleasantly satisfied ... until the belt began slipping after less than a month of use . It was replaced , and it slipped again . It was replaced , and it slipped again . Since the original purchase , I have replaced the belt at least once a month.Still in warranty , I contact Hoover about shipping my machine to a Factory Service Center for repair or replacement . I was told that they were in the process of closing their Factory Service Centers , and all would be closed -- if they were n't already -- by 12/31/08.I now own a $ 200 doorstop . I imagine that I will continue to replace the belt monthly or more for a while . But I will never purchase another Hoover product again.Look for this one at a rummage sale near you .	-1
The tool cover broke with first usage . The carpet attachment wo n't stay on . Good thing we needed it mostly for hardwood floors ... .	-1
This Bissell Spotlifter Powerbrush is advertised as an all-in-one system that sprays , scrubs and vacuums in one easy step . I had expected this to be a compact and smaller capacity version of Bissell 's full-sized Spotbot ( which is quite a nice machine by the way ) but sadly it is not.First of all , let 's address the spray system . While it does spray , it takes quite a number of sprays ( let 's call this heavy mist ) to saturate the stain area for effective scrubbing to be done by the brushes . Once the brushes get at the scrubbing and the cleaning solution dissolves the stains , this little unit is then supposed to vacuum it all up . While it does have enough suction to vacuum a couple of sprays ( aka heavy mist ) , it does not have enough suction to vacuum the amount of liquid that needs to be put on the stain in order to remove it . This futile attempt at suction is as if one tried to vacuum a glass of wine out of the carpet with a dust bunny handheld vacuum . One would have more luck with a silly straw in this aspect.The cumulative problem of holding this otherwise compact machine over a stain repeatedly misting it until properly saturated , waiting for the scrubbing action to do its thing and then for the insufficient suction to not work , is that the machine feels heavier and heavier to hold.The design solution to these drawbacks would simply be an adjustable spray output ( even a Windex bottle has one ) and increased suction power . The Bissell branded chemical cleaning solution and the scubbing brushes seem to do their job well enough.Usually when a pre-existing product is offered up for review in the Amazon Vine program , it means that the product has either been improved or re-marketed to a different segment ( pets for example ) . However , after doing some research , this product does not seem to have been re-marketed to a different segment nor has any of the pre-existing problems with weak spray and insufficient suction been addressed . However , I do not have nor received the original machine to compare this current machine to to determine if the spray or suction has improved over the older models from reviews a few months prior . If this machine `` is '' an improvement , my judgement is that it is still insufficient.For those that need a spot lifter , I do not recommend this particular machine . If Bissell 's full-sized Spotbot is in your price range , that machine delivers what this one does not . The Bissell cleaning chemicals are the same ( and are quite effective ) and it has an even better scrubbing system and lightweight handle.This machine was tested on a few pieces of cream-coloured carpet remnant with red wine stains , mud stains and pizza stains .	-1
Bought this device when our cat was sick and we had lots of clean up to do . This was no help at all because it did n't work . First of all the sprayer for the solution did n't work at all . We were desperate so we sprayed the area with a hand sprayer and tried to clean it with this machine . It was a total waste and we returned it the next day . Replaced it with Bissell 's Little Green spot cleaner ( see my review ) . It cost twice as much but saved my sanity and my kitty 's life .	-1
At first this machine worked great . It sucked up liquids and dirt , the water sprayer is powerful and has a wide range , and it was very easy to use . However , I 've had it for about 3 years now and it is filthy ! The bottom collection tank does not come clean . There are so many little grooves and due to the way it 's designed it never completely empties . The result is that now whenever I use it , an incredible stench ( akin to a rotting animal ) radiates from the machine . This is after I 've tried to clean the container with bleach even . Also , while the front bristles do come out for easy cleaning , the actual suction area does not and is now clogged with nasty dirt and pet hair . The cord is very long , which is a big plus , and it holds a decent amount of water for a lot of cleaning before the bottom has to be emptied . However , due to the stench and how dirty it is and that I am not able to clean it , it is now going in the garbage and I am buying a different brand .	-1
This does n't work very well , the battery does n't stay charged long enough to finish the job . I am throwing it away because the only thing it is really good for is taking up my precious space .	-1
these pads do not pass water/steam very well . Neither do they clean well . after a couple of uses , the water kinda puddles up and passes through unabated.when washing , I 've tried every type of cleaner , and air drying to machine drying.. they turn out heavy and scratchy .	-1
The vacuum really is noisy . I wear ear plugs when I use it because it is so loud and the noise actually gets painful in narrow halls . I refuse to use it when my dog is in the house and eventually I will have to get a quieter vacuum . For now , though , I like that the vacuum is lightweight , easy to maneuver and picks up the dog hairs and the daily debris .	-1
I was looking for a small and efficient vacuum for our 1500 SF townhouse with hardwood floors . This vacuum , which I purchased from Target in store , sucks . Actually , it does the opposite . Instead of picking things up , it blows them around . It does pick up SOME stuff , but chasing the little pieces is fruitless , and I just end up using a broom . I paid $ 40 for this and am returning it 3 days after I bought it . Additionally , this is the loudest vacuum I 've ever heard-including shop vacs . Put your money towards a better quality vacuum-not dirt devil . I 'm buying a Hoover Flair with Power Nozzle as this vacuum 's replacement , as it has very positive reviews on Amazon . It 's worth an extra $ 20 . DO NOT BUY this vacuum ... unless you like your money going down the drain . : )	-1
The reviewers that mention the noise are dead-on , this is the loudest vacuum I have used . The noise is not the reason for the low review , it is simply awkward to use . I was looking to replace an old electric broom for use on hard surfaces and stairs and the power stick is not a good choice . It picks up fairly well when the dirt is in its path but blows a lot around and is difficult to get into small spaces or against walls . I did not see any options in this class of vacuum with edge-cleaning but the lack of a swivel feature makes cleaning with this model harder than I expected . I have replaced this with a Hoover `` Flair '' and found it serves my purposes much better than the Power Stick .	-1
I have had this hand vac for less than 6 months and the beater brush has stopped working . As with many bagless vacs , it looses suction quickly and emptying the canister is a dusty messy process . My favorite thing is when you pop-off the canister to take it out to empty and the lid flies off , spilling out all the dust that you just vacuumed up.I wish I had n't bought this vacuum . It worked ok in the first month but went downhill quickly after that .	-1
Buy the Classic Dirt Devil - not this one . The brush is air driven and stops whenever it comes in contact with a carpet etc . Basically a useless vac .	-1
When you first get the BrewStation it works great . It 's really convenient . I bought one for my Mom last Christmas ( 2005 ) and she loved it . One day I walked into the kitchen and noticed coffee all over the counter around the BrewStation . I whiped it up and did n't give it another thought . But the next day I went back and there was coffee all over the counter again . It was then I noticed that the spout had developed a leak . My Mom said she had n't a clue what was wrong with it , so we cleaned it and sit it on the dining room table for about 2 months unused . Yesterday , I went back to it and figured it was probably the gasket around the spout . I found the replacement gasket that came with it and replaced it . I then cleaned it off and placed it back on the counter and filled it with water . I ran it with just plain water to see if it would leak and at first it did n't . Then after it got up to about 6 cups it began dripping again . Bummer ... So I left it sitting there and put a paper towl under it and when I went back about 20 minutes later the paper towel was soaked.The bottom line is the BrewStation my be convenient and have great features , but you would be better buying a $ 10 traditional coffee maker at your local Dollar Store..	-1
All the ads made this sound really good , so I bought one early on . However , it made horrible coffee -- - I tried using different amounts of grounds but it made no difference the coffee did not taste good . It tasted like instant coffee that you used to get at BK . My guests did not like the quality of the coffee either so after a couple of weeks I gave the coffee maker to Goodwill .	-1
I 'll be replacing mine after six years of trouble-free operation . Ca n't ask for more than that . Unbelieveably easy to clean & convenient to use . I discovered a trick to getting the coffee to come out hotter : First , run a batch of water through the machine . That gets everything hot before the coffee brews . Also , have hot water sitting in your coffee cup while brewing.UPDATE 9-23-12 : TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE . The coffeemaker started pausing when I would turn it on . Then it completely stopped pumping the water . So it worked for one year . I do n't know who 's making them now , but the quality is n't there any more ( like so many products today ) . I contacted Hamilton Beach & they `` offered '' to sell me another one at a small discount & with their ridiculous shipping costs added , it would cost MORE than a store 's price . I said , `` No thanks . '' For the way it worked for one year - 5 stars . For durability & customer service , I 'm being rather generous taking off three stars .	-1
I , like many other reviewers of this product , also own one of the Mr. Coffee iced tea makers . I was pretty happy with that tea maker except that it would sometimes leak all over the counter during the brewing process . I found that if I pressed the pitcher up to the brewing tower firmly and made sure there was no `` wiggle room '' between the two pieces , that there was on leakage . I found myself watching the beginning stages of the brewing process to make sure that all liquids were getting into the pitcher and not on my counter . Once I verified that all was in good order , I would walk away and everything would , in fact , be fine . But I wanted an iced tea maker that did n't require me to babysit it , so I tried the Hamilton Beach 2-quart . I am in the process of returning it.It works just fine in that it does n't leak and I do n't have to babysit it . However , I have to use 7 standard sized tea bags for this 2-quart machine and I was able to use only 6 tea bags for my 3-quart Mr. Coffee ... and even then , the tea did n't have the same quality to it . We also tested the brew strength dial and found no noticeable change in the actual brew strength.So I 'm back to using my Mr. Coffee and simply babysitting it for the first moments of brewing.One thing I did like about the Hamilton Beach was that it had a built in filter so you did n't have to use coffee filters.Also , one thing I did n't realize until I got the Hamilton Beach model and read through the manual is that this is only a 2-quart maker ... it even says not to attempt to make more or even LESS tea . So if , for whatever reason , you only want to make 1 quart , the Hamilton Beach model advises against this entirely saying that it was designed for exactly 2 quarts , no more and no less . The Mr. Coffee model allows you to choose between 1 , 2 , and 3 quarts . I like this .	-1
Overall , this ice tea maker serves its purpose . It 's easy to use , and fairly quick to brew . It fits well in the fridge door , and has a pretty good capacity.However , there are a few issues:1 ) It 's not exactly ready to drink ice tea in under 10 minutes . Be prepared with A LOT of ice ; at least three ice cube trays of them . I only have room for two ice cube trays ( and they are large ice cube trays ) in my freezer , and they are n't enough to fill the pitcher to the `` Max Fill Line '' ( which apparently is more of a requirement rather than a suggested max ) . While this does n't hinder its ability to brew tea , it does hinder you from drinking the tea right away , as it 's still quite warm due to the lack of ice . This wo n't be a problem for those who have ice cube dispensers built-into their refrigerators or more ice cube trays , but for those who may not have enough ice readily available , you 'll be forced to let the pitcher cool in the fridge for a few hours before drinking it . With this being my case , I am in no different a position than before , just brewing tea in the kettle , cooling it with ice in my own pitcher , and then letting it cool in the fridge.2 ) It 's not dishwasher safe . A lot of the components have to be washed by hands . This is clearly listed in the product description , but it still would have been nice if I could put it in the dishwasher . Especially because after making a pitcher , the filter assembly gets quite dirty and needs to be cleaned well ... especially if you like variety in your ice tea and often use different kinds of tea for each new pitcher brewed.3 ) Now , even with those first two compromises , I still probably would have given this unit at least three stars . The lack of ice probably is n't a problem for most , and washing by hand is annoying but still is n't a deal breaker . However , the reason why I gave it only one star , is that upon receiving and inspecting the ice tea maker when I got it , a piece of the plastic hinge for the lid snapped and broke quite easily . There could n't have been more than a slight amount of pressure on it ; and it just snapped off . Maybe I just got a unit with a manufacturing defect , but I was a bit surprised to see it break so easily . Because the broken lid does n't really hinder the tea brewing process , I 'm not going to bother with a return ( hah ... and that I had already made the mistake of throwing the box out . With all the good reviews , I really was n't expecting to need to return this ) . While the lid is n't so important , it makes me question the durability of the rest of the unit.Additional Notes : About 11 months into the 12 month warranty , the entire plastic pitcher broke . The pieces were all over the place , and a quite sharp , so I threw out the shards of plastic and contacted Hamilton Beach for the warranty . After giving them a serial number from the base of the tower , they told me that I needed a number off the pitcher itself and would not honor the warranty . Fast forward a few months ... we were getting antsy for ice tea so I ended up buying this unit again . While I had a bad experience with this model , I figured maybe I just got a bad unit ( since the reviews for this ice tea maker are overwhelmingly good ) ; what I found when I received my new ice tea maker , is that there is no serial number on the pitcher itself . So unless they remodeled the unit within the last year , Hamilton Beach essentially weaseled their way out of honoring their warranty . Even though my new unit seems to be working OK and did n't break immediately like my first one , I 'm glad I gave them one star in my initial review .	-1
I drink a lot of iced tea and used this every day . You pour in the water , put the tea ( loose or bags ) in the filter tray . Turn on and forget.HOWEVER it began leaking water after a little more than 6 months of use . I ca n't see where it 's leaking from . It makes a real mess every time . I thought I 'd have to buy a new one BUT I read in one of these reviews that a regular ( cheap ) electric coffee maker does a fine job . You probably have one around . I use my old Braun , which uses Melita filters . I use the same amount of tea leaves I did in the Hamilton . It makes 10 cups , which I pour into a 2 quart pitcher and add extra water to fill the pitcher to the top . I usually let the tea cool to room temperature and then I pour the tea over ice ( or into a pitcher of ice ) and have exactly what this leaky Hamilton product produces . After A-B testing of the two devices I conclude there is no difference in the tea produced.Most of these iced tea makers have negative comments that after about a year they start leaking . I 've never heard of an electric coffee pot leaking . And you can always wash out the coffee maker and make coffee in it , too . One less kitchen appliance .	-1
The unit would probably work fine for someone who had plenty of counter space , but I found it very akward to use on my counter . I also have very hard water with a lot of minerals in it which made the tea cloudy . The plastic lid stained every time I used it also . After making tea the third time the machine no longer heated the water at all . I found the cold brewed tea much clearer and tastier , so I returned the machine for a refund . If I am going to make cold brew tea , I would n't need a machine that 's supposed to heat the water to do it .	-1
This thing was a PITA . Not only does it take-up valuable counter space , the button was hard to push and there was water under the pitcher when I lifted it . It was a pain to clean the tea compartment . You 'll need a strong wrist to lift the heavy awkward pitcher from the fridge , and the spout does n't close so you 'd best be careful how you do it or you will spill tea.The next time I 'm tempted to waste my money on something like this , I 'll remember my mantra : `` But I already have a stove ! '' I guess for people without stoves or saucepans this would be nice but of course those people probably do n't have refrigerators or ice either.This thing has `` Garage Sale '' written all over it .	-1
I had several Mr Coffee automatic iced tea makers over the years but was disappointed that the seams on the pitchers eventually leak , so when the last one went I purchased the Hamilton Beach iced tea maker.Both brands make terrific iced tea . The Hamilton Beach pitcher is still going strong after two years , however it is quite heavy when full and the narrow shape gives it a different center of gravity than the round Mr Coffee pitcher . I is difficult to handle with my arthritic hands . Also , every time anyone pours tea from it some spills on the table or counter . When the pitcher is full , there are tea spills going in and out of the refrigerator.I just purchased a new Mr Coffee iced tea maker andHamilton Beach 40911 2-Quart Electric Iced Tea Makerextra pitchers .	-1
This is not a good bakeware pan . The first time I used it when checking my baked goods saw that the pan had warped and tilt on one side . I replaced this one with one that did the same thing and was hoping this one would not do the same but it did . Not a good product and to much hassle to box up and pay to send back . It is a donated item if someone wants a warped pan..	-1
I bought 2 pans . They were great at start . All muffins came off easily and neatly . I had thought they were the best muffin pans in the world . But soon , after 5-10 times uses , they became very sticky , and completely different from what they were . I had been using warm/hot water and dish detergent and hand washing them , and never used nonsticky spray on them as instructed , so I could n't figure out what was the problem . No scratches , and there may be a very thin layer of grease . Was this the problem ? I wonder whether the other buyers had the same issues after using them a few times .	-1
These silicon Orka oven mitts are better than your traditional fabric-based oven mitt . However , I have felt uncomfortable heat upon contact with oven-temperature metal for more than 2 seconds . This mitt is by no means impervious to oven-temperature heat . I also think that `` glove '' style hot-hands with fingers are much better than `` mitten '' style hot-hands as they allow one to grab unwieldy items much more easily .	-1
I bought a pair of these for their 500 degree capability ... and that 's about all I got out if them.I have size 7-8 glove hands , and these are at least a good fit.In actual use on BBQ , grill and oven work , they:1. quickly make one 's hands hot and drip with sweat because they are waterproof2 . are way too stiff , and hard to grip things with , because of the rigid , thick silicone , and rigid containment of the thumb3 . because they are completely waterproof , they would be good for working in and around hot liquids , that would penetrate cloth or leather glovesI 've gone back to lined leather and lined thick cloth gloves , and welcome their dexterity , and not having sweaty , hot hands encased in these `` heaters '' .This was a great idea in 2001 . Not now . If you insist on having a silicone material , there are smaller silicone `` grabbers '' or `` glovelets '' perhaps 4 inches in length to fit just the fingers and thumb in , that are far easier to use for hot utensils and pots in the oven . Perhaps in a few years , silicone will be not as stiff to work with , and then we can try a pair .	-1
After about 9 months of use , the small plastic piece that keeps the filter screens in place begins to loosen and slide up the plunger rod . That makes the press useless . I 'm not the only one with this problem.Bodum was cutting corners when they used a plastic pressure fitting instead of a metal threaded piece.I contacted Bodum and they told me to buy the metal piece they should have used in the first place that 's standard on all their other presses for 2.99 + 5.99 ( shipping ) . I 'll eventually buy one but in the mean time I bought the 48oz Bodum Chambord press . Its awesome .	-1
First I will say that someone should travel to Bodum corporate headquarters bringing with them a standard 8-ounce measuring cup and 12 oz coffee mug , to demonstrate to Bodum what image is conjured in American minds when the word 'cup ' is used . If this pot makes 3 cups , then I must ask , are the cups for people or for elves ? Only a minuscule creature would be satisfied with the amount of coffee that comes from this pot . I am not certain why Bodum thought this size pot is necessary at all.I bought the pot because it was said to make `` 3 cups '' . I had already bought the Chambord model , which is also labeled `` 3 cups '' and makes enough coffee for one 15 oz mug , so I was stunned when I opened the package and saw the tiny vessel that is the Brazil pot . The amount of coffee I would get from this pot would be enough for my first sip . Taking clean-up into consideration , it is absolutely not worth the trouble or the money.Since returning it would cost about 50 % of what I paid for it , I will keep it , for those rare occasions when I want to brew a small cup of tea . Finally , a general comment on Bodum : French press coffee pots have been said to make the best possible coffee , which is probably true . But this morning , when I dropped and broke the glass container of my new Chambord , I had to resort to a porcelain Melitta filter cone to make my first cup of the day , and the coffee I got from that was excellent . Plus there was no clean-up . So , if you have about 20 minutes in the morning to spend fussing around making coffee , and you do n't break the glass container , then Bodum is the way to go .	-1
Pulls pretty well with moderate noise as expected for the price.Unfortunately , the fan body did n't fit in a single window in my house with the one expansion panel that was included . Much too narrow . Plus Amazon does n't sell the extenders ! No way to make this work even remotely without purchasing another part from another site .	-1
Pros-fits well into window , light weight and easy installation , arrived quickly , reasonable price but not for the power of fan.Cons-Much lower suction than I expected , even at high setting very little air movement , I would not buy this item again or recommend it .	-1
This little fan `` works '' but for how long ? I ca n't believe how cheaply it is made . Plastic ... Nothing but cheap flimsy plastic.Another poorly made product from CHINA . You know ... China , the country we sold our souls to.Amazon should require that the country of origin be listed on all products . That would really help me to avoid Chinese made junk .	-1
The fan is not very powerful at all . I have no idea why so many people wrote good reviews for this thing ! I 'm going to get a more expensive fan hoping that the cost means it is stronger !	-1
Its a really bad product . I hated it since I opened it . It looks so small and fragile and it actually is . The fan is a window fan and there is no way you could make it stand on ground . It could only be installed in a window and there is no way you could use it inside room without additional supports . May be chairs : p ... Not only this , this is an inferior quality product . Fans are small and are not powerful . This stopped working suddenly one fine morning after 10-15 days . I am returning it and am asking for refund from amazon .	-1
When I received this Breville wok it seemed like it was used , but I did not want to hassle with a return . I 've only used it a couple of times because it is very heavy and a hassle to use . It is however a quality wok .	-1
I was very disappointed in this . Read the reviews and thought it might be worth it . I am returning it after only one use . Will stick to using my oven~~~	-1
I bought this juicer after reading all of the great reviews here on Amazon.I 've now used it several times , and I have to say , the juice it outputs is amazingly tasty ! I think it produces some of the best-quality juice I 've ever had.That said , it has a big problem : it just does n't make a whole lot of juice . The pulp container fills up very quickly , and the pulp is soaking wet . Often , depending on the type of fruit I put in , I 'll even end up with huge chunks of fruit in the pulp container , clearly packed with juice and not extracted at all . I estimate that this juicer only gets half of the available juice out of the fruit , most of the time.I 've found that the larger the pieces of fruit are going in , the better it will do its job . Use large pieces , and push down VERY SLOWLY with the plunger to get maximum extraction . Do n't even bother with smaller fruits . Grapes , for instance , are a joke with this thing -- it just throws the grapes , nearly whole , into the pulp container , while extracting almost nothing.I 've also tried re-processing the pulp . This gets a bit more juice out , but not much . As I noted , the smaller the pieces are going in , the worse the extraction rate , so the pulp does n't do much.I 'm really not at all happy with this purchase . I love the juice it makes , but every time I use it I feel like I would have done better just eating the fruit instead of processing it through this machine .	-1
We returned this . We were very disappointed for a number of reasons . It was far too labor intensive : clean-up took way too much time . It was messy and splattered . And most importantly , after trying a number of recipes , we thought the juices were awful , medicinal-tasting . We 're sticking with Bolthouse Farms juices .	-1
My Moline 104 Juicer broke down this morning after almost 10 years of use . I use a juicer at least three times a week to make a vegetable juice ( for the most part , beets , carrots , celery , parsley , green peppers ) . I needed a replacement and I bought this model because it looked like the only decent model available at the local stores . I tried it right away and , frankly , was not impressed . Considering the price , the quality just did not measure up - light plastic ( part of the top cover came in chipped right out of the box ) , juice splatters all over the countertop , lots of juice left in the pulp . I am returning it . Will be contacting Moline Customer Service - turns out , their juicer has 15 year warranty .	-1
It grinds bologny and eggs well . Second time I tried to grind pork butt , it made loud cracking noises and quit . Wish I would have ground meat more while it was returnable . I also had trouble with Waring waffle iron and deep fryers . At least those broke when they were brand new.Waring Pro Stainless Steel Meat Grinder MG100CWaring is off my shopping list !	-1
Like so many others , I fell in love with the look of this Kitchen Aid coffee grinder . Unfortunately , also like so many others , I burnt out two of the units by using beans that were apparently `` too oily '' . The second motor jammed even though I did n't use flavored coffee beans in it . Instead , I coddled the thing by using an old , trusty-but-aesthetically-unpleasing Melitta for my flavored beans . No amount of rice or cleaning could save the dying motor . Since I was 2 weeks past the warranty date on the second grinder , and I 'd already been `` burned '' twice , I opted not to fight for a third unit . I still miss how `` cool '' it looked on my counter -- but I do n't miss the hassles it brought during a 2-year period .	-1
I was thoroughly disappointed that any KitchenAid product could be so awful . I have had large and small KitchenAid appliances over the years and been delighted with them . This is a LEMON ! The only thing nice I can say about it is the retro styling . If I wanted to have coffee grounds all over my sink , counter and kitchen floor , I could buy a bag and spread them around myself . Not only is this inordinately messy , the beans do not feed well from the hopper , do not all grind , and fly around instead of pouring exclusively into the glass container . What a disaster . I do n't care if burr grinders are supposed to be `` so good '' - I will keep my cheap blade grinder any day !	-1
This is a poorly desgined grinder . Maybe OK for the occasional user , as it requires serious cleaning of the spout and counter after each use . Not a reliable machine for the daily or serious coffee drinker . Am returning it .	-1
When it 's working it 's fine , but it rarely is working.I have owned this machine for approx . two years . In that time I may have used ta half dozen time and had the `` the churn motor '' once last year . This year when I decided to use itit would not churn even though I may have used it only twice since replacing it.Now I am stuck with a huge expensive appliance which is useless for churning ice cream.DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY ITALIAN DESIGNED MACHINE .	-1
Unit did not get cold at all . Delivery fine . Not a lot of noise . When I called Lello they had an `` I really do n't care '' attitude and did n't help at all ! HOWEVER , when I contacted AMAZON.COM , they were a help and told me how to return the item and use the return lable to avoid shipping costs . The NEXT DAY I went to the UPS store to sent the package back ; to my surprise , when I returned home , Amazon.com had OVERNIGHTED the replacement without even recieving the return yet . Now , THAT 'S what I call costumer service ! ! New unit works wonderfully . Gets cold fast and ice cream in no time	-1
I was desperate for a new coffeemaker and I found one of these on sale for a decent price , so I decided to give it a shot.It was easy to setup and easy to use . Everything worked properly and I had no problems with the quality of the coffeemaker or the process of setting it up.But what matters the most is : does the coffee taste good ? Sadly , it did not . It tasted like chemicals and plastic . I tried four different brands of coffee , and they all had the same weird , chemicaly , plasticky taste . And yes , I did clean the coffeemaker thoroughly , following the manufacturer 's instructions , before using it for the first time.I really did like the concept of this coffeemaker and the way it worked , but if the coffee is going to taste like plastic , there 's no way I 'm going to drink it . Back to the store it goes .	-1
Ok - So I have an older ( 2 yrs ? ) version of this exact same pan , which I really like , and use constantly.Same Calphalon product id etc . .So I feel confident ordering this one based on my previous experience . . . Mistake . . .This is NOT the same pan in any way , even though it has the same Calphalon Product code etc . .The metal in this pan is about 60 % of the thickness of the older version , and is far too thin for any serious use.It also has a `` re-designed '' 2-rivet handle that is of a far worse design then the older 3-rivet design.The pan has also been significantly reshaped , reducing the effective heated surface , and now featuring a prominent 1/4 '' vertical lip around the edge which I find interferes with the use of the pan . .It 's about a 3 for actual usability , and a 0 for Calphalon for continuing to reduce the quality of their products.I wo n't buy another . .	-1
I bought both the 10 & # 34 ; and 12 & # 34 ; as a set some time back , not on Amazon , and have used them almost daily with great success . So why only two stars ? Because , while I think the pans are excellent , I am astounded by the price . I paid $ 49 for the set of two . While I think the pans are quite good , I absolutely do no think they are worth this ridiculous price . For this amount of money , I would step up to a more expensive pan or , at the very least , compare prices at some of the stores that carry this type of merchandise .	-1
For some reasons did not work for me . I only washed by hand and i start to see rust on the handle after 1 use . Had to return it and purchased a pan Bakers & Chefs from Sam 's Club . Sorry Calphalon ! !	-1
Its a good looking saucepan but the only problem is that when your cooking the metal handle gets hot and you have to use cooking gloves in order to pick up the saucepan .	-1
I purchased the pan back in 2006 and it was wonderful , better than just anything Walmart carry ; for the records Walmart was the course of my cookware ( or whatever you call them ) back in grad school 's salary . Unlike most pan , the sheet of metal is thick and by soem magic heats up really fast . Now after carful using ( alwasy wooden spatulla and hand wash ) teh coating started to peel of soem tiem middle of 2007 and the process is still on . Now , it sticks up everything , only thing I can really cook is sause ; I used to saute my food a lot and now I can do so only if I use a different pan . Overal , not worth the extra $ ; I think a more resonable way to get nonstick is hard anodized stuff .	-1
I replaced my old Brita pitcher ( I broke it ) with this bigger one . I hate it . I have to wait until every bit of water has trickled into the reservoir before it can be used , and that is not a quick process . In a family , trust me , everyone is n't going to reliably fill the pitcher each time they use it . You will be waiting and waiting just to make some coffee . The lid leaks like a sieve if you try to pour some before it is all in the bottom . Additionally , it is really a two handed operation just to pour from . The lid will fall off sometimes , even when it seems properly seated , and water will be everywhere . I know this can happen with any pitcher if the lid is n't on correctly , but it happens a lot with this one . So , one hand to pick it up , and one hand to hold the lid on is really required.An electronic gage to advise you how your filter life is progressing that moves in 25 % increments might make you think there is something actually being gaged , other than the simple passage of time , that is . But all this thing does is tell you that in two months you should change the filter . It does n't matter if you were on vacation the whole two months or a football team playing in the August heat was using your pitcher , it will need changing in two months .	-1
I had been using a Pur filter for a long time . I complained to Pur that the filtered water , after standing for a while , had a metallic taste . They sent me a coupon for a free filter if I bought one . HaHa . I thought I would try the Brita Pitcher . While the water tastes very good when first filtered tastes very good . But again after sitting for a while , again the metallic taste . I am not pleased with this product and would not recommend it to any one else . I will just stick with gallons of bottled water .	-1
To refill this pitcher , you can either remove the entire lid or use your thumb to flip up a small portion of the lid . This flip up piece in the lid always ends up coming off when you use it so then you end up having to mess with it to pop it back on there . Not convenient at all . If you decide to remove the entire lid , it 's hard to get the lid to snap back on properly so that also takes some time . It 's hard enough to get my family to refill the pitcher when it 's empty and certainly no one will do it when it 's so cumbersome .	-1
I love that its red . But thats pretty much where my love for this pitcher ends . Its definitely not as well made as the old Brita pitchers . Very often when you go to pour the water , the entire top of the pitcher falls off . You have to hold the pitcher with one hand and hold the top on with the other . Really annoying .	-1
In all my life I have NEVER seen such awful quality control as with this Brita pitcher . You could n't remove the white reservoir to wash it without breaking it . It was totally squeezed in . The upper lid did NOT FIT because the plastic fitting was a bit too big . When you poured it , the water went all over the counter . I called Brita and got some person who seemed to care less and in a monotone said I need to talk to Amazon . I talked to Amazon and Amazon was GREAT . They said they would send me another or refund my money and I agreed to try ONE MORE of this size . They told me to hold onto the other and see if it works or the same problems is here . I also ordered the basic 5 cup pitcher : NO PROBLEM on that in taking the white filter holding reservoir out ... NO PROBLEM with the top fitting and water spilling . I simply ca n't understand this utter lack of quality control : TWO parts that do n't fit . I wasted about an hour trying to take the white part off and get the lid on and cleaning up water and waiting on the phone for an absolutely wasted call to Brita . I 'd suggest Brita try to recruit some customer service people from Amazon . They are much more helpful . I will write another review if the new one fits or does n't fit . But this was the WORST PRODUCT I have ever received in terms of terrible construction and quality control . I 'm only giving it one star because the water it filetered tasted good . But frankly , I 'm being an easy marker .	-1
I 've been using Brita Pitchers and filters for years , usually buying the cheap ones you can pick up at the big box store in town . Always loved them , but had one complaint - they did n't hold enough water to fill my 12 cup coffee maker . Always had to refill and wait to make a full pot of coffee . So when I saw this , I thought it was just exactly what I wanted . So why the 2 star review , well ... One star is for the size - it holds enough for the coffee maker and then some.One star is for the style - this thing looks good on my counter.The MINUS three stars - it drips at a high rate of speed if there is any water left in the upper reservoir . It does n't matter how tightly you hold the lid , the water still comes rushing out because it does n't fit tight enough . ( On the older , cheaper ones , you could hold the lid in place and nothing dripped ) .For me , this is a major design flaw because it means , quite simply , you can not pour a glass of water until all the water in the top has filtered through to the bottom . Which puts me right back to the cheaper models - waiting for water.I wish I had n't throw out the old one - because , this is so aggravating , I know we 'll buy another cheaper one next time we go shopping for drinking water and just reserve this one for filling up the coffee pot .	-1
Water tastes great through a Brita filter , but this pitcher is poorly designed . The following list of cons is short , but these little details have become so annoying that I decided to throw the pitcher away and order Brita 's Atlantis pitcher instead.Cons1 . Water gets trapped under the outer plastic bezel when you wash the pitcher . The trapped water will eventually drip out and leave wet spots on your counter top.2 . Water gets trapped inside the pitcher between the filter reservoir and the transparent pitcher body . This water stays trapped for long periods of time and turns stale.3 . The squared lip of the pour spout creates a dribble problem that will leave little puddles under the pitcher every time you pour water.Pros1 . Water tastes good.Conclusion : If you buy a Brita pitcher , do n't choose this one .	-1
I tested the water before 658 and after 532 . Anything over 300 is considered contaminated . Real filtered water is 10.And the design bites on top of that .	-1
The light is almost always red ; it 's clunky and heavy . Do n't like the black . Will probably replace this . The one positive thing is that the top is secure ; it does n't come off when you pour from it too soon after you 've filled it .	-1
The ergonomics are terrible , the lid falls off at the slightest angle , the filter also dislodges at moderate angles , and it lets carbon bits get EVERYWHERE . Worst Brita model by far.Do yourselves a favor and buy theBrita Marina Complete Water Filtration Pitcher , Clear/Whiteinstead . I bought it as a replacement for the Grand , and every day feel a sense of great relief .	-1
I Love Brita , always have and will continue to . We needed a new pitcher and we decided to get this one for its size and the color options . Everything is great ... except the spout and lid are flawed on this pitcher . : : : The spout never opens properly when you are trying to pour water ... .creates a spill.When you old the pitcher to pour the entire lid pops off about 50-75 % of the time , creating a spill.I love their products and I so wish that this one did not have these minor issues ... .but it does and thus it loses 3 stars.Come on Brita ... .	-1
I bought this to sharpen my Fiskers splitting ax and other knives . I found it to be very cheaply made and not worth it . I did not feel that it was sharpening well , and I returned it .	-1
I have a similarly designed item for kitchen knives and it works great . This is way too flimsy to sharpen a large blade on a work tool such as a machete or an axe . Though I can not speak knowledgeably about the exact angle to which these larger items need to be honed I can say that this seems wrong for these large angled blades . After using this item my machete may be slightly less dull , but it is far from sharp .	-1
It is a lot more flimsy then it looks . To try to use it on a axe is not a good .	-1
The top pops off . The metal is warped and thin . This is the sort of garbage you expect to find at a dollar store . They have some nerve selling it for $ 10 . Do n't waste your money or time . As soon as I got the item , I immediately returned it for a refund . I can not believe that trash like this is getting decent reviews .	-1
Will not work right , hangs up on one of the teeth since the tooth is bent . Cheaply made . I am not sending it back to Amazon since it is not worth my time and trouble .	-1
Are you kidding me ! ! ! ! ! ! They used PLACTIC to cover the dial . I looked into the oven to see the temp , and WTF , , , , THE COVER WAS MELTED ! ! ! ! ! This is the worse PIECE OF CRAP EVER ... . But Amazon refunded my money ... UPDATE : After I read the fine print and in all fairness , , , , it does say not to leave it in the meat . So take the risk burning of yourself and singeing your eyebrows , to check the meat temp from time to time while cooking . I never heard of anything so ridiculous ? ? ? I 'm still giving it 1 star ...	-1
I did n't purchase this thermometer for deep frying a turkey . I just needed it for my counter top deep fryer . But as I tested the temp of the oil , I got the feeling that the thermometer 's calibration was off . So I tested the temp of the oil with my Thermapen Instant Thermometer and , sure enough , the deep fry thermometer was off by 20-degrees . That would have been enough for a 3-star rating , but even worse , after calibration the deep fryer thermometer did n't hold the calibrated temp . The only positive thing I can say is that the thermometer is easy to calibrate - and it should be since calibration is required so often .	-1
The sensor on this instant-read thermometer is halfway up the shaft , nowhere near the tip . For smaller pieces being checked , it 's unusable without shoving the shaft all the way through and halfway out the other side.I 'll look for a better one and probably pretty much retire this one except for the rare occasions when I cook large roasts and such .	-1
This is a great thermometer for deep frying with a lot of oil or making candy where the product is at least one inch or more.So my search goes on for a thermometer that will work on more shallow amounts of oil .	-1
This is a great thermometer ... for the first few months . After that , the numbers started to fade . I ca n't even tell where the numbers even used to on my thermomter .	-1
I did n't really look at it very closely when I got went to use it today 8/21 and discovered the glass part was only half there and no red liquid it was broken and only half of the glass part was there : (	-1
the number flutter and your not really sure what they are ending up at , To much trouble should just be poke and read , There for product has never really worked correctly .	-1
I never actually got to use mine because as I was trying it out I noticed that the one I received appeared to be defective . When I would press the buttons ( which seemed very flimsy to begin with ) I would often have to press them multiple times to get a response . Aside from that the design of the unit has to be the most complicated timer ever created . Yes it has a lot of functions which is nice , but most people will never figure out the majority of the basic functions without thoroughly reading through the manual . I am returning this unit , and will likely purchase a different model in it 's place .	-1
I will keep this simple , I did not like 3 things about this . One , the temp is every other digit so if you are looking for a very specific temperature you may have to adjust by 1 degree ( no huge deal ) . Two you ca n't shut it off , and though it makes a nice kitchen clock since I have never set the time on my microwave : ) , it would be nice to save the battery life to have that option . Three , the alarm seems to go off not when the temp is reached but rather when the temp goes just over the temp you programmed , which could be a problem say if you are making custard , but once again if you adjust for that you should be fine . Other than that it is accurate , quick , good magnet , easy to use , and i like how you can adjust the angle of the display . Alright I am changing my rating to 1 star . Why ? Well the probe has failed twice , I sent the unit back and they replaced it , however the new unit failed after just a few uses . Furthermore , the magnet is not that great , if it gets any grime on it it loses its ability to hold to a metal surface for the most part . I could send it back again since it has a five year warranty but nah , I am buying s new one .	-1
I returned theCDN TM4 Digital Timer - Count Down Big Digitand returned it for theCDN TM15t Design TM15 Extra Large Big Digit Timer . Why ? Let me count the ways ... 1 . It was too darn LOUD when entering numbers . Having it loud for ringing was fine . But 7 times when you wanted to enter 7 minutes was just waaay to annoying.2 . Because it had no seconds it took me quite a while to tell if it was on or off . ( the : between hours and minutes blinking meant it was on.3 . If I entered the numbers my letting it scale up ( remember the 7 minute example ? ) and then went by it to 8 and hitting the `` clear '' button did n't clear . I had to start/stop it and then I could clear it.4 . If I was timing a hamburger 4 minutes on a side it did n't `` remember '' the 4 after I turned the meat . I had to re-enter.I bought another TM15 with 99 minutes and seconds because I ca n't have too many of these good guys.I will continue to search for a large digit timer that has hours minutes and seconds . This is the first CDN product I have n't just L O V E D .	-1
I bought 2 of these for my kids reading timers . The batteries did not stay together so they kept losing connection which would reset the timers . Very disappointed and so where they when they would have to start their reading time all over again .	-1
If this had n't broken within one year , I would have given it 3 stars . There is a clip on the back and the magnet is on the back of that . No matter whether you have the clip extended or not ( there is a metal bracket thingy to keep it extended if you like ) , it is easily pushed off balance and either falls or slides around . If your fingers are messy and you want to push the off button with one finger without steadying it with the other hand , it will knock it off they fridge . If you really try to do anything without grasping it with two hands , it will come off the fridge . If they could make the clip the detachable so you could attach the thing stably to the fridge , maybe it could work . I do like the programmable functions . I think there should be a ten minute button to go up in increments of tens instead of just ones . I also like that the beeper will eventually stop on its own . And now I need a replacement and I ca n't find one that is programmable , has the ability to type in the time instead of just holding a button down , and sticks to the fridge . Apparently this fridge sticking business is difficult for all timer manufacturers to master according to the other reviews . Grr .	-1

I have always trusted that in most cases , you pay for what you get . This is one of those examples where you stop and feel like someone is sitting back and laughing at me.1 . To switch from clock to timer you have to move a switch on the side of the machine . IF you see the clock and try to set the timer , you only mess up the clock . Switching back and forth between clock and timer gets tedious . By the time you finally train yourself to use the switch on the side , you have reset the clock no less than a dozen times . To be even more honest - I 'm very proud of myself for not smashing the thing on the floor ! 2 . The worthless memory button should actually be used to switch back and forth between the clock and timer . At least this way you would n't screw up the clock all the time.I HATE this timer.D .	-1
. . . is erratic and inaccurate ! It is a disappointment . I just wanted a timer that would beep me every four hours . Guess that was too much to ask .	-1
I ordered this thinking it would keep the cord out of my way while ironing . I have seen them work for other people.However , it does not work on my board or else I do not connect it correctly.If I could return it without postage being more then it 's worth I would return it.I would not recommend buying it .	-1
This item is cheap but it is not a bargain.I just attached it to my ironing board and the arm of the cordholder is so flimsy that it immediately bent over with the weight of the cord . Also , the cord does not slide through the cord holder so you can not run the iron across the length of the ironing board without it getting caught or having to manually thread the cord through the holder.Poorly designed and poorly made . Do not waste your time or money .	-1
The rest will not support the weight of my iron . As it bends so much have been afraid to put a hot iron on it for fear it will fall . Would not purchase again	-1
THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED . MY IRON DID NOT FIT WELL ON IT AND I RETURNED IT FOR CREDIT .	-1
this thing is just a bit bigger than a cd , so there is not much room to do anything on it , you have to put a bowl or something on top of it to use it effectivley . Also , I did not find it very accurate , as I have a 1lb weight to test with . I found mine at least 10 % off . Spend your money on something else more effective .	-1
Had this for a year or two and it stopped working completely . There is NO customer support from the manufacturer . Worked great til it died , but should not have died so soon . Would not buy again .	-1
I was so excited when I received this waffle maker for my bridal shower . It made great waffles for the first 3 times , then on the 4th time , the maker just did n't get hot enough and all the waffles turned out barely cooked and limp . I guess my machine had the same problems as all the rest . Beware and do n't buy this waffle maker . I 'm going to see if i can return it . MAD !	-1
I got it and tried it the same day.It operated per the manual until it came time to beep at us telling us the waffle was done.Something was wrong with the timer as it never did beep.We returned it the same day .	-1
Well , the heating element on my Waring Pro WMK300 broke after a little over 3 years . It was used maybe 4 times a year . While it was working , the waffles came out great . First thing I did when it broke was check what other reviewers had to say and it looks like I 'm not alone . I am SHOCKED at the people who also had their waffle maker break giving this 3 and 4 stars ! People , this is a $ 70 waffle maker . Plus , this is something ( like people say in their reviews ) that only gets very OCCASIONAL use . This is not acceptable .	-1
This waffle maker worked well - while it worked . I had it for over a year , but only used it maybe 15 times before the heating element went out . It just seems too common for electronic appliances to fail these days . I did n't check , but I 'll bet it was made in China .	-1
Sadly I purchased this unit from a retail store ( had to have it right now ) and could not return it . IF you are juicing citrus , when you press down on the fruit , the unit BASE spins around spewing the juice everywhere . If you have 2 people using it 1 to operate and 1 to hold the unit down , it clogs up quickly . Probably going to purchase the Breville unit FROM Amazon .	-1
This juicer is an embarrasment to Cuisinart . I purchased this to juice limes and lemons and when juicing them:1 ) the top swivels and the lime moves all over the place so you have to use it without the plastic top to try to get some results2 ) the unit is noisy and the engine sounds like it 's dying3 ) the base moves when you are juicing so that the juice goes all over the counter instead of in the cup4 ) etc ... ..I ca n't wait to take it back to the store and if the store were n't closed , I would take it back now and it 's almost midnight . What a horrible product and an embarrasment to Cuisinart . They should recall this juicer to save their name .	-1
My hands hurt . I made lovely pink grapefruit juice but with one hand holding the grapefruit down and the other trying to keep this machine from jerking to the side and spewing juice all over the counter ... .well . You get the picture . Do n't buy this !	-1
I am glad there are other juicers in the world . Everywhere I turn I only see this one and I hate it . It makes a loud grinding noise .	-1
I just got this juicer over the other brands thinking Cuisinart was a good one ... what a mistake ! A soon as you put your citrus down it starts moving all over the counter and half of the juice will end on the counter instead of the glass ... .. When it start spinning the other direction does an horrible noise , like if the all machine was going to fell apart !	-1
My son bought me a gift - or so he thought it would be something nice for me since I juice oranges - What a piece of junk - tiny weeny spout - extends out about 1/2 inch - What mess to juice - All the negative reviews are accurate . DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK - DESERVES ZERO	-1
PROS : Matched the brushed steel motif of the kitchen.CONS : Short spout , unstable , small pulp basket , weak construction ... DETAIL : Do yourself a favor now and check outBlack & Decker CJ525 CitrusMate Plus Citrus Juicerinstead . I replaced the Cuisinart with the B & D ; after returning it in roughly a week . It was hands down the worst juicer I have ever used.This appliance has too many flaws to detail . But there are some huge deal breakers.First , the appliance is unstable . I spent more time chasing the damn thing around the counter than actually juicing fruit.When I could get it steady and manage to press an orange half down , the pulp would fill the basket up extremely fast . Ironically , this is on the setting allowing the most pulp through.The decision to have a spout vs. a pitcher may seem like a good clean idea , but the design makes it so that more juice ends up on the counter than in the glass.The construction of this device is such that I felt like I would break it at any moment if I pressed too hard . Unfortunately , if I did n't apply a good deal of pressure , the juice would never be extracted ! You do n't need yet another poor review to tell you what so many others have said.This `` juicer '' did not juice much more than $ 20 from my wallet .	-1
This is not a cheap rice cooker but the design is very poor , must be from a very early model . The inside of the upper lid can not be removed to clean thoroughly . It can easily trap steam , rice and/or food particles , harbor germs and causing health issue.I do n't care if it can cook perfect rice but I personally think this model should be discontinued just for sanitary reason alone . Purchase other models that are a little more expensive where the inner lid can be removed for cleaning . I do not recommend this rice cooker for anyone .	-1
I had a stainless steel ( inner area ) Airpot from Zojirushi years ago , it works great and I got tired of it ( I wanted a newer model ) , so I gave it to my friend , who just love it for her new born at the time . That was few years ago , when I gave it to her . That pot served me over 10 years.This newer model is fancier with the computer temp and reboil bottoms , I was happy with it . I notice this one hard water build up faster then the older model , and after a year , the taste of the water got funnier , I just do n't like it anymore , I gave it away to another friend , who does not notice anything wrong with the taste . Who was very appreciated for this expensive boiler . After a year , I was told the inner area of the cover broke , due to the steam and usage . I could not believed only after couple of years of use . It 's a fine product , for the price I paid , I would expect it last longer like the first one , it 's not the case . I now switch to another brand that cost about 1/2 as much , does the same job .	-1
I used this regularly for tea and french-pressed coffee . Unfortunately after about 2 years , I went to descale it and found that the teflon lining sloughed off ! It is useless now . Why do they have to coat the tank with non-stick ? There is some debate as to whether that stuff is even hazardous to your health .	-1
This is the worst airpot i have ever bought . I have alway thought of Zojirushi to be one of the top notch brands . However , after one month of using this airpot , the insides has turned color ( brownish stains ) .I emailed Zojirushi and all they tell me is that it is common and that i have to clean it . The stain keeps getting worst and i feel that it is unsafe to use for my baby . I had bought it with the intention of using the boiled/kept warm water for her milk . I will never buy another zojirushi ever again with the bad service provided . I can not believe that this is under warranty but Zojirushi staff does not want to take any responsibility in their products .	-1
This juicer did n't cost much , and is n't worth much . You get what you pay for . It looks good , but does n't get all of the juice out of the fruits and vegetables . The pulp is pretty soggy , meaning there is still a lot of juice left in it . The juice you do get out is full of pulp , not well strained . Save your money and invest in a better juicer . This is not worth it . I stuck it up in the closet and will never use it again .	-1
and was very disappointed . with the good reviews I was excited to have a juicer at such a good price . I did not force the vegetables but let it do the work itself . the pulp does not stay in the little trap . it goes everywhere down into the machine . it took me over 10 minutes to clean it . there was juice , and it tastes fine but the mess is so not worth it . this is going back ...	-1
1 ) Filter is not tight to the upper receptacle causing unfiltered water to just drain into the lower basin.2 ) Nozzle internally is about 2 inches above the floor of the container- this means that the bottom layer of water will never drain unless you tilt the whole thing3 ) It is not impossible but /very/ difficult to get the top part out to clean the basin- the guy who said to just turn it upside down is full of it . That does not work at all . It takes about 10 mins of teasing the plastic around all edges .	-1
With a product of this capacity I expected a better product . The current design had my common sense kick in to simply purchase a sink attachment filter after a few tests over a 90 day period . Well ok , the last 60 some odd days of use , the first thirty I mistakenly trusted the design to perform.I like brita and filtered water , but I had to throw this out.Mold , slimes , and a few other items that are hazardous to a persons well being are the main issue . Even with weekly cleaning there was some biological return . The worst was testing the filter after 58 days.The filter itself contained a plethora of microscopic crawlies . Nothing fatal , but we cultured a bunch of varieties that cause bad breath , stomach , and throat issues . All of which were also found in the 'clean ' water in the well below.Three kinds of fungi had invaded a previously pristine , chef quality , fridge . All growing from the protected colony in this huge reservoir.I 'd have to recommend a smaller capacity pitcher or in a family sized home a faucet attachment . If you are going to pay for something to give you clean water , you might as well get clean water .	-1
The fan was great , with lots of breeze and circulation . It is loud , but who cared ? The problem is that it only lasted for about 3 months before it just quit working , along with a little puff of smoke . Two weeks before the fatal puff , the fan arced , popped , sparked , and gave off a puff of smoke , but it still worked . Two weeks after that it sparked and puffed and has not turned on since.I live in Hawaii and it is currently in the rainy season . There has been a lot of humidity in the air during the last month , and I noticed that the back of the fan was actually getting rusty . I thought perhaps that moisture was the cause of the sparking so I was surprised to read in another review that the fan was good to use during heat and humidity ! The fan was sitting in front of the living room window and it kept the whole small 2 bedroom house cool . We miss it , but I ca n't keep buying a new fan every 3 months ! This is the first time ever that this has happened with a fan that I purchased . I have been living in Hawaii for 13 years and have been through a lot of fans . One of the best-lasting fans I had was a $ 10.00 Lasko box fan . It lasted and worked well for 7 years before it quit working .	-1
I 've had my fan for 10 or more years ? ? Loved it , liked the loud jet like noise . When you first turn it on , it does get less loud then it gets louder . Last night , it had been running for 2 hours , at 2 am . I woke up , it was on fire and my room was full of smoke . If I had n't woken up ... ...	-1
I was a little worried about ordering this board after reading the `` one '' bad review , however after reading the comments attached I felt more comfortable that I would get what was listed . I did ! ! It 's absolutely beautiful ! Having been a degreed Chef for 24 years as well as being from Michigan , I am familiar with this company and have two more boards made by them . From counter tops to cutting boards , their wood welded Maple is the best money can buy regardless of the good deals that may make them look inferior to competitors . This is more than a masterfully made cutting board of the highest quality ... ... ... it is an heirloom if properly cared for and I hope my sons will be using it long after I am gone . Seriously , there is no need to look any further . If this is the right size ( and its not a small board ) then buy it ! ! When you get it you will be wondering how you bought all of those other boards over the years without knowing that something like this was available . The price here was almost unbelievable and scared me a bit too , but like I said , I got exactly what was listed . My knives love me ! ! Sincerely , Chef Douglas James . Schoolcraft Culinary School.UPDATE : 12-09-13As I had mentioned in the above review , I have many boards as I am a chef . That said , and even though I purchased this board on May 30th of this year , ( 7 months and 9 days ago ) , I have not got around to using this one yet ( not even once ) . Though I have never used it , it still gets the monthly rub down with mineral oil as my boards are precious to me . Always standing on it 's side parallel to the welds and of course it has never seen a drop of water . Now having said all of that , it is falling apart like a $ 2 cutting board from target . Can not believe it myself as I have other boards from Michigan Maple Block that are like new after years of abuse . I will be contacting Michigan Maple Block tomorrow to see if they care as my opportunity for a return has obviously run dry with the seller here on Amazon . I am completely blown away that 4 ( not 1 ) of the welds have completely split . I do not believe that this board is from Michigan Maple Block but rather is a knock . For that reason I would not even dare to buy this board without contacting the seller and if possible , tracing its origin .	-1
When I ordered this , I did not pay attention to the width . When it arrived , it was so heavy and bulky . Since I am a smaller person , this was way to overkill for me . Definitely more suitable for professional use and not household .	-1
This thing is a big piece of junk . It lasted about an hour before the wire started pulling out of it- not even using it hard , taking it easy . It 's criminal to put this kind of trash on the market and ask people to spend money on it .	-1
They came with this greasy coating , which is no big deal just washed it off ... but the handles are just crappy . The one cup handle bends when carrying one cup of sugar ? ! I doubt they will last long . The spoons are fine though .	-1
I was very disappointed by these measuring cups based on the outstanding reviews by other customers.These cups have a strange tint to them and quickly tarnish with little spots . The handles are terrible . They bend easily with just pancake mix , specifically the 1 cup . I would not recommend these cups.If you are looking for professional quality stainless steel measuring cups these are not the ones for you .	-1
After reading the reviews here and seeing that fabulous picture I ordered one of these . Unfortunately , when it arrived it did n't look like the picture or measure up to what people said about it in the reviews . First , the one I got does not have a brushed exterior . I has a very shiny exterior , which shows a considerable number of small surface imperfections , mostly small pits in the surface , but a few others as well . It 's going back to Amazon because it wo n't find any love in my kitchen.Note : This thing is made in India , which is worse in my opinion than having it made in China.I submitted some pictures so you can see that I saw .	-1
UPDATE JAN 2014- They continue to break . 15 of the 30 are now in the trash . We will have to buy another set from a different maker as our cups are weekly cracking and dwindling away . Also we paid $ 19.99 and I notice the price is up to $ 45 as of Jan 2014 . That is way to much for this set of low quality glass . ( Original Review Dec 2013 ) Nice , but they crack and chip EASILY . In 10 days , we have had 5 cracked or chipped glasses . We love the small ones . Too bad the quality of them is too fragile . Still looking for a better quality as these will clearly not last . And the cracks came from when we were washing them . Just barely bumping the counter top or being stacked in the sink while washing is what caused them to break . Our previous glasses ( name brand unknown ) never had issues like this . IF they were more durable , they would be 5 stars ! ! !	-1
I was very disappointed when I received the set . I had 5 of the glasses in pieces when they arrived .	-1
I bought this model from a local dealer who has since quit selling Hoover vacuum cleaners because she could never get the manufacturer to do anything about how crappy the machines were . But I did n't know this and neither did she ( they had bought this store fairly recently ) when I bought the vacuum cleaner . I paid a fortune for it and was very happy at first . It would suck the stripes off a zebra from 6 inches away . But not long after the warrenty expired , so did the machine . The motor started overheating and I changed the belt , but , that did n't help . The nearest repair place was over 100 miles away , repair was expensive and shipping was unbelievable . And there were no guarantees that the mahcine would n't mess up again . My previous vacuum cleaner had gone for 17 years . I was furious . I wo n't buy another Hoover . The store owner said that another customer ( a veterinarian ) called Hoover company to ask which model they thought would be best for her , since she had a lot of pet hair to deal with . Hoover 's answer ? Go to Walmart , get the cheapest model they have , use it till it dies , toss it in the trash . Then go to Walmart , buy the cheapest ... . In other words , every model they make is crappy . The store owner said it was obvious that Hoover did n't care about the customer or their needs .	-1
I thought for the money this would be a good vacuum . Easy to push , suction to pick up cat hair and dust . Boy , was I wrong . The suction never really was that great , and the self-propel feature stopped working about 2 years after purchase . What a disappointment .	-1
I have owned , and fought with mine for several years now . This is a convoluted piece of junk . Far too elborate with too many belts and complicated mechanisms to do a good job . The self propelled system no longer functions without stooping down and lifting the vacumn a little bit as you scoot along . I now do the limbo dance and vacumn at the same time . All the belts look good but it just does n't work . Does n't matter what carpet-height setting I use . The system just is n't strong enough . As for suction , that 's another joke . It sucks , but not like it should . Probably too many filters and pipes and chambers for the air to have to go through . Words like Patented Wind Tunnel Technology are supposed to evoke confidence in the potential buyer , but let me tell you the whole concept sucks air . There is a scene in a popular comedy where some office workers finally get their revenge on the aggravating laser copier.. well someday I will have my moment with this so called vacumn cleaner and it 's not going to be pretty .	-1
The only reason I gave this vacuum 2 stars was for the cleaning ability . When the machine is new , with brand new belts , the vacuum does a great job ! After approximately one year , the vacuum will start going downhill . This is by far one the most repaired vacuums out there . This machine has a very bad design for the belts . It 's a combination of two belts , on driving the agitator brush , the other driving the self-propelled . What happens is as soon as one belt goes bad , it causes the other to go bad.You will be having to replace the belts , at least once a year , if not more . One other problem is when customers pick up the machine by the handle ( lets face it , this is the most convienent way to carry ) it causes the self propelled actuator arm to break . There 's too much tension on the arm , and it will rip the screw right out of the plastic actuator arm.You need to carry the machine with the carrying handle on the back of the vacuum to avoid this . There 's not much you can do to avoid the belt changes , as it is a flawed design by Hoover.When the machine is working , it actually cleans very well . It is very heavy , so if you are carrying up and down stairs , this will be a concern of yours .	-1
I had my heart set on a self propell vac because I have a bad back . After 14 months the self propell broke ! It is now easier to push my car down the street then push this thing across the livingroom because the self propell unit inside the vacume is so heavy , it really weighs the vacume down . It still sucks great but if I 'm going to keep useing it I will have to go back to physical therapy.This thing is such a tank if you run into a pice of furniture it will dent your furniture ! Carring it up and down the stairs while trying to vacume is impossible . The self propell unit is so heavy it really defeats the purpose of having one.Hoover is still my favorite vac , just do n't get a self propell !	-1
It shampoos fine , but ( 1 ) It is NOT a steam cleaner . You have to boil water & pour it into the tank if you want it hot . ( 2 ) It 's way too finicky ! You have to be careful in how you align the water tanks for reassembly or it does n't work right , but there is n't an indicator to tell you it is n't working or why . It 's just hit & miss until you get it right . Then you hope to remember what you learned next time you use it . If I had it all to do again , I would n't buy it .	-1
When I was shopping for a carpet cleaner , I eventually settled on this one , because my parents had owned the same model when I was younger , and it seemed to do a great job.After receiving this one , though , I would return it in an instant if I could . It lasted less than 5 light uses before it became completely worthless.First - Do n't let them fool you into thinking that there is any type of heater on this unit that contributes to `` Heated Cleaning '' . They added these keywords to the marketing because that 's now the standard , but really the only heat this thing generates is from the motor . They simply call it heated cleaning because the luke-warm exhaust is directed toward your carpet . There is no water heater , and the water will not be heated unless you put it in hot.During the third light use , which was about 5 months after I bought it , I noticed that it just began leaking everywhere , without my pulling the trigger . It just really leaked the cleaning water wherever it was and there was no way to stop it.On the 5 use , it completely stopped sucking up any of the water ... so now it was leaking uncontrollably AND no longer picking up the water.Of course , even though it 's essentially brand new , I ca n't return it because it 's over a year since I bought it.Get a BISSEL instead !	-1
Well , I am sending my new Hoover SteamVac back after only one use . I was so thrilled yesterday when I finally got my product put together ( which was really quite easy ) and the first time I used it , I though `` self '' , this is great ! It worked like a charm and it picked up so much dirt that I was utterly amazed at how well it worked . Well , the honeymoon lasted one use ! Today , I went to finish the job and clean the living room ( I cleaned the dining room yesterday ) and now I have a soaked carpet and the thing will not suction . I read all the directions , did everything , took all the pieces I could take off and cleaned them again ( I had already done that ) and nothing . It even sounds different today than yesterday.So , that is when I called Hoover . They told me that they get 200 calls a day ( ! ! ! ! ! ! ) regarding this same problem and it is that the return tank is very `` touchy '' and it has to be just right in order to get a suction . Well , I did everything they said to do , twice , and no dice . It did not work . They said the only thing left to do was to take it to a repair shop . Well , the repair shop is only about a mile from my house but the repair person said that it would be at least 2-4 weeks and possible more to get the repair done if a new part is needed . A NEW PART ? The thing is brand new ! Used once ! I asked her if I should send it back to Amazon , she said she could not tell me what to do but also reminded me again about the length of time to get the thing fixed.I took that as a sign and cleaned the machine as best I could , reboxed it , and UPS is to pick it up tomorrow . The other thing that drives me crazy is that the front nozzle area that picks up the water to go to the return tank can not be taken off to clean it . I did the best I could and I really would have liked to get it spotless , but that is never going to happen . With the rented Rug Doctor , you can take everything apart and clean and I like that aspect . I have to say that when this machine worked , I was amazed ( and it out-cleaned the Rug Doctor ) but I really do not want to spent $ 134 plus cleaning solution costs to clean only one room ! Unfortunately , maybe I did my homework too well . All of the consumer reports said this was the best with the least problems . I was going to get a Bissell as my Bissell vacuum cleaner is excellent . I think I will try one more time when I get my refund , puchase the Bissell from Amazon . I will not puchase another Hoover - 200 calls a day to customer service convinces me that there must be a problem !	-1
So far so good . Worked really good right out of the box . Easy to put together , easy to use and did a good job . Now hope it last longer then my Bissell Pro did . Was more expencess then Hoover but only lasted about 15 Months.OK , I used this three ( 3 ) times and plastic parts started falling of . Then stoped working.Three strikes and your OUT . Get what you pay for . If you buy this then remember ( from a buyer that did ) you gat what you pay for ! ! ! !	-1
The first carpet cleaner I purchased several years ago was a bissel . It was not an upright , but it did a great job , but it started leaking after about 3 years of using twice annually . My husband purchased an upright hoover in about the year 2001 . It worked well , but started leaking shortly after we purchased it . I do n't know why , but I purchased another one to replace a couple of years ago and it began leaking after the second or third use . I am still looking for a brand which will not leak , and last longer than these .	-1
I never had a problem with leaking with this machine , however , I did find that it did n't clean my carpet very well . It 's a bit of a hassle to use , clean and store , and I landed up giving it away after only having used it a few times ( although I 've actually had it since 2005 ) . If you 're going to use it a lot , then it may be a good buy for you , but for someone who had the best intentions when buying this cleaner , it landed up being a bit of a waste of money for me .	-1
This cleaned really well about three times , then the motor stopped working and I had to get it fixed . Luckily it had a one year warranty so other than being a pain to take it 45 minutes away to the Hoover store , I was covered . I 've used it 2 x since and now the water wo n't leave the cleaning tank to travel to the floor . Very frustrating - more landfill electronics .	-1
We have a lot of carpets and live in a place with lots of dust , so we have bought quite a number of Hoover Carpet Cleaners over the years . We 've always been happy with our carpet cleaners from Hoover . However , this product looks the same , but the quality has gone way way down . I 'm so disappointed . The other Hoovers were easy to clean . With this model , in order to clean it , you have to unscrew the section to clean to clean it and the screws are really really hard to reach . I do n't want to fiddle with unscrewing sections every time I want to clean it.Additionally , if it is dirty ( and it always dirty after we 've been shampooing the carpet ) the screws are covered in gunge and I have to get my hands filled with gunge to fight to get the screws off and I have to t ; rn the unit almost upside down to get to the screws . Arrrggggh . The other solution is to not clean it very often but this means that it will smell and the dirt and grime will dry inside the unit.Also , other Hoovers have had a way to either shampoo or rinse the carpet while they were being used . With this unit you can only shampoo which means leaving shampoo in your carpet . I guess you could empty the shampoo out of it ( which wastes shampoo ) and fill the unit up with clear water . But this is a huge hassle . Additionally the other Hoovers have had plastic that seemed strong . This plastic is flimsy . We are really disappointed and probably wo n't be buying Hoover products again .	-1
Suction is fantastic . Detergent distribution is very good . I would highly recommend this except for one overwhelming fact . It 's designed to break.The first thing you 'll notice with this unit is that the triggers are very stiff , uncomfortable to use and fragile . Your hand will become tired very quickly holding the triggers . They will also fail after about 15 to 20 cleaning . The plastic retainers built into the handle for the pivot points for the triggers is thin and very weak . There 's no possible way they could last long at all . The replacement part is available online for under $ 10 , but count on it failing soon , too.The entire upper portion of this unit could use a complete redesign . The lower portion seems fine .	-1
Like some other users I clearly did n't put this together quite right as it is not recovering the water and so the carpet is left quite damp . I still use it anyway and have been using it for about a year . The moving parts are coping quite well even with pet hair.Instead of the special carpet cleaning fluid I followed an online tip and now use it with Windex . Surprisingly this works the best for lifting marks and stains.Edited to add : being overly damp probably contributed to my carpet 's seams giving ( splitting ) . So I am reducing the review to 2/5 stars .	-1
This thing fell apart completely in less than 6 months . I moved out of apt and ended up using the upholstery part to finish the job of a 700 sqft section of carpet because not only did the button stop working for the upright suction , but the sprayer , and the foot pedal that either releases it from upright or locks it into place . There are more durable/sturdy models out there so go for that model . Yes I contact Amazon when I noted this and there was nothing they could do so I am out the money and have a broken cleaner .	-1
I have only one room with carpet that is light beige . I need to clean it 3-4 times a year . I have used this two tomes . Then the third time it totally stopped working . My brother is an engineer and was unable to find the problem . What an absolute waste of money.I do not recommend this product .	-1
This is a great machine , cleans really well , but it was my second and I wo n't be buying another . My first one lasted 10 years so I 'm not really complaining about that one - but when it broke - the trigger to release liquid stopped working . The most recent one - exact same problem , but this one did n't even last two years . Which tells me a lot about the quality and in which direction it 's going . I 'll look into another brand . Shame .	-1
the brush drops off with my first use.Plastics are cheaply made . No steams actually.Many dusts in the package box indicates it 's not a brand new one .	-1
The product is cheap cheap cheap . It 's also bulky . I used it once after my purchase sometime in May/June of 2012 . I used it again in November , or tried to use it , and it wo n't suck up the water . It completely soaked my carpet . I watched all the troubleshooting YouTube videos , and did a lot of research on line , but I ca n't fix it . Unfortunately the warranty expired a month from date of purchase.I 'm going back to my reliable spot bot , but it 's not a great tool for a large space .	-1
About 8 month of very light use ( about once every 3 month on clean carpet ) , the hand power tool stopped turning and machine itself would leak pretty bad ( only when I 'm using hand power tool ) , sent it in for repair , after I got it back and used it for the first time , I heard a loud pop and I can smell bad smoke , so I think the motor just died & # 8230 ; .it & # 8217 ; s really a pity why the quality of this product is so bad , otherwise it & # 8217 ; s really a good machine .	-1
This is not a STEAM Vacuum . It uses warm to hot Tap water and has no heating element to boil the water to get steam . If you are looking for a Sanitizing STEAM cleaner do not buy this product . If you are looking for a decent Carpet shampooer , then this is a good buy . The name is very misleading .	-1
I used it once and was very happy with the results . Next time I used it was a long time after the first , long enough that I do n't even remember when I purchased it , but I have to assume it 's outside of warranty . The second time , the brushes hardly spun , and it picked up no water . The directions do n't seem to have much troubleshooting advice at all . I 'm pretty upset about the whole purchase . I would have been better off just renting Rug Doctors like I did before .	-1
I purchased this from Amazon Warehouse , it was said to be & # 34 ; like new & # 34 ; . While assembling it we discovered that the hose coupling was absent so the upholstery tool could not be used . Customer service said that the carpet cleaner would be significantly discounted if I decided to keep it . I decided that it might be worth keeping since it would give me a carpet cleaner at an excellent price . However , I soon discovered that the solution would not spray at all , rendering it completely useless . I had a similar machine several years ago which lasted for about 10 years and did a wonderful job , and I was really looking forward to having another . However , clearly this was n't going to happen . I will say that customer service responded quickly and offered to refund my payment and pay shipping costs if I choose to return it which I will now do . Oh well , I have ordered many other things from Amazon Warehouse and never before had a problem and , I must admit that their customer service responded quickly and offered me very acceptable solutions . I really ca n't complain about that	-1
1 star for the simple reason that this product does NOT use steam . The front of the manual even states that ituses & # 34 ; hot tap water & # 34 ; . Hot tap water is NOT steam ! I do n't know how Hoover gets away with this blatant FALSE ADVERTISING.Because of this huge lie I can not comment any further on this item .	-1
I bought this model after having purchased and used the newer model at my other home . I figured I would try the Hoover that was about $ 70 less . Not a good decision for the following reasons . To start , this model is not as well made as the newer version , the latch for the dirty water tank snapped on the first use . It does not have a separate tank for the detergent/soap so there is no way to rinse the carpet to ensure that all of the soap is removed . This is extremely important since it is the soap residue that attracts more dirt to deposit in your carpet so having a rinse only stroke to make sure your carpet is really soap-free is critical and worth the extra $ $ $ right there . Putting together the stair attachment is a complete pain in the neck as you have to attach it to the dirty water tank and it involves more steps than with the newer version and finally the tanks are n't clear so it is more difficult to see how close you are to full/empty.I am sure that all of the great reviews were deserved when this was a new product and before the recent upgrades ... ..do not be fooled this is now past its use date and I am returning this for another Max Extract All Terrain Carpet Cleaner . For $ 40 more than this one you could get the Max Extract Dual V Carpet Cleaner and do just as well .	-1
The vac stopped working after two months ( one use ) . The vac no longer sucks water after dispensing it . I 'll be contacting Hoover to see what they can do .	-1
It was just about 6 months old with a low to moderate amount of use when it began to leak water all over the floor . It buckled up our newly refinished wood floors while sitting there before we realized what happened . Then plastic parts began to break off of it . I brought it to a friend of ours who is a repairman for vacuums and shampooers . He looked at what was broken and said it was n't worth repairing . It did do a good job of cleaning the carpet . BUT it is ridiculously difficult to set it up for the hand/spot attachment . I think they took it to the dump or I would attempt to return it . Amazon is good about that . Leaking is a serious problem for a machine and all the plastic breaking on critical parts is cheap , un-fixable materials .	-1
This carpet cleaner is a piece of junk . When buying this I was short of time to get a couple rooms cleaned up and wasnt prepared to splurge on a Royal Carpet cleaner like I had intended . Since I live in a very rural area far from any town I quickly overnighted this as renting a carpet cleaner or getting a professional out here is not an option . I was replacing a Bissel Proheat 2x that had just given up after 1 year , but at least when it was working , it worked really well . With the Hoover Steamvac , is seems as though the brushes dont get down into the carpet well enough or rinse the cleaner out well . The width of the cleaner is very narrow so there is a lot more time involved with cleaning one fairly sized room . The whole machine just seem very rickity , like you must be VERY carefull with it . I know part replacements are expensive , but after half a dozen uses I shouldnt already be needing to replace the brush block . The brushes had already worn flat and the part to replace is $ 30 and thats not including shipping . Do n't waste your money !	-1
I purchased this product and assembled according to the instructions.The liquid does not come out of the bottom like it should.The heater does work to dry the floor , all I was left with was a heated carpet.The brush broke on the first day of use.It 's currently been in the vacuum repair shop for a WEEKS because returning the item would be a hassle with such a large item but instead , having to wait weeks to have them repair the item.I should have just returned it ...	-1
After the tremendous disappointment with theBISSELL ProHeat Upright Deep Cleaner , 25A3I opted to switch to a different brand to try something different . While there 's a lot that I like about the Hoover F5914-900 there 's a lot NOT to like . For starters it does n't do as good a job on deep cleaning carpets as theBISSELL ProHeat Upright Deep Cleaner , 25A3and I frequently have to switch to the hand tool to clean bad spots . That said the Hoover does n't pull up so many carpet fibers and track them around . Speaking of the wand attachment/hand I 've never used a machine that had such a complicated , time-consuming means of attaching it for use . It requires leaning the handle and Clean Water Tank back to access the Dirty Water Tank . In the process water leaks out of the Clean Water Tank requiring a whole new clean up . Attaching the hose requires opening the Dirty Water Tank ( disgusting ) , sliding out a panel ( which is n't easy , nor is getting it back in ! ) , and then attaching the end of the hose to the tank and a separate water line . Pretty simple eh ? Score one for Bissell where you simply turned a dial and powered it on . Disconnecting the hose is similarly complicated and still more water leaks out ( Yay ! ) . Suffice to say if you need this for quick cleanups you 're better served by a smaller devise or simply leave the cleaning wand attached at all times . That said , the rotating cleaning wand worked VERY well ... the tradeoff is the general mess left behind . The floor/carpet cleaning is decidedly so-so and my hunch is after using this for a while you 'll still want to spring for one of the truly heavy duty cleaning machines or have a service come in and do it.All in all , the Hoover F5914-900 is something of a disappointment as it does nothing particularly well . If you need a knockabout general use machine I 'm sure this is fine . If you have pets or entertain frequently and need to clean up various spills this is NOT the machine for you . Maybe I 'm a bit extreme and simply need a machine that is specific for spot cleaning and treatment and another for general carpet clearning and that 's probably where I 'm headed . But to my mind the Hoover F5914-900 is the Jack of all trades and the master of none .	-1
I bought a total of 4 'clean water ' tanks in hope of making the leak stop . It would stop for the first hour , then start leaking water out the bottom left rear of that tank . Genuine Hoover replacement parts . Genuine disappointment .	-1
when it worked it was fine ; but sure as the warranty was to expire it died..motor popped and nuttin would work . we tried to get it covered under warranty ... good luck if you are not close to a warranty center . we will have to drive over a 100 miles to one in the bay area , at over 3 bucks a gallon , plus bridge fee ... wow ! ! ! i would never buy this product had we known , you are then benefiting from our experience . buyer beware is what i think .	-1
The fan worked great for a month . I unplugged it to move to a different location , it never worked again . It just would n't turn on at all after that .	-1
I would rate almost any fan that is relatively quiet , moves air , and can be disassembled for maintenance , higher that 2 stars . Even though this fan seems to meet those minimal requirements , it deserves no more than I 've rated , and probably less , because of other major design flaws.Energy use* -- Low speed = 37 watts . Low with grill rotation 'On ' = 38 wattsMedium speed = 40 watts . Medium with grill rotation 'On ' = 41 watts.High speed = 42 watts . High with grill rotation 'On ' = 44 watts* Rounded to nearest watt , measured by a `` Kill-A-Watt EZ '' meter.Energy Use Note : IMO , the watt consumption on the 'Low ' fan speed setting is excessive . On 'Low ' I would expect the fan to consume about 25 to 30 watts . The 'High ' setting is a low consumption ( again IMO ) . Other small fans I have had ( 6-inch to 10-inch ) consumed about 50 watts or more on 'High'.Pros -- This fan moves air and does that well . It is reasonably quiet.It has a removable grill on the back ( attached with Phillips screws ) so I assume I will be able remove it to clean the blade . This should also allow access to the motor so I can oil the bushings ( have n't done this yet ) . This is the typical reason my fans stop working : the bushings lose lubrication over time and eventually seize.If it turns out that I can not easily remove the blade for cleaning and disassemble to oil the bushings , my rating will be revised to 1 star.The grill on the front rotates , only when engaged , to change air-flow direction to some degree ... similar to standard fans that use a gear to rotate the entire fan head although this fan does not have as much air-flow directional change . This feature works , but it does rattle slightly when in use.Regardless of my minor criticisms , I like this feature . It takes up less room than a standard fan when operating ( the fan-head does not rotate , only the front grill ) and I can turn off this feature if not wanted ( or if it fails ) . Also , the limited directional change of air-flow is adequate for my use.Cons -- The problem is the design . Awful . I bought this fan to mount on the wall . Nope . Does n't work for me.I did not go through the mental exercise of visualizing how mounting this fan would work in practice . I assumed the designers had thought about this , since that is a major selling feature . Apparently , they did n't think much.IMO , the design is terrible for wall mounting . After several dry runs , I ca n't figure out how the design can possibly work well for anyone . Serious modification would be needed for my application and I draw the line at defeating built-in safety features.Here is why I find the design to be terrible : Note that the fan-head will pivot , but the pivot angle is set at 45 degrees to the fan 's base , instead of 90 degrees or parallel to it . Also note that the controls are on the right hand side of the fan housing . Although this might be attractive , this design interferes with the usefulness of this fan , table-top or when mounted . To the point that the fan is useless to me for mounting.Sitting on a table top , the 45 degree pivot will direct air-flow as much up ( but NOT down ) as it will side-to-side . This can work on a table top where you can physically move the fan to get the direction wanted . But , there is a physical 'stop ' in the housing which prevents the fan from pointing down , at all . Not good.As designed , the fan is to be mounted on the wall with the fan rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees ( viewed from the front in table-top position ) . Mounting is limited to this one orientation . If that does n't work for your wall , too bad . If that points the fan in the wrong direction , the fan portion can be rotated 180 degrees within the housing , but it then looks like it is pointing backwards , which it would be . Not pleasing.It first appeared that the mounting plates could be reversed to resolve this . Although they can be reversed , the fan will not function when mounted this way ( 'upside-down ' from the mfg 's intended mount ) . There is a safety feature on the fan , an automatic shut-off ( presumably to turn the fan off if it falls over ) . Thus , the fan will not run 'upside-down ' . So I am stuck with the one orientation , set by the design , and would need to turn the fan-head backwards to direct air where I need it . A poor option.It gets worse . When wall mounted , the design forces the position of the controls to be *above* the fan blade housing . With the bottom of the fan housing mounted at 6 1/2 feet above the floor ( my preferred location ) , the controls would be difficult even for me to see or access ( the controls would then be at about 7 1/2 feet above the floor ) . Anyone shorter than I would need a ladder to reach them . This 'on-top ' control location can NOT be changed ( again , due to the safety shut-off feature ) .Finally , when mounted the pivot remains at 45 degrees so directional adjustment of air-flow becomes a compromise between horizontal and vertical ( 45 degree movement ) . Although this does allow a downward component , it still does not work well in my proposed application ( a galley kitchen ) .Mounting would not be easy either . There is no access through the plastic feet to attach the mounting plates to the wall . Attaching it firmly to the wall , to limit vibration/noise , would also be problematic because the mounting plate system looks pretty flimsy.The mounting method to be used for this fan is to first install 2 screws in the wall ( into studs or with drywall anchors ) at the exact location of the mounting slots , then slip the fan and feet with mounting plates ( which are embedded in the feet of the fan ) over the screw heads . If you 've done this before , you know it requires accurate placement of the screws and then adjustments of the screws ' depth to create a tight fit . Not terribly difficult , but not very forgiving of errors either . A hole in the drywall in the wrong place and you 've created a repair job . Access holes through the fan 's plastic feet to the anchor plates would make the job easy . But , there are none.The First Abandoned Plan to Make it Work -- Just in case you are thinking about this : Plan : To reverse the mounting plates , mount it at a 45 degree angle for decent air-flow directional control , and turn the fan 'upside-down ' so the controls are below the fan housing ( and can be seen and reached ) . This would also point the fan in the correct direction . Ca n't do this . Safety shut off . Fan does n't run.The Second Abandoned Plan to Make it Work -- Plan : Place the fan on a high shelf at the end of the my work area ( table top mode ) and direct airflow downward . Ca n't do this . The fan will not allow downward air flow adjustment ( remember the physical 'stop ' ) .So Why ? -- This leaves me with five questions about design problems : 1 ) Why is n't the pivot set at 90 degrees to the base or parallel to the base ? 2 ) Why are n't the controls on the base of the unit instead of on the side ( which puts them 'on-top ' when mounted ) ? 3 ) Why is n't there access through the plastic feet for mounting the unit to the wall ? 4 ) Why prohibit reversing the mounting orientation with the automatic shut-off ? and 5 ) Why design it so it will not point down ( at all ) in table-top mode ? If those problems were corrected , the fan could still be attractive , and it would become easily mountable , useful , and actually function as advertised ( which , in my opinion , it does NOT ) .End Result -- I bought it and I will use it . But NOT mounted on the wall I bought it for . I will use it as a table-top fan , period.I would not buy another nor recommend this fan to anyone except as a table-top fan and even then with reservations . With one exception : If you have the correct wall to accept the fan 's required orientation , a low mounting height so you can reach the controls , adequate carpentry skills , and a space that works with the 45 degree air-flow pivot ; this fan would be fine.I gave it 2 stars because it is a fan and it does run . I was generous .	-1
As others have stated , this item does heat a room . The downside is it is a killer on the eyes as it is way too bright . I am trying to find out if this horribly bright light is harmful to the eyes . It is so bright that it literally hurts my eyes , my child 's eyes , and my husband 's eyes .	-1
I may have received a lemon but the heater stays on for a unreliable amount of time and it seems the safety thermostat kicks in and it shuts off . The inside of our house is around 55 degrees and we wished to use this for localized heating which when it is on works great.One shortcoming when it is on is it is so bright compared to other radiant heaters that if your trying to read or work in the vicinity it can be blinding and should be considered for what you are going to use it.I 'm afraid we are going to return this to Amazon.What does work great and reliably is the Presto Parabolic Heater which we will be buying another of soon.Presto HeatDish Parabolic Heater Plus Footlight	-1
Good espresso but horrible for milk frothing . Recieved as an early Christmas gift today . You can not turn off the espresso maker portion so that if you want to froth milk the espresso portion continues to run . So to keep from having watered down espresso I needed a second cup to swap out after the espresso is done . Then the other cup catches the drippings while I froth the milk . But it runs out of water before the milk is hot . Just warm when frothing milk for a single cup . Then refill the water , catch two cups of wasted water from the espresso maker portion and you can froth a second luke warm cup of milk for your significant other ( or for a large to-go cup for the AM drive to work ) .Mine is going back to Kohls in the morning and I 'm going to try the lower end Mr. Coffee machine that appears to have good reviews .	-1
No way to control the steam , coffee away 's pours out and you are left with no steam to heat upthe milk	-1
This machine , it 's completely impossible to Froth the milk , not enough steam . If you want to froth the milk I suggest you get a Mr. Coffee , I have one , and it froths like a charm . and it 's Cheaper . And LEGIT .	-1
not a good espresso maker i thought it would be good but its not a normal coffee pot would have been alot better	-1
This espresso maker was great while it lasted . Made good coffee and quickly , a plus on those sleepy mornings . But it only lasted 13 months . One morning it was just dead .	-1
I tried really hard to get these to work . Stuck them all over the different walls in my shower so I can hang my soap latherer up . No dice ! They do not work . I gave them at least 2 weeks of continuously putting them up , only to find them back on the tub floor hours later or minutes later.Do not buy	-1
we recently purchased this microwave oven ... it 's really big but i ca n't hold that against it . one selling point , for us , was that it has a stainless steel interior - no more bubbly paint peeling off ... we were initially happy with the metal turntable too - no glass to break . however , the table has a *very shallow* groove to rest on the turning arm in the bottom of the microwave . it very easily will become uncentered but it 's not very obvious and even when it 's not centered , it will still turn.in fact , it will turn just fine and CHEW UP THE SIDES OF THE MICROWAVE ! apparently , we inadvertently used it once , slightly off center ( and not for very long - i mean , that 's what a microwave 's for , right - short cooking times ) and now , there 's a nice little chewed-up divet in the back wall . i 'm very surprised the microwave has n't started sparking off that rough spot yet , like will usually happen when you put metal in a microwave.if i had it to purchase over again , i think i 'd pass . if it was n't so costly to send it back , i would consider it . if you decide to purchase , be prepared to constantly mother and fuss over its easy-to-dislodge , very-poorly-designed turntable .	-1
Just like clockwork , my second Sharp R930CS has failed within five years . My unit is built into the kitchen cabinet system and uses the costly trim mounting kit , so it 's impractical expense to switch manufacture which I 've considered doing . Others do not fit the opening . My first Sharp counter top convection microwave lasted over twelve years when I gave it to a friend who still uses it ; so it seems Sharp 's products quality and reliability has decreased in the last ten years or so . The recent failure involved significant , continuous microvwave flashing on the right inside the cavity walls . Looked like the unit was shorting out , but not in the cooking area . We use the microwave and convection nearly every day for one meal or another , and were satisfied when it worked . The convection function still works , it 's just the microwabe section that 's failed . And , that catastrophic failure is disappointing , hence the two star rating Unfotunately , I will have to order a new Sharp unit with the expectation it probably wo n't last beyond five years .	-1
The sharp edges on the basket , handle and drum on this device makes this the least ergonomic piece of kitchen equipment I have . It requires a ridiculous amount of force to grate a hard cheese , leading to hand fatigue , and inevitably , injury ( I almost always end up grating my hand ) . This is going straight into the trash !	-1
My previous grater was a plastic Zyliss . It lasted for many years and worked well , but I bought the Cuisipro grater thinking that an all metal unit would outlast and outperform the plastic Zyliss . Wrong ! The Cuisipro leaves chunks of ungrated cheese , the handles are loose and flop about , and the drum bent quickly under normal use . The Cuispro grater is poor quality and poor design . I went back and replaced it with the vastly cheaper but better Zyliss . Lesson learned .	-1
Hands down the worst hand greater on the market.1 . Difficult to crank even when not grinding anything.2 . Poor design takes the skin off your knuckles.3 . Jams up easily.TRY THE OXO BRAND GADGET ! OXO Good Grips Seal and Store Rotary Grater	-1
After a couple of weeks of use , the Cuisipro Spray Mister failed to hold pressure and the pressure leak could be heard . Avoid this product.My advice is this : go and get a regular plastic 8 oz plastic spray bottle and fill it with oil . It 'll work just as well . Sould you desire a PAM substitute , simply mix 4 tsp lecithin with 1C of either grain alcohol or oil .	-1
Not worth the money . Used it a few months and noticed I kept having circles of liquid smoke inside my cupboard plus the smell of the liquid smoke . I did not overfill the sprayer . Put it in a plastic bag in the cupbaord but I still had the smell and the plastic bag was wet inside . I figured out it was leaking out the bottom ; turned the sprayer sideways and it poured out easily from the bottom seam . Will try the other brand and hopefully it works better because this does come in handy .	-1
This little machine worked great the first time I used it - seemed perfect ! Not a lot of money ; and you get real Moka , like stovetop but without the constant scrutiny . And then I realized , though I had seen the words `` stainless steel '' it was n't referring to the boiler . The boiler is aluminum.Because of the negative things I discovered about cooking with aluminum , years ago , I had to get rid of all of my grandmother 's pots and pans and bakeware . That was n't easy ; but the concerns about aluminum for humans and otherwise was enough to encourage me never to cook with anything made of it . When you wash an aluminum pan , if you do n't dry it - you can see the deposits that develop . Who needs that in our food and body ? So sadly , after running to get this item when I saw it demonstrated on youtube , and foolishly not reading all of the details ( which is listed here above ) I will now return it.What a shame . It works well and is so simple . I wonder if anyone makes such a similar little machine with stainless steel ? ( I know aluminum is a good conductor of heat -- but surely there are other ways ... ... ? ) Dear DeLonghi - I use many of your products ; how about creating one of these with a stainless steel boiler ? Thanks .	-1
I just could n't get it clean & fresh . I take good care of my coffee makers , because I drink about 20 cups of espresso in the course of a day . ( Once you 're inured , you can sleep even if you drink a cup as a nightcap . ) Coffee is a health drink , people . This machine made lousy coffee after using it a few times .	-1
This is a good way to make `` moka '' coffee IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A STOVE . If you have a stove , stick to the stove top method of brewing coffee in a traditional `` moka '' pot . If you get one of these as a gift and you have been using the stove top version for 20 years then you will instinctively put this one on the stove and melt it and possible destroy your kitchen or even burn down the house . If you are using it at your office or some other place that does not have a stove close by , then its great . Another thing , why on earth would they make the top part plastic ? Almost almost all of the complaints in the reviews are about the cheap plastic top and the fact that it is not easy to tighten without putting damaging stress on the handle . I have had a few of the metal ones and I love them . They make larger pots of stronger coffee for years and years . I occasionally change the rubber ring and have to tighten the handle with a screwdriver but the trade off is worth it.Bottom line : Keep it away from places where a person might confuse this pot with a traditional stove top pot and you may enjoy coffee from this product . Also , let it be known that you can put a metal carafe from another pot of a similar size on the heater and it works fine , better even.I do n't care if I can see the coffee coming up in the plastic carafe ! Plastic sucks ! I wish Delonghi products were a little less designy and a little more functional .	-1
Money in the trash , could n't be made of cheaper materials ; thin pressed wood wrapped in vinyl , if you breath on these things they break , practically speaking they are too light and flimsy to support anything bigger than mini 's , I recently threw them out , useless ! DO NOT BUY !	-1
Pros : They do hold the speakers off the floor and the materials feel robust to some degree.Cons : Well , despite the reviews noting how easy it is to split the particle board pieces , I took a chance , given that these are so inexpensive . I was very cautious when putting them together , but I still split the wood in 4 places . I think the holes are not machined precisely enough -- and the vertical pieces are just too thin for the size screws provided . However , the splits are not obvious from a distance ( well , one was , but I took the screw out and did n't bother with it ) .The included rubber standoffs are a joke , you 'll want to bring your own.No protection is provided for hardwood floors.As other reviews have noted , the wire management is a total joke given that the wires are visible from the front because of the gap between the two pieces.Having said that , they probably look pricier than what I paid , and they do hold the speakers up off the floor . It was quicker to assemble than building and painting stands from scrap lumber would have been , but definitely not as sturdy or as nice as 2 hours of time in the garage with some 1x3s would have yielded.As long as you know you 're buying a piece of junk , it 's an ok buy .	-1
this does n't fit correctly on the grater [ and yes I carefully bought the attachment for the correct grater series ] it ends up grating plastic into your food ! My friend has one I love , but this model just did not work for me !	-1
Not sure what was up with this , my sister has one and loves it.No matter what I did , the display was SUPER faint and hard for me to see .	-1
Buy three of them . That way , you will have one to use , one will be in the mail to the manufacturer for warranty replacement , and one will be in the mail coming back from Taylor.No , kidding , this is really that bad . They offer a warranty , but you will soon grow tired of sending them back.Mine eat batteries , wo n't recognize hot meat , wo n't calibrate , are just plain inaccurate or give variable readings , or just go dead . I have given up on them.Even if you are lucky and get a good one , it is unlikely that it will stay good for very long . None of mine have.Too bad . They are nice when they work .	-1
We purchased this after a number of disasters resulted from our serving under or overdone burgers , steaks , sausages , and pork . We needed a reliable method for determining the internal temperature of grilled meat . Leave in type thermometers only really work well on roasts and other large pieces of meat . We thought this `` instant read '' thermometer would do the trick.We were extremely disappointed with the thermometer . During the first use , after we lifted the lid of the grill to check our burger 's temp , ( we like to shoot for 145 and let carryover do the rest ) it read 141 F. after 15 seconds . That is an eternity to keep the lid off the grill just to take a burger 's temp . Flare ups happen fast on a hot grill . When we extracted the probe , we sadly watched our burger 's juices flow out of the hole like water from a faucet . A minute of additional cooking later , a check of the same hole read 152 F after 10 seconds . We chewed on our overdone burgers and contemplated the causes for such a large variance in temp after only a few seconds.Not to be discouraged , we read the calibration instructions and checked freezing and boiling points . Both were within a few degrees accuracy . We elicited suggestions from fellow grill-o-philes . None could compensate for the thermometer 's deficiencies . It takes too long to get a reading , it leaves too big of a hole , and it does n't give consistent readings.Finally , a foodie friend suggested a thermo-resistor type thermometer . We looked and were put off by the price initially , but then wondered if the costs in losses from all of the `` grilled food gone bad '' could have been saved with an accurate , really fast , and consistent thermometer.We bought it and have been happy ever since . It gives an accurate and consistent measurement within 3 seconds . It leaves a much smaller hole . It has enabled us to cook to order much more precisely than we would have hoped possible . In fact , we 've divided the doneness spectrum to include gradations from `` Rare '' to `` Medium '' with points of `` Cool Medium Rare , '' `` Medium Rare , '' and `` Hot Medium Rare '' along the way . Guests are amused at the greater degree of precision we can offer . And yes we can stop at finer points between `` Medium Well '' and `` Well '' as well -- but why ? At $ 80 ( when we purchased it ) , it is something of a bragging gadget , but we would not attempt to grill without it . We enjoy hearing family and friends chatter , `` They have this Thermapen ... '' The Original Super-Fast Thermapen Instant Read Thermometer ( Red ) by ThermoworksOh , and the Taylor thermometer ? Its case cracked one day and so it went out with the trash . We can not think of a reason to replace it . Anything it could do the Thermapen can do better .	-1
I use these stem thermometers extensively cooking sap for maple syrup . Accuracy is critical and they get some use . The stem on this is a bit short for my purposes but I was prepared to like the unit , especially if it was waterproof . After one week of use , the display crashed showing three letter L 's - LLL - instead of the temperature ! I threw it away and relied on my other candy thermometers . Hugely disappointed with the failure of this instrument .	-1
I bought this thermometer to replace a 12 year old Taylor thermometer which has given excellent service . I am not pleased with the new soft rubber control buttons . I can not turn it on with my finger , nor my fingernail . I have to use a ball point pen or other pointed object to get enough pressure on the button to make it work . My Old Taylor had a simple slide switch which worked every time . This may be a minor issue for most people , but for my application , bread proofing , it is a pain to use at a time I have more important things to do .	-1
lasted exactly 1 minute in the meat on the grill and stopped working . Not suitable for cooking at all . Grill was only 250 degrees or so ... .Thermometer is supposed to be good for up to 450 . Extremely disappointed and now am left cooking a brisket without a thermometer .	-1
